00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Good morning.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.260
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.670
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: My name is
Doug Caldwell, and I am Chair

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.610
of the United States Board
on Geographic Names, or BGN.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.510
And on behalf of our
members and staff --

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.110
[ Applause ]

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.280
-- it is really a great pleasure
to welcome you here today

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
as we celebrate our
125th Anniversary.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.250
Our geographic names are
more than mere words.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.130
They are, as Terrence Cole
once said, compact poetry.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.660
Geographic names are endlessly
fascinating in the stories

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.200
that they tell and the
stories of their origins.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.230 position:56%
They reflect our cultural diversity,
our languages, our history,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.940
our environment, our
values, and our politics.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.090
Fortunately, geographic
names can also be confusing.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.270
There may be many names
for a single place.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.550
A single name may be
spelled many different ways.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.300
And many different places
may have the same name.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.100
And it is this confusion
that is at the root

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.070
of the Board on Geographic Names.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.700
In early 1890 Thomas Mendenhall
from the Coast and Geodetic Survey

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.430
and one of the founding
members complained

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.410
about the confusion
caused by the lack

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.090
of standardization of
names and spelling.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.940
He wrote to all of the federal
departments and he said,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.790
"You know, we have a problem.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.450
On our maps of your agencies
you are using different names

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.050
for the same feature."

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.570
And he said, "Even worse, I can see

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.950
on a single map a single
agency uses different names

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.750
for the same feature."

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.260
Now I found this very
hard to believe,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.380
but it actually wasn't too
difficult to find an example.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.060
So this is an 1883 Army
reconnaissance map of Alaska.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.650
And it has the name Chilkat Inlet
in the title, spelled with a K,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.070
and Chilcat Inlet on the
map spelled with a C.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.550
So this is not exactly
what we wanted to see.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.740
So what happened was he

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.830
with Lieutenant Richardson
Clover got together

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.980
and called agencies
together to discuss

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.070
and resolve conflicts
in geographic names.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.650
So this was a tremendous example
of interagency cooperation,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.490
starting in 1890, for the
benefit of the federal government.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.830
So on September 4th, 1890 -- it
was a day actually much like today;

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.670
it was a nice fall day,
temperatures in the low 80s --

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.850
President Benjamin Harrison
established the Board

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.810
on Geographic Names.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.110
&gt;&gt; Hey, Doug.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.410
Excuse me, you want to
put it on slideshow?

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.710
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Oh, sorry.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.010
&gt;&gt; Hard to see in the back.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.310
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Nope, nope.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.610
Thank you.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.150
There we go.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.570
Okay, the BGN's mission was to
resolve geographic name conflicts

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.820
and promote the uniform
use of geographic names

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.910
for the federal government.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.770
Theodore Roosevelt
expanded the Board's mission

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.450
to include all issues related
to geographic names in 1906.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.390
And this was also done
by executive order.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.370
Congress re-established the
Board in its current form

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.330
in 1947 under public law.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.560
So today the Board works conjointly
with the Secretary of the Interior

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.940
who has ultimate authority over
the Board's decisions and policies.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.690
Throughout the years the challenge

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.200
of geographic names has
remained a constant.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.060
As much as in 1890, they
are still ambiguous,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.570
contested, complex, and changing.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.250
Yes, constantly changing.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.550
It's hard to believe.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.400
For many it seems like
a glacial pace,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.350
but there's a lot of
activity going on.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.160 position:56%
In the BGN's first year of operation
it processed around 2000 names,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.510
which was pretty remarkable for
the time, and a lot of work.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.000
In fiscal year 2014, the
last complete fiscal year,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.190
the BGN added over 700,000 new
names and made close to a million

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.190
and a half edits in
the existing names.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.960
This was not an atypical year.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.440
So it is a great pleasure to
have you here today to reflect

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.410
on our geographic names, to
celebrate 125 years of history

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.240
of the BGN, and to
consider our future.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.540
Please, for you.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.340
Thank you.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.810
[ Applause ]

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.520
Before we begin I'd like to
thank the Library of Congress

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.660 position:56%
for hosting this event, particularly
the Chief of the Geography

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.510
and Map Division, Mr.
Ralph Ehrenberg --

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.980
[ Applause ]

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.510
-- and Ms. Jackie Nolan
for making this possible.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.210
[ Applause ]

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.800
I would also like to thank the
Philip Lee Phillips Society

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.700 position:56%
for their very generous sponsorship.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.550
This special group
develops, enhances,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.270
and promotes the collection of
the Geography and Map Division.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.030
Now I have a few routine
announcements.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.370
The corridors in the
building are color-coded.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.640
The restrooms are located
just off the lobby in kind

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.620
of the back right-hand
corner as you exit the room.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.500
We're going to have really
some very special events today.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.610
We have -- we're starting off
with the symposium this morning.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:15.840
We have a collection of true
national and international experts

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.030
on geographic names who
are going to share some

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.890
of their knowledge with us.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.150
And we have an amazing
open house this afternoon

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.570
in the Geography and Map Division.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.780
That's going to be
down in the basement.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:32.060 position:56%
You'll see some items here that
will only be on public display today

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.470
in celebration of the
Board's anniversary.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.230
We'll talk a little bit more about
lunch as we get closer to lunch.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.250
Hopefully no one's ready yet.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.540
And the Geography and Map
Division staff is in the lobby,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.170
and they can answer
any of your questions.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.490
So without further ado we'd
like to welcome Mr. Mark Sweeney

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.740
who is the Associate
Librarian for Library Services

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.390
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.750
The Library of Congress is not
only the world's largest library,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.020
but it's America's oldest
federal cultural institution.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.860
And it's also the research
arm of Congress.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.510
Mark?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:23.130
[ Applause ]

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.020
&gt;&gt; Well, good morning, and
thanks for that warm welcome.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.130
Again, I'm Mark Sweeney,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.910
the Associate Librarian
for Library Services.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.880
That's the traditional part of the
Library, the part that acquires,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.910
describes, serves, and preserves
the Library's vast collections.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.830
And on behalf of the Librarian of
Congress, Dr. James Billington,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.910
it's my pleasure to extend a
warm person welcome to each

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.720
of you this morning as we gather
to celebrate the 125th anniversary

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.910
of the United States
Board of Geographic Names.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.790
Well, as was mentioned, the Library

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.050
of Congress is the nation's oldest
federal cultural institution.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:05.480
It's also the world's largest
single repository of knowledge

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.320
and information, with a collection
of more than 160 million items.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.080
About 30 million books, but
most of the collection is made

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.570
up of special materials, more than
5.5 million of which are maps.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.220
And names, of course, are a key
entry point into the collection.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.240
So one of our major objectives is

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.590
to make this vast collection
more readily available

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.890
to members of Congress.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.700
That's mission one for us, but
also to the scholarly community

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.210
and the general public
through cataloging

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.560
and a variety of online resources.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.180
Standardization of names, places
is critical to these efforts.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.340
And that's really across all of
the different formats and types

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.850
of materials that we have in
our multifaceted collection.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.100
Among our most significant
cartographic holdings,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.170
which I believe you
will see this afternoon,

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.230
is the Charles Pierre L'Enfant's
original 1791 manuscript map

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.150
of the city of Washington
which contains notations penned

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.520
by Thomas Jefferson
to the map's engraver.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.530
Two are related to place names,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.820
demonstrating that
this founding father,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.490 position:56%
the one on whose personal collection
the Library's vast resources

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.810
of today rests, understood the
need for standardization of places

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.790
on federal maps and documents
100 years before the U.S. Board

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.640 position:56%
of Geographic Names was established.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.020
When you look you'll see that
Jefferson substituted Rock Creek

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.920
for Pine Creek, annotated that, and
marked through the W in Potomac.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.560
I'm particularly pleased that this
celebration has brought together

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.590
here at the Library of
Congress a gathering

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.780
of distinguished place
name experts, geographers,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.780
and cartographers from
across the country.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.180
I hope that during your brief stay

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.130
at the Library you will have an
opportunity to meet and interact

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.640
with some of our expert staff as
well as examine the fine items

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.260
from our collection
that the geography

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.190
and map division will place

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.700
on display specially
for you this afternoon.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.800
Because of the long and close
association between the Library

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.360
of Congress and the U.S. Board

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.560
of Geographic Names the Board was
actually housed here at the Library

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.410
for a brief period in the 1920s.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.220
We are happy to have this
opportunity to host today's event.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.340
I believe we also hosted the
100th anniversary event as well.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.220
In closing, as an old Federal
Depository librarian that selected,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.960
organized, and described, and
served government publications,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.830
I want to express the Library's
abiding support for the Board

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.220
and wish you continued success.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.800
Happy 125th anniversary, and have a
wonderful day here at the Library.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.600
Thank you.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:00.500
[ Applause ]

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.520
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Our
next speaker is going

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.870
to be Dr. David Applegate who
is the Acting Deputy Director

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.140
of the U.S. Geological Survey.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.180
He's representing the
Department of the Interior,

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.330
which protects America's
natural resources and heritage,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.310
which honors our cultures
and tribal communities,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.000
and supplies the energy
to power our future.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.390
The Secretary of the Interior, as
we mentioned, Ms. Sally Jewell,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.560
is the senior federal official
concerned with geographic names.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.210
She works conjointly with the
BGN to assure uniform usage

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.150
within the federal government.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.510
David? Thank you.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:53.740
[ Applause ]

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.040
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Well, thank you.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.350
And thank you to the Library of
Congress for hosting us here.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.790
Let me first off say how
pleased I am to be a part

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.270
of this marvelous milestone
and for the opportunity

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.890
to represent the Department of
the Interior and Secretary Jewell.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.650
I had an opportunity to discuss
this event with Secretary Jewell

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.890
on Wednesday, and she sends her
regrets not to be here herself,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.140
along with her congratulations
on the 125th anniversary.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.810
You know, this is a subject that
is much on her mind of late.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.570
This is one of these issues
that may seem invisible

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.370
for a while, and then it's not.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.130
And that is very much the case.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.830
Earlier this month she signed a
Secretarial Order to make the name

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.770
of North America's highest peak
Denali, sing the authority she has

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.070
under the 1947 law that provides
for the standardization of names

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.770
through the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.440
Names matter.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.740
In signing this order, Secretary
Jewell spoke of sacred status,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.150
of reverence of traditions.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.960 position:56%
She also cited official state usage
and the strong support of the people

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.010
of Alaska in her decision.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.080
All of these are the
sorts of factors

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.510
that must be taken
into consideration.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.500
And then, of course, there's one
more, and that reflects the policy

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.610
that had been in place since
the 1960s for the Board

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.510
to help protect it from any
apparent politicization,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:35.130 position:56%
which was to avoid action when there
was pending congressional action.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.800
And -- which was very sensible,
but it might have been used a bit

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.570 position:56%
by the Ohio delegation which made
sure there was pending congressional

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:51.680
action for the better part of 40
years, since 1975 when the state

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.340
of Alaska had originally
petitioned to make this change.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.750 position:56%
So it turns out that that 1947 law
also states that action may be taken

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.740
by the Secretary in any matter
wherein the Board does not act

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.000
within a reasonable time.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.480
And speaking as someone who was
eight when that petition was made,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.490
and as someone who has a fair
number of white hairs in his beard,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:22.180
it seems reasonable to
me as a layperson, so --

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.920
that she took this action.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.680
You know, it may not come as
much surprise that the Secretary

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.200
of the Interior would have the
responsibility for standardization

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.390
of names domestically given
that Interior manages more

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:42.120 position:56%
than 500 million acres of land,
about 1/5 of the nation's land area.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.490
But the Secretary also has
the final responsibility

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:51.340 position:56%
in this conjoined responsibility for
standardizing foreign names as well.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.600
There are nearly four times as
many foreign names in the Board

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.060
on Geographic Names databases
as there are U.S. names.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.210
And this really illustrates the
breadth and the global nature

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:07.180
of this responsibility that the
Secretary and the BGN share.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.480
The Board itself, of course,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.640
is organized into two main
committees reflecting that, the --

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.500
reflecting that dual roll,
the Foreign Names Committee,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.570
the Domestic Names Committee
are good friends and colleagues.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.310 position:56%
The National Geospatial Intelligence
Agency supports the Foreign Names

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.520
Committee while the U.S. Geological
Survey as part of the Department

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.050
of the Interior supports the
Domestic Names Committee.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.810
Now as was noted in some
of the opening remarks,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.690
standardization may sound
like a mundane pursuit

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.160
until you consider the alternative.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.870
What if there were no standards
for nuts and bolts, for tire sizes,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.590
for electric current,
or computer data?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.030
The standardized spelling and use
of geographic names that's ensured

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.290 position:56%
by the U.S. Board allows the federal
government to communicate clearly

00:16:55.290 --> 00:17:00.030 position:56%
and unambiguously about places,
reducing the potential for confusion

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.220
and saving taxpayers money
It's good government.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.910
In an age of instant
electronic communication

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.070
and massive collections of
play space data, standards

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.260
and uniform usage of geographic
names are more important

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.560
than ever before.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.040
And that, you know, has
particular resonance standing here

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.840
in the Library of Congress where
we recognize that this digital age

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.090
and everything goes
actually increases the need

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:29.530
for those synthesizers, for that
effort to try to be able to --

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.080
when you search you
will actually find.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.890
The usefulness of standardizing
geographic names is well-proven,

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.980
even if it's often
taken for granted.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.470 position:56%
The United Nations actively supports
international standardization

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.790
of geographic names by
encouraging strong programs

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.640
of national standardization.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.150
Indeed, more than 50
nations have some type

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.800
of national names authority.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.050
So on behalf of Interior Secretary
Jewell I thank the members

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.290
of the Board, past and present,
who have played a vital role

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.320
in 125 years of names for America.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.680
Your continuing efforts

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.330
in standardizing names have helped
advance government efficiency.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.530
And furthermore, I want to
salute the staffs of the --

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.600
both the Foreign Names Committee
and the Domestic Names Committee,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.710
past and present, who have worked
with the greatest diligence

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.280
across the years to
promote the understanding

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.960
and standard use of
geographic names.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.290
And I wish you another
125 years of success

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.030
in serving the American people.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.830
Thank you very much.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:37.500
[ Applause ]

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.000
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Whoop,
start at the beginning.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.150
So now we're going to go and
start with our series of speakers.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.900
So what they'll do is they'll talk
for a while, and we hope at the end

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.880
of each presentation to
have at least five minutes

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.050
for questions and answers.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.620
But there's so much good
material we might not make it,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.100
and you might have
to talk at the break.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.190
Our keynote speaker this
morning is Dr. Mark Monmonier.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.120
He is the Distinguished
Professor of Geography

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.050
at Syracuse University's
Maxwell School

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.670
of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.220
Dr. Monmonier is the author of
many books related to cartography,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:49.440
weather, climate, technology, and
society, including a volume focused

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.570
on geographic names, "From
Squaw Tit to Whorehouse Meadow,

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.090
How Maps Name, Claim, and Inflame."

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.380 position:56%
Most recently he served as the
editor of volume six of "The History

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.180
of Cartography, Cartography
in the 20th Century."

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.040
This is the definitive
history of modern mapping,

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.590
and a monumental achievement.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.320
Dr. Monmonier is internationally
recognized

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.730
on all things cartographic, and
I have to believe after doing

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.880
that you probably know more than
anyone else could possibly know.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.030
He's known for his meticulous
research and his willingness

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.680
to tackle difficult and
controversial topics.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.510
Dr. Monmonier.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:49.100
[ Applause ]

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.650
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier:
Well good morning.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.950
Thank you for inviting me.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:57.450
It was an honor to be asked
to give the keynote address

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.860
at a symposium recognizing the
125th anniversary of the founding

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.490
of the U.S. Board on
Geographic Names.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.850
And particularly, I want
to thank Ralph Ehrenberg

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.220
for making the initial
contact, and Doug Caldwell

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.910
for handling arrangements
related to the program.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.840
And earlier draft of the
program suggested "The Power

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.130
of Geographic Names" as
the title for my talk.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.040
I'm pleased that Doug
was enthusiastic

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.720
when I proposed the title
that you see on the screen.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.450
I don't like the word power,
which has been overworked by those

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:35.020
who see the map as a
mysterious irresistible force,

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.210
which is simply not true.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.100
In my experience the term
leverage is far more appropriate.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.130
If you have the apparatus for
compiling and publishing maps,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.880
the map can enhance or
leverage that power.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.990
That said, cartography
in its use of symbols

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.970
and words is a distinct
kind of rhetoric.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:22:00.200
And in some situations maps can
attract attention, lots of it,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.320
especially when geographic
names are involved.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.710 position:56%
Controversies over geographic names,
which became particularly prominent

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:12.510
in the 20th century, show that
names on maps can be a forceful way

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.600
of asserting ownership or control,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.280
or a way to denigrate a particular
group, perhaps unintentionally.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.900
Either situation invites
resistance, a pushback from people

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.540
or organizations who
believe that other names,

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.460
or names in some other
language or alphabet,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.490
are more appropriate or more just.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.980
More on this later.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:42.370
What are the roles
of geographic names?

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.770
The most obvious role is to provide
a unique identifier for places

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:52.180
and geographic features so that a
map user can assert unambiguously

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.990
where he or she has
been or intends to go.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:01.480
This role of geographic names
underscores a key function of local

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.590
or national naming authorities
like the Board on Geographic Names.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.080 position:56%
Namely, the key function of
avoiding potentially fatal confusion

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.280
between features, including
confusion about where

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.980
to send the rescue helicopter
or order up surveillance

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.080
in advance of an airstrike.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.750
Although GPS has increased the
use of geographic coordinates

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.300
in emergency response and military
contexts, many of us rely more

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.330
on names than on numbers.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:37.320 position:56%
Much of the importance of geographic
names lies in the link they provide

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.320
between map symbols
and everyday language,

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.610
which in turn implies a need for
standards of grammar, spelling,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.530
syntax, and style, hence the
various rules that the Board

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.260
on Geographic Names has crafted

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.200
to avoid confusion and
needless complexity.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.170 position:56%
A chosen hegemonic language,
English rather than Native Hawaiian,

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.970
for example, or Hebrew rather than
Arabic, can be a strong statement

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:10.950
of territorial control, and thus
a potential source of resentment.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.920
And even when language,
per se, is not an issue,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.810
a geopolitical reference
like East Sea or Sea

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.150
of Japan can trigger a resistance.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.560
Another role of geographic names
is to commemorate an individual,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.190
a people, an event, a
place in a distant land,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.360
or anything else with a name.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.060
Personal names can be particularly
problematic insofar as people

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.870
like to leave their own mark,

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.590
as when wealthy real estate
developers plaster their names

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:49.920
on casinos and office towers,
or on mountains, bays, rivers,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.520
and lesser geographic features
if they could get away with it,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.030
which calls for a referee
acting in the public interest,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.280
a referee like the Board on
Geographic Names which collaborates

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.170 position:56%
with a network of state-level boards
to circumvent potential conflict

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.110
between people who think that
their favorite dead uncle is more

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.630
deserving than your
favorite dead President.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:20.710
The rhetoric of geographic
names is a negotiate, reasoned,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.060
and inherently conservative
rhetoric, and a rhetoric

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.540
that is resistant to change

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.400
because too-frequent change can
be disruptive and confusing,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.570
not to mention expensive
if mapmakers want

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.500
to keep their products up to date.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.880
An important point is that
geographic names are a public good,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.790
provided without private gain
to all members of society.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.870
Change might be warranted, but
it needs to be well thought out

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.100
and perhaps responsive
to significant changes

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.170
in public attitudes toward names
that have been publicly acceptable

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.320
in the past but no longer are.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.480
By the 1960s, for instance, the
name Nigger Creek had become

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:09.390
as offensively obsolete as Jim Crow
practices like segregated practices

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:14.140
and race-based seating preferences
at lunch counters and on buses.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.200
At times civility demands that
some geographic names be changed.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.060
There is also a romantic
aspect to geographic names,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.700
as when they commemorate the
Revolutionary War heroes,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.310
Old World cities, or the
Ancient Mediterranean.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.860
And there's also a bit of romance
in bawdy or irreverent names

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.240
like Whorehouse Meadow which
local historians committed

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.460
to authenticity will defend
vigorously should anyone suggest

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.310
replacing them.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.190
Indeed, there is no better
argument for the importance

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.420
of geographic names than
the controversies that arise

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.390
when someone, or some organization,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.370
or some government agency
proposes changing them.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.930
Let's examine some of
these controversies.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.560
Look first at the international
arena where names on maps,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.650
particularly names associated with
boundaries, are fighting words.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.050
Some names, like the territorial
control they represent,

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.970
are so heinous that national
mapmakers refuse to put them

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.720
on the map even when
it's abundantly clear

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.430 position:56%
who controls a particular territory.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.800 position:56%
My first example is a map I acquired

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.780
at an international
cartographic meeting in the 1970s,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.980
in a brochure distributed
by the Survey of Jordan

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.510
which pointedly denied the
existence of the State of Israel.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.150
My apologies for the
sloppy colors here.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:48.050
I cannot locate the original
brochure, and when I had scanned

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.390
and photoshopped this map

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:54.520 position:56%
for publication decades ago I
needed only a black-and-white image.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.920
This is the best likeness
I could find.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.170
And despite the uneven hues,
it was too good to leave out.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.720
In this vein, Jordanian
cartographers erased Old Testament

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.740 position:56%
names from the map of the Holy Land.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.130
And the Palestinian Liberation
Organization counterparts

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.480
who produced a Palestinian
map series on the cheap

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.140
by photocopying Israel's
one-to-100,000 scale topographic

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.900
maps, replaced Hebrew
names with Arabic names,

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.710 position:56%
and substituted the PLO logo for the
Survey of Israel copyright notice.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.860
By contrast, on Israeli
maps Arab towns and villages

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.690
in Israel carry their Arabic names,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.600
which appear on official
Israeli maps.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.680
However, because naming places
can be an important part

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.130
of nation building,

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.810
Israeli cartographers have
assertively added ancient

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:48.890
biblical names.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.830
One can find some intriguing
examples.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.440
I am going to show
you two map excerpts

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.020
which are a study in
change and contrast.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.110
This first example is from
the Haifa sheet of the map

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.240
of Palestine published
by the British in 1943.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.750 position:56%
The gridlines, which are a kilometer
apart, provide a sense of scale.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.080
The area is about 10
miles northeast of Haifa.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.310
Note the frame toward the lower
left which surrounds a small,

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.850
[inaudible] like feature
marked by [inaudible].

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.890
On the second example, from the
same quadrangle sheet published

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.220
by the Survey of Israel in 1988,

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.830
the name in the Roman
alphabet is generally similar.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:38.230
The first word, spelled T-A-L-L
on the British map and T-E-L

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.700
on the Israel map,
means hill or ruin.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.290
What's noteworthy here is the
inscription of a Hebrew name

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.160
to the left of the feature.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.460
Jump back to the 1943 Survey of
Palestine map, and note the frame

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.900
around the village of Al-Birwa.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.650
Note also the two smaller
villages shown

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:07.290
by dark splotches farther
south, Al-Damun and Ar Ruwais.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:15.680
And now look at the representations
on the 1988 Israeli map.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.930
Simply put, they're not there.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.250
And not because the
mapmaker suppressed them.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.790
The villages are gone, dismantled.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:30.470
This slide shows resistance to the
Israeli removal of Arab villages

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.130
from the landscape
as well as from maps.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.640
It was posted on the
website Palestine Remembered.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.130
The inset map at the upper
right locates the district

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.180
of Acre in the north of Israel.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.480
And the main map and its
key below show 26 villages.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.680 position:56%
This is an index map with links to
descriptions of the bygone villages.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.720
Note that the names are the links.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.730 position:56%
It is part of the electronic version

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.700
of what has been called
the Arab map of Israel.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:08.550
The map has been replaced
by Google-type maps,

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.030
some with a satellite background.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.800
You can zoom in and click on one of
the red pins to pull up information

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:21.090
about bygone villages no longer
identified on present-day maps.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.010
The names remain in the database,
though, and can be plotted

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:30.040
on demand by their coordinates.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.900
Let me turn to a controversy
prominent in our own national media

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.360
in the 1990s when Korea,
still smarting from the pain

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.120
of Japanese occupation from 1910
to 1945, objected to Western maps

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.520
in which the body of water
directly east between Korea

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.590
and Japan was labeled
the Sea of Japan.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.940
Media were lobbied to
substitute the name East Sea,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.710
which refers to is
location east of Korea.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.590 position:56%
Obviously the Koreans were not happy

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.710
with the name Japan
immediately offshore.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:10.460 position:56%
To acknowledge Korean concerns,
many atlas publishers added East Sea

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:15.750
in parentheses directly
below the better-known name.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.020
The National Geographic Society,
because its atlas was not yet due

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.360
for a new edition, offered
this cut-out-and-paste-in patch

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.570
on its website.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:31.670
It's still that way on
most cartographic websites.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.320
And the latest National
Geographic atlas uses both names

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.060
with East Sea in parentheses.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.310
A similar controversy involving
countries on opposite sides

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:47.010
of a large body of water is the
controversy over the Persian Gulf,

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:51.290
the name favored by Iran,
but opposed by Saudi Arabia,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.500
which would prefer the
label Arabian Gulf.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.840
WorldAtlas.com is content with
the more widely-accepted name even

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.900
for its map of the
United Arab Emirates.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.170
Google Maps has a clever,
21st century way

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.010
of dealing with the conflict.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.730
When you or I ask to see its world
map only the name Persian Gulf

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.030
is present.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.580
When you zoom in really close the
secondary name Arabian Gulf appears

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.470
in parentheses.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.230
But because Google wants to avoid
having its web servers blocked

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.750
by the web servers of Iran,
users with an IP address

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.560
in Iran do not see
the name Arabian Gulf.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.030
But this accommodation
was worth the effort,

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.000
reinforces the importance
of geographic names.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.590 position:56%
And west of the Gulf, I am told,
the name Persian Gulf is suppressed.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:49.740
To deal with issues like
this for U.S. government maps

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.290 position:56%
and other publications, the
Foreign Names Committee of the Board

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:59.880
on Geographic Names maintains
the searchable geonames database

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.710
on the National Geospatial
Intelligence Agency website.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.780
A recent search for Arabian
Gulf revealed 14 substitutes

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.750 position:56%
for the preferred name Persian Gulf.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:15.940
Note that the screen includes links
to two online mapping websites,

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.600
Google Maps and MapQuest.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.700
Click on the Google Maps link, zoom
in a bit, and you get a red pin

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.250
with both the preferred
and the secondary name.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.780
Click on the MapQuest link, and
no matter how closely you zoom

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.770
in is an unnamed purple pin.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.760
Curious as to whether this
might have been a fluke,

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.750
I tried to find the Arabian
Gulf with a direct search

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.520
from Mapquest.com and got nothing.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.990
Searching for Germany
and then scrolling

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:53.300
down to the southeast
led me to the conclusion

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.430
that MapQuest does not label bodies

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.220
of water smaller than
the Arabian sea.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.410
One way to deal with
vexatious toponyms.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.210
For a while, around 2012,

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.230
Google Maps deliberately suppressed
the name Persian Gulf on its maps,

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:16.670
but apparently adopted the present
policy after protests from Iran.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.560
This seems a good place to note

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:25.570
that the Domestic Names Committee
has a policy whereby once named,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:29.420
a place cannot be un-named.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.620
Un-naming might have been a welcome
strategy for dealing with names

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.390
like these, excerpted

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:43.690
from geological survey maps
published in 1936, 1982, and 1986.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:48.450
Like most -- majority of toponyms,
they occur in sparsely-inhabited,

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.940
relatively inaccessible areas.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.640
How these names wound up on
federal topographic maps is easy

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.040
to understand.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.970
Topographers were sent into
the field and asked to measure

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.990
and describe the landscape as
it was, at least to the extent

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.380
that they could fit topographic
details, including place

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.150
and feature names onto
a map published at one

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.580
to 250,000, one to 62,500.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.340
In the pursuit of accuracy,
federal surveyors were required

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.780
to ferret out local usage.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.700 position:56%
Whether a toponym might be offensive
to some people was immaterial.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.650
What mattered was whether a name
was applied and understood locally.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:38.390
Toponyms typically consist of two
parts, a generic and a specific.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:43.090
This slide illustrates that the
J word as a specific was applied

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:47.760
to a variety of generics,
largely in the Western states,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.430
with a noteworthy concentration
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.990 position:56%
Although J-word toponyms were more
common in the West than in the East,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.520
any correlation with a pattern

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.330
of Japanese settlement
is faint at best.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.510
It's inevitable that the racial
enlightenment that swept the nation

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:12.610
in the 1950s and 1960s would make
federal officials uncomfortable,

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.020
if not mortified, by the
flagrant use of the N word

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.460
on the nation's topographic maps.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.430
As best I can discern,

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.600
the Washington establishment
was largely ignorant

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.980 position:56%
of the implied federal
endorsement of the N word until 1962

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.610 position:56%
when Secretary -- when the Secretary

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.520
of the Interior Stuart
Udall, ordered its removal.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.210 position:56%
USGS mapmakers responded by
changing all instances of the N word

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.610
to negro, which was considered
acceptable at the time.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.430
Unfortunately, these
toponyms were replaced only

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.030
when a map sheet was revised, which
in many cases meant replacement

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.020
of the 15-minutes series

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.550
by the more-details
seven-and-1/2-minute series

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.860
over the next 20 years.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:09.640
The only other instance of blanket
renaming was initiated in 1974

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:15.020
when USGS mapmakers were ordered
to replace Jap with Japanese.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.980
If you're curious about the
incidence of these toponyms,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.680
they are now online in
the web version of GNIS,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.420
the geographic names
information system.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.540
GNIS was started as a
one-state pilot project in 1976.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.110
Its earliest phase included
the capture of all toponyms

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.890
on then-current federal quadrangle
maps, a boon for mapmakers

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.660
and anyone else concerned

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.950
with racially-offensive
place and feature names.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:49.400
The GNIS website now makes it
easy to identify offensive names

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.980
which might survive in a
database as so-called variants,

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.790
a designation that includes
obsolete names as well

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.900
as non-standard spellings.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:05.490
This map shows the instance by
state of toponyms with the N word

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.540
or two similar spellings.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.670
It is interesting to note that few
of the N-word pejoratives occur

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.020
in the Southeast, the
part of the country

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.810
with the most violent resistance

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.490
to the Civil Rights
Movement in the 1960s.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.630
The source for this map
is the Omni Gazetteer,

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:30.610
a multi-volume reference
work published in 1991

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.650
and based largely on GNIS.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:41.460
This more complete cartographic
summary is based on a snapshot

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.600
of the GNIS database
obtained in 2003.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:52.040
The large number of N-word
pejoratives reflects what USGS

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:58.060
called phase-two names compilation,
a piecemeal process contracted

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.080
out on a state-by-state
basis and designed

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.860
to identify additional
named features,

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.060
not just those on federal maps.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:12.430
As the title indicates, these
names are mostly variants.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.870
Also based on GNIS, this
map shows the distribution

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.210
of toponyms containing negro.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.530
As of mid-2003 none of
these were variants.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:31.050
Some, but not all of them, reflect
the blanket renaming of the 1960s.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:35.870
By century's end negro had become
less acceptable as a substitute,

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:41.550
but BGN rules rejected cumbersome
substitutes like African-American

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:45.300
or the utterly generic B-L-A-C-K.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.420
Replacement names had to
be vetted individually

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:54.000
by the locally-initiated process
used for un-named features.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:04.140
This slide shows the progression
of feature names for a place

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.110
in Upstate New York along
the Lake Ontario shoreline

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.660
between Rochester and Oswego.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.320
According to the town
historian, the original name,

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.080 position:56%
shown in the top frame from a
topographic quadrangle map published

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.120
in 1943, reflects the
place's role as a station

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.340
on the Underground Railroad.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.900
Someone at USGS apparently
recognized it

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.490
as inappropriate before
the Udall edict.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.220
The redacted version
in the middle frame is

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.820
from a USGS map published in 1953.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.980
The lower frame is from a
New York State Department

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.210 position:56%
of Transportation
seven-and-1/2-minute planometric map

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.580
published in 1977.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.040
I was unable to track down
the origin of the name Graves.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.470
Doug, when people here reviewed
my slides, somebody looked

00:41:53.470 --> 00:42:00.630
into the geonames database,
and Graves Point is not there.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.140
The only thing I can figure
is there is a road that goes

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:09.240
up there that's called Graves Point
Road, and DOT, being the Department

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.960
of Transportation, I
guess, took it from that.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.030
And maybe somebody trying to sell
building lots up there figured

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.000
that that might be more apropos.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.430
The most contentious renaming
issue involves the word squaw,

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:29.720
deemed not amenable
to blanket replacement

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.190
with Indian woman or clan mother.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.920 position:56%
Like feature names containing negro,

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.170
names with squaw must be
dealt with individual.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.650
This map, which they
made about 10 years ago,

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.230
suggests the extent of the problem.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:47.510
Here's a choropleth map which
reports the same data as the ratio.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.590
Each state's count of
S-word toponyms was divided

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:57.010
by its total number of named
features and multiplied by 100,000

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:01.590
to provide a more readable key.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.910
Note that the highest rates
are in Idaho and Oregon.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:11.840
For whatever reason, the lowest
rates are in the Southeast.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:18.160
Minnesota's low rate, as of
2002, reflects a concerted effort

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.110
to replace S-word toponyms
with acceptable substitutes.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.770
Although states and localities can
change toponyms their actions have

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:32.430
no impact on federal maps and
databases unless the Board

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.310
on Geographic Names
approves the change.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:38.380
Typically the State
Names Board must approve,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.950
and tribal officials are also
consulted for names on tribal lands

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.150
or other areas in which the
tribe might have an interest.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.890
As this list of requirements
indicates,

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.740
the process is bureaucratic,
but hardly daunting.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.340 position:56%
How the nation deals with its
S-word toponyms will be a noteworthy

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.780
concern for historians of
21st century cartography.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.120
Will political pressure
expedite the process?

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.710
Will Native American leaders
give the issue a lower place

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.780
on their agenda?

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.690
Will majority public opinion
eventually find the word

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:21.320
so offensive that public officials
at all levels are required to act?

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.020
Will businesses cooperate or resist
when an S-word toponym refers

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.970
to a branded tourist
destination like Squaw Valley?

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:35.090
Native Americans are offended
by other kinds of names.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.390
For instance, the name Mount
McKinley for the tallest name

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.530
in Alaska, also the tallest
mountain in North America.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.900
The correct name, which the Board
on Geographic Names recognizes,

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.200
or would like to have
recognized, is Denali,

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.080
an Athabaskan word
for "the high one."

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.670
The peak had several
names, including Denali,

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.850
in 1896 when William
Dickey, an Alaskan prospector

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:07.850
and Princeton graduate, proposed
naming it for William McKinley

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.930
who had recently received the
Republican presidential nomination.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:19.050
In Dickey's mind, McKinley's strong
point was his spirited defense

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.350
of the gold standard.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:25.840
In 1897 Dickey mentioned the
name Mount McKinley eight times

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.680
in a short article he wrote for
"National Geographic" magazine,

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.510
an article somehow
interpreted as an endorsement.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.530 position:56%
The name was widely accepted by
1901 when McKinley was assassinated,

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.260
and a grieving citizenry
began plastering the name

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:45.300
of our 25th President on
high schools nationwide,

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.560
as fans of "Glee" are well aware.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:55.230
Even so, Hudson Stuck, Episcopal
Archdeacon of the Yukon,

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.370
preferred the name Denali.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:03.610
In 1913 Stuck became the first
person to reach the summit

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.270
and described this accomplishment
in his book "The Ascent

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:10.200
of Denali" published
the following year.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.330
Athabaskans had no voice on the
issue, nor did white Alaskans

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.860
who pointed out that McKinley
had never visited the territory,

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.980
which was accorded
statehood in 1959.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:26.390
Calls for renaming the peak
persisted, including a resolution

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.490
by the Alaskan legislature.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.890
Finally in 1980, the National
Park Service changed the name

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:37.640
of Mount McKinley National Park to
Denali National Park and Preserve.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.240
The Park Service can rename its
facilities without BGN approval

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.080
if Congress consents, as it did.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.380
All the same, the name Mount
McKinley stuck for over a century

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.090
because a single member of
Congress could block a name change

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:58.620 position:56%
by the Board on Geographic Names,
because one of its bylaws precludes,

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.370
quote, a decision on a
name or its application

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.040 position:56%
if the matter is being considered
by the Congress of the United States

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.930
or the Executive Branch, end quote.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:14.610
For a long time the obstacle was
Congressman Ralph Regula whose

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.590
district included McKinley's
hometown, Canton, Ohio.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.620
Shortly after a new
Congress was sworn in,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.050
Regula would introduce a bill
to keep the name Mount McKinley,

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:30.160
basically, as Ralph tells me,
by threatening the USDS budget.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.160
Even though these bills went
nowhere they blocked any action

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.100
by the federal Board.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.730
Now as we know -- well know,

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:42.720
the situation changed abruptly
last month, and for the good

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.780
and long overdue, I'd say.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.910
Another names controversy related

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.610
to a murdered President
occurred in 1963.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.200
In the week after the
Kennedy assassination,

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.650
when the new President
Lyndon Johnson decided

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.710
to put Kennedy's name
on Cape Canaveral.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.120
Johnson was a forceful politician,

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.300
noted for having rammed the
Civil Rights Act through Congress

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.400
and sending a half
million troops to Vietnam.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.810
Florida residents were outraged.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.390
Because Kennedy was from
Massachusetts, they asked,

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:17.600
why not rename it --
why not rename Cape Cod?

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:24.240 position:56%
Moreover, Canaveral was an old name,
having made its cartographic debut

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:31.190
in 1564 on a map by French
artist/explorer Jacques le Moyne.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.960
In 1973 the Board on Geographic
names accepted Florida's

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.850
recommendation that the
original name be restored.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.910
By general agreement, the
prominent NASA facility

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:45.960
on the Cape remained the
Kennedy Space Flight Center.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.950
Another consequence was the
establishment in 1984 of a rule

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:54.860
that banned renaming
geographic features after people

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.570
who had been dead less
than one year.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:02.300
In 1995 the waiting period
was increased to five years.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:08.280
The five-year rule caused
conflict with another state in 2003

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.090
when Arizona Governor Janet
Napolitano convinced the State

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:18.850
Board, strong-arming them, to
rename Squaw Peak near Phoenix

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:22.840
for Lori Piestewa, the first
female Native American soldier

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.440
to die in combat.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.090
Napolitano saw Piestewa's
death as an opportunity

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.450
to expunge a prominent
derogatory name

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:35.900
that had recently caught the ire
of Native American activists.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:40.250
Napolitano was no Lyndon Johnson,
and the Federal Board held fast

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:44.930
until 2008 when the five-year
waiting period had passed.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:49.680
Hawaii was another state in which
indigenous people resisted the

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.170
official treatment
of geographic names.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:56.010
The issue was not so much the
names themselves, but the system

00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:03.070
of Romanization that conspicuously
suppressed two diacritical marks,

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.350
the macron and the glottal stop,

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.720
both of which signify
important tonal differences.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.770
The macron is a short bar above
a letter, usually a vowel.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:16.550
Here's a USGS map showing a
name rendered with a macron.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:21.470
And here is the same feature in
an excerpt from an earlier edition

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.640
of the same quadrangle map.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.560
This earlier Romanization
affects other letters as well

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.300
and shows two words, not one.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:37.420
This slide from a 1998 map has
two examples of the glottal stop

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.040
which Hawaiians write as
a single open quote mark.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.930
In 1995 the Board on
Geographic Names relaxed the rule

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:49.980
that had prohibited diacritical
marks used in Native languages

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.080
in Alaska and Hawaii, and over the
next 10 years the federal Board

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.530
approved several thousand
revised Hawaiian names in time

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:04.920
for a major revision of
large-scale USGS topographic maps.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.940
Here's the same feature on
an earlier map from 1954.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.420
Note that the two glottal stops
have been accommodated awkwardly

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.720
by blank spaces.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.310
Another kind of geographic name
that might evoke a call for change,

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.250
at least in some of the more
genteel quarters of society,

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.680
are risque feature names focused
on excrement, bodily functions,

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.220
and most of all the female body
which provides geometric metaphors

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:39.690
for a variety of feature names like
Virgins Breasts and Nipple shown

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.080
in this excerpt from a 1977 edition

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.090
of the Geological Survey's
Jonesville,

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:49.330
Maine seven-and-1/2-minute
quadrangle map.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:58.400
The lure of, L-O-R-E and L-U-R-E,
of risque toponyms is epitomized

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:04.020
by the saga of Brassiere Hills,
an off-again/on-again name

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:10.350
of a twin-peaks feature 18 miles
Northwest of Juneau, Alaska.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:15.800
The name had appeared on a 1948
version, but not on the 1952 map

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.660
from which I took this excerpt.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.130
It had apparently appeared on
an advance copy of a 1962 map,

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.240
but was removed from
the final version.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:32.310
Here is is on the 1996 edition.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.180
I doubt that the feature would
have had a particularly risque

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:42.290
significance until overhead imagery
revealed its suggestive tree line.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.870
This seems a good place
to wrap up [laughter].

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:50.060
Most of the examples I've shown
this morning are in my book,

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.590
"From Squaw Tit to Whorehouse
Meadow," which the University

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:58.580
of Chicago Press published in 2006.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.380
The title was imposed by
the Press's marketing people

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.100
who considered my working title,

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.350
Fighting Words, insufficiently
enticing.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.650
Well, if you don't count Squaw,

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:13.290 position:56%
only two of the books eight
chapters deals with risque toponyms.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:18.520
In my opinion, Fighting Words, was
an apt and suitably broad title

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.280
which captures the
importance of geographic names

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.540
as words worth fighting over.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.510
Thank you.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:39.620
[ Applause ]

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.340
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: We have
a few moments for questions,

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.810
so if you have a question if you
could stand, and speak loudly,

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.870
and Mark, thank you again.

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.260
If you could repeat the question,
since you have the microphone.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.560
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Okay.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.860
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell:
Then we will [inaudible].

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.000
Are there any questions?

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:05.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Ah, yes, yes?

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:07.080
&gt;&gt; Are you working
on a current book?

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.380
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Yes, I am.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.100
Oh, okay, the question is am
I working on a current book?

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.430
And the answer is yes, I am.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:16.330
If you're curious as to what
it's about, it basically looks

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:23.140 position:56%
at patented cartographic inventions,
which in producing volume six

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:28.150
of "The History of Cartography,"
turned out to be a significant gap.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:34.010 position:56%
We have one entry in there concerned
with intellectual property,

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.430
and talks mostly about copyright.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.820
I think it has maybe about
three paragraphs about patents.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.890
There have been a lot of
cartographic inventions patented.

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:48.810
I maintain that the patent
system functioned as kind

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:50.110
of a parallel literature.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.620
In other words, we have the
standard -- excuse me --

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.820
technical, scientific, academic
literature of cartography,

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.380
and general articles
refereed, and so forth.

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.940
Well, there's also a literature
produced by the Patent Office,

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.040
"Published patents" and also the

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.620
"Official Gazette"
of the Patent Office.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.010
There's some interesting parallels

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:17.390
because patent examiners
function as editors.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:20.050
We have also patent
attorneys who function

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.920
in many cases as ghost writers.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.480
And it's interesting to sort
of look at that and then find

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.140
out some things that people reading
the cartographic literature and,

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.740
in fact, the literature
of the history of mapping,

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.560
seem to be largely ignorant of
a lot of these possibilities.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:40.070
There is very little cross-citation
between these two literatures.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.300
So thanks for the question.

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.590
One over here.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:53.770
&gt;&gt; Using your history of name
[inaudible] what do you predict

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.720
for renaming [inaudible]
the Confederacy?

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.160
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier:
After the Confederacy?

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.460
Boy, okay.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.900
Considering my work on geographic
names and the history of it,

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.520
what do I predict on the
renaming of the Confederacy?

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:16.230 position:56%
Well, I don't know how many toponyms
really involve the Confederacy,

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.820
per se.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:24.150 position:56%
You know, I would imagine that the
interest of, you know, authenticity,

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:31.660
you know, places named Lee are
going to still be places named Lee.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:38.240 position:56%
And I know there -- I don't have the
facts on the tip of my fingers --

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.770
a lot of facts I don't have on
the tip of my fingers these days

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:48.530
as one gets older -- but there was
a controversy somewhere out West

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:55.010
about a place named after a
Civil War general involved

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.950
in the slaughter of Native
Americans or something like that.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.250
&gt;&gt; Must be Harney Peak.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.550
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Harney
Peak, ah, good, thank you.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.990
&gt;&gt; That's an ongoing --

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.290
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: And you know,

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:07.720
and basically the Harney family
apparently does not oppose the

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:13.500 position:56%
renaming of the feature, and I guess
Board Members are not authorized

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.850
to talk on their opinions
on the outcome of that.

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:24.830
And frankly, I have no idea
where it's going to go.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:28.560
It's a question, I guess, of how
much, you know, pressure is made,

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.860
especially at the state level
to change that name, and whether

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.940
or not they can come up with
an appropriate substitute.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.350
And I would imagine that
if they try hard enough

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.380
that should not be difficult.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.970
But well, that's a good example.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.360
One thing that some people
have asked me, you know,

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.830
about is the squaw issue.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:54.490 position:56%
And it seems -- and I mentioned
this in the talk, and the likelihood

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.220
of any blanket renaming is nil.

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.500
And some interesting opportunities
to actually identify local people,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.050
some Native Americans or some not,
or you know, maybe even species

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:09.960
of birds or fish that would
provide acceptable substitutes.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:14.130
But I guess that -- there's been
significant progress made on that,

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.610
and that is ultimately
going to, you know,

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:21.120
I think maybe work its
way through the system.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.840
Anybody -- yeah, question there.

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:29.800
&gt;&gt; How do you personally feel about
applying hierarchy to generics

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:34.300
such as river, creek,
stream, rill, rut,

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:39.500
applied to a specific
size of a stream?

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:48.160
Or what the difference is between
a hill, a mountain, and a peak?

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Oh, boy.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.530
Okay, I guess the question is
concerned, again, with my opinion

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:59.360
on the applicability of the various
generics, referring maybe to --

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.260
in the case of hydrographic
features maybe stream flow,

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:07.160
in the case of topographic features
-- elevation features, height,

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.900
and whether, you know,
hill or mountain.

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:20.420
Okay, since you asked for my
personal opinion it probably --

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.080
I doubt that the Board is going
to want to come up with a standard

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.380
for what constitutes a hill,
what constitutes a mountain.

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.750 position:56%
You can probably figure that there
might be some cases which would come

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:34.000
up where, you know,
calling some feature

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.310
that is 11,000 feet tall a hill.

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:43.430
I don't know what the Board's
feeling is about irony.

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:50.850
And the same way, and I would
imagine there probably are some,

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:53.850
you know, what you
might call gray areas --

00:59:53.850 --> 01:00:00.530 position:56%
in the case of hydrographic features
blue areas -- as to, you know --

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.830 position:56%
I mean, there are also other things.

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.130
I mean, what is a cove?

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.740
What is a bay?

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.080
And I would imagine NOAA might
probably have some standards

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.630
on that, too.

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:14.330
You can see I'm sort of, you
know, hemming and hawing.

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.670
And I guess I don't really
have much of opinion.

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.540
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Why don't
we let you off the hot seat?

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.860
&gt;&gt; Mark Monmonier: Okay, oh,
thanks very much for you interest

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.330
and thank you for your questions.

you for sharing them.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.570
Our next speaker is
Ms. Helen Kerfoot.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:43.040
She is the former Chair of the
United Nations Group of Experts

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.600
on Geographic Names and
an Emeritus scientist

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.340
for Natural Resources Canada.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.940
As UNGEGN Chair Ms. Kerfoot
promoted the significance

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.010 position:56%
of geographical name standardization

01:00:56.010 --> 01:01:00.150
for national geospatial
data infrastructures

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:04.350
and for the preservation
of cultural heritage.

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.530
UNGEGN is the international group

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.110
who provides technical
recommendations

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.650
on standardizing geographic names

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:15.430
at the national and
international level.

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.640
Drawing on her leadership
in national

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.270
and international geographic names,

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:25.370
Ms. Kerfoot will set global
naming practices in context

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:30.510
and discuss the roles of national
naming authorities like the BGN.

&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Thank
you very much, Doug.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.760
And good morning to everybody.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.570
&gt;&gt; Good morning

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:53.270
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: It's a privilege
for me to be here with you today,

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:58.000
and I was, in fact, here
for the 100th celebrations,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.640
so that makes me feel
doubly privileged.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.540
And at that time the Canadian
Board put out a special publication

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.580
of its journal "Canoma" which
recognized really cooperation

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.860
in toponomy between our countries.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.790
And they were all issues
which were of interest

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:19.440
to both Canada and
the United States.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.590
So congratulations
now on your 125th.

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:28.590
The BGN, I'm sure, receives
interesting inquiries.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:31.920
And when I was Chair
of UNGEGN I had --

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.780
or we received one
rather curious one.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:43.160
A gentleman from Denmark wished to
name the point where zero longitude

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.880 position:56%
and zero latitude cross each other
In other words, something like this,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.010
or maybe it's something
more like that.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:57.320
And he wanted to name it Anker
Point, which probably is a play

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.910
on words for A-N-C-H-O-R.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.430
And he thought, or assumed,

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:06.450
that United Nations
could, in fact, do this.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.370
Well, as you can see, it's
not really a feature It's not

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.430
in anybody's national jurisdiction.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:16.880
The United Nations does not have a
mandate to make decisions on names.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.040
The IHO, the International
Hydrographic Organization,

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.870
cannot make that decision.

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.310
And in fact, it seemed
like nobody could.

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:26.490
And in case you're wondering, yes,

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.730
Anker is his family
name, so [inaudible].

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:35.000
I've mentioned the United
Nations, and you've heard

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.500
that in fact they support
conferences

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.460
and UNGEGN sessions
on standardization.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.720
This starts back in
1959 with a resolution

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.370
of the Economic and Social Council.

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:54.630
And the first meetings
were held in the 1960s.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.840
Since then there have
been 10 conferences

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.620
and 28 meetings of
the Group of Experts.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.430
And it all started with the
idea of improving communication

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:07.960
with geographic names, particularly
for the U.N. cartography,

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:13.540
and the idea being of standardizing
spelling and also applications.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.840
And the basis for this,
as you've heard already,

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.530
is national standardization.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:23.360
And that forms the background
for international standardization

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.230
with appropriate Romanization
systems with a scientific basis.

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:32.960
And the Resolution Four of the
first conference has lived on

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.760
and still is one of our very
valuable resolutions making

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.010
these statements.

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:43.510
So if the basis is
national standardization,

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:47.050
then the cornerstone is
the names authorities.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.890
So people ask, "Well, is
there a model to follow?"

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.190
And clearly there isn't.

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.930
This depends upon the type
of government you have,

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:58.600
the size of the country,
the population distribution,

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.690
the number of languages,
and so on, and so on.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.300
We do have some sort of
basic thoughts on this.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.190 position:56%
If there are -- if there is no names
authority its probably the national

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.950
mapping agency that takes charge.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.170
This is all right for
some countries,

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:18.590
but in other cases it
means that many departments

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:21.380
or agencies have overlapping
responsibilities

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:25.150
and is rather a waste of
time and waste of resources.

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:30.100
So UNGEGN does suggest that a
names authority be established.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.050
It could be a centralized one,

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:35.270
particularly this is the
case in smaller countries.

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:39.150
And Madagascar is mentioned
here, perhaps has the privilege

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:43.960
of having the highest number of
members on its Board, 44 members,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.830
which sounds a little
unwieldy, but I guess may work.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.900
We could have a decentralized
authority

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.630
where the decisions are made at the
regional level as, for instance,

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.190
Canada has, and several
other countries.

01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:01.600
Or we could have the arrangement
like you have in this country

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:08.040 position:56%
with the BGN cooperating with
naming authorities at a state level.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.140
Now these are referring
to domestic names.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.540
When we look at foreign names
boards there are far fewer

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.950
around the world.

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:18.840
Certainly the BGN comes
to mind, obviously,

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.490
and the United Kingdom's PCGN.

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.170
Poland and Bulgaria
area also countries

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.440
that have foreign names boards.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.240
Now just as authorities come in
all sorts of different phases

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.100
or different types,
so does the mandate

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.650
of a board differ from
country to country.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:45.660
And most countries would have
a mandate with, shall we say,

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.600
geographical features, and probably
with unincorporated place names,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.690
but relatively few, unless
they are smaller countries,

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.140
would have authority
over street names.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.300
This usually comes down
to a municipal level.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.290
But when we hear about
China, who report to us

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:06.620
that they need 20,000 new
urban names every year,

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.080
you can see this is
not insignificant.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.460
And by that they mean
buildings, streets, suburbs,

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.060
or completely new cities.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.600
And then the United Nations
tells us that by 2030 over 80%

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.460
of us will live in
an urban environment.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.410
So street names are certainly
nothing to be avoided.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.760
They are all important to us.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.150
And you can see here a
few examples [laughter].

01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:42.220
In 2005 the World Bank put
out a very interesting report

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.840
and indicated that at
least 50% of city streets

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.910
in Sub-Saharan Africa had no
names, and therefore, no addresses.

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:54.670
And this was because the centers
of the city had become more dense,

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:58.430
the urban areas had expanded,
and names had not kept up.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:01.750
Now this is very difficult
for individual identity,

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:05.500
for bank accounts, or postal
delivery, or anything like that,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.830
for gathering taxes, for urban
planning, for following epidemics.

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:14.010
With no names and addresses
this is a difficulty.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:18.120
So the World Bank did finance
several Sub-Saharan African

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.830
countries to set up
street addressing,

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.720
and associated databases, and maps.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.820
To start with they
suggested numbering systems,

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.160
which you can imagine is not as
controversial as putting names.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.050
And then these could
be augmented later.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.600
So for instance, in Yaounde

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:42.330
in Cameroon this first one
would be one of six zones.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.920
This is zone one, street number 74.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.350
In this case we've got a name added
as well as the zone 2 reference.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.490
And this one shows one of
each, one without a name,

01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:55.610 position:56%
and one where a name has been added.

01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:59.840
So that was the approach
that was taken on that.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.880
If I can go back to the
level of national boards,

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.270
most exist with some sort of
legal framework, an act maybe.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:10.480
And in the older acts
usually it was just described

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.280
in a technical way
about approval of names.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.120
But in newer boards, as
in Burkina Faso recently,

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.850
there has been much more about
the idea of cultural heritage,

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:24.720
of conserving face names, or
preserving toponomic heritage

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.810
of culture and of language.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:32.040
The same thing in Tunisia,
again in 2013 they talked

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.550
about national toponomic heritage,
of preserving the specifics

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.420
of Arabic, of the Tunisian
form of Arabic,

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:44.240
ensuring that studies be undertaken
in -- on geographical names.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:50.560
So in fact, toponyms do
link man to the land.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.210
They are points of reference.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:56.430
They are bearers of our
history and our language

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.420
and carriers of our identity.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.120
So this brings up interesting
questions.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.050 position:56%
The mantra in the past, particularly
from cartographers was one name

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.410
for one feature, or university.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.710
And Nameless Cove is
in Newfoundland,

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:15.760
so don't take offense from that.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.420
But it brings now the question

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:22.150
of should there be multiple
names recognized in the languages

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:25.710
of the country, reflecting,
perhaps reality,

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:27.410
if you like to put it that way.

01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:32.520
This is in Norway with
Norwegian Sami language

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.290
and [inaudible], or finish.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:38.430
There's another example in
Slovenia with the Italian added,

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:42.700
and there are many more examples
we could give of multiple naming.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.550
This is New Zealand where
names might be in [inaudible],

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.390
or they might be in English.

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:50.880
Or in the two examples
shown there are various ways

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.120
of having combinations of names.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.420
This, of course, does bring
questions for cartographers.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.590
And this is in northern Finland
with three names for Inari,

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.890
although I just learned last week

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:05.650
that there are now
five names for Inari.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.430
And the Finnish way of
handling this is you either

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:13.990
on a map show all the names,
or you omit the altogether.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.270
You do not just pick
one or two of them out.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.450
And in Canada this year we
have increased the names

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:23.040
for the Mackenzie River,
and we now have seven names

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.550
in the local languages
of the Mackenzie Valley.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.840
Still have to figure out
how we're going to deal

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.640
with this on maps, incidentally.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.790
I'd like now to look at something
about the sort of time frame

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:39.360
when national authorities
have been set up.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.210
The United States Board,
as you know, from 1890,

01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:47.330
was the first national board
established in the world.

01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:51.420
Canada was shortly after that, for
similar reasons, the settlement

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:57.320
in the West, and the confusion
of names that were taking place.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.150
Four other countries,
Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand,

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.610
and Ireland all had
boards established

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.110
by the end of the Second World War.

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:08.510
And now in our sort of latest
figures we have got some 80

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:11.310
countries that have
national authorities.

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:14.020
And this would mean, again,

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:17.440
dealing with domestic names
rather than with foreign names.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.610
Most recent of these are Saudi
Arabia, and Burkina Faso,

01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.820
and Tunisia that I
mentioned, Sri Lanka,

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:27.610
the Foroyar area of
Denmark, and so on.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:31.890
But we do have to be fair on this,
even though they're established

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:36.400
by law, there are some boards that
are clearly not really functional

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.910
at the present time, to
be encouraged, obviously.

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:47.050
If we look at this on a basis of a
map, the green areas are countries

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:49.370
that have national
names authorities.

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:54.110 position:56%
The purple-y color are the ones that
without national names authorities.

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:58.310
And the orange-y/brown-y color is
where we still have to do a bit

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:01.350
of work on this where
the status is unclear.

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:04.170
Now before you all jump all
over me and say, "Oh, no.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.470
I disagree with this.

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.380
I disagree with that
one," let me say

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.080
that these countries have
self-identified these.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.820
This is not something
that we have imposed.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.500
They have said, "Yes,
we have a board," or,

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.800
"No, we don't have a board."

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.730
And of course, you can see from
the date at the top this is sort

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:20.360
of ongoing and changeable.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.860
And I could point out that
the number of countries

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.690
in Africa grew considerably in the
'60s when they gained independence

01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:30.790
and set up their names authorities.

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:34.950
And then similarly, in countries
that came from the breakup

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:39.290
of the Soviet Union or from breakup
of Yugoslavia were quite quick

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:41.480
to establish names authorities.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.720
For those countries that
don't have authorities,

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.860 position:56%
this can be quite a hard sell for us

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.550
to convince them that
it would be useful.

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:56.850 position:56%
Of course, we can't compete with
water and health, nor can we compete

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:01.220
with trying to have accommodation
of some sort, living facilities,

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:07.850 position:56%
or with education, with food supply,
or with transportation routes.

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:13.940
But basic to all those
agencies is the use

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.550
of standardized geographical names,
even if it's under the surface

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:20.280
and not clearly recognized.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.530
So we can talk about the
benefits of standardized names,

01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:25.990
and we can do this on a
sort of overlapping basis.

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.400
This is just in general terms.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.110
We might talk about technical
benefits, for instance,

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:34.860
in different forms of mapping
and information management;

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.800
of economic benefits for
clear delivery services

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.140
and promoting your tourism it's
better not to have ambiguity.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.940 position:56%
If we're talking about social
benefits you've got humanitarian aid

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.650
and search and rescue where
you certainly don't want many

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:51.270
different names.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.290
And we can talk about
cultural benefits and the idea

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:55.800
of retaining your language,

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:01.470
or in terms of identity
ambiguity is not very helpful.

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:04.810
Some examples of lack
of standardized data

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:12.510
or standardized names, in Pakistan
-- this was back in 2005 --

01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:17.580
the United Nations Office for
Humanitarian Affairs was dealing

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.230
with rescue operations
or aid operations

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:24.770
after the earthquake
up in the mountains.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.800
And there were all sorts of
delays in providing assistance

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.080
to these remote villages partly

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.660
because they could not
obtain standardized names.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.660
The coordinates weren't
available for the villages.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.030
There were no gazetteers
to be handed out.

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.020
They didn't know the
population statistics.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.630
And they didn't have maps
So all this, of course,

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:50.930
contributes to thousands of people
who lost their lives as a result

01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:53.960
of this earthquake and aid
not reaching them quickly.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:59.330
By contrast, a year or so later
Indonesia had similar problems,

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:02.030
but their data was
in much better shape

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:07.630
and was much more helpful
to those providing aid.

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.060
A similar one, this is in Somalia,

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.780
and this is the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.360
And you can see on the list here
they are providing different forms

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.940
for the names in Roman alphabet.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:28.170
And they found that duplication of
names, repetition, obviously lack

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:32.160
of standardization, and the
data not even being available

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.070
for some areas had a lot
of significance to them.

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:37.860
They lost resources.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.380
Security could be compromised
over this.

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.380
There certainly was confusion with
these multiple spellings of names.

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.050
And this also led to
bad decision-making.

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:50.030
So this is some of the difficulties

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:53.010
when you don't have
standardized names available.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.290
So I think we're clear
that we still need

01:16:55.290 --> 01:17:01.010
to encourage national names
authorities, and we also know well

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:03.440
that crises don't stop
at national borders.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.680
So we do need to have cooperation
between countries for databases

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.940
and for making information
available.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.420
I just want to look at other
international organizations.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.580 position:56%
And I still have a few minutes here.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.150
The International Hydrographic
Organization --

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.390
I know there are people
here involved with that --

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:28.060
it is a coordinating body
for hydrographic agencies

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.140
and for the work that they do.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.550
It is not a decision-making
body in the terms of names

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:36.940
of oceans and water features.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:40.250
Although, obviously through
"Limits of Oceans and Seas,"

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:45.320 position:56%
one of their prominent publications,
they do have an influence.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.130
And that, as you know,
they're still trying

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.920 position:56%
to be updated from the 1953 edition.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:56.430
The Subcommittee on Undersea
Feature Names relating

01:17:56.430 --> 01:18:02.420
to IHO does have decision-making
authority, and meets once a year,

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.470 position:56%
and decides on the names of undersea
features that have been submitted

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:12.210
to it, and keep an online gazetteer
which everybody can access.

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:14.190
Another international group --

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:17.340
which I cut the slide because I
thought I wouldn't have enough time

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.150
-- is the Scientific Committee
for Antarctic Research.

01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:25.040
They are a gathering group rather
than a decision-making group.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.490
And I know they have
something like 39,000 names

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.390
for some 17,000 features
because they gather the material

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:34.780
from the different countries.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:38.400
And I believe the U.S. have
contributed something like 1/3

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.560
of the names that are
in that database.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:46.270
And then we -- lastly, we go
beyond Earth and out into space

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:52.130 position:56%
to the International Astronomical
Union and one of its working groups.

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:56.080
The IAU has been in
effect since 1919.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:04.230 position:56%
And I think particularly with
Sputnik in 1957 and man on the moon,

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.110
if you like, in the late '60s,

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:12.330
there was much more general public
interest in features on planets,

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.730
on moons, names outside Earth.

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:20.570
In other words, toponyms
rather than geographic names.

01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:22.520
And they set up the Working Group

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.160
on Planetary System
Nomenclature in 1973.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:33.740
Now themes have been established
for naming with this working group.

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:38.680
And just quite recently there were
some craters named on Mercury --

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.130
this was earlier this year --

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:43.510
and they have a theme of
artists, composers, and writers.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:47.430 position:56%
And I was quite interested to see
that a famous Canadian photographer,

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:55.130
Karsh, in fact, was put forward
and now has a crater named for him.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:20:00.040
He's not alive, so
he won't know that.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.880
So they are moving towards a
public involvement in these,

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.180
either by contest, which that
one was, and chosen by the IAU

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:14.000 position:56%
and this working group, or as we saw
just recently, planets associated

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.410
with other stars and how
they're now having public input

01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:21.000
and public voting in fact, more
crowdsourcing of information.

01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:28.220
Right. So just to finish
off, I would like to say

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:33.460
that I'm sure we certainly have
continued need for standardization

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.090
of geographic names
to protect heritage,

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:40.840
to integrate with other
place related data.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.110
As you've already heard,
the geographic name is one

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:50.600 position:56%
of the main aspects that the general
public will use to query databases,

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.990
so it's an important entry
point for place-related data

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:57.250
and for linking them together.

01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:00.380
There's still a need for
accurate and up-to-date records.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.800
It's greater than ever.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.270
Although it may be challenging

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:10.530
to name authorities today I think
we have to keep up with life,

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:15.230
we have to grasp the opportunities
of today's communication,

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:18.750
and this probably means
going to crowdsourcing,

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:21.860
which I know for a name's
board is quite controversial,

01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:24.020
but I think we'll hear
about that this afternoon.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.820
So, thank you very much.

point do we have any questions?

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.230
Kenneth, you can stand up.

01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:50.730
&gt;&gt; Helen, I'm curious if you
have some valid information

01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:56.200
on legalities regarding
[inaudible] copyright

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.140

that you can tell us.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.540
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the question?

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.840
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Yes.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.140
The question was, have we
compiled anything about legalities

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.440 position:56%
of geographical names and copyright?

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.740
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.540
I should clarify.

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.660
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:16.960
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Ownership of list

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.920
of names rather than
individual names.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.220
&gt;&gt; Good.

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.520
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Okay.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.060
No, I would say that UNGEGN has
not dealt at all with ownership

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.220
of names or lists of names.

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:29.660
I think perhaps here you're talking

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:33.380
about databases and
this sort of thing.

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.680
All right.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.700
No, I guess we're trying
to encourage countries

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:42.770
to make their geographical
names data available for free.

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:45.380
But, as you know, this is
not the case particularly

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.690
for many countries in Europe.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:50.280
These names are not
available for free as a group.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.290
Some countries have moved in
this direction, though Finland,

01:22:53.290 --> 01:22:58.210 position:56%
for example, now has its names data
and other topographic data available

01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:00.730
to the public without charge.

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:05.000
There are other issues, of
course, of ownership of names.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.880
This does come up with
indigenous or aboriginal names,

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.980
and really whether these
names belong to the Earth

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:18.540 position:56%
and to the people, whether
everybody has access to these names.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.010
There are many interesting
questions there, too.

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:25.510 position:56%
But I think that's perhaps different
from the question you posed.

01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:31.020
So I can't say we have done
much work on copyrighting, no.

01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:36.000
I'll put it down for
future reference [laughter].

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:43.760
&gt;&gt; Yes. I [inaudible] decided
you had to show the country

It's only that I'm
looking at that map

01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:56.190
and I see quite what you're
saying, but in addition

01:23:56.190 --> 01:24:00.440
to the board's itself, there
are other organizations.

is, in your experience dealing

01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:16.460

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:23.260

&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Thank you, Leo.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.400
This is quite a controversial
topic I think,

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.840
the question of whether
a mapping agency sort

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:43.230 position:56%
of constitutes a names authority and
whether that's the best way to go.

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:48.270
I think there are some countries
like you mentioned, Mexico.

01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:53.470
I think Egypt's probably
another one where the statistics

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:58.570
and the mapping agency are
together, and perhaps some

01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:01.060
of the South American
countries, too.

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.550
People would say this is probably
the best arrangement for them.

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:07.730
But we have found in other areas
like when we've been working

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:09.680
with countries in Africa.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.330
This isn't necessarily
the best way ahead.

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:14.700
The mapping agencies are weak.

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.160
They've, for instance,
I was thinking

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.730
of Burkina Faso before it got
the names authorities there.

01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:25.290
Out in the countryside you
saw several names on a sign,

01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:29.040
and one of them might be
some sort of local spelling.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.740
Another one was perhaps the
French way of pronouncing it.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.500 position:56%
So you got Geekum [assumed spelling]
Tango and Geekum Tingo which were --

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.860
both been on the sign and
essentially the same thing.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.340
Nobody was really taking
charge of those.

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.740
So it seems easier and avoids
overlap of effort, I think,

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.690
so that many different
departments are not spending money

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:49.470
on the same sort of thing, to
have a group which advises now.

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:53.220
It doesn't mean the mapping agency
wouldn't be the lead on this,

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:57.210
but at least they could involve
others like transportation

01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:03.140
and agriculture and other groups
into the naming authority.

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.080
I think that's the way
Burkina Faso's gone,

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.380
and also Tunisia has gone.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.060
So I don't know if that kind
of addresses your point,

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.740
but I think it can be good, and
it's certainly a starting point.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.040
But maybe we want something

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.340
where the names can be
used more universally.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.640
Sometimes when it's the mapping
agency that's the only authority

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.940
that's the only use these names
have, and they don't make it

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.310
into the media, and they don't
make it into other uses outside

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.610
that government department.

01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:24.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:25.810
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: All's quiet?

01:26:25.810 --> 01:26:27.110
Thank you.

01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:28.410
[ Applause ]

01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:29.710
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Okay.

01:26:29.710 --> 01:26:32.900
So now in this next session before
lunch we're going to have two talks

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:37.940
that are going to focus
specifically on the BGN.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:43.380
Our first speaker is Captain
Albert E. "Skip" Theberge,

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:47.160
who's a retired NOAA Corps
Officer, and who currently works

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.460
at the National Oceanic

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.170
and Atmospheric Administration's
Central Library.

01:26:52.170 --> 01:26:54.670
Skip served on the
BGN's Advisory Committee

01:26:54.670 --> 01:26:58.210
for Undersea Features for 12 years.

01:26:58.210 --> 01:27:02.010
He's written over 75 articles
on the history of the Coast

01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:06.330
and Geodetic Survey
and Ocean Sciences.

01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:09.500
Skip will talk about
the origins of the BGN.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:16.140 position:56%
As an historian Skip is like a
crime scene investigator [laughter].

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:20.550
He will take us where
the evidence leads.

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:22.510
Skip.

01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:31.040
[ Applause ]

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.340
&gt;&gt; Albert E. Theberge: Thank you,

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:36.540
and as I was telling a few
folks here, I have a number

01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:37.840
of friends in the audience.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.550 position:56%
I hope they still are after I'm done
[laughter], but we'll find out here.

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:44.780
We'll get going.

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.400
Okay. I received, when I
was asked to do this --

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.810
I really was not overly
knowledgeable in the history

01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:56.090
of the BGN, and I'd really like to
offer recognition of Don Orth who's

01:27:56.090 --> 01:28:00.330
in the audience here today who
really has delved into many

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:04.850
of the nuances of the history and
just glad he's here and I use some

01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:07.580
of his work to help unravel this.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.420
So I have this little
brochure that was sent to me.

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.240
The wording in this was a
little different than what's

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.540
in the brochure you have today.

01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:18.950
Okay. Domestic names.

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:23.240
The origins of the US BGN can be
traced to the surge of exploration,

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.370
settlement, and economic
exploitation

01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:29.380
of the American West
after the Civil War.

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.180
Contradictions and
inconsistencies concerning names

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.320
of geographic features were a
serious problem for surveyors,

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.700
mapmakers, government officials,
and scientists who required uniform

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.030
and unambiguous geographic
nomenclature.

01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:46.310
In 1890 President Benjamin
Harrison created the Board

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:49.590
and gave it the authority to
resolve unsettled geographic

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.170
names questions.

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.510
Well, that just about
says it, so no.

01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:56.110
[ Laughter ]

01:28:56.110 --> 01:28:57.410
Okay, so. Okay.

01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.710
Glad a few folks laughed.

01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:00.010
That was good.

01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:02.690
Okay. Now, getting a
little more serious.

01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:06.590
The BGN has its intellectual roots
in the earliest map-making efforts.

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:09.620
As societies became more
complex, the necessity to name

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:12.460
and define geographic
entities assumed increasingly

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.990
greater importance.

01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:18.530 position:56%
These names were incorporated in
maps, charts, gazetteers, peripli --

01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:22.770
that includes portolani, routiers,
rutters, coast pilots, et cetera --

01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:26.310
census listings, and
related documents.

01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:27.890
This is an early example.

01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:32.620
I canvassed a number of people
for pronunciations, so forgive me.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:36.940
The Tabula Peutingeriana
dates to Emperor Augustus,

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:41.260
555 city names, 3500 place names.

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:44.940
Approximately 15 B.C.E.,
produced under the direction

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.280
of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:52.650
Moving ahead 200 years,
we have Claudius Ptolemy.

01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:56.900
He put together a listing of
8000 place names with his version

01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:00.220
of latitude/longitude coordinates.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:03.750
The <i>Doomsday Book </i>-- that's how
I'm informed it's pronounced --

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:09.710
put together in England at the
behest of William the Conqueror

01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:14.350
over 13,000 place names ordered by
county and hierarchy of ownership.

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:16.530
Those of you who are
concerned with the IRS,

01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:20.010
maybe the pronunciation
is Doomsday [laughter].

01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:21.650
So, moving head.

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:23.720
The Cassini map of France.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.530
Four generations of the Cassini
family put this map together.

01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:30.010
It was based on -- first map

01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:32.680
of a country based on
geodetic principles.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:39.070
Sixty-two thousand place names were
included on this particular map.

01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:43.870 position:56%
Going across the Atlantic, we don't
think of Noah Webster as having much

01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:50.130
to do with geography, but his 1802
<i>American Spelling Book </i>had a

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:52.920
listing of, spelling
and pronunciation

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:57.220
of selected place names in the
United States, so most states

01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.470
that existed then and
the major cities.

01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:04.320
He was trying to impress
his will on the spelling

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.920
of these areas' features.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.230
Two years later we have the
Lewis and Clark expedition.

01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:13.670
This is November 7, 1805.

01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:15.450
Well, we'll go three years later.

01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:16.750
"Ocian in view!

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:18.050
O! the joy."

01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:22.090 position:56%
"Great joy in camp we are in view of
the Ocian, this great Pacific Octean

01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:24.150
which we been So long
anxious to See."

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:26.890
That was William Clark, all right.

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:31.320
In one sentence he
basically gave the reasons

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.510
for the Board on Geographic Names.

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:36.930
[ Laughter ]

01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:43.050
Actually the -- and with that
I'd say that -- two things here.

01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:48.280
He finally found the -- he
completed the connection

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.240
between the Atlantic
and the Pacific.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.840
For the first time the true
nature of our continent

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.140
and nation was understood.

01:31:55.140 --> 01:32:00.430 position:56%
There was still a lot of exploration
had to go on, but William Clark

01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:03.930 position:56%
and Meriwether Lewis were the first.

01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:11.340
Okay. In my opinion, and once again
I'm starting from a view that --

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.720
I sort of came into this cold.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.170 position:56%
The history I really wasn't aware of
so I sort of just did my own thing

01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:20.230
in thinking about how
I would approach this.

01:32:20.230 --> 01:32:25.190
What I discovered was that the
Post Office was probably the first

01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:28.670
government department that
was really truly concerned

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:30.790
with orthography of place names.

01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:35.030
They published lists of post
offices of the United States,

01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:39.220
the names of postmasters, the
counties and states, et cetera.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:45.440
Okay. So this is an example page on
your right as you're looking at it.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.580
They also published as
well as these listings --

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.250
well, backing up a little bit.

01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:57.390
The post offices grew from
75 in 1789 to 7,003 in 1827;

01:32:57.390 --> 01:33:04.810
18,417 by 1850; and 62,000 by 1890.

01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:07.810
Besides naming new post offices,
many were either stricken

01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:10.010
from the listing over
time or renamed.

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:13.830
The Post Office kept track of
all these changes through time.

01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:18.680
The early 1900s, I read one article
that stated that there were 30

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:23.220
or 40 new names of post offices
per day that were being brought

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:28.600
to the -- well, it was necessary
the Post Office to keep track.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.090
They also had a cartography
department.

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:37.170
This is the legend of the first
United States Post Route Map, 1796.

01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:39.170
Abraham Bradley, Junior.

01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:42.300
I didn't look into his history.

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.780
That should be fairly
interesting in itself.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:50.260
This is what the map looked
like, and looking at a blow-up,

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:56.350
this is the Washington to,
let's see, Washington area

01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:58.290
up the Philadelphia Corridor.

01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:03.290 position:56%
You can see place names, you can see
mileage between various post offices

01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:05.630
on this and the routes
that were followed.

01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:08.460
The Post Office had
a great tradition.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.410
By the late 19th century they
were making beautiful maps

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:18.550
of other post routes of virtually
all United States states.

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:22.770
Okay. Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler
came to the United States in 1805.

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:26.000
First Superintendent of the
United States Coast Survey.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.720
The Coast Survey was among the
earliest mapping agencies concerned

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.020
with orthography.

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:36.740
This is a quote from Rear
Admiral Benjamin Franklin Sands,

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.320 position:56%
a naval officer who was assigned to
the Coast Survey in the 1830s/1840s.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.810
Actually worked with
Ferdinand Hassler.

01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:48.150
"He was quaint in his language,
particularly in his orthography,

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:53.940
cautioning his assistants always to
inquire closely into the derivation

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:57.690
and spelling of the names of
localities in our surveys.

01:34:57.690 --> 01:35:00.270
He would never accept the
spelling of 'Neversink,

01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:02.850
one of the prominent
points near Sandy Hook,

01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:06.580
but insisted upon 'Navesink'
as the correct orthography;

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.480
and upon every name put down by us

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.430
on the charts he would
make his comments."

01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:16.260
So here we have the first
chart of the New York Harbor.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.560
We see --

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.510
Well, somewhere here is Navesink.

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:24.120
Yeah, Navesink.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.600
Yeah, here we have Navesink
lights, and that's what it's been.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.100
Neversunk, Neversink,
Navesink, and so it is today.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.020
Both of those first
terms were actually --

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:38.350 position:56%
showed up on various nautical charts
through time, prior to the adoption

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.360
of Navesink as the
correct orthography.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.710
Alexander Callas Bache, for
those of you who wish to know.

01:35:44.710 --> 01:35:46.880
There was always a Bache
or a son of a Bache

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.570
in the Coast Survey [laughter].

01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:53.150
He was a great grandson
of Benjamin Franklin,

01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:55.750
second Superintendent
of the Coast Survey.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:58.700
He issued instructions
concerning the correct orthography

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.000
of place names.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.440
Also commissioned the first study

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.500
of Native American place
names that I'm aware of.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.620
There could be others
that occurred before that

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.820
but I'll stipulate that
this was the first.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:15.110
This is an 1853 chart of Neah
Harbor which is just east

01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:16.680
of Cape Flattery, Washington.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.050
A couple of things
you can see on it.

01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:22.270
There are a number of Indian place
names, Neah being one of them.

01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:25.350
Watta [assumed spelling], Island,
Battah [assumed spelling] Point.

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.460
Virtually all of these names
are still on the chart,

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:31.360
but we also see Anglo-English
terminology

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.080 position:56%
and we see the Spanish version of
the Greek pilot's name Juan de Fuca.

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:43.040
So the United States has always
had a mix of various languages,

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.420
the various explorers,
they're echoed

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.920
in the place names of our nation.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.280 position:56%
Eighteen-fifty-six Bache
commissioned this list of park bays,

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.220
harbors, and anchorages
of U.S. waters.

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:56.850
There were about 500 at the time.

01:36:56.850 --> 01:37:01.340
This was to establish the,
once again, correct orthography

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.760
to be used on the charts that
were produced by the Coast Survey.

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.710
The signature, A.P. Hill, a
future Confederate General.

01:37:08.710 --> 01:37:12.790 position:56%
The Coast Survey, prior to the Civil
War, had about 70 Army officers,

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:15.200
many generals that were
attached to the Survey,

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.640
and about 400 naval officers
of which about a hundred ended

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.370
up being admirals following
the Civil War.

01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:26.730
Once again, Native America names.

01:37:26.730 --> 01:37:30.310 position:56%
"The transliteration of Indian
names has everywhere been a fruitful

01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:32.430
source of differences in spelling,

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:36.560
inasmuch as no two persons
understand alike or render

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.830 position:56%
into the same English characters
the obscure sounds of Indian names."

01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:42.620
That was in the second
report of the Board

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:48.230
of Geographic Names,
published in 1899.

01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:50.030
Eighteen-sixty-eight annual report

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:51.600
of the Superintendent
of the Coast Survey.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.300
We have this letter from
the Reverend Edward Ballard.

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.200
"I have the honor to present
to you the following attempt

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.190
at an examination of the
geographical nomenclature

01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:03.380
of the coast of Maine, for the
purpose of furnishing a list

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:07.490
of the names of Indian origin,
with their proper orthography,

01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:11.610
as far as it now can be ascertained
and their interpretation."

01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:12.910
So this was a list.

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:15.720
It was probably about a
20/30 page listing that was

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.530
in the Annual Report of the
Coast Survey for that year.

01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:27.000
Eighteen-sixty-nine, following
the inspection trip to Alaska

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.700
by George Davison, a
Coast Surveyor in 1867.

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:34.040
He published the first
<i>Coast Pilot of Alaska."</i>

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.370
<i>Within that Coast Pilot </i>--

01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:38.260
oh, and I would like to
pay homage to Miss Kerfoot.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.710
She mentioned the list
that occurred, listed maps,

01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:43.730
and I guess I'm going
through a list here as well.

01:38:43.730 --> 01:38:45.030
But, anyway.

01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:48.120
Eighteen-sixty-nine.

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.390
There were hundreds of place names
of Indian, Anglo, Spanish, French,

01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:57.690
Russian names that were included
in that particular document.

01:38:57.690 --> 01:39:01.940
The commercial entities
also were interested

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:04.170
in orthography and place names.

01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:07.460
<i>Gazetteer of Railway Stations
in the United States and Dominion</i>

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:11.870
<i>of Canada 1874 </i>publication.

01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:15.930
If I remember correctly, there
were about 4000 place names

01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:19.160
that were included in
that particular document.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.700
So this brings us up to 1890.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:29.100
These two men, Thomas Mendenhall,
Superintendent of the Coast Survey,

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.190
or Coast and Geodetic
Survey as it was then known.

01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:35.050
Lieutenant Commander Richardson
Clover, he was the Superintendent

01:39:35.050 --> 01:39:38.530
of the Naval Hydrographic
Office and also the Naval --

01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:42.170
well, the Hydrographer of the Navy.

01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:44.330
They met in the first week of 1890

01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:47.070
to discuss problems
with Alaska place names.

01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:48.800
Mendenhall expanded the concept

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.920
to include all government
agencies concerned

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.970
with nationwide orthography.

01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:55.470
He wrote to other agencies
suggesting formation

01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:57.840
of a board to discuss names issues.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.490
An informal board was formed
that brought the names issues

01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:03.860
to the attention of
President Harrison.

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.260
He concurred and issued an
Executive Order dated September 4,

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:11.190
1890 that stated, "As it is
desirable that uniform usage

01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:13.080 position:56%
in regard to geographic nomenclature

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.370
and orthography obtain throughout
the Executive Departments

01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:19.720
of the Government, and particularly
upon the maps and charts issued

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.780
by the various Departments
and Bureaus,

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.820
I hereby constitute a
Board on Geographic Names."

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.460
That Board was composed of
Mendenhall as the first Chairman,

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.570
Herbert Gouverneur Ogden,
Henry -- of the Coast Survey,

01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:36.570
also a Vice President of the
National Geographic Society,

01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.370
Henry Gannett, Chief
Geographer of the USGS,

01:40:39.370 --> 01:40:41.970
Secretary of the National
Geographic Society,

01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:46.040
and Lieutenant Richardson
Clover, Hydrographer of the Navy.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.730
This comprised the
Executive Committee.

01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:50.840
It prepared the material for
the full Board to review.

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.720
The remainder of the Board was
comprised of Otis T. Masson,

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.740
a Smithsonian Ethnologist, Captain
H. L. Howison, United States Navy,

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:02.500
of the Lighthouse Board, Andrew
H. Allen of the State Department,

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:08.300
Marcus Baker of the USGS and a
National Geographic Society Manger,

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.000
Pierson Bristow of
the Post Office --

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.620
couldn't find a picture
of him [laughter].

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.010
Sorry. That is his grave.

01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:16.850
He's there.

01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:21.590
Okay. Major Thomas Turtle,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:24.800
Okay. I'd like to return
to this thought.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.660
"After the American Civil War
there was a surge of mapping

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:30.880
and scientific reporting associated
with the exploration, mining,

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.110
and settlement of the
western territories.

01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:36.010 position:56%
Inconsistencies and
contradictions among the many names,

01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:38.500 position:56%
their spellings, and
applications," et cetera, et cetera.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:41.860
Very similar to the wording of the
brochure that was at the beginning.

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:47.780
Now I went through the first
4000 names that were decided upon

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.610
by the Board of Geographic
Names and attempted --

01:41:50.610 --> 01:41:56.960
well, in my way, analyzed them to
check whether or not that was a --

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.990
if that statement or some other
statement would better describe the

01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:02.370
work of the Board.

01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:04.960
It would seem that if the
above statement is correct,

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.780
that was related to
the western states,

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:11.360
decisions concerning western states
place names, particularly those

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.160
of the [inaudible] west should
dominate the early activities

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.480
of the BGN.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:19.370
Alaska also, because of the
initial meeting between Mendenhall

01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:22.390
and Clover, has also been
invoked as a prime mover

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:25.440
for the formation of the BGN.

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.740
Okay. So here's the --

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:30.800
here's Bulletin Number One,
1890, December 31, 1890.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.460
Alaska, 155 decisions.

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:36.380
That sure looks like Alaska's
driving the whole thing

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.510
at that point in time.

01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:41.390
Next closest state, Maine, with 15.

01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:43.130
But then we look at
the [inaudible] west.

01:42:43.130 --> 01:42:46.050
We have Arizona, New
Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Idaho,

01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:49.470
Montana, and Wyoming, zero.

01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:53.640
I skip ahead 10 years here
because a nice convenient number,

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:57.070
more than anything else, and I
figured 10 years we'd be able

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.990
to see the priorities of the Board

01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:03.730
and to some degree also what really
led to the formation of the Board.

01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:07.670
So, the Second Report
was published in 1899.

01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:12.290 position:56%
Now, looking at generic terms within
the Board, Civil Terms like towns,

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:16.210
cities, even railroad
stations, post offices.

01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:19.330
There were 2132 decisions.

01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:21.830
Nautical Terms, and by that
the sort of thing you'd see

01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:24.720
on nautical charts, 1,496.

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.090
Terrestrial Physiographic
Terms, 172.

01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:34.220
Post Office, 1045 decisions
in that first 10 years.

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.660
Townships, 436.

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.200
Islands, 358.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.430
Railroad Stations, 330.

01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:42.390
Then we start dropping
down significantly,

01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:46.190
but these were the generic
features with over 100 occurrences

01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:48.260
in that particular document.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.270
There were over 40
additional generic terms found

01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:53.490
in the first 10 years of decisions,

01:43:53.490 --> 01:43:56.050
most of which are nautical
in nature.

01:43:56.050 --> 01:44:00.710
Regional Decisions
by BGN 1890 to 1899.

01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:04.920
Decisions east of the
Mississippi River, 2319;

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:10.910
west of the Mississippi,
1297; foreign, 503.

01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:15.710
Highest number of names decisions
per state in the first 10 years

01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:18.190
of the BGN, and this was

01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:20.690
like approximately
one-third of the decisions.

01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:25.510
New York came in first,
258; Alaska, 228.

01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:29.390
Keep in mind that the
first bulletin had 155,

01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:33.000
so there were 73 additional
decisions in the next 10 years.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.490
Then Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, California.

01:44:36.490 --> 01:44:38.550
We get a western state,
a coastal state

01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:41.050
that had been a state since 1850.

01:44:41.050 --> 01:44:43.090
Then New Jersey.

01:44:43.090 --> 01:44:44.500
That's the middle third.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:49.080
Just significantly there is no
[inaudible] state in that group.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.820
Then when we go to the bottom
24 states and territories,

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:56.060
I have a total of 593 decisions.

01:44:56.060 --> 01:45:01.920 position:56%
New Mexico anchors the mass at three
decisions; Nevada, seven; Arizona,

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.620
eight; Idaho, nine;
et cetera, et cetera.

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:08.040
Now if we put this into map form,

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.270
initially we see the cumulative
blue states or the top third

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:13.790
of names decisions
during that period.

01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:17.130
We have the Eastern states.

01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:19.140
California is a coastal
Western state,

01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:23.890
and Alaska were the top
third of the decisions.

01:45:23.890 --> 01:45:27.750
The red states were
actually the bottom bunch

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:30.540
that were mentioned,
the 24 bottom states.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:33.820
White states being sort
of the middle of the road.

01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.470
We put that into a cartogram.

01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:39.940
This is the relative size of an
area or relative size as a function

01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:43.460
of the area of the state
and the number of names.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.240
Now the East Coast dominates.

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.240
California shows up
and Alaska shows up.

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.000
The West is disappearing.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:57.410
Looking at it a different way,
seeing if maybe it would come

01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:00.790 position:56%
out a little different which, I
guess, rationally it shouldn't have,

01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:04.290
but names decisions per
thousand square miles per state.

01:46:04.290 --> 01:46:10.200
This is a statistic I made up, a
measure of BGN decision intensity

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:16.940
on the [laughter] -- well,
what else would you call it?

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.240
I don't know.

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.890
But anyway, with that, Washington,
D.C. only having 68 square miles

01:46:22.890 --> 01:46:27.930
and eight decisions sort of wiped
out the statistical package,

01:46:27.930 --> 01:46:32.320
but the rest, the next nine,
Massachusetts, New Jersey,

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:35.560 position:56%
Rhode Island, Maryland, Connecticut,
Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania,

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.450
Virginia, all Eastern states.

01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:42.820
Then we look at the 10
lowest intensity states --

01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:47.160
Montana, South Dakota, Utah,
Wyoming, Texas, North Dakota,

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:51.080
Nevada, Idaho, Arizona,
and New Mexico.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.290
Then we look at that map form.

01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:57.610
First of all, the red being the
lowest, blue being the highest,

01:46:57.610 --> 01:47:00.420
once again dominated by the East.

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:05.790
Here we have a cartogram that
the West totally disappears.

01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:07.090
I can't resist this.

01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:10.230
Texas has decision names envy.

01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:13.340
Okay, never mind [laughter].

01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:14.760
New Mexico disappeared.

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.310
Idaho virtually disappears.

01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:22.090
The rest are pretty hard to
find, at least by the algorhythm

01:47:22.090 --> 01:47:25.090
that was used to develop this map.

01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:26.820
So, let's look at Alaska.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.560
That's also been invoked.

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:34.270
Beginning in 1869 with the
George Davidson Coast Pilot.

01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:36.390
That was followed by
William Healy Dall.

01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:39.400
All of these had hundreds
if not thousands of --

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:43.020
at least a couple of thousand
names associated with them.

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:47.430
William Healy Dall, also of the
Coast Survey, Pacific Coast Pilot,

01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:51.010
Coast and Islands of Alaska, 1879.

01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:52.770
Go to Marcus Baker.

01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:57.020 position:56%
He was Dall's assistant on the Coast
Survey before going to the USGS

01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:59.810
as did Dall in the 1880s.

01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:01.450
Then Herbert Gouverneur Ogden.

01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:06.960
He worked on Alaska for
the BGN, 1890 to '93.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.570
So Alaska and the BGN.

01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:11.560
Two or three hundred
Alaska names presented

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.710
to the Board early-on
for consideration.

01:48:13.710 --> 01:48:18.340
First Bulletin of the BGN
reported 155 Alaska decisions

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:23.240
and 241 Alaska names superseded,
the majority of which were coastal.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.900
The magnitude of Alaska names
decisions issues became apparent,

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.280
so the Board appointed
Marcus Baker of the USGS,

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.780
and Herbert Gouverneur Ogden
of the CNGS as a committee

01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:34.780
to research Alaska names.

01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:40.890
By 1893 Ogden had compiled 2400
names in Southeast Alaska; Baker,

01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:43.420
1900 names for the rest of Alaska.

01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:47.640
Work stopped for eight years
after that time on Alaska.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:50.380
Thence the first great
territorial compilation

01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.680
of names was published by the BGN.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:57.150 position:56%
A year later, the Alaska compilation
was published by the USGS.

01:48:57.150 --> 01:49:01.760
That first great compilation by
the BGN was the geographic names

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.670
of the Philippine Islands.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:05.890
So, ask how that happened.

01:49:05.890 --> 01:49:07.710
Okay. That was brought forward

01:49:07.710 --> 01:49:13.640
by the Naval Hydrographic
Office, published 1900 or 1901.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:19.360 position:56%
I can't read this right now -- 1901.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.600
That was based on the atlas
of the Philippine Islands

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:26.090 position:56%
which was produced by the Coast
Survey, and that was based, in turn,

01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:31.860
on the work of Father Jose
Algue of the Manila Observatory.

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:35.840
So, next year, 1902, Marcus
Baker's <i>Geographic Dictionary</i>

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.890
<i>of Alaska </i>was published.

01:49:38.890 --> 01:49:40.230
How does this compare

01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:44.380
to USGS efforts concerning place
names during the formative years

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:46.790
of the BGN?

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:49.450
Well, Henry Gannett,
the Chief Geographer

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:53.320
of the USGS published the
following Geographic Dictionaries

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.530
between 1894 and 1906.

01:49:56.530 --> 01:50:00.040
Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Connecticut.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.150
We get to Kansas in 1898.

01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:04.260
Then after the first 10 years,

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:09.310
Utah is the first [inaudible]
state, 1900.

01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:13.560
We go Puerto Rico, Texas,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:19.790
Okay. My conclusions that may not
be somebody else's conclusions,

01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:23.760 position:56%
are an analysis of the work
accomplished in the BGN early years.

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.020
Number One, numerous governmental
organizations had been wrestling

01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:31.200
with problems of orthography
for many years prior

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.360
to formulation of the BGN.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.010
Two, although the Alaska
meeting of Mendenhall

01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:39.970
and Clover was the catalyst
for the formation of the BGN,

01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:42.850
they recognized that it, a BGN,

01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:47.380
was an idea whose time had
been a long time coming.

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:50.750
As opposed to names issues with
frontier areas, both the BGN

01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:52.760
and its member organizations,

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:56.650 position:56%
including the USGS were more
concerned with the highly developed,

01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:59.990
more heavily populated
eastern states.

01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:03.370
Four. Needs of communication,
transportation,

01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:06.270
and commerce followed
by diplomacy, defense,

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:10.820
and exploration were the driving
forces dictating the formation

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.700
of the work of the BGN.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.800
A final thought.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.350
In 1816, Ferdinand Hassler,
Founder and first Superintendent

01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:23.080
of the United States Coast Survey,
wrote, "The duty of every man is

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.960
to be honest and to do good."

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.000
The United States Board

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.570
on Geographic Names embodies
that spirit and concept.

01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:32.940
Its work is one of the
invisible underpinnings

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.500
of our civilization and society.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.410
Its work has truly done good,
in the best sense of the word,

01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:41.680
for our nation and citizens.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.480
Thank you.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:56.860
[ Applause ]

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Skip.

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:01.300
Do we have any questions?

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.600
Yeah.

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:03.900
&gt;&gt; Albert E. Theberge: Yes, sir.

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:05.200
&gt;&gt; Please stand and -- oh.

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.500
&gt;&gt; Loved your presentation.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.520
I have a comment on the -- I'm
a student of Alaska history.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:14.110
I would suggest that the discovery
of gold in Juneau in 1880,

01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:19.850
and the subsequent discovery
of gold in the Klondike

01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:25.850
in 1896 might have had a huge
influence, because of the number

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:30.140
of ships that were taking
people to Southeast Alaska.

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.440
&gt;&gt; Albert E. Theberge: Yeah.

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.670
I would concur with that,
particularly the 1896 and the --

01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:40.110
I guess the -- that was we're
going to the Klondike and --

01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:45.410
Marcus Baker in his introduction
to the <i>Geographic Dictionary</i>

01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:49.090
<i>of Alaska </i>, he made the statement
that the Director of the USGS came

01:52:49.090 --> 01:52:54.540
to him at the time and said we need
to get the <i>Alaska Dictionary </i>going

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:57.850
because we need this for
our work now at this time.

01:52:57.850 --> 01:52:59.150
It had been put on the back burner

01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:04.200
for a bit following the initial
meetings of the USBGN but because

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.750
of the gold rush and
the influx of people,

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:09.780
I'm sure that was the
driving force, ultimately,

01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:13.130
behind finishing the <i>Dictionary
of Alaska Place Names </i>.

01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:18.700
Don Orth may have a
different view on that, maybe.

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:20.330
Okay. You're good with it.

01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:23.850
Okay. Any further questions?

01:53:23.850 --> 01:53:25.370
Okay. Thank you.

01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:27.580
[ Applause ]

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:28.880
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Okay.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.180
Our next speaker.

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:33.250
We're very fortunate to have Miss
Sandra Shaw here with us today.

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:36.200
She worked at the CIA and
the Department of State,

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:40.240
and was the first woman
to chair the BGN.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:43.430
Among the assignments during her
distinguished 31-year Federal

01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:46.210
career, she served in
the Department of State

01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:48.800
as the Deputy Executive
Director of the Bureau

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.420
of Intelligence and Research.

01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.560
She was also the Chief of
Cartography in the Office

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.480
of the Geographer where she
oversaw cartographic support

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:02.280
for key diplomatic initiatives.

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.550 position:56%
Given her experience with all facets

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:08.190
of the BGN she is exceptionally
well-qualified

01:54:08.190 --> 01:54:12.540
to help us better understand
how the Board has evolved.

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.340
Sandra.

01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:24.070
[ Applause ]

01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:26.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandra Shaw: Thank you very much.

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:29.870
I'd like to thank the U.S. Board in
Geographic Names and its Chairman,

01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:32.790
Douglas Caldwell, for inviting
me to participate today

01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:36.820 position:56%
in this 125th anniversary symposium.

01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:40.240
It's an honor and a pleasure
to be here, to be re-acquainted

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.800
with former BGN colleagues,
and to meet current members

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.580
and the many distinguished
participants and guest

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.520 position:56%
who have gathered today to recognize

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.370
and honor the extraordinary
work of the BGN.

01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:55.630
Captain Theberge has presented you
with a fascinating introduction

01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:56.930
to the origins of the BGN.

01:54:56.930 --> 01:55:01.260
Its evolution's been a
journey down a long, winding,

01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:06.950
and sometimes weary road from its
creation in 1890 to its expansion

01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:13.120 position:56%
of authority in 1906, its
abolishment as an independent agency

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:19.670
in 1934, the granting of its
statuatory authority in 1947,

01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:22.550
and the eventual transfer
of the domestic names

01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:25.090
to the Geological Survey,

01:55:25.090 --> 01:55:27.910
and the foreign names
to the Army Map Service.

01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:32.930
The BGN has endured the 125-year
journey through the dedication

01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:35.210
and innovation of its
members in support

01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:37.770
of their respective organizations.

01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:41.200
Sixteen years after
its establishment,

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.480
President Theodore Roosevelt issued
an Executive Order which added

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:50.290 position:56%
to the BGN "the duty of determining,
changing, and fixing place names

01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:53.950
within the United States
and insular possessions.

01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:57.350
All names suggested for
any place by any officer

01:55:57.350 --> 01:56:01.850
of the government shall be referred
to the Board for consideration

01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:05.530
and approval before publication."

01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:10.960
A second Order was issued in August
10th changing the official title

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.740
of the United States
Board in Geographic Names

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:16.860
to the United States
Geographic Board,

01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:20.440
and granting it advisory powers
concerning the preparation

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.730
of maps compiled in the government
to avoid unnecessary duplication

01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:30.440
of work and to unify and
improve map scales and symbols.

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.140
The Board would only
hold the advisory powers

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:37.300
for 13 years before they
were transferred in 1919

01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:41.260
to the newly established
Board of Surveys and Maps.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.280
The new authorities
presented the Geographic Board

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:47.350
with a formidable task.

01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:51.340
With only 13 Board Members, most
of whom held senior positions

01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:55.190
in their respective
departments, no staff support,

01:56:55.190 --> 01:57:00.170
and an edict that the Board and
its work would entail no expense

01:57:00.170 --> 01:57:02.470
on the government [laughter].

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.630
Lack of staff and funding would
persist throughout the history

01:57:07.630 --> 01:57:13.360
of the BGN, even after it gained
statuatory authority in 1947.

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.010
In my discussion of
this period of 1906

01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:19.890
through 1934 the Geographic
Board will simply be referred

01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:21.190
to as the Board.

01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:25.800
The records did not reveal why

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:28.370
or by whom these new
authorities were proposed,

01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:31.500
but it seems reasonable that
the Board itself sought broader

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:36.350
authority to maintain uniform
usage of names in the government.

01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:40.700 position:56%
Additionally, many Board Members
were involved in mapping activities,

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:44.500
including its Chairman, Henry
Gannett, Chief Geographer

01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:48.420
of the Geological Survey, who is
often considered to be the father

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:51.600
of topographic mapping
in the United States.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:56.760
Henry Gannett chaired the
Board until his death in 1914.

01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.620
On his deathbed, he was informed

01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:02.930 position:56%
that he had again been elected
Chairman, and he replied [laughter],

01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:08.660
"You were determined I shall
die in the harness, and I will."

01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:13.280
The last of the original
BGN members,

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.380
Mr. Gannett was also a founder of
the National Geographic Society

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:22.610
and concurrently served as its
President from 1910 to 1914.

01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:24.140
You'll hear more about the BGN

01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:27.920
and the National Geographic
this afternoon from Mr. Valdez.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:32.000
Following the 1906 actions,
the Board moved quickly

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.090 position:56%
to develop principles for new names.

01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:37.870
It streamlined the
names approval process

01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:41.900
and addressed the advisory
powers, establishing a committee

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.700
to standardize map symbols.

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:50.020
By 1911, the Board published
conventional signs adopted

01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:54.360
by the United States Geographic
Board that provided a standard set

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.440
of signs, symbols, and
abbreviations for use

01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:00.410
on all government maps and charts.

01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:04.390 position:56%
The work of the Board was primarily
conducted by the Executive Committee

01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:06.740
with their recommendation
of names decisions sent

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.260
to the full Board before
promulgation.

01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:12.870 position:56%
However, to expedite the new duties,

01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:21.210
the Executive Committee's
authority was expanded to approve

01:59:21.210 --> 01:59:25.310 position:56%
or reject all new names submitted by
the Geological Survey and the Coast

01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:29.810
and Geodetic Survey without
waiting for Board approval.

01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:32.110
The Chairman was to act
on behalf of the Board

01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:35.700
in all names submitted
by the Post Office.

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:39.080
Postal names had been confusing
and an issue from early

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.700
in the Board's history,
with many instances

01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:45.000
of the Post Office and
town name differing.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.780
There was a new urgency in the
approval process since between 30

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:54.920
and 40 postal names
were established daily.

01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:00.450
Between 1906 and 1934, the
U.S. would enter World War I

02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:02.280
and suffer the Great Depression.

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:07.220 position:56%
But through these events the Board
made progress, no matter how slowly.

02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:11.660
World War I, unlike World War II,
did not require mass production

02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:17.110
of foreign names and had minimal
effect on the work of the Board.

02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:19.430
If anything, it slowed
the work since many

02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:22.760
of the members were
away at war duty.

02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:25.150 position:56%
This was a period of Board outreach.

02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:28.980
It established an Advisory
Board of outside specialists,

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:32.150
enlisted the assistance of
state names authorities,

02:00:32.150 --> 02:00:36.760 position:56%
and encouraged establishment of
such authorities where none existed.

02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:39.730
It strengthened and developed
international collaborative efforts

02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:42.790
with names authorities such as
the Geographic Board of Canada,

02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:46.400
the Royal Geographical Society,
and the Permanent Committee

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.890
on Geographic Names for
Official British Use,

02:00:49.890 --> 02:00:55.800
and also increased the focus
on foreign geographic names.

02:00:57.250 --> 02:01:00.150
Also, after 30 years of
requests for funding,

02:01:00.150 --> 02:01:05.520
the Board received its first direct
appropriations from Congress.

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:10.100
Starting in 1920 and continuing
until it was abolished in 1934

02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:14.680
as an independent board,
it received about $79,000

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.860
in direct appropriations.

02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:22.600
That would approximate about
1.2 million in 2015 dollars.

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:27.690
The funding peaked in 1934
which reflected the salaries

02:01:27.690 --> 02:01:31.330
of the Chairman, the
Secretary, and Assistant Clerk,

02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:36.130
all devoting full time
to the work of the Board.

02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:40.370
Another Board first would come
in 1925 when the first woman,

02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:43.440
Dr. Helen Strong, was
appointed to the Board

02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.030
by the Department of Commerce.

02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:47.950
She had prepared a
Congressional study

02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:51.540
on U.S. foreign agricultural trade
that garnered her the position

02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:56.450
of Geographer of the Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce.

02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:59.860
During her nine-year tenure on the
Board she would be instrumental

02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:04.080
in the Board's work on
foreign geographic names.

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:11.020
Dr. Strong is seated in the lower
right of the 1932 Board photo.

02:02:12.130 --> 02:02:15.620
Since World War I there had been
a growing need for decisions

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.680
on foreign names within
the government,

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.410
as well as the private sector.

02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:24.850
In 1926, Board Chairman, Frank
Bond, appointed a committee

02:02:24.850 --> 02:02:28.490
to consider the entire
subject of foreign names.

02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:32.060
The final work of the Committee,
composed of Dr. Samuel Boggs

02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:37.730
of the State Department and Dr.
Helen Strong, was published in 1932

02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:42.090
as the Board's "First Report
on Foreign Geographic Names."

02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:47.730 position:56%
It was a tutorial on the treatment
of foreign names addressing policies

02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:52.240
and procedures, guides for
transliteration, pronunciation,

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.260
abbreviation, and even gave tips
on proper business protocol,

02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:02.440
as well as a list of 2500
foreign names decisions.

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:06.000
The report gained press
coverage, even a quarter column

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.900
in the <i>New York Times</i>
titled, "Foreign Place Names."

02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:13.350
The reporter observed, "One of
the evidences that we've come

02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:17.430
into a consolidated world is a
United States Government report

02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:20.950
about the spelling of
foreign geographic names.

02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:24.030
If only there had been
added another hundred pages

02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:29.270
by some Homeric Earth wanderer who
had seen the cities of many men

02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:34.540
and learned their manners, it might
easily be the book of the month."

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:37.640 position:56%
Though the report was well-received,

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.450
the Board conducted practically
no other work on foreign names

02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:44.740
until it was faced with
the monumental task

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:49.550
of standardizing millions of
names in support of World War II.

02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:55.800
I call 1934 "The Board's Waterloo."

02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:01.260 position:56%
April 17th, Franklin Roosevelt
signed an Executive Order abolishing

02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:05.060
the United States Geographic
Board and transferring all

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:09.340
of its functions to the
Department of Interior.

02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:12.250
The Executive Order attributes
the President's actions

02:04:12.250 --> 02:04:17.270
to the 1933 Reorganization Act, but
there also seems to be a back story

02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:19.480
to the President's actions.

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.480
It involves his Secretary
of Interior,

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.390
Harold Ickes, and Hoover Dam.

02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:31.850
At inception, the Dam Project
was simply known as Boulder Dam.

02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:35.040
But at the ceremony to start
the project Hoover's Secretary

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:39.070
of Interior, Ray Lyman Wilbur,
announced, "I have the honor

02:04:39.070 --> 02:04:42.550
and privilege of giving a
name to this new structure.

02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:45.670
It shall be called Hoover Dam."

02:04:45.670 --> 02:04:51.030
When Roosevelt took office in
1933, his Secretary of Interior,

02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:55.510
Harold Ickes, changed the name to
Boulder Dam, justifying his action

02:04:55.510 --> 02:05:01.020
by saying, "The men who pioneered
this project knew it by this name."

02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:04.420
Ickes' action was not without
critics, some writing directly

02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:08.400
to him and others to
the Geographic Board.

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.730
It seems Secretary
Ickes was not pleased

02:05:10.730 --> 02:05:12.490
that a Federal Authority existed

02:05:12.490 --> 02:05:14.480
that could overturn
his naming action,

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:20.220 position:56%
so in 1934 Ickes drafted the
Executive Order to abolish the Board

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.670
for Roosevelt's consideration.

02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:24.970
The Director of the Bureau

02:05:24.970 --> 02:05:28.250
of the Budget advised
Roosevelt against such action.

02:05:28.250 --> 02:05:31.630 position:56%
However, he did not heed his advice.

02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:36.410 position:56%
It created concern about many in the
government as well as in the private

02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:40.240
and scientific community,
including Dr. Isaiah Bowman,

02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:44.200
a member of President
Roosevelt's Science Advisory Board

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:48.100
and Former President of the
American Geographical Society.

02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:53.370 position:56%
He wrote to the Secretary indicating
he had read about the abolishment

02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:56.470
of the Board and hoped
that "If it is discontinued

02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:59.830
under its present name its
functions will be carried

02:05:59.830 --> 02:06:02.630
on as effectively as in the past.

02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:05.840
It is of great importance
from every standpoint

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.420
that such an organization
should exist in the government.

02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.280
Under no circumstances
should this work be assumed

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.710
by an outside agency.

02:06:14.710 --> 02:06:18.150
It would be a relatively simple
matter to set up an adequate Board

02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:20.560
in the Department of Interior."

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:26.800 position:56%
Bowman closed his letter by offering
his services to discuss such a plan.

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:30.500
Secretary Ickes actually may be
credited rather than vilified

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:34.670
for providing a home in which the
Board could more easily structure

02:06:34.670 --> 02:06:38.720
and ramp up its work to effectively
support the upcoming requirements

02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:40.880
of World War II.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.760
Also, if the Board had
maintained its independent status,

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.010
would Dr. Meredith Peat
Furrell [assumed spelling],

02:06:48.010 --> 02:06:52.280
a Geographer in the Department
of Interior, be in the history

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:55.960 position:56%
of the BGN or International
Standardization of Geographic Names?

02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.300
Following the transfer the
Secretary established the Division

02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:04.510
of Geographic Names and an Advisory
Committee on Geographic Names

02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:06.760
which has centrally
mirrored the membership

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:09.180
of the abolished Geographic Board,

02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:12.170
but also included individuals
representing a number

02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:14.950
of geographical societies.

02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:19.690
He appointed Walter Mendenhall,
Director of the Geological Survey

02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:23.370
and nephew of BGN Founder,
Thomas Mendenhall,

02:07:23.370 --> 02:07:26.750
as the Executive Officer
of the Division.

02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:29.150
Shortly afterward,
Mendenhall recommended

02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:32.670
that an authoritative name
for the two units was needed

02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:36.030
for publication of names decisions.

02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:38.450
At first, Secretary
Ickes was not receptive

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:43.690
to essentially reestablishing the
BGN, but reconsidered upon advice

02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:48.090
of Dr. Bowman, and issued a
departmental order explaining

02:07:48.090 --> 02:07:50.170
that for simplicity of reference,

02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:54.500
these two units together will be
designated United States Board

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.410
on Geographical Names.

02:07:57.410 --> 02:08:02.120 position:56%
At the first meeting of the Advisory
Committee, Secretary Ickes said he

02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:05.620
and the President were both
opposed to naming place

02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:10.630
after living persons, and that he
had more than once been shocked

02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:14.410
by the names selected for
some of our natural objects.

02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:17.070
Names of people that the
American people would

02:08:17.070 --> 02:08:22.060
like to forget have been affixed
to the objects that were inanimate

02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:24.260
and thus unable to
protest [laughter].

02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:29.080
"I hope that this Committee will
adopt a policy of not yielding

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.450
to political pressure in
such an important matter

02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:35.760
as the selection of a name."

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.250
Until World War II, the work
of the BGN was conducted

02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:40.550
by the Executive Committee

02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:44.210
and the full Board met
only about once a year.

02:08:44.210 --> 02:08:48.210
In 1941, the BGN broadened
its responsibilities

02:08:48.210 --> 02:08:51.050
to include the standardization
of traditionally

02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:55.210
or newly named undersea features,
which led to the establishment

02:08:55.210 --> 02:09:00.470
of the Advisory Committee in
Undersea Features in 1963.

02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:04.870
With 3- to 400 domestic names
decisions published yearly,

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:08.640
the BGN did practically
no work on foreign names.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.850
Upcoming American military

02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:15.120
and intelligence requirements
brought sweeping change to its work

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:20.740
and would be the coming of age of
BGN's foreign names activities.

02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.410
With the U.S. Declaration of
War, the BGN entered a new era

02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:28.360
of production that no
longer allowed the luxury

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:30.730
of approving individual names.

02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:34.720
For the first time, the Board
had ample staff and funds

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:40.530
to support its work, or at
least its work on foreign names.

02:09:40.530 --> 02:09:43.720
Through an agreement between the
Interior and the War Department,

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.540
approved by the President, the
War Department transferred funds

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:52.470
to reimburse Interior for the
BGN foreign names activities.

02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:59.670 position:56%
As you can see, the funding peaked
in 1944 which came to about $400,000

02:09:59.670 --> 02:10:02.740
that they were transferring
into Interior

02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:05.970
for the Board's work
on foreign names only.

02:10:07.410 --> 02:10:11.710
Secretary Ickes selected
Dr. Meredith Burrill,

02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:17.800
a Geographer serving as the
Chief of Analysts and Research

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.590
in the General Land Office, to lead
the reorganization of the Board.

02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:27.700
In a 1967 interview, Dr.
Burrill indicated that he was

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:30.600
about the only Geographer around,

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:32.990
"so the Secretary of
Interior picked me."

02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:39.320
By the end of 1943, the Division
had increased from a pre-war staff

02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:45.610 position:56%
of two to of about 180, which
included geographers, cartographers,

02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:50.130
linguists, historians,
librarians, and clerks.

02:10:50.130 --> 02:10:51.850
In the words of Dr. Burrill,

02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:55.080
"The task of making ready
these geographical tools

02:10:55.080 --> 02:11:00.830
of war was not unlike that faced
by the manufacturer of airplanes."

02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:04.470 position:56%
The goal that had to be attained
would have been considered fantastic

02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:07.310
before the war.

02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:11.050 position:56%
The name of the Division was changed
to the Division of Geography,

02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:12.620
and the work of the Division staff

02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:16.080
and Advisory Committee
was redefined.

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:18.960
To expedite work, the
Secretary delegated

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.790
to Dr. Burrill the authority

02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:25.960
to approve all domestic names
conforming to existing procedures,

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:29.760
and all foreign names
either derived by approved

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.410
or unapproved procedures.

02:11:32.410 --> 02:11:34.930
The Division took on
the responsibility

02:11:34.930 --> 02:11:38.120
of establishing major rules
and policies for the treatment

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.730
of both domestic and
foreign names, investigating

02:11:41.730 --> 02:11:44.470
and recommending action
on names issues,

02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:49.300
while the Advisory Committee simply
reviewed principles, policies,

02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:53.970
and name recommendations prior
to approval by the Secretary.

02:11:53.970 --> 02:11:58.990
A special Committee on
Antarctic names was established

02:11:58.990 --> 02:12:03.460
that also became the
Advisory Committee in 1947.

02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:07.860
The BGN became a clearing house
for names, producing indexes

02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:12.020
for European invasion maps,
gazetteers, and the transcription

02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:16.830
of some 3 million Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean names.

02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:23.810
This is an example of a
long-range air navigation chart

02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:27.730
which is a typical
product that was produced

02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:30.260
by the BGN during that period.

02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:35.260
The Army would submit a
blue-line proof of the map,

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:39.420
and the BGN would prepare what
they called a names overlay.

02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:43.090
All of these black areas are
names that they've gone in

02:12:43.090 --> 02:12:47.310
and applied by hand in ink.

02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:52.850 position:56%
Once they applied the names overlay,
they would return this to the Army

02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:56.110
for application and
final production.

02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:59.610
The war ended in 1945,

02:12:59.610 --> 02:13:03.060
but standardizing foreign
names was only beginning.

02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.700
The BGN would continue work

02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:08.500
on a reimbursable basis
producing gazetteers

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:10.730
and other names requirements
for the military

02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:15.270
and intelligence programs
for years to come.

02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:18.870
However, Cold War funding
for foreign names that ranged

02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:24.620
from about 200,000 in
1946 to a high of 580,000

02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:29.000
in 1965 became a two-edge
sword for the BGN.

02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.500
In 1945 the Chairman of the House
Committee on Appropriations stated

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:41.260
that all agencies of the
government that lacked authority

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:45.810
for lawful appropriations
must seek legislation.

02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:48.670
The BGN took action and on July 25,

02:13:48.670 --> 02:13:54.440
1947 President Harry Truman signed
a bill establishing the U.S. Board

02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:57.000
on Geographic Names.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.670
Conjointly with the Secretary of
Interior, the BGN would "provide

02:14:00.670 --> 02:14:03.650
for uniformity and
geographic nomenclature

02:14:03.650 --> 02:14:06.590
and orthography throughout
the Federal Government"

02:14:06.590 --> 02:14:10.280
and would be authorized to
be appropriated such funds

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:15.750
as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes of this Act.

02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:19.610
Additionally, the Act authorized
the Secretary to take action

02:14:19.610 --> 02:14:25.790 position:56%
in any matter wherein the Board does
not act within a reasonable time.

02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:29.590
This has been mentioned before,
but we saw earlier in August

02:14:29.590 --> 02:14:35.520
or late August that the
Secretary exercised that authority

02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.800
when she changed the name
from Mount McKinley to Denali.

02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.040
In my opinion, I think this
is the only time a Secretary

02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:49.690
of Interior has exercised
this authority.

02:14:49.690 --> 02:14:54.610
The BGN's first meeting under
statuatory authority was spent

02:14:54.610 --> 02:14:58.870
on organizational matters including
the establishment of committees,

02:14:58.870 --> 02:15:02.410
election of officers, and the
appointment of Dr. Burrill

02:15:02.410 --> 02:15:06.290
as the BGN Executive Secretary.

02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:10.020
However, gaining statuatory
authority did not have the results

02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.170
the BGN sought.

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:15.850
Between 1947 and 1950,
the Division continued

02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:18.700
to receive small direct
appropriations for the work

02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:22.550
of the BGN, but efforts
to seek additional funds

02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:25.540
for domestic names
activities was hindered

02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:30.280
by the large sums available
for foreign names.

02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:34.660
In the early 1950s, concern grew
among the Domestic Names Committee

02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:39.600
members over the lack of adequate
funds to address its backlog.

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:44.170
Some agencies no longer submitted
cases for staff processing.

02:15:44.170 --> 02:15:48.860
Several Interior management
reports published between 1952

02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:55.170
and 1955 indicated that the work
of the domestic names was in chaos

02:15:55.170 --> 02:15:58.800
because no funds were
available for needed work.

02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.540
The reports recommended options

02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:03.070
such as transferring the
domestic names activities

02:16:03.070 --> 02:16:07.910 position:56%
to the Geological Survey,
divesting the Department of the work

02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:10.490
on foreign gazetteers,

02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:14.580
and transferring the
foreign names functions

02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:18.490
to another appropriate agency.

02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:23.020
No action was taken until 1958
when the domestic names activities,

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:26.210
including several staff
members, were transferred

02:16:26.210 --> 02:16:30.160
to the Geological Survey,
and an Executive Secretary

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.760
for Domestic Names,
Jerome Kilmartin,

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:36.630
was appointed by the
Survey to head the program.

02:16:36.630 --> 02:16:42.560
Dr. Burrill remained the Secretary
for Foreign Names and the BGN.

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:45.780
It took until 1962 for
the domestic names staff

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:49.980
to clear the decisions
of its backlog.

02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:54.640
In 1959, Donald Orth joined
the Domestic Names staff.

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.490 position:56%
He was appointed the Executive
Secretary for Domestic Names in 1963

02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:03.510
and was a formidable leader of
the program, expanding its work

02:17:03.510 --> 02:17:08.740
and guiding it into the digital
age until his retirement in 1991.

02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.310
Roger Payne succeeded him

02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:14.180
as the Executive Secretary
for Domestic Names.

02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:18.530
Another 10 years elapsed before the
Foreign Names staff functions were

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:21.030
transferred from Interior
to the Department

02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:23.630
of Defense Army Map Service.

02:17:23.630 --> 02:17:26.690
During that period, the BGN
became actively involved

02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:29.700
in international standardization
efforts.

02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:32.450 position:56%
In 1956, at the request of the U.N.,

02:17:32.450 --> 02:17:36.790
Dr. Burrill drafted a proposed
program addressing international

02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:39.690 position:56%
standardization of geographic names.

02:17:39.690 --> 02:17:43.000
His work was instrumental
in the U.N.'s development

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.530
of its current program and he
continued to play a role even

02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:50.940
after his retirement in 1973.

02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.920
Upon his retirement, Dr.
Richard Randall was appointed

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.200
as the Executive Secretary
for Foreign Names and the BGN.

02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.080
He was the steward of foreign names
and an admirable leader of the work

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:05.730
of the BGN for the next 20 years.

02:18:05.730 --> 02:18:09.350
With the transfer of the
Foreign Names activities in 1968,

02:18:09.350 --> 02:18:13.000
the foundation for the
modern day BGN had been laid.

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.940
The evolution of the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names has progressed

02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:24.390 position:56%
from Theodore Roosevelt's Geographic
Board through increased interaction

02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:27.060
with state and international
naming authorities

02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:30.220
to massive support of
World War II efforts.

02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:33.940
It's been established,
reorganized, abolished,

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:36.760
absorbed, and reestablished.

02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:39.090
Its focus has changed
from dealing only

02:18:39.090 --> 02:18:41.940
with unsettled questions
concerning geographic names

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:44.920
to rendering thousands of decisions

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:47.690
that span the Earth,
Sea, and Antarctic.

02:18:47.690 --> 02:18:54.170
It now deals with 50 states, 195
countries, and dozens of languages.

02:18:54.170 --> 02:18:57.550
The BGN has adapted to
vast technological changes

02:18:57.550 --> 02:19:00.430
with 2.7 million domestic names

02:19:00.430 --> 02:19:07.840 position:56%
and 9.8 million foreign names online
available at a few keystrokes.

02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.860
It has indeed been a
journey down a long, winding,

02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.410
and sometimes weary road.

02:19:13.410 --> 02:19:18.050
In closing, I congratulate the
U.S. Board in Geographic Name,

02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:21.050
its members and staff,
both past and present,

02:19:21.050 --> 02:19:25.090
on 125 years of providing
outstanding national

02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:28.240
and international leadership
and the standardization

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:30.290
of geographic nomenclature.

02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:32.090
Thank you.

02:19:32.090 --> 02:19:42.110
[ Applause ]

02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:43.410
It's gone now.

02:19:43.410 --> 02:19:44.710
&gt;&gt; Here we go.

02:19:44.710 --> 02:19:46.010
Dave.

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.310
&gt;&gt; Do we have any questions?

02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:52.650
It's been an interesting
history and thank you so much

02:19:52.650 --> 02:19:54.780
for sharing a long-time
[inaudible] but.

02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:56.080
Well, we do have a question.

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.380
Yes. Please stand.

02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:58.680
Thank you.

02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:05.510
&gt;&gt; With the recent surge for
deleting Denali and other --

02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:10.560
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:29.590 position:56%
-- do you see the movement where the
Board's facing the next 125 years

02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:34.330
of renaming what was named
in the past 125 as well

02:20:34.330 --> 02:20:36.380
as continuing on [inaudible]?

02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:37.680
&gt;&gt; Sandra Shaw: Well,
that's a good --

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.370
&gt;&gt; Repeat the question.

02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:45.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandra Shaw: She wanted to know
if the names that have been approved

02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:50.650
in the last 125 years,
if we're faced

02:20:50.650 --> 02:20:52.290
with renaming some of the names.

02:20:52.290 --> 02:20:53.590
Is that correct?

02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:54.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:20:54.890 --> 02:20:56.190
&gt;&gt; Sandra Shaw: Yes.

02:20:56.190 --> 02:20:57.490
Well, I think this question
was sort of asked earlier also.

02:20:57.490 --> 02:21:00.100
I'm not quite sure about
how many renamings.

02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:01.690
I think that with -- of course,

02:21:01.690 --> 02:21:05.920
on the foreign names side you
will always have issues that --

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:08.900
with countries changing of --
with the Soviet Union like right

02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:10.420
when it broke up, many
of the other countries

02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:15.020
that were becoming independent,
you would have naming changes.

02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:20.780
In many instances governments
themselves will change a name

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:26.540
and require, say, the Department
of State to use a name approved.

02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:32.430
Such one issue was with the
Ivory Coast many years ago.

02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:34.280
The Ivory Coast insisted

02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:37.400
for diplomatic purposes
we use Cote d'Ivoire,

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:40.260
the French form, which we did.

02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:43.170
However, we did approve
a conventional form

02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:46.150
for U.S. Government mapping.

02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:51.790
On the domestic name side,
it's a little more emotional.

02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:57.060
When I was Chair of the Board, it
was interesting because I worked

02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:01.690
on only foreign names and, of
course, we had always had issues

02:22:01.690 --> 02:22:05.390
with countries that wanted
us to do certain things.

02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:09.600
Usually, if we had established
diplomatic relations with them,

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.600
we would accept what
they wanted us to do.

02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:18.600
But at the encouragement
of Don Orth,

02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:22.900
he got me involved
in domestic names.

02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:27.520
I was not aware of the
emotions that were involved

02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:31.900
in naming domestic features.

02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:39.670
It's really a different issue
on both sides of the house.

02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:49.860
But I can't see us going in and
renaming masses of names that --

02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:53.020
that's all I can say
on that I guess.

02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:54.320
It's [laughter].

02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:55.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:57.570
Do we have any other questions?

02:22:57.570 --> 02:22:58.870
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Good.

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:01.910
At this time, what
we'd like to do is --

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:05.830
you've heard the names of
several people mentioned.

02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:10.250
These people -- the
Board is many things.

02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:13.830
It represents the Federal
Government.

02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:16.080
It represents different agencies.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:20.580
But it's really the people
behind it who make it work.

02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:24.540
Now I'd like to take a few
minutes to introduce you to some

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:31.250
of those people, particularly
our distinguished leaders.

02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:35.560
You've heard the name Don Orth
mentioned several times today.

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.780
Don, could you raise your hand?

02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:39.580
Okay.

02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:47.360
[ Applause ]

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:49.610
So Don has worked with
Geographic Names

02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:53.800
at the U.S. Geological
Survey starting in 1959,

02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:55.920
and he was the Executive Secretary

02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:01.830
for Domestic Names
from 1973 to 1990.

02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:08.440
The Executive Secretaries are
our senior staff positions.

02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:12.420 position:56%
He consolidated the working policies
of the Domestic Names Committee

02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:16.840
into the principles, policies,
and procedures that we use today.

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:19.320
He signed the Transboundary
Agreement with Canada,

02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:24.450
and he directed the production
of a number of gazetteers.

02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:29.730 position:56%
As if he wasn't busy enough, he also
authored a very interesting history

02:24:29.730 --> 02:24:31.830
of the BGN and its evolution,

02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:34.620
some of the things
that we've heard about.

02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:37.500
One of his best-known
publications, <i>The Dictionary</i>

02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:41.750
<i>of Alaska Place Names</i>
was published in 1971.

02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:46.700
It's known by many
people simply as "Orth."

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:52.110 position:56%
It has been referred to as the Bible
for Geographic Names in Alaska.

02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:57.650 position:56%
I have heard it said that there are
people in Alaska who have two books,

02:24:57.650 --> 02:25:00.160
the Bible and Orth [laughter].

02:25:03.310 --> 02:25:06.840
The next person I'd like to
acknowledge is Mr. Roger Payne.

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:08.640
Roger, could you stand up.

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:18.320
[ Applause ]

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.360
Roger worked at the
U.S. Geological Survey

02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:25.340
with Geographic Names
from 1974 to 2006.

02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:30.820 position:56%
He served as the Executive Secretary
for Domestic Names from 1990

02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:40.040 position:56%
to 2006, and the Executive Secretary
of the entire BGN from 1993 to 2006.

02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:44.890
As if Roger couldn't get enough,
he currently serves as Secretary

02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:48.020
for the Advisory Committee
on Undersea Feature Names,

02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:51.480
even though he's retired --
Antarctic names, sorry, sorry.

02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:53.080
Got that wrong.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.550
Roger -- sorry about that.

02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:57.690
Roger is the father of the
Geographic Names Information System

02:25:57.690 --> 02:26:03.600
or GNIS which led the BGN from the
age of print to its digital future.

02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:08.260
The GNIS remains today the
separate repository for information

02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:12.720
about approved domestic
and Antarctic names.

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.910
In addition, Roger's been a leader

02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:19.310
in the geographic names
community for many years.

02:26:19.310 --> 02:26:22.240
Among his positions, he
was formerly the President

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:26.130
of the American Names
Society, the Vice-Chairman

02:26:26.130 --> 02:26:30.540
of the Place Name Survey of the
United States, and the author

02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:33.610
of a section on applied
[inaudible] in the <i>History</i>

02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:37.080
<i>of Cartography, Volume Six </i>.

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:42.920
Okay. At this point, I'd like to
also acknowledge Mr. Randy Flynn

02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:46.650
who was unable to be with us
today, and Dr. Dick Randall,

02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:49.160
who passed away earlier this year.

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:51.970
There's a little mention
of him in the brochure

02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:55.540
with his many accomplishments.

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.800
So those are some of
our senior leaders,

02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:03.380
and we've been very
fortunate to have such wise

02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:06.950
and knowledgeable people
leading the Board.

02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:10.890
At this time, I'd like to introduce
some of our current leadership,

02:27:10.890 --> 02:27:13.820 position:56%
and these are pretty amazing people,

02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:17.090
and they're a lot of
fun to work with.

02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:20.080
The first is Mr. Tony
Gilbert, can you stand,

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:21.910
from our Government
Publishing Office [applause].

02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:28.120
He's the Vice Chair
of the full Board.

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.340
I think as we go through
these, you'll get a flavor

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:35.250
for the interagency
aspects of the Board.

02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:38.920
Mr. Lou Yost from the U.S.
Geological Survey is our Executive

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:40.720
Secretary for Domestic Names.

02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:47.280
[ Applause ]

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:51.540
You'll often see Lou quoted
in the newspaper [laughter].

02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:56.640
Mr. Marcus Alsop from the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.510
our Acting Executive
Secretary for Foreign Names.

02:27:59.510 --> 02:28:06.050
[ Applause ]

02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:10.080
He's filling in for Mr. Trent
Palmer who is currently detailed

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:12.510
to the Department of
State [inaudible].

02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:17.500
[ Applause ]

02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:19.460
Mr. Doug Van der Graaf
from the Bureau

02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:21.800
of Ocean Energy Management
is the Chair

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.600
of the Domestic Names Committee.

02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.390
[ Applause ]

02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:31.470
Mr. Leo Dillon from the
Department of State is the Chair

02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:33.510
of our Foreign Names Committee.

02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:38.440
[ Applause ]

02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:41.280
Dr. Scott Board, who I don't
believe is with us today,

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.480
from the National Science
Foundation,

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:48.510
is the Chair of the Advisory
Committee on Antarctic Names.

02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:52.310
[ Applause ]

02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:56.550
Roger, as we mentioned, and I
mis-mentioned, is the Secretary

02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:59.510
of the Advisory Committee
on Antarctic Names.

02:28:59.510 --> 02:29:04.260
[ Applause ]

02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:07.800 position:56%
Mr. Jerry Walters, from the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:10.510 position:56%
the Chair of the Advisory
Committee on Undersea Feature Names.

02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:16.380
[ Applause ]

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:17.720
Mr. Jimmy Nurantes
[assumed spelling]

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:20.270
from the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is

02:29:20.270 --> 02:29:23.510 position:56%
the Secretary of the Advisory
Committee on Undersea Feature Names.

02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:28.130
[ Applause ]

02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:31.310
I have to say, the Advisory
Committees are somewhat unique.

02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:34.820
So we have our Standing Committees
which are domestic and foreign,

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:39.420
and all of the people who serve
on those are Federal employees.

02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:44.690
The Antarctic Names and Undersea
Feature Names are somewhat unique

02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:50.540
in that they are names
for features on areas

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:55.490
for which the U.S. Government
doesn't recognize a sovereign

02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:59.040
leader, and there are areas where
there's no permanent population.

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:03.510
So they have a lot of
unique characteristics.

02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:07.300
And so they -- they do an excellent
job on these things because it's --

02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:10.510
it's quite complicated with
all the players involved

02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:15.120
and all the work that
remains to be done.

02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:17.930
So it's -- it's a great
pleasure to have them

02:30:17.930 --> 02:30:21.890
and if you have any questions,
just give them a chat.

02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:24.590
Our final person is Miss
Meredith Westington,

02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:27.880
who also couldn't be here and --
and she is actually the organizer

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:33.310
of this event and the person
who made everything possible.

02:30:33.310 --> 02:30:37.200
She's done a wonderful job keeping
a lot of moving parts together.

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:41.840
She works for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:43.510
She's a wonderful person, the chair

02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:45.720
of the Special Communications
Committee

02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:49.510
and she's currently in Colorado --

02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:56.710
[ Applause ]

02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:58.570
So -- so those are some
of our leaders and they're

02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:01.390
like the cabinet, that --
that makes things run and --

02:31:01.390 --> 02:31:04.020 position:56%
and they -- they're a great cabinet.

02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:08.570
But the BGN could not operate
without its members and staff.

02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:10.740
The members are the ones

02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:14.570
who actually make the
decisions and develop policy.

02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:17.800
So this time I'd like to ask the
current BGN members to stand,

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:20.510
if you're a current BGN member.

02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:30.790
[ Applause ]

02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:34.610
Do we have some former
BGN members here?

02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:36.510
Yeah --

02:31:36.510 --> 02:31:42.880
[ Applause ]

02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:46.110
And -- and naming is kind of
a funny thing because you --

02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:50.750
you can't go to college and
get a degree in toponymy.

02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:53.710
It's something that you
learn through experience,

02:31:53.710 --> 02:31:55.260
and often years of experience.

02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:58.330
You have to understand what's
gone on before and some

02:31:58.330 --> 02:32:01.160
of these things don't
happen every day.

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:07.880
And so, institutional knowledge
is very important to the BGN.

02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:12.140 position:56%
Now our staff, we have an
incredible staff, not a lot of them,

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:14.370
but they're incredible people.

02:32:14.370 --> 02:32:18.310
And they maintain our databases,
they interact with the public.

02:32:18.310 --> 02:32:20.240
When you call the BGN,
you're probably going

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:21.820
to be talking with one of them.

02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:25.980
And they do the research that's
the foundation of all of our work.

02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:30.020
So would our -- our current
BGN staff members both from NGA

02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:32.510
and the U.S. Geological
Survey, please stand?

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:44.490
[ Applause ]

02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:48.960
And do we have any former
staff with us today?

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:51.660
They're all working, so.

02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:54.920
And finally, the BGN works closely

02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:56.970
and this is a really
important thing, so the --

02:32:56.970 --> 02:33:01.740
the names that we work on and
the decisions that are made apply

02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:03.830
to the federal government,

02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:07.050
but we work in certainly
a broader environment.

02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:11.020
And so we have international
partners, state partners,

02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:15.470
local partners, and tribal
partners who work with us as well.

02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:19.760
And so if anyone here today is
from one of these authorities,

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:22.160
please stand up and let's
acknowledge your work.

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:23.960
Anyone here?

02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:30.400
[ Applause ]

02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.680 position:56%
So, I -- again I'd like to thank
again, all of the members and staff.

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:40.170
It's incredibly -- they work
very hard every day making sure

02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:44.660
that we have the best
quality of work on our names.

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:50.190 position:56%
So now this morning, we were
focusing particularly on the history

02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:53.840
of the BGN and the history
of our geographic names.

02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.580 position:56%
This afternoon we're going to pivot,

02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:58.540
the theme of the day is
traditions and transitions.

02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:00.640
So now we're going
to the transitions.

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.430
And we're going to be
looking at some of the things

02:34:05.430 --> 02:34:08.150
that are facing the
BGN in the future

02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:10.890
in our world of geographic names.

02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:12.810
Our next speaker, who
it's a pleasure

02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:15.800
to introduce, is Dr. Luis Bermudez.

02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:17.480
He is the executive director

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:22.190
of the Open Geospatial Consortiums
Compliance and E-Learning Program.

02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:25.030
He's an adjunct professor at the
Master of Professional Studies

02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:27.870
in Geographic Information
System at the University

02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:30.640
of Maryland, Baltimore County.

02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:34.220
Now Dr. Bermudez is in
a very special position.

02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:39.600
He's not one who worries so much
about the problems of today.

02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:42.610
He's looking at the
solutions of tomorrow.

02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:45.870
He's sort of one generation
and one step ahead,

02:34:45.870 --> 02:34:49.920
and so he brings a very
interesting perspective.

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:53.260
He not only thinks about the
future of geographic names,

02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:58.980
but has been involved in several
experiments looking at technology

02:34:58.980 --> 02:35:04.660
and concepts that will bring our
geographic names to the next level.

02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:07.510
So, Luis.

02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:16.240
[ Applause ]

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.540
Oh, sorry.

02:35:35.070 --> 02:35:36.370
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: Okay.

02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:37.690
So, good afternoon
everybody and thank you, Doug,

02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:39.810
very much for this kind invitation.

02:35:39.810 --> 02:35:41.220
It's really a pleasure to be here.

02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:45.050
When I was listening to
the previous speakers

02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:52.130
about how sentiment is too
-- is put when you place --

02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:56.550
when you put names into places
and how the first one that says,

02:35:56.550 --> 02:36:01.970
this is how I publish what name
belongs to what geographic feature.

02:36:01.970 --> 02:36:03.950
I thought about a good example.

02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:07.750
So this was about seven
years ago and my daughter was

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:11.260
about to get born, my third
child, and then we're thinking

02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:14.040
about what's the best
name -- Natalia or Sandra?

02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:16.190
Perfect in English
and Spanish, right.

02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:17.850
And then my son came,
he was six years,

02:36:17.850 --> 02:36:21.800 position:56%
and he wrote Isabella
[inaudible], and put it in the crib.

02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.600
And boom! He publicly
published the name [laughter].

02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.950
He won. So, I really appreciate
all the work that the board

02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:35.740
and staff does because it's really
heroic in how you solve conflicts

02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:40.410 position:56%
of putting names and resolving
conflict names between even borders.

02:36:40.410 --> 02:36:46.510
So, congratulations and -- and
thank you very much for your work.

02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:51.140
So, I -- I broke up the content

02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.140
of this presentation,
it's in four parts.

02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:56.590
First, to talk about the
maps and name of places,

02:36:56.590 --> 02:37:00.220
but I'm going to show
previous examples of some

02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:02.460
of the previous speakers before.

02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:05.420
But now I have the technology lens,

02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:07.740
so I'm putting this
in another context.

02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:11.060 position:56%
Then I'm going to talk about two
problems, basically name and search,

02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:15.890
next the third revolution and
finally, to infinity and beyond.

02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:19.500
So, most of you are
familiar with this, right.

02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:21.890
This is a very early map.

02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:26.450
The humans at that point wanted
to draw things in caverns.

02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:29.060
This was when agriculture
started to take place,

02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:33.480 position:56%
so the humans had more time to paint
their surroundings before they were

02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:35.750
painting animals and so forth.

02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:37.920
You see have no names.

02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:44.810
Now, Ptolemy as some of
you also mentioned before.

02:37:44.810 --> 02:37:46.660
He was an Egyptian geek.

02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:51.070
Now come one, Greco-Egyptian
[inaudible] sometimes.

02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:54.480
But he had a list of names
with latitude and longitude.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:57.310
Now so you can imagine
first the humans were trying

02:37:57.310 --> 02:38:00.420
to draw their environment
and how they were placed.

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:06.740
And then, this guy was able to put
a list of names with coordinates.

02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:11.390
You can imagine what comes next,
which is a map with names, right.

02:38:11.390 --> 02:38:15.800
This is one of the first
maps created by Martin.

02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:20.450
So, historically this is how
I think from my perspective,

02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:25.110
this is how we have sort of moved
from drawings to list of names

02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:28.800
and then to maps that have names
associated with those places.

02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:32.470
Now two problems that -- that I've
been able to -- to distinguish.

02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:33.970
So if you see this map, this is
Tennessee, but is not spelled

02:38:33.970 --> 02:38:35.530
as we usually encounter Tennessee,
which I don't know even how

02:38:35.530 --> 02:38:37.510
to spell, but I know -- I know
this is not the correct spelling.

02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:51.770
[ Laughter ]

02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:57.180 position:56%
So, solving these problems is very
tough because sometimes one thing --

02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:00.300
one geographic feature can
have different representations,

02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:01.850
even in the same language, right.

02:39:01.850 --> 02:39:07.760
And we have all seen a lot of
different examples related to that.

02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:14.010
And that's why one of the
first works here in the U.S.

02:39:14.010 --> 02:39:20.560
and we have all seen these work on
Alaska, was trying to standardize

02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:25.340
on a place of names, a dictionary
where everybody can look and say,

02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:29.690
"Okay, this is the standard
name, this is the approve d name

02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:31.230
and I'm going to use it."

02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:34.230
I'm not going to talk
more about the history

02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:37.700 position:56%
because this has been talked before.

02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:40.690
Now, so that's one problem, right.

02:39:40.690 --> 02:39:43.520
[Inaudible] geographic feature
with different representations.

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:44.910
Now we have a second problem.

02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:47.460
Where is Ontario?

02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:48.840
Who knows?

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:50.910
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:52.210
So -- somebody?

02:39:52.210 --> 02:39:53.510
Huh?

02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:54.820
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:56.440
One in California, where else?

02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:57.740
&gt;&gt; One in Canada [inaudible].

02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.260
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: One
in Canada, yeah.

02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:02.040
So, Ontario is there, right.

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.660
It's like east of Pomona,
north of Chino.

02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:08.960
All -- everybody agrees?

02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:10.490
That's Ontario.

02:40:10.490 --> 02:40:17.590
No. As we know, Ontario is
also a province in Canada.

02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:21.400
So, we can have one
name, now in this case,

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.840
representing different features.

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.120
So, that's the second
problem, right.

02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:27.980
And all these problems
are called [inaudible].

02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:32.090
And we have now virus technologies

02:40:32.090 --> 02:40:35.550
that are able to solve
these problem.

02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:38.680
Now I've been lucky
enough that I was involved

02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.220
in previous works about semantics.

02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:45.420
I was at Drexel University
and we're trying

02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:49.240
to do hydrologic interoperability
[phonetic] in terms

02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:52.490
of how do we call observatories,
water sheds and so forth.

02:40:52.490 --> 02:40:55.500
And we were the first
ones to publish ontologies

02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:58.070
and semantic works on hydrology.

02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:59.750
So then when I came to you --

02:40:59.750 --> 02:41:03.690
to OGC, I was able to lead some
cross [inaudible] and that's

02:41:03.690 --> 02:41:07.280 position:56%
where I met Doug and at the end, I'm
going to present some of the work

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:09.710
that we have advanced
related to -- to that.

02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:12.030
But these are the two
typical problems when we talk

02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:15.610
about semantic heterogeneity.

02:41:17.450 --> 02:41:24.330
Now, more interesting is when we
want to please a hungry fisherman.

02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:27.400
So, it's 4 o'clock in the morning,

02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:31.340
this guy just parked
somewhere in a hotel.

02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:34.880
All he's fishing poles
are in the car.

02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:36.300
He's hungry.

02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:38.730
What is the nearest lake

02:41:38.730 --> 02:41:41.010
from my current location
that I can go fishing?

02:41:41.010 --> 02:41:44.400
It's not an easy question
to -- to respond right now.

02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:47.760
If somebody can point
me to a map that says --

02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:52.490
I don't know, insta-fishing map
buddy or something like that.

02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:54.150
I don't think it exists.

02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:58.960
Because it requires to cross
link a lot of information.

02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:03.630
Not only where are the lakes that
hopefully we can solve, right,

02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:09.270
with proper names, but we also
need to know if fishing is allowed,

02:42:09.270 --> 02:42:16.090
if the fish that I want is there,
if it is open when I want to go,

02:42:16.090 --> 02:42:17.930
if there is any closing, you know,

02:42:17.930 --> 02:42:22.730
all these related information
is hard.

02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:24.380
So keep that in mind.

02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:29.880
This is what I call the problem
of the hungry casual fisherman.

02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:37.300
So, over these years, we have
evolved various techniques.

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:41.590
I'm going to see how
much on time, good.

02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:44.560
We have evolved through virus
techniques and first is,

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:49.400
I'm going to show techniques on how
we have agreed on geographic names.

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:54.930
And second, how we have make those
names accessible to the public.

02:42:54.930 --> 02:42:58.030
And in particular made only
accessible to a web interface,

02:42:58.030 --> 02:43:00.690
right, but accessible to
the developer that wants

02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:07.530
to create this app insta-fishing
buddy gram or whatever [laughter].

02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:10.960
So, agreement via controlled
vocabularies or for those of you

02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:14.420
that are familiar with semantic
techniques and the different levels

02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:17.220
of controlled vocabularies,
every community

02:43:17.220 --> 02:43:20.380
and every endeavor
starts with list of terms.

02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:23.060
And that's how we saw
Ptolemy, right.

02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:25.640
He created the list of terms.

02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:27.780
And then those evolved
into dictionaries.

02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:30.730
I'm going to show more
examples and at the end,

02:43:30.730 --> 02:43:34.040
we can capture these
tables and relations.

02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:38.710
When an organization decision
starts with these process of, oh,

02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:40.970
now we need to create
controlled vocabularies

02:43:40.970 --> 02:43:44.630
because there is an executive
order or somebody says, "Yeah,

02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:48.850
because it's cool," or because
open link data, all of those --

02:43:48.850 --> 02:43:52.060
the first thing is its
create a list of terms.

02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:56.810
Then define those list of terms and
then create tables and relations.

02:43:56.810 --> 02:44:03.210 position:56%
So you have seen these, it's
bulletin one published by the board.

02:44:03.210 --> 02:44:10.710
And here we see a list of decisions
which basically provide categories,

02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:14.230
right, list of countries, for
example, list of foreign countries,

02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:18.670
the U.S. and basically it
has a list of names, right.

02:44:18.670 --> 02:44:21.720
This was the first part.

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.420 position:56%
Then we have good example, this was
the first official stat e gazetteer,

02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:28.890
the Gazetteer of Rhode Island.

02:44:30.250 --> 02:44:34.730
Where we see a lot of elements of
dictionary style and thank you doc

02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:38.000
for providing a lot
of very useful slides.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.390
So you will see elements,
for example, like the name,

02:44:42.390 --> 02:44:48.360
like the class or type, where's the
location and where is it located.

02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:54.110 position:56%
So all those different components
form part of a structured definition

02:44:54.110 --> 02:44:57.280
and then we can easily capture
in the tables and relation.

02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:00.050
But this is like the second part.

02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:05.420
And then, this is an example
of gazetteer maps of Thailand,

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:11.120
now this is 1944 and then we
see a table representation.

02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:15.680
So you see the name, you see the
type which is the second column,

02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:17.940
you see even a link to a map.

02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:20.120
So we have the map
reference that you're able

02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:24.220
to locate the information in
that table and the information

02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:26.950
on the map, and then
latitude and longitude.

02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:31.420
So 1944, this was represented
as tables.

02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:35.200
So I'm talking about the
techniques, remember.

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:38.040
Now something happened -- since
I'm going to talk about technology,

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:40.550
I need to also tell a
little bit about this --

02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:44.750
something happened
between 1960 and 2000.

02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:49.490
Internet/web revolution
and the digital revolution,

02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:52.350
this is what we call
the third revolution.

02:45:52.350 --> 02:45:54.090
What was the first revolution?

02:45:54.090 --> 02:45:55.390
&gt;&gt; Agriculture.

02:45:55.390 --> 02:45:56.690
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: Thank you.

02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:57.990
And the second one?

02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:59.290
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:01.750
You guys are super
awesome, thank you.

02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:04.990
So in 1947, something
incredible happened.

02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:10.040 position:56%
We were able to get ones and zeros
[inaudible] from electrical signals.

02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.810
And that allow us to do what?

02:46:11.810 --> 02:46:15.850
Create computers and more
interesting, to be able then

02:46:15.850 --> 02:46:18.240
to transfer information
across computers

02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:20.540
and across servers,
across the world.

02:46:20.540 --> 02:46:24.120
And this is when Internet
was born, 1969.

02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:27.680
University of California,
Stanford, they were able

02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.530
to share some information doing
a link called ARPANET link --

02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:35.710
1969 -- 2230.

02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:42.210
And then between the 70's and 80's,
also something interesting happened

02:46:42.210 --> 02:46:48.230
and it's that we were able to
create systems that were able

02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:51.670
to store information and
retrieve information easier.

02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:54.950
Before relational databases,
we had graphs.

02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:58.600
And then if we wanted to search
information, want to go from --

02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.900
I don't know -- we have a customer
and a customer had invoices,

02:47:03.900 --> 02:47:07.000
invoice one, invoice two, we
had to traverse invoice one,

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.070
invoice two until we
get to the last invoice.

02:47:09.070 --> 02:47:12.880
We were trying to search something
in invoice 40 and we wanted

02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:14.990
to search how many products
did we want -- we want --

02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:17.040
had to search every
graph for every invoice.

02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:18.450
It was crazy.

02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:22.100 position:56%
So they came from these relational
databases were born, that allows you

02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:28.190
to capture tables, link tables
and be able to be more efficient

02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:31.400
in the store of information.

02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:38.170
In 1993, you know, almost three
years after the Internet was born,

02:47:38.170 --> 02:47:42.470
we have one of the first
popular browsers, Mosaic.

02:47:42.470 --> 02:47:46.120
And this allowed people
to search the web, right,

02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.820 position:56%
so we're not only talking about
links about University of California

02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:54.180
at Stanford, but in a simple
interface, we're able to click

02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:57.120 position:56%
and access servers around the world.

02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:58.720
This was incredible.

02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:00.960
This was an eye opener
for a lot of people.

02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:06.540
Knowledge became widespread and
not only knowledge, but maps.

02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:10.500
So in 1996, MapQuest was created.

02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:15.040
Four years after MapQuest
was created, AOL --

02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.630 position:56%
you remember some of you, AOL, okay.

02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:22.790 position:56%
One -- but MapQuest for 1.1 billion.

02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:29.220
So this is how crazy it was mapping
in the mapping industry on the web,

02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:32.900
bringing that information that
previously was hard, right.

02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:38.600
We used to use printed maps to
travel -- I used to, you know,

02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:44.310
I look young and --
but I still use those.

02:48:44.310 --> 02:48:47.600 position:56%
And then came the fourth revolution.

02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.310
No, no, came OGC.

02:48:51.310 --> 02:48:57.480 position:56%
So, it was created in 1994, right at
that point was eight members mostly.

02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:02.240
Government from the OpenGIS project
and we wanted to create interfaces,

02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:05.630
web interfaces to share
geospatial data.

02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:11.100
So in 1997, the first open
geospatial consortium,

02:49:11.100 --> 02:49:14.090
OGC standard -- that's
where I work, right,

02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:15.660
created the first specification,

02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:17.720
which is Simple Features
Specification.

02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:21.600
How do we store data in
that geospatial database?

02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:22.900 position:56%
That was the first time [inaudible].

02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:27.100
Why? Because spatial databases
were popular at that time.

02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:29.640
So this is the first
standard, right.

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:34.150
So Oracles, you know, all
those companies got certified

02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:37.220
and they were able to properly
put geographic information

02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:38.520
in their base.

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:41.560
There were certain queries
that you were able to do it.

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:46.110
And today, most geospatial
databases support simple features.

02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:50.520
Then in 2000, came another
interesting standard.

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:51.820
So, what's the next step?

02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:54.400
Oh, well, the next step is
to publish maps on the web.

02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.250 position:56%
Cool. So, what would you like to do?

02:49:56.250 --> 02:50:00.260
Well, can we have common links,
common URL's that we type

02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:01.560
in a browser and get maps?

02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:04.320
And let the server
do all the crunching,

02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:11.760 position:56%
meaning that if we want a map 400
by 600 in JPEG, with certain styles,

02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:14.230
that the service do all
-- does all the crunching

02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:18.060
and I just get an image that
I can reuse in the website

02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:20.620
that I can then put with
another image on top.

02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:23.370 position:56%
So that is what double UMS is about.

02:50:23.370 --> 02:50:27.760
Very popular, is -- is the most
popular OGC standard, I think.

02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:30.330
All governments around
the world have implemented

02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:32.820
when they are started to implement

02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:36.490
or recall spatial data
infrastructures, that's --

02:50:36.490 --> 02:50:38.750
maybe the first thing is
the inventory catalogs,

02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:40.510
but the second thing
is publishing maps.

02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:45.690
And then in 2002 was the question
of, okay, now we can publish maps,

02:50:45.690 --> 02:50:48.670
can we publish vector
data on the web?

02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:51.830
So only the images,
but can we ask for --

02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:54.610
give me all the polygons
that represent the U.S.

02:50:54.610 --> 02:51:00.510
or give me all the roads and
that is web features service

02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:02.920
that came in 2002.

02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:11.660
Now, so you see this is 1997,
2002, so maps crazy now --

02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:17.430
2004, more people use
maps online than e-mail.

02:51:17.430 --> 02:51:21.090
And in 2007, we knew
what happened, right.

02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:25.070
We ready now to have
digital maps in our pocket,

02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:28.440
thanks to -- to -- to Steve.

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:36.280
And okay, now when back a little
bit of what USGS has done.

02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:39.790
This is one of the first
screenshots -- I think so.

02:51:39.790 --> 02:51:43.620
Geographic Names Information
Systems where you're able

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:49.260
to search some places
via a user interface.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:53.470
So this was in 2002, maybe I got
it wrong, but this was the --

02:51:53.470 --> 02:51:58.500 position:56%
the best information I got from
Geographic Names Information System.

02:51:58.500 --> 02:52:02.230
So this was quite advanced
at that moment, right,

02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:06.050
2002 was about 12 years ago.

02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:09.690
And then -- so there
was a web interface,

02:52:09.690 --> 02:52:12.510
but what about then
for the developers?

02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:14.120
Is there a web service?

02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:16.710
Is there somehow, I can
access that information

02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:21.380
and do my cool app
insta-fisherman buddy helper?

02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:25.670
So in 2008, the first
web service appeared,

02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:28.170
this was an XML based service.

02:52:28.170 --> 02:52:31.650
They can also -- were
able to get elevation

02:52:31.650 --> 02:52:34.810 position:56%
from the National Elevation Dataset.

02:52:34.810 --> 02:52:40.320
But in 2008, you guys also
published the OGC Web Map Service,

02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:41.620
so you were able to get

02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:44.190
that information via a
standard OGC service.

02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:47.150
And in 2010, via Web
Feature Service.

02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:50.890
And there is a prototype, which is
WFS-G, which is Web Feature Service

02:52:50.890 --> 02:52:54.350
for Gazetteers, which is very
special functions that I'm going

02:52:54.350 --> 02:53:00.610
to talk at the end that provides
better search capabilities,

02:53:00.610 --> 02:53:02.450
better interface capabilities

02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:07.050
that go beyond this
[inaudible] vector data.

02:53:07.050 --> 02:53:13.850
Okay. So now to infinity
and beyond, right.

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:19.160
So, we talk about -- so we started
from maps, then list of names.

02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:23.520
We were able to put names on a
map, technology advance, right,

02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:27.380
digital revolution where we're
able to create computers, Internet,

02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:30.330
put maps on the web and
create web services.

02:53:30.330 --> 02:53:35.770
So we are now at this point,
a position that I can go

02:53:35.770 --> 02:53:40.090
to a web service and I can get the
vector data that I want, right.

02:53:40.090 --> 02:53:45.130
And maybe it has proper names,
maybe it has some attributes,

02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:50.150
not all of them, but attributes
likes what type is it, right.

02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:52.770
Where is it contained,
a little definition.

02:53:52.770 --> 02:53:56.950
So, what's next?

02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:59.130
So I have four topics here.

02:53:59.130 --> 02:54:02.520
One is advanced location
representation,

02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:07.360
advanced semantics,
linking and search.

02:54:09.060 --> 02:54:11.050
Now, where is Russia?

02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:17.400
Yeah, in California,
west of Chico, right.

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:23.490 position:56%
No, usually what we do with names or
in -- in the previous years, well,

02:54:23.490 --> 02:54:27.820 position:56%
Russia is here and how it was this
place and how I got the information,

02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:30.120
was sort of a dot on the map

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:34.580
that represented maybe
the center of the polygon.

02:54:34.580 --> 02:54:40.530
But now we can have advanced
representations, right,

02:54:40.530 --> 02:54:45.530
so it's not only a point, but
now we have better vector data,

02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:48.720
better web services, better
databases that allow us

02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:56.130
to not only link names with points,
but also sometimes bounding box,

02:54:56.130 --> 02:55:00.220
that are very useful for
searching, for linear rings,

02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:02.770
polygons and multi-polygons.

02:55:02.770 --> 02:55:06.240
And all those vector types

02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:12.270
or presentations are all also
standardized as part of OGC.

02:55:12.270 --> 02:55:15.030
So we can better answer the
question of, where is Russia,

02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:18.960
but saying Russia is here,
all these polygons, right.

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.150
It's much better than
saying, it's this point

02:55:21.150 --> 02:55:26.660
because I can somehow use the
data for other purposes, right.

02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:29.550
Containment, I can
calculate the area,

02:55:29.550 --> 02:55:32.790
I can link with other
information that I can somehow find

02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:40.130
that it's inside Russia
and -- and -- and so on.

02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:42.560
Now, this is also related
to somebody that --

02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.270
that asked a question in the
-- in the morning session.

02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:52.590
So, how do we solve the
problems of these category types,

02:55:52.590 --> 02:55:55.120
right, but it's a Summit.

02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:59.990
It can be maybe all of these or
part of these, or related to these.

02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:03.000
How -- how do we do it?

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.410
Well, there is a formal
way to do it.

02:56:07.410 --> 02:56:09.370
We have the technology right now,

02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:13.720
so the worldwide web
consortium -- this is W3C, right.

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:19.270
They are doing a lot of web -- a
lot of work on the next web, right,

02:56:19.270 --> 02:56:21.990
because they already did all
the work on the web HTTP,

02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:24.470
that's how we publish
information on the web.

02:56:24.470 --> 02:56:28.160
But their moving towards something
called the semantic web that says,

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.690
"Well, if we can describe
things that we put in the web

02:56:31.690 --> 02:56:38.400
with a correct name and you can
provide a correct unique identifier

02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:39.700
for that name.

02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:43.290
Then we can start playing
and linking all those types

02:56:43.290 --> 02:56:47.510
and instances, and all the data
and build these rich semantic web

02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:49.810
that we can infer more stuff.

02:56:49.810 --> 02:56:54.910
And maybe solve the problem for
the hungry late fisherman," right.

02:56:54.910 --> 02:57:00.210
So, and this is very,
very small example

02:57:00.210 --> 02:57:03.640
of maybe what ontology
would look like.

02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:05.960
You can see, for example,
that we have volcano

02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:08.210
and volcano we can say
is a type of a mountain.

02:57:08.210 --> 02:57:10.680
Mountain is a type
of natural elevation,

02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:15.370
that is a geological formation
and mountain has a mountain peak,

02:57:15.370 --> 02:57:19.280
which is a type of peak and
some it is a peak, right.

02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:24.710
So we have somehow
information that says, you know,

02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:31.250 position:56%
this Summit something, something and
has the name of the mountain like,

02:57:31.250 --> 02:57:34.810
for example, Denali has
two significant Summits.

02:57:34.810 --> 02:57:38.700
The south Summit is higher
than da, da, da, da, da, da.

02:57:38.700 --> 02:57:41.430
Then if we have the type
of information and we have,

02:57:41.430 --> 02:57:48.290 position:56%
for example, like machine --
machine learning algorithms are able

02:57:48.290 --> 02:57:52.480
to construct from text or
from queries, use ontology.

02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:55.030
Then you're able to
infer more stuff.

02:57:55.030 --> 02:58:00.090
If you have proper names, proper
categories, then you are able

02:58:00.090 --> 02:58:04.990
to query, get back the information
and provide information useful

02:58:04.990 --> 02:58:10.050
to the end user, like
again, the fisherman.

02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:18.440
So now there is another problem,
right, we have a lot of --

02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.290
now I had all my notes here, I have
not been able to read one -- okay.

02:58:22.290 --> 02:58:26.600
So we had -- we have a
lot of different ways

02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:31.240 position:56%
to divide our geographic, right, can
be counties, it can be by watershed,

02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:34.670
and we somehow need to
share that information.

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:38.110
If I'm interested in what
lake is inside this watershed,

02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:42.450 position:56%
it's a different question from, what
lake is inside this county, right?

02:58:42.450 --> 02:58:45.610
Watersheds come across counties
and [inaudible] and so forth.

02:58:45.610 --> 02:58:50.500
So having the boundaries is not
enough, but having information

02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:54.300
of how do we calculate, for
example, these in real time

02:58:54.300 --> 02:58:59.370
because we are able to properly
save the watershed polygon

02:58:59.370 --> 02:59:03.400
and the county polygons, and then
calculate what is inside what.

02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:05.960
That is very powerful.

02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:09.040 position:56%
And right now we're able to do that.

02:59:11.530 --> 02:59:15.400
The -- the keynote presenter
talk about -- and if --

02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:17.790
I think this was his
second slide or so,

02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:22.060
about the importance
of unique identifiers.

02:59:22.060 --> 02:59:25.710
And some of the experiments
that we do at OGC, so again,

02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:29.980
open this special consortium, which
you know, we're about 500 members.

02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:33.770
We publish standards, but one of
the cool activities that we do is,

02:59:33.770 --> 02:59:37.370
can we prototype some
technology and solve problems?

02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:42.500 position:56%
So sponsors, like USGS and GAFAA and
so forth, they come and say, "Hey,

02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:46.570
OGC, we have these problem and
want to be able, for example,

02:59:46.570 --> 02:59:53.380 position:56%
in this case, to be able to search
NGA, but using USGS names or be able

02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:56.570
to link with these other
type of information.

02:59:56.570 --> 02:59:59.670
Can you do some prototype and then
we can create [inaudible] practice,

02:59:59.670 --> 03:00:02.080
publish a report, improve
the standards?"

03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:04.180
And we say, "Yes."

03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:06.970
And that's part of the
[inaudible] Program Activities.

03:00:06.970 --> 03:00:09.490
And so we invite other
members to participate,

03:00:09.490 --> 03:00:12.160
these are very fast
activities, like six months.

03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:16.290
A lot of participants around
the world, we interact --

03:00:16.290 --> 03:00:19.790
I think Doug, we had
a lot of fun time.

03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:21.560
I had a lot of fun time.

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:26.360 position:56%
But it's -- it's very cool because
we're able to really move technology

03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:32.980
in the future and I -- and get some
things, you know, software running

03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:36.590
and -- and then we can publish
our report for others to look

03:00:36.590 --> 03:00:37.890
and improve their systems.

03:00:37.890 --> 03:00:42.510
So in this case, we had [inaudible]
National Geospatial Agency data,

03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:45.830
now we had USGS data.

03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:48.730
And we had also Dbpedia, right.

03:00:48.730 --> 03:00:51.710
And we wanted to be
able to link these three

03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:54.630
and if we have one user
interface that search one name,

03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:58.430
can we also get the information
from the other sources, so that --

03:00:58.430 --> 03:01:02.760
that way we get a more
comprehensive set of information?

03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:04.540
The first thing we need to do,

03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:07.750
unique identifiers
for all those folks.

03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:11.080
We have unique identifiers, then
we can use the power of ontologies

03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:14.540
to do explicit representations
of types, attributes

03:01:14.540 --> 03:01:17.660
and then we're able to
do powerful searches.

03:01:17.660 --> 03:01:23.130
So, for example, we're able
to get this information,

03:01:23.130 --> 03:01:27.800
which I think is not part of
-- of what you guys published.

03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:33.440
Like, for example, rain
days average in a year

03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:38.720
or the population metro
density and other information

03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:40.510
that can be accessed somewhere.

03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:44.650
So again, going back to
the fisherman exercise,

03:01:44.650 --> 03:01:49.180
if we're able to link with a
database that provides information

03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:53.410
about lakes, if they are close, not
close, what type of fish, etcetera,

03:01:53.410 --> 03:01:57.700
we were able then to create
this for the fisherman.

03:01:59.030 --> 03:02:05.450
We were able also to play
with advanced searches, right.

03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:11.520
And we had the scenario where, what
if there is an event in the border

03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:14.970
of Mexico and U.S. and
something happened in Rincon,

03:02:14.970 --> 03:02:16.780
but you didn't know
how to spell Rincon?

03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:21.290
If you know Spanish, sometimes you
need to open [foreign speaking],

03:02:21.290 --> 03:02:24.760
but if you don't speak
Spanish so well you say Rincon.

03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:26.450
And then you don't know how to --

03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:28.700
how to write it sometime
[inaudible] whatever.

03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:35.270
So you can write it with different
ways, but can we even search

03:02:35.270 --> 03:02:38.240
that way, and we call
it Fuzzy Match.

03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:41.680
And not only [inaudible] --
in a web interface where we --

03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:43.940
we can put, you know, all the --

03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:47.180
all the code, but can we
put it via web services?

03:02:47.180 --> 03:02:51.930
So we're able to improve the
web services for gazetteers

03:02:51.930 --> 03:02:56.020
and provide these in --
in a service interface.

03:02:56.020 --> 03:03:00.520
Also, the nearest neighbor, right
-- again fisherman, nearest lake

03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:04.610
and the best coffee around, best
espresso around, organic, whatever.

03:03:04.610 --> 03:03:09.800
How can I do this in
a programmatic way

03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:12.400
so we interact with web services?

03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:17.060
So we also advance these
searches via web services

03:03:17.060 --> 03:03:22.600
and also using the ontologies and
the categorizations that we have

03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:24.330
for Summit and the radius.

03:03:24.330 --> 03:03:31.320
Can we search for all Summit
types in this 20 kilometer radius?

03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.300 position:56%
So we're able to play with
ontologies and find names that have,

03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:39.650
for example, mountain, hills,
peaks because they were related.

03:03:39.650 --> 03:03:47.470 position:56%
And beyond, so there are a lot, a
lot, a lot, a lot of sources around.

03:03:47.470 --> 03:03:50.670
There is a trend that if you didn't
know you need to be aware of,

03:03:50.670 --> 03:03:55.980
but this is called linked data,
which allows you, organizations,

03:03:55.980 --> 03:04:00.950
agencies, everybody to publish
this information on the web

03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:05.110
and to link it and to
provide more information

03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:07.330
that the current source
and improve it.

03:04:07.330 --> 03:04:10.370
So then you query all
this information

03:04:10.370 --> 03:04:14.410
and get very interesting
answers like, the lake example

03:04:14.410 --> 03:04:16.010
and the fisherman example.

03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:21.210 position:56%
So link data and I think that's all.

03:04:21.210 --> 03:04:23.010
Thank you very much.

03:04:23.010 --> 03:04:35.080
[ Applause ]

03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:36.380
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell:
That just sort of took us

03:04:36.380 --> 03:04:39.830
out of our own little world
of geographic names and put us

03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:43.110
in the larger context
of other information

03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:45.960
and how we can be a big player

03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:50.200
in the information ecosystem
rather than just more broken.

03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:52.500
Is there any questions?

03:04:57.240 --> 03:04:58.730
[Inaudible] so what
-- what are you think

03:04:58.730 --> 03:05:01.430
in your experiments was
the most interesting

03:05:01.430 --> 03:05:04.640
and unexpected find that you had?

03:05:04.640 --> 03:05:06.620
So you -- you knew about
the data and things,

03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:11.090
what was the biggest surprise
in -- in working through this?

03:05:11.090 --> 03:05:13.370
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: So -- so the
biggest surprise is when we said,

03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:14.970 position:56%
"Yeah, we have the technology, yeah,

03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:18.340
we [inaudible] with
ontology search."

03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:23.080
Then the services, the data of the
services didn't have a unique URI.

03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:24.610
That was the biggest problem.

03:05:24.610 --> 03:05:28.750
So we published data and
agencies, organizations --

03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:32.180
yeah, of course, it's not --
they had priority, nobody said,

03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:36.330 position:56%
"You need to publish those names
with unique identifiers on the web."

03:05:36.330 --> 03:05:38.110
But that was one of the big issues.

03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:40.250
And then, what if we
have multiple services

03:05:40.250 --> 03:05:43.080
that are serving the same
name or the same feature?

03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:44.540
How do you deal with that?

03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:46.730
Yeah, okay, if you
have unique identifiers

03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:49.550
and we can find ontology, this
is -- this is the same as.

03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:53.200
But the -- the main problem is
unique identifiers on the web

03:05:53.200 --> 03:05:56.080
for everything, for
digigraphic features,

03:05:56.080 --> 03:06:01.330
for the types so we can do a
nice categorization of them.

03:06:01.330 --> 03:06:02.630
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: And I --

03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:04.850 position:56%
I think one of the most interesting
things to me in that experiment was,

03:06:04.850 --> 03:06:12.740
we were able to take a gazetteer
ID from NGA, for a feature,

03:06:12.740 --> 03:06:15.130
and we did Saint John in Canada.

03:06:15.130 --> 03:06:21.660
And within a couple links, we
had the mayor of Saint John,

03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:26.190 position:56%
we had the picture of the mayor, we
knew what his occupation was and all

03:06:26.190 --> 03:06:31.160
of these things, just starting
with that one ID from NGA.

03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:35.640
And that I think is in this link
data, that's the power of this.

03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:38.090
There actually are -- there are
billions of pieces of information

03:06:38.090 --> 03:06:41.870
out there just waiting
to be tied to our names.

03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:47.680
And -- and this is one of the
things I think that we're going

03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:50.400
to look forward to in the future.

03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:51.700
Question, yes?

03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:59.110
&gt;&gt; I'm curious if you yourself or
[inaudible] has gotten into the --

03:06:59.110 --> 03:07:01.580
the moral standards
[inaudible] aspects.

03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:08.190
You have places that have previous
names and it's all the same place.

03:07:08.190 --> 03:07:09.670
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Can
you repeat the question?

03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:10.970
&gt;&gt; Is there a standard
or -- or [inaudible].

03:07:10.970 --> 03:07:13.940
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: So if
OGC has a standard to --

03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:15.470
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell:
Repeat the question.

03:07:15.470 --> 03:07:17.370
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: -- yes,
the question -- question.

03:07:17.370 --> 03:07:21.920
If OGC has a standard to deal
with how the names changes and --

03:07:21.920 --> 03:07:23.220
and temporal names, right.

03:07:23.220 --> 03:07:25.400
Yes. So we are dealing
with two things there.

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:30.160 position:56%
One is provenance, so we have done
a lot of work in provenance activity

03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:34.060
and in particular, reusing the
word, the W3C again, is done --

03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:38.080
is doing it's called
[inaudible] something like that.

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:40.200
But they have a model
for provenance.

03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:45.610
And second, GML 3.2
provides temporality,

03:07:45.610 --> 03:07:50.140
so you can attach to features time.

03:07:50.140 --> 03:07:53.440
Aviation uses this a lot
because they want to know

03:07:53.440 --> 03:07:56.040
when an airport is
closed and when it's going

03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:58.230
to be open, when an event occurs.

03:07:58.230 --> 03:08:04.490
So in aviation, AXM is the GML
profile, they use time a lot.

03:08:04.490 --> 03:08:05.790
Yeah.

03:08:05.790 --> 03:08:10.720
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell:
Any other questions?

03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:12.020
Thank you.

03:08:12.020 --> 03:08:13.330
&gt;&gt; Luis Bermudez: Thank you.

03:08:13.330 --> 03:08:15.330
[ Applause ]

03:08:15.330 --> 03:08:18.770
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Okay, our next
speaker is going to be David Stage,

03:08:18.770 --> 03:08:21.490
who was formerly the
state GIS coordinator

03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:22.790
for the state of Florida.

03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:25.480
And the eastern cadastral
coordinator

03:08:25.480 --> 03:08:29.960
for the Federal Geographic
Data Committee -- or FGDC.

03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:36.880
As the state GIS coordinator, Mr.
Stage had a view of names outside

03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:39.860
of BGN federal activities.

03:08:39.860 --> 03:08:42.550
So he was able to see
them, and work with them,

03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:45.000
and use them as someone not

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:49.230
in the federal government,
but as someone outside.

03:08:49.230 --> 03:08:53.240
He understands how outside
government organizations work

03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:55.820
with the BGN and geographic names.

03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:58.870
And today he's going to
talk about the connection

03:08:58.870 --> 03:09:03.170
between two really
seemingly incompatible things.

03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:06.920
On the one hand, we have
our authoritative names,

03:09:06.920 --> 03:09:10.570
which obviously can only be
approved by an authority,

03:09:10.570 --> 03:09:12.780
in this case, the federal
government.

03:09:12.780 --> 03:09:16.510
But we also have this world of
crowd sourcing, which is emerging.

03:09:16.510 --> 03:09:20.070
And in the crowd sourcing world,

03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:24.880
we're tapping into a huge
labor pool of volunteers.

03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:27.460
And he's going to talk a
little bit more about that.

03:09:27.460 --> 03:09:28.760
Thank you.

03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:30.560
David?

03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:36.860
[ Applause ]

03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:38.800
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Okay, great.

03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:43.110
Okay, I'm David Stage.

03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:46.810
My presentation here obviously
is on authoritative data

03:09:46.810 --> 03:09:50.730
and crowd sourcing or how can
volunteers provide authoritative

03:09:50.730 --> 03:09:52.030
data to BGN?

03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:55.920
This is based on my own
experience working at the state

03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:59.130
and local governments, as well --

03:09:59.130 --> 03:10:00.960
not only governments,
but associations.

03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:02.490
I've worked with the
National State's Geographic

03:10:02.490 --> 03:10:03.790
Information Council.

03:10:03.790 --> 03:10:06.920
I've also had discussions
with the National Map Corps,

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:09.090
that's part of the USGS.

03:10:09.090 --> 03:10:12.180
And I talked with Elizabeth
McCartney and Erin Course,

03:10:12.180 --> 03:10:15.200
who were very valuable and who
cannot be blamed for anything

03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:17.320
that I'm saying [laughter].

03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:20.170
Okay, I've looked into the
research on crowd sourcing and --

03:10:20.170 --> 03:10:23.290
and I use the terms
crowd sourcing and VGI

03:10:23.290 --> 03:10:26.980
or volunteer geographic
information interchangeably often.

03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:28.360
There -- there are differences.

03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:33.250
And on the last slide,
I have references

03:10:33.250 --> 03:10:35.460
that if you are interested in --

03:10:35.460 --> 03:10:38.110
in this whole business
of crowd sourcing,

03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:40.200
that you should take a look at.

03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:41.500
So this is a new area.

03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:45.890
I'd like to note two things that,
one is this is a governance issue.

03:10:45.890 --> 03:10:49.260
And I've made things a lot
simpler than they really are.

03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:52.870
So, with that -- let's see
if I got my things right.

03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:56.290
Down. Thank you very much.

03:10:56.290 --> 03:11:01.330 position:56%
Authoritative data and BGN's
business requirements -- so, as a --

03:11:01.330 --> 03:11:05.890
it's an -- a BGN or USGS,
is an authoritative source,

03:11:05.890 --> 03:11:09.950 position:56%
it's an organization that has a
legislative mandate or just learned,

03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:14.600
an executive order and
budget to create data

03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:16.700
to meet specific business needs.

03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:21.490 position:56%
In short, what those things are,
our place stands for the USGS quads,

03:11:21.490 --> 03:11:23.280
provide an official
process to create

03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:27.300
and maintain official place names,
maintain the currency of that data

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:33.180
and [inaudible] place name history
-- provide a place name history.

03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:37.220
Now this next slide is the
National Map Corps website.

03:11:37.220 --> 03:11:41.500
This is the door for crowd-sourced
data to become authoritative data.

03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:44.670
It's a very interesting website.

03:11:44.670 --> 03:11:47.750
You go home, register today
and you can get to work.

03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:51.010
There are a number of
crowd sourcing efforts

03:11:51.010 --> 03:11:53.530
that have taken place
or are taking place.

03:11:53.530 --> 03:11:57.760
Probably over the past 10 years,
it's starting to build momentum.

03:11:57.760 --> 03:11:59.900
There's a -- some couple
of interesting references,

03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:02.280
there was one to the World Bank
that's crowd-sourced geographic

03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:06.450
information for governments where
over 30 case studies were looked at

03:12:06.450 --> 03:12:11.130
or published, both from
governments and the private sector.

03:12:11.130 --> 03:12:13.100
This is a really good one.

03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:17.230
The one that was given to the --
the United Nations 10th Conference

03:12:17.230 --> 03:12:20.560
on Geographic Names, Laura
Kotanski, a crowd source

03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:22.750
and geographic information
for government gazetteers

03:12:22.750 --> 03:12:25.040
where she interviewed 20
public/private entities.

03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:27.990
And I'll be getting
back to her later on.

03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:31.250
And she talked about --
well, I'll be getting to it.

03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:36.180
And then BGN's National
Map Corp. Okay,

03:12:36.180 --> 03:12:39.740
now to be a little
[inaudible] here and come

03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:42.670
up -- and look at some terms.

03:12:42.670 --> 03:12:45.420
I've broken things
out into two spheres.

03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:47.000
There's the authoritative
data sphere

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.390
and there's a volunteer
geographic information sphere.

03:12:49.390 --> 03:12:52.700
So I'm going to kind of
go through some terms,

03:12:52.700 --> 03:12:55.770
so there's some common definitions.

03:12:55.770 --> 03:12:59.950
First, authority and we
use this all the time.

03:12:59.950 --> 03:13:05.560
And it is -- my understanding of
it is it's the legal responsibility

03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:08.900
by a public agency to conduct
business for the public good.

03:13:08.900 --> 03:13:10.710
That's what authority is.

03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:13.230
We have an authoritative
data source.

03:13:13.230 --> 03:13:17.700
It has legal authority that's
really important to collect data

03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:21.180
for specific business purposes.

03:13:21.180 --> 03:13:28.060
And BGN and their staff constantly
remind me of what they are supposed

03:13:28.060 --> 03:13:32.070
to do and things that they're
not supposed to necessarily do.

03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:36.010
Okay, authoritative data is
officially recognized data

03:13:36.010 --> 03:13:38.630
that comes from the
authoritative source.

03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:41.920
There are data stewards, this
is the entity within that source

03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.070
that has a responsibility
for collecting data.

03:13:44.070 --> 03:13:47.550
That's often confused with
the authoritative data source.

03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:51.100
And then you've got certified
data and uncertified data.

03:13:51.100 --> 03:13:54.830
Certified data is data that's been
vetted by an authoritative source

03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:58.520
and has legal standing,
that's really important.

03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:03.480
The name has legal standing for
-- between federal agencies,

03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:05.440
not necessarily the state
governments or anybody else,

03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:08.160
but it does have legal
standing for --

03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:10.840
between federal agencies,
the place name.

03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:13.880
There's uncertified data, which
you kind of think of is either data

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:15.510
that hasn't been quite
vetted yet, has --

03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:16.960
hasn't been anointed

03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:21.870
or its supporting data
for those place names.

03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:27.530
Okay, the volunteer data
sphere has two types of --

03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:30.090
I kind of use the notion
of friendship

03:14:30.090 --> 03:14:31.390
because that's what you're dealing

03:14:31.390 --> 03:14:33.410
with when you're working
with volunteers.

03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:36.160
There's two types of data sources,
I call them strangers of the night

03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:39.170
and friendships of utility.

03:14:39.170 --> 03:14:42.040
There is shadow sources,
we used to --

03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:45.160
we used this in partial data
all the time and we were talking

03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:48.220
at lunch how it comes
-- how people are --

03:14:48.220 --> 03:14:50.110
take government data and
then provide it to you,

03:14:50.110 --> 03:14:52.590
and then you have no idea
where this came from.

03:14:52.590 --> 03:14:54.880
You have no idea the
currency of the data.

03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:58.840 position:56%
We call that the sources, the shadow
source, the data is shadow data

03:14:58.840 --> 03:15:01.340
because you really don't
know what that data is.

03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:03.300
There's no way to confirm it.

03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:06.280
Whereas, your friends
are trusted sources.

03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:09.580
This is an entity whose
trust has been earned.

03:15:09.580 --> 03:15:11.060
Please note that.

03:15:11.060 --> 03:15:15.960
Trusted data is data from outside
the authorized process whose

03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:20.550 position:56%
limitations, currency and attributes
can be known and verified.

03:15:20.550 --> 03:15:27.040
Okay, now in the volunteer sphere,

03:15:28.130 --> 03:15:34.820
I have identified three
types of volunteers.

03:15:34.820 --> 03:15:37.970
There's the Type I and II.

03:15:37.970 --> 03:15:39.470
These have infrastructure.

03:15:39.470 --> 03:15:44.130 position:56%
The Type III are the true
volunteers, when you think about it,

03:15:44.130 --> 03:15:45.700
and these have no infrastructure.

03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:49.100
The Type I, these are
intergovernmental cooperatives.

03:15:49.100 --> 03:15:51.760
There might be something signed
where you have some people

03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:53.640
with an organization, they're
working with other people

03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:56.420
and other organizations to kind
of help pull things together.

03:15:56.420 --> 03:16:00.180
You have Type II or
indirect management support

03:16:00.180 --> 03:16:03.330
where an entity -- or where
your boss just tells you, "Well,

03:16:03.330 --> 03:16:06.560
it'd be nice if you could find time
to work on this, but you've got

03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:07.860 position:56%
to get your other stuff done first,"

03:16:07.860 --> 03:16:10.160
and there's no task
involved with that.

03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:14.950
The Type III are individuals that
are outside of the infrastructure

03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:18.730
and their participation
is altruistic.

03:16:18.730 --> 03:16:20.670
One of the big difference
between the Type I and II

03:16:20.670 --> 03:16:23.570
and the Type III is that Type I and
Type II have a paycheck coming in

03:16:23.570 --> 03:16:26.320
and the other folks don't.

03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:27.770
It's a big deal.

03:16:27.770 --> 03:16:32.310
So this is a -- the next
slide shows what it's like.

03:16:32.310 --> 03:16:33.940
We have some sort of
legislative authority

03:16:33.940 --> 03:16:36.790 position:56%
or executive authority that's
provided to an authoritative source.

03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:40.680
In this case I would
say it's the USGS.

03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:41.980
The data steward is BGN.

03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:45.820 position:56%
And then you have GNIS, the
Geographic Names Information System,

03:16:45.820 --> 03:16:50.160
is a processing system that goes
into the authoritative data bucket.

03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:51.720
The GNIS database.

03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:54.710
And out comes the authoritative
data.

03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:58.390
Now the VGI, the volunteer sphere,

03:16:58.390 --> 03:17:00.660
what you have over on
the other side is --

03:17:00.660 --> 03:17:02.900
oh, I need to mention
the one on the bottom.

03:17:02.900 --> 03:17:07.500 position:56%
You have shadow sources and see that
verboten symbol down at the bottom.

03:17:07.500 --> 03:17:11.300
Okay, now what -- doesn't
happen very often

03:17:11.300 --> 03:17:14.630
and it's not very efficient is when
somebody comes from the outside

03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:17.840
and just out of the blue they
provide you with something and say,

03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:20.680
"Well, here, what about this one?"

03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:24.530
That's not where the majority
of the information comes from.

03:17:24.530 --> 03:17:26.730
What happens is always --

03:17:26.730 --> 03:17:29.440
I mean I've looked at some
of the research that's done,

03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:32.830
and they may not like talk about
it, when you go and you look at it,

03:17:32.830 --> 03:17:37.050
there's some funding that goes to
some sort of coordinating entity.

03:17:37.050 --> 03:17:40.120
And in our case, it's
the National Map Corps.

03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:42.780
And what happens is
you have a -- in --

03:17:42.780 --> 03:17:45.710
a shadow source that
comes into the system,

03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:50.130
they provide shadow source
data, which is vetted,

03:17:50.130 --> 03:17:52.030
there's usually an
overhead for that,

03:17:52.030 --> 03:17:54.920
it goes into your trusted bucket,
and then it could be pumped

03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:58.680
into the GNIS processing system.

03:17:58.680 --> 03:18:02.510
And then you have trusted
sources who can go directly

03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:05.700
into your data bucket, or almost
directly into the data bucket,

03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:09.650
and then pumped over into
it, with much less overhead.

03:18:09.650 --> 03:18:12.260
And one of the jobs of the
coordinators is to get people

03:18:12.260 --> 03:18:15.590
to volunteer and the
second one is to move people

03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:18.990
from your shadow sources
to your trusted sources.

03:18:18.990 --> 03:18:23.260
Now it should be done here,
right, but no, no, no.

03:18:23.260 --> 03:18:27.880
Okay, so this is an interesting
diagram for the National Map Corps.

03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:30.080
This is 2014-2015.

03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:34.740
This is when they first started
operationally really getting going.

03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:38.220
And what you found here is they
have, they've got 2000 accounts,

03:18:38.220 --> 03:18:40.640
these are 2000 people who have
registered into the system

03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:44.730
over that time period, and they
provided 125,000 contributions

03:18:44.730 --> 03:18:46.420
in that time period.

03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:47.720
That's pretty good.

03:18:47.720 --> 03:18:49.020
I'll just put this in context.

03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:52.240
I managed a project in
Florida for collecting data.

03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:57.350
Over a year we had four
geography students work

03:18:57.350 --> 03:18:59.440
with us half time and
we were paying them.

03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:02.110
And we were able to
collect 40,000 records

03:19:02.110 --> 03:19:04.020
over the period of about a year.

03:19:04.020 --> 03:19:06.580
So this is really pretty good.

03:19:07.630 --> 03:19:10.400
Next, this is really
an interesting one.

03:19:10.400 --> 03:19:16.400
This is a logarithmic curve
of data provided by user.

03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:19.190
Which states there are a few users
that provide you a whole bunch

03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:22.400
of stuff and the rest
provide just a little.

03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:24.400
This is a universal phenomenon.

03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:25.700
All right.

03:19:25.700 --> 03:19:28.020
Of all the literature that I
read, it happens everywhere.

03:19:28.020 --> 03:19:32.860 position:56%
There's a few people that do all the
work, whether it's the soccer moms,

03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:35.170
there's one person
that's running the show.

03:19:35.170 --> 03:19:40.330
It's the same thing here as it is
in all volunteer organizations.

03:19:40.330 --> 03:19:43.270
It's not that the other
stuff is not important.

03:19:43.270 --> 03:19:46.050
I mean there is data coming
in and usually people do it

03:19:46.050 --> 03:19:50.700
by their interest, their
particular geographic location.

03:19:52.020 --> 03:19:54.650
Now, let's look at coordinators

03:19:54.650 --> 03:19:57.490
and leaders' relationships
to the volunteers.

03:19:57.490 --> 03:20:01.090 position:56%
Your job is to create
authoritative data using volunteers.

03:20:01.090 --> 03:20:02.390
You're a coordinator.

03:20:02.390 --> 03:20:03.690
How are you going to do that?

03:20:03.690 --> 03:20:04.990
What tools do you have?

03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:07.060
You have no authority
over the volunteers except

03:20:07.060 --> 03:20:10.950
to tell them to not participate.

03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:17.070
You have no funds and you can't
give them timeout [laughter].

03:20:17.070 --> 03:20:19.930
So what can you do?

03:20:19.930 --> 03:20:25.140
Okay, now this is something
I always found very valuable.

03:20:25.140 --> 03:20:28.050
A manager's job is to make it
possible for their employees

03:20:28.050 --> 03:20:30.540
or volunteers to do a good job.

03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:34.520
If you ain't doing that, you're
not necessarily a good manager

03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:36.130
as far as I'm concerned.

03:20:36.130 --> 03:20:39.590
I've worked under a number
of them, and you know,

03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:42.550
yeah if you've got a paycheck
coming in, yeah, you'll stay there

03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:44.810
for a while, but you'll be going
looking for something else.

03:20:44.810 --> 03:20:50.310
If you're a volunteer, you're going
to be there for about a minute.

03:20:50.310 --> 03:20:52.930
So, there's three things you
can work on as a coordinator,

03:20:52.930 --> 03:20:56.050
and that is motivation,
quality assurance,

03:20:56.050 --> 03:21:01.210
and working towards improving
the number of trusted sources.

03:21:03.350 --> 03:21:06.810
Okay, so let's first look at
motivating your communities.

03:21:06.810 --> 03:21:08.670
And you'll notice,
I keep circling back

03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:11.300
because there's these concepts kind
of overlap and build on themselves,

03:21:11.300 --> 03:21:16.100
it's almost like a Venn diagram,
or multiple Venn diagrams.

03:21:16.100 --> 03:21:17.400
Okay, so how do you get --

03:21:17.400 --> 03:21:19.140
you increase the participation
of your volunteers?

03:21:19.140 --> 03:21:21.250
Well, you provide them with
recognition and reward.

03:21:21.250 --> 03:21:23.400
It seems pretty simple, but
it's pretty straightforward.

03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:24.700
I got a pen.

03:21:24.700 --> 03:21:28.520
You know, it makes me feel
good and I appreciate that.

03:21:28.520 --> 03:21:29.820
Okay, you make it easy.

03:21:29.820 --> 03:21:31.800
And this is probably one of
the most important things,

03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:34.050
and it's been pointed out
with people I've talked

03:21:34.050 --> 03:21:39.240
to multiple times, is you make
their work, you minimize the amount

03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:42.280
of input that they have to do.

03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:45.820 position:56%
Minimize their work, make it simple.

03:21:45.820 --> 03:21:47.840
Give them tools to work with.

03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:53.510
Provide them training and with
user guides, WebEx is great.

03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:56.860
You know a lot of the travel that
we've done has been cut down simply

03:21:56.860 --> 03:22:00.380
because you can stay in your own
office and talk with a group of 20,

03:22:00.380 --> 03:22:04.390
30 people, and get everything
you get done as if you'd flown

03:22:04.390 --> 03:22:08.160
and got everybody together in one
place and it had taken two days.

03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:09.850
Document success.

03:22:09.850 --> 03:22:13.190 position:56%
One thing you can do is if you've
got a best practice, well, you know,

03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:16.830
you could pay somebody to put
together a best practices document.

03:22:16.830 --> 03:22:19.640
Target specialist communities,
and I'll get back to this again,

03:22:19.640 --> 03:22:21.430
that have an interest
in the resulting data.

03:22:21.430 --> 03:22:24.510
These are Type I, Type II,
and Type III volunteers.

03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:28.020
And accept the idea, and
this is real important one,

03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:31.950 position:56%
that the idea of going beyond your
mission can be a valuable motivator.

03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:35.980
BGN's requirements
are pretty strict.

03:22:35.980 --> 03:22:38.700
And hopefully I'll give
you a way of looking at it

03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:42.490
where maybe you can think about
it a little differently and kind

03:22:42.490 --> 03:22:45.770
of go beyond that --
those boundaries.

03:22:45.770 --> 03:22:48.100
All right.

03:22:48.100 --> 03:22:49.400
Quality Assurance.

03:22:49.400 --> 03:22:52.450
There's a misconception crowd
source data is unreliable.

03:22:52.450 --> 03:22:57.330
Remember that little
verboten, you know, source?

03:22:57.330 --> 03:22:58.890
Well, when people --

03:22:58.890 --> 03:23:03.920
Nancy [inaudible] and I call
these people the "Yeah but'ers."

03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:06.690
You know people don't really
understand what's going on.

03:23:06.690 --> 03:23:08.760
Don't understand the
complexity of the system.

03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:12.070
And you know, you tell them
something, what you've been working

03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:16.920 position:56%
on for a year, and they say, without
thinking much about it, "Yeah, but."

03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:18.610
That's pretty much, you know.

03:23:18.610 --> 03:23:20.620
So people like tend
to condemn things

03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:22.780
without having really
looked into it.

03:23:22.780 --> 03:23:24.080
So there's a bunch of things

03:23:24.080 --> 03:23:27.020
that you can actually do
to assure data quality.

03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:28.400
There's self-regulation.

03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:30.320
The Wikipedia approach is great.

03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:32.900
I mean, I give money
to that organization.

03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:35.090
Peer review is a wonderful thing.

03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:36.810
It's really good info.

03:23:36.810 --> 03:23:38.960
You need to make it simple.

03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:40.450
I've already talked about that.

03:23:40.450 --> 03:23:42.440
You need to develop data
checking procedures,

03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:43.790
and I'll get back to that.

03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:46.530
Whether it's sampling, you can go
and sample the data that's coming

03:23:46.530 --> 03:23:49.250
in by volunteers, or
there's automation processes

03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:50.750
that are being developed.

03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:54.650
And track and evaluate the
data input by provider.

03:23:54.650 --> 03:24:03.240 position:56%
Which leads us right into creating a
trusted data source, which the core

03:24:03.240 --> 03:24:07.160
of it is tracking and
evaluate the data by provider.

03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:08.820
That's how it's done.

03:24:08.820 --> 03:24:11.430
Because what you're doing
is developing familiarity

03:24:11.430 --> 03:24:14.050
with what the person
is providing you.

03:24:14.050 --> 03:24:19.380
And if a person's doing a good
job, then what you should do, or --

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:22.800
and actually what the National Map
Corps does is they create levels

03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:27.190 position:56%
of responsibility or authority based
on the track record of the provider.

03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:32.250
So you -- those super providers are
provided with a fast track pathway

03:24:32.250 --> 03:24:35.150
into the authoritative data sphere.

03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:36.450
That's key here.

03:24:36.450 --> 03:24:41.280
National Map Corps identifies these
super providers as advance editors.

03:24:41.280 --> 03:24:45.540 position:56%
They have -- they've got 200
entries and they're good, all right,

03:24:45.540 --> 03:24:46.840
you can trust that person.

03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:48.140
It's like your friend.

03:24:48.140 --> 03:24:49.440
You can count on them.

03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:51.270
Make use of that.

03:24:51.270 --> 03:24:53.370
This is an interesting diagram.

03:24:53.370 --> 03:24:58.540
This is the data they
provided in the past.

03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:02.500
Well, since 2012-2015,
these are data points just

03:25:02.500 --> 03:25:04.320
from the National Map Corps.

03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:06.250
And you can look -- there's
two really interesting things

03:25:06.250 --> 03:25:07.600
about this.

03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:10.240
One is there's a lot of points.

03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:13.210
The other one is you look
at Nevada and you go, "Wow,

03:25:13.210 --> 03:25:15.810
they ain't doing much in Nevada."

03:25:15.810 --> 03:25:19.980
Well, you know, if you know
anything about Nevada, 82,

03:25:19.980 --> 03:25:22.990
and actually the I have to
preface this by the focus

03:25:22.990 --> 03:25:26.060
on the data they're
collecting is structures,

03:25:26.060 --> 03:25:28.180
emergency management,
schools, etcetera.

03:25:28.180 --> 03:25:32.450
If you know anything about
Nevada, it's 82% federal land.

03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:34.820
So is that little border of --

03:25:34.820 --> 03:25:38.380
there's a lot of federal land in
that border in California too.

03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:40.190
Now the other one is Iowa.

03:25:40.190 --> 03:25:42.190
See Iowa is yellow, right?

03:25:42.190 --> 03:25:43.490
It's all yellow.

03:25:43.490 --> 03:25:44.790
This is pretty interesting.

03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:47.340
This is somebody on
the logarithmic curve.

03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:48.810
On the end of it, there's a --

03:25:48.810 --> 03:25:52.100
I was told that from the
National Map Corps folks,

03:25:52.100 --> 03:25:56.520
that there was this young lady
in, I think she was in Iowa,

03:25:56.520 --> 03:25:59.700
and she got interested --
she's like 15 -- 14, 15.

03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:01.220
And she got interested
in career paths

03:26:01.220 --> 03:26:05.300
and found the National Map Corps
and got interested in putting data

03:26:05.300 --> 03:26:08.680
in for over the summer, and got
interested in putting data in,

03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:11.600
and then got focused on cemeteries.

03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:15.660
And so over the summer, four or
five hours a day, she punched in --

03:26:15.660 --> 03:26:18.790
she -- those are mostly
cemeteries --

03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:22.400
she punched in a lot
of cemeteries in Iowa.

03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:24.900
Okay, so if you want to know
anything about cemeteries,

03:26:24.900 --> 03:26:27.430
you could talk to that little lady.

03:26:27.430 --> 03:26:31.920
And so that's a best practice
that should be documented.

03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:34.050
And there's great value in that.

03:26:34.050 --> 03:26:38.850
This is another very interesting --
I mean it kind of goes back to some

03:26:38.850 --> 03:26:42.360
of what I've been talking about.

03:26:42.360 --> 03:26:47.730
This is the National Map Corps,
this is the number of providers.

03:26:47.730 --> 03:26:51.170
Starts over the period of year,
I think this is 2014 and 2015.

03:26:51.170 --> 03:26:52.510
That's the bar graph.

03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:56.260
Those blocks up there are
things that they've done.

03:26:56.260 --> 03:26:57.750 position:56%
From newsletters that have gone out.

03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:59.340
Things of that nature.

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:00.870
Well there's two peaks.

03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:03.930
See two peaks in there where,
or that the line is the number

03:27:03.930 --> 03:27:06.870
of active providers, okay?

03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:11.430 position:56%
So the first peak was a call that
went out from the National Map Corps

03:27:11.430 --> 03:27:13.830
to reach 100,000 records.

03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:15.300
See that peak?

03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:20.300 position:56%
And the next one was a map challenge
that they made to their volunteers,

03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:21.930
who said, "Okay, here's
something to do.

03:27:21.930 --> 03:27:23.690
Let's -- got to make that happen."

03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:25.150
So these things that they do,

03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:30.360
if you've got a good coordinating
entity and you fund these people,

03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:32.020
and I know I've kind
of been a coordinator

03:27:32.020 --> 03:27:38.490
and people have a tendency not to
fund them, you can get a lot done.

03:27:38.490 --> 03:27:42.420
Okay, now I've never met this
woman, but she's my buddy.

03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:43.870
Laura Kostanski.

03:27:43.870 --> 03:27:46.620
She's from Australia and
she wrote an article called

03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:48.320
"Crowd-Sourcing Geospatial
Information

03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:50.050
for Government Gazetteers."

03:27:50.050 --> 03:27:55.170
It's like a 60-page research paper
that she did by talking to --

03:27:55.170 --> 03:27:56.470
well she came from Australia.

03:27:56.470 --> 03:27:57.850
I think she was the
gazetteer person there.

03:27:57.850 --> 03:28:01.000
She went to the United
States, England, Scandinavia,

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:05.600 position:56%
the Netherlands, and she interviewed
like, well 20 entities, private

03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:09.420
and public, and she gave
up 10 lessons learned.

03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:14.340
I call these the 10 commandments of
volunteer geographic information.

03:28:14.340 --> 03:28:16.870
And I'm just going to
march through these

03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:23.030
because I think it's --
oh, oh, no, I was right.

03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:27.760
One is focus on the end user.

03:28:27.760 --> 03:28:29.060
You need to motivate them.

03:28:29.060 --> 03:28:31.120
There needs to be something
in it for them.

03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:32.900
You can't do just what you want.

03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:35.990
You've got to do what they want.

03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:38.750
And this is -- the second
one is don't rely solely

03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:40.050
on digital technology.

03:28:40.050 --> 03:28:41.560
Here in the U.S., everybody's
got it,

03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:44.670
but in the undeveloped
countries, maybe not.

03:28:44.670 --> 03:28:47.230
You can use a map and
a pen and paper

03:28:47.230 --> 03:28:49.590
and collect information that way.

03:28:49.590 --> 03:28:52.870 position:56%
The other thing to recognize is
your volunteers can only do so much.

03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:55.830
So don't like fire
your staff and try to,

03:28:55.830 --> 03:28:57.470
you know, just hire volunteers.

03:28:57.470 --> 03:28:59.710
It's just not going to happen.

03:28:59.710 --> 03:29:03.090
So, you're going to have to
be able to fill in those gaps.

03:29:03.090 --> 03:29:05.920 position:56%
You're going, you know, the idea is
to make it simple for the volunteers

03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:07.220 position:56%
so they can get that information in.

03:29:07.220 --> 03:29:08.520
Well, you may have to fill out some

03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:11.190
of the other information
that goes along with it.

03:29:11.190 --> 03:29:13.340
Be happy with what
users want to provide.

03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:16.270
Give them guidance
and scope, etcetera.

03:29:16.270 --> 03:29:19.500
Okay, you also need to work with
these special interest groups,

03:29:19.500 --> 03:29:23.620 position:56%
Type I, Type 2, Type 3, all of them.

03:29:23.620 --> 03:29:26.030
These include state and
federal agencies, other --

03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:29.060
and I know the Census Bureau
works with BGN and provides data,

03:29:29.060 --> 03:29:30.440
but there's others
like the Department

03:29:30.440 --> 03:29:35.230 position:56%
of Natural Environmental Protection,
parks and recs, school systems,

03:29:35.230 --> 03:29:40.280
state GIS boards, the
NGO's, borders, hikers,

03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:45.890
those people all have an interest
in providing or having name data.

03:29:45.890 --> 03:29:54.360
Okay, and then provide easy and
simple assessable technology.

03:29:54.360 --> 03:29:56.730
I mean these were her
lessons learned, okay.

03:29:56.730 --> 03:30:00.240
The National Map Corps doing
a real good job about that.

03:30:00.240 --> 03:30:02.150
Develop policies for
quality assurance.

03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:06.280
There's a great focus on
that, using both kind of like,

03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:12.650
you're using both a lesson you're
providing them with how to do it,

03:30:12.650 --> 03:30:17.170
as well as procedures for
checking the information.

03:30:17.170 --> 03:30:18.470
Track entries.

03:30:18.470 --> 03:30:21.100 position:56%
I mean this was kind of what was
already done and what they're doing.

03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:23.950
Provide greater responsibility
to your trusted sources

03:30:23.950 --> 03:30:26.300
and give rewards and
attention to the volunteers.

03:30:26.300 --> 03:30:30.930
This is tangible things such as
data points and some of the places

03:30:30.930 --> 03:30:33.900
where they need information
real quick, cash.

03:30:33.900 --> 03:30:35.730
Give them, you know, if you
really need to collect data

03:30:35.730 --> 03:30:39.330 position:56%
in an emergency management situation
or in an undeveloped country,

03:30:39.330 --> 03:30:41.010
provide, you know,
people collect data,

03:30:41.010 --> 03:30:43.020
if it's good, pay them something.

03:30:43.020 --> 03:30:45.110
That's a real good motivator.

03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:48.550
Intangible things, this is
communication, improved information

03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:50.790
for the user groups
and more independence.

03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:53.540
And most importantly, I
think very importantly here,

03:30:53.540 --> 03:30:59.760
is to reevaluate your data
spectrum to attract user interest.

03:30:59.760 --> 03:31:05.930
I know what the requirements
are for the GNIS.

03:31:05.930 --> 03:31:09.500
And it's written out,
very specifically,

03:31:09.500 --> 03:31:12.190
and in a federal agency it's
really hard to wander from that

03:31:12.190 --> 03:31:14.160
and I hope I have a solution here.

03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:18.390
But, provide unofficial data,
along with official data.

03:31:18.390 --> 03:31:20.470 position:56%
This is target the data to the users

03:31:20.470 --> 03:31:24.760
but also not only points,
but lines and polygons.

03:31:24.760 --> 03:31:27.270
That's what people
really want to use.

03:31:27.270 --> 03:31:30.150
It's been talked about multiple
times on what value there is,

03:31:30.150 --> 03:31:33.790
by being able to have a point, have
a place name, that's on a point,

03:31:33.790 --> 03:31:36.510
and then connect that
to a footprint.

03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:39.790
And then offsite trusted sources.

03:31:39.790 --> 03:31:41.930
Okay, so let's look at
offsite trusted sources

03:31:41.930 --> 03:31:43.340
and how I think this might happen.

03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:45.070
So you have your authoritative
data sphere

03:31:45.070 --> 03:31:47.030
and you have your trusted
data sphere.

03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:53.140 position:56%
My suggestion is that you -- the BGN
provides guidelines to the state.

03:31:53.140 --> 03:31:55.790
The state geographic
information counsels for example.

03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:58.910 position:56%
They have databases in there, right?

03:31:58.910 --> 03:32:03.370 position:56%
Tell them what it's supposed to look

03:32:03.370 --> 03:32:07.950
like for an unofficial
names database.

03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:09.980
They can do what they want to.

03:32:09.980 --> 03:32:11.840
They can hook up shape piles to it.

03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:13.820
They can put the lines and
the footprints in there.

03:32:13.820 --> 03:32:15.860
They probably already have them.

03:32:15.860 --> 03:32:17.600
Get them -- get some
way to encourage them

03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:22.880
to get those things connected
together with the GNIS ID and then,

03:32:22.880 --> 03:32:25.380
you know -- so that will
be available to the people

03:32:25.380 --> 03:32:26.910
in that particular state.

03:32:26.910 --> 03:32:29.820
And then over time, you can use
that tool to be able to pull stuff

03:32:29.820 --> 03:32:32.970
into your system, and if ever
it happens that, you know,

03:32:32.970 --> 03:32:34.560
you get the authority to put
those lines and polygons,

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:35.860
they'll be sitting there.

03:32:40.200 --> 03:32:46.230
Okay, I used to have a boss when I
first started with technology field

03:32:46.230 --> 03:32:47.720
and I'd go over and talk to him.

03:32:47.720 --> 03:32:51.690
I was in the technical part and
he's the policy-type person,

03:32:51.690 --> 03:32:54.640
and he would give us kind of a
work order to do and I'd walk over

03:32:54.640 --> 03:32:56.210
and talk to him and then
we'd discuss things.

03:32:56.210 --> 03:32:58.040
And I'd say, "Well,
what about this?"

03:32:58.040 --> 03:32:59.340
Or, "What about that?"

03:32:59.340 --> 03:33:02.510
And his response was
always, "And do that too."

03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:05.010
[ Laughter ]

03:33:05.010 --> 03:33:06.310
Now, I kind of cut
back on the number

03:33:06.310 --> 03:33:07.610 position:56%
of things I suggested after a while.

03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:09.480
[ Laughter ]

03:33:09.480 --> 03:33:15.310
But this is my "And Do
That Too" list for BGN.

03:33:15.310 --> 03:33:18.440
And I'm just completely ignoring,
you know, all practicalities

03:33:18.440 --> 03:33:21.200
and budget and everything else.

03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:22.760
First of all, a user
needs assessment.

03:33:22.760 --> 03:33:24.060
Oh, you see this "LK?"

03:33:24.060 --> 03:33:30.910 position:56%
That's Laura Kostanski's Commandment
One and Commandment Four.

03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:33.980
That's how that all matches up.

03:33:33.980 --> 03:33:38.220 position:56%
Okay, so do a user needs assessment.

03:33:38.220 --> 03:33:40.350 position:56%
These are not very complicated to do

03:33:40.350 --> 03:33:41.650
if you've got the right
people doing it.

03:33:41.650 --> 03:33:44.170
You can do phone calls
and just ask people.

03:33:44.170 --> 03:33:49.250
Do a user needs assessment
by organization to figure

03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:51.720
out what they really want and
then kind of start thinking

03:33:51.720 --> 03:33:53.880
about how you can like,
if they can get something,

03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:56.620
it has to be a win-win
for everybody.

03:33:56.620 --> 03:33:58.630
Go to State GIS organizations.

03:33:58.630 --> 03:34:01.730
There's a National States
Geographical Information Board

03:34:01.730 --> 03:34:03.290
where all those folks get together.

03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:06.650
It'd be a really good way if you've
got a plan set out, to communicate

03:34:06.650 --> 03:34:08.900
with these folks about what
you'd like to have happen,

03:34:08.900 --> 03:34:13.460
such as giving them with a
suggestion, put on the table,

03:34:13.460 --> 03:34:20.490
that whole notion of guidelines
for an offsite names database.

03:34:20.490 --> 03:34:21.790
Challenges.

03:34:21.790 --> 03:34:25.420
Identify tasks to be
completed for particularly

03:34:25.420 --> 03:34:26.720
where you've got your gaps.

03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:29.620
I mean, it's not only for
outside, but also inside.

03:34:29.620 --> 03:34:32.410
And allow users to
identify data opportunity.

03:34:32.410 --> 03:34:35.920 position:56%
One of the things in the effort that
we did in Florida was that I found

03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:39.070
out that at the state
level, the Department

03:34:39.070 --> 03:34:43.620
of Education had a database of
all schools and coordinates.

03:34:43.620 --> 03:34:46.060
So we took that data
and pushed it into GNIS,

03:34:46.060 --> 03:34:47.900
as part of what we were doing.

03:34:47.900 --> 03:34:52.250
But of course, they're -- that
database still sits with just that.

03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:57.720
So my suggestion is that you would
have somebody that's identified a

03:34:57.720 --> 03:34:59.600
data source, or whatever
the heck that it happens

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:01.610
to be -- this is just an example.

03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:03.050
They can send a letter to BGN.

03:35:03.050 --> 03:35:08.320 position:56%
BGN could say, yeah, this seems like
a good project, we trust this guy.

03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:13.550
Send a letter to the Department of
Education, give it an introduction,

03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:17.570
anoint this person
to go talk to him.

03:35:17.570 --> 03:35:20.840
And then they could put their
proposal forward, which would be,

03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:23.820
hey, this is how this
whole thing fits together,

03:35:23.820 --> 03:35:27.010 position:56%
because they have no idea about this
BGN and the [inaudible] database.

03:35:27.010 --> 03:35:30.140
This is how it all works,
if we put the unique idea

03:35:30.140 --> 03:35:34.470
in here we can use this --
we could use this to be able

03:35:34.470 --> 03:35:38.430
to pull this data together,
do what the previous --

03:35:38.430 --> 03:35:40.880
we talked about connecting
everything together.

03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:43.580
And we can keep that
up on a regular basis.

03:35:43.580 --> 03:35:47.400
And then, by the way, we'll put the
names in for you, and all you got

03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:51.340
to do is add a field and
dump it into your database,

03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:55.330
which is about a four
hour work order, you know.

03:35:55.330 --> 03:35:56.630
I mean -- and you're there.

03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:58.370
I mean, it could work.

03:35:58.370 --> 03:36:01.540
So it's actually, you know, kind
of pushing the whole business

03:36:01.540 --> 03:36:02.900
of giving, you know,

03:36:02.900 --> 03:36:08.550
more responsibility to
your trusted sources.

03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:11.530
Provide access to official
and unofficial data.

03:36:11.530 --> 03:36:13.380
Kind of talked about that.

03:36:13.380 --> 03:36:16.430
Footprints, lines of polygons,
that's what people really want.

03:36:16.430 --> 03:36:19.820
It's okay, you already sell that
point in the middle of Russia,

03:36:19.820 --> 03:36:22.590
that's not nearly as good
as polygons, all right?

03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:27.600 position:56%
So if you got a state park or a city
park, points great but you really --

03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:29.510
I mean, if you're local -- I
mean, it's great if you're looking

03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:32.060
at the national level, but a
local level you really would

03:36:32.060 --> 03:36:35.000
like to have access to that
polygon [inaudible] index

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.220
or a dictionary to the polygon.

03:36:37.220 --> 03:36:39.900
It ties things together for you.

03:36:39.900 --> 03:36:43.380
And publish successful
data collection procedures.

03:36:43.380 --> 03:36:46.770
Run out and grab that little
girl in Iowa and get her to write

03:36:46.770 --> 03:36:49.690
down what her procedures are.

03:36:49.690 --> 03:36:51.340
Okay, so here's the conclusion.

03:36:51.340 --> 03:36:56.590
VGI, crowd sourcing, can be used
to create authoritative data.

03:36:56.590 --> 03:36:59.300
I truly believe so.

03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:03.800
It's here now, it's being done,
it's been done for 10 years.

03:37:03.800 --> 03:37:06.910
And to paraphrase an
alleged Chinese curse,

03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:12.040
the future will be
interesting time [laughter].

03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:14.520
Okay, here's my references
[inaudible] number right there.

03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:15.820
Questions?

03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:18.610
I have no idea where I was.

03:37:18.610 --> 03:37:21.510
I wasn't looking at you.

03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:31.910
[ Applause ]

03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:36.260
&gt;&gt; Yes. So what do you
think about [inaudible] now?

03:37:36.260 --> 03:37:41.440
&gt;&gt; David Stage: You know, I know a
whole lot about the OpenStreetMap,

03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:43.330
where I've read [inaudible]
said, I mean,

03:37:43.330 --> 03:37:45.300
she seemed like she
pretty much liked the idea.

03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:48.060
But one of the things that I did
note, which is not a direct answer

03:37:48.060 --> 03:37:52.560
to your question, is that I think
it may have been OpenStreetMaps,

03:37:52.560 --> 03:37:54.520
and I can't -- I forget
which one it was.

03:37:54.520 --> 03:37:57.770
But when they talked about --
somebody talked with them about,

03:37:57.770 --> 03:38:00.250
you know, taking on
the responsibility

03:38:00.250 --> 03:38:05.400 position:56%
of providing authoritative data,
and they said, no, we don't do that.

03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:09.860
It's like it's a government job
to do those sorts of things,

03:38:09.860 --> 03:38:11.490
and we just can't handle that.

03:38:11.490 --> 03:38:18.610
But she did suggest [inaudible]
did suggest that the entities,

03:38:18.610 --> 03:38:26.850 position:56%
you know -- I mean, VGN would
[inaudible] she talked to would work

03:38:26.850 --> 03:38:30.710
out relationships with Google
or OpenStreetMaps to upright

03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:35.140
within that volunteer sphere,
that's the way I would describe it.

03:38:35.140 --> 03:38:36.480
&gt;&gt; I think it's really interesting

03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:38.400
because it is -- it's
a very fine line.

03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:43.460
I mean, you could see a time
obviously authority plays a role

03:38:43.460 --> 03:38:48.600
and that's a role that is being --
it's government's responsibility

03:38:48.600 --> 03:38:50.810
to make sure that the
names are official,

03:38:50.810 --> 03:38:52.160
and to work within the process.

03:38:52.160 --> 03:38:57.460
So if you can imagine a world where
social media totally [inaudible],

03:38:57.460 --> 03:39:02.080
so we can say, oh, Washington
D.C. is trending, oh,

03:39:02.080 --> 03:39:04.630
it's Washington D.C. [laughter].

03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:08.420
Thirty seconds later, oh,
no longer, it's Miami again.

03:39:08.420 --> 03:39:15.710
You know, the crowd can be tickled,
but the crowd is very powerful.

03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:19.620
And this is really something
that's going to be worked

03:39:19.620 --> 03:39:22.550
out in the next few years.

03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:28.690
&gt;&gt; I don't know if
you are [inaudible]

03:39:28.690 --> 03:39:33.560
but they've done something somewhat
similar to this, but they didn't go

03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:35.600
out to the crowd overall.

03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:42.200
Like in their mapping system you
can say, oh, I'm in this hotel

03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:49.860
and I want to know
where I can [inaudible],

03:39:49.860 --> 03:39:54.390
you can do that [inaudible].

03:39:54.390 --> 03:40:02.410
But the way they did it was
[inaudible] Chambers of Commerce

03:40:02.410 --> 03:40:05.420
of each area and got them to agree
[inaudible] business interest

03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:06.780
that way and they get
the Chamber of Commerce

03:40:06.780 --> 03:40:08.500
to then maintain the [inaudible]
into the mapping agency.

03:40:08.500 --> 03:40:09.800
It's more of a common [inaudible].

03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:11.690
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Yeah, I could
see where that would work.

03:40:11.690 --> 03:40:13.130
I mean, that would be a source,
because there's other stuff, like,

03:40:13.130 --> 03:40:14.510
you know, the peaks on a
mountain and creeks and rivers,

03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:15.950
and all those sorts of things
that maybe they wouldn't have.

03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:17.290
But if would be a very
good data source.

03:40:17.290 --> 03:40:18.970
I mean, that's what
you're suggesting here,

03:40:18.970 --> 03:40:21.540
is it would be an excellent data
source to look at the Chamber

03:40:21.540 --> 03:40:23.870
of Commerce as -- I mean, that's
the people that have an interest

03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:26.550
in these sorts of things, so maybe
you should contact them and figure

03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:28.110
out what their business
interests are,

03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:32.640
and figure out how
it connects together.

03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:33.960
Yeah.

03:40:33.960 --> 03:40:41.560
&gt;&gt; As people interact with the
digital mapping [inaudible]

03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:47.510
and they interact in their
environment and record things

03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:53.680
out [inaudible] in these
open source mapping systems,

03:40:53.680 --> 03:40:58.030
what do you see is the
potential for creating new names

03:40:58.030 --> 03:41:01.620
and getting acceptance
for those names

03:41:01.620 --> 03:41:04.110
that somehow then become
[inaudible]?

03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:06.720
&gt;&gt; David Stage: That would be --
you know, I'd go back to the model

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:09.270
where is you've got a source
of information that goes

03:41:09.270 --> 03:41:13.880
into this sphere, you've got
this place where it can operate.

03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:15.460
Where so if you have -- you know,

03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:18.480
if you have like an entity that's
actually collecting this --

03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:21.470
this information or this
data, I mean, you know,

03:41:21.470 --> 03:41:25.190
one of the suggestions -- you
know, I could just [inaudible].

03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:27.440
One of the suggestions that
I would make is, you know,

03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:30.730
provide these people with some
guidelines on what to do, you know.

03:41:30.730 --> 03:41:33.550
And if they can meet
it, then they're more

03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:38.480
of a trusted source than, you know,

03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:40.520
if they didn't have
that information.

03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:42.130
And so you can see
somebody that's actually --

03:41:42.130 --> 03:41:45.200
or some entity or some
application that's doing something

03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:47.730
of this nature, and then you
provide them the guidelines,

03:41:47.730 --> 03:41:52.230
and they're following them, then
it kind of moves that person

03:41:52.230 --> 03:41:56.840
from a shadow source more
towards a trusted source.

03:41:56.840 --> 03:42:01.830
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] bottom up move
of naming where people begin

03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:04.050
to accept the name and then

03:42:04.050 --> 03:42:06.180
that name becomes authoritative
[inaudible].

03:42:06.180 --> 03:42:08.220
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Oh, as
opposed to BGN looking

03:42:08.220 --> 03:42:11.550
at it and saying yay or nay?

03:42:11.550 --> 03:42:15.390
&gt;&gt; I'd have trouble with
that personally [laughter].

03:42:15.390 --> 03:42:16.690
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Yes?

03:42:16.690 --> 03:42:19.700
&gt;&gt; My question actually
[inaudible] that.

03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:22.980
You mentioned authoritative
[inaudible] through BGN.

03:42:22.980 --> 03:42:24.910
But I'm a geography teacher

03:42:24.910 --> 03:42:28.230
and my authoritative
source is my curriculum,

03:42:28.230 --> 03:42:32.190
so right now my curriculum actually
has me teaching [inaudible] names

03:42:32.190 --> 03:42:33.490
of places.

03:42:33.490 --> 03:42:34.790
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Well --

03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:40.030
&gt;&gt; So what do you see as the
future of [inaudible] maps?

03:42:40.030 --> 03:42:41.860
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Well
[inaudible] has aliases in it,

03:42:41.860 --> 03:42:46.720
and they have a single [inaudible]
ID and they have one name that sits

03:42:46.720 --> 03:42:50.960
on top and they have aliases
and you can pull them all up,

03:42:50.960 --> 03:42:54.310 position:56%
and it seems to work, if you ask me.

03:42:54.310 --> 03:42:56.880 position:56%
[Inaudible] names, but you really --

03:42:56.880 --> 03:43:00.450
I mean, you can just see an
[inaudible] management you got

03:43:00.450 --> 03:43:02.940 position:56%
like a single name here and somebody
says something that's not sitting

03:43:02.940 --> 03:43:06.480
up on the top, somebody calls in
and says, I'm at such and such.

03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:10.660
Well, if you got -- you can
call that name up, you know,

03:43:10.660 --> 03:43:13.290
with technology, and match
it up with the real name,

03:43:13.290 --> 03:43:14.910
and match it up with coordinates.

03:43:14.910 --> 03:43:18.540
I mean, that's how that whole
linking together stuff works.

03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:21.540
So, you know, conceptually,
I mean, that's --

03:43:21.540 --> 03:43:25.480
the technology pulls that
all together for you.

03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:27.860
&gt;&gt; If I could ask Helen
maybe to stand up.

03:43:27.860 --> 03:43:34.220
She can -- has seen how different
countries handle this dual naming

03:43:34.220 --> 03:43:36.560
or it's called by different things.

03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:40.490
And maybe you could
just mention that.

03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:46.250
So do you want to come up the mic?

03:43:46.250 --> 03:43:52.120 position:56%
I think this is a very
interesting issue and it's a very --

03:43:52.120 --> 03:43:55.300
it's a challenging one
and it's an emerging one.

03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:57.510
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Well, first
I guess this dual naming

03:43:57.510 --> 03:44:02.350
or multiple naming at an official
level, an authoritative level.

03:44:02.350 --> 03:44:04.870
And I think there are many
countries across the world now

03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:12.270
who are processing more than one
name for a feature or a place.

03:44:12.270 --> 03:44:18.880
For example I showed you Norway and
[inaudible] this morning, in Sweden

03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:21.790
and in Finland there's more
than one name for places.

03:44:21.790 --> 03:44:27.000
Australia has, Canada has, and
I could go on further than that.

03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.160 position:56%
So that's sort of an official level.

03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:33.800
At the unofficial level, as
you've heard about the --

03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:41.490
from David now, Sweden has had a
project where they collected names

03:44:41.490 --> 03:44:47.310
on a cell phone and that was with
an app that they had produced

03:44:47.310 --> 03:44:49.510
in [inaudible] and they did it

03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:52.610
for just one city, it
was a pilot project.

03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:55.960
They collected I think quite a lot
of names, but haven't found a way

03:44:55.960 --> 03:44:57.940
of processing it, but
have passed these

03:44:57.940 --> 03:45:02.420
over to the municipality
for potential use.

03:45:02.420 --> 03:45:06.590
There are I guess other
people who are trying this out

03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:10.630
but haven't quite found
a way of working it

03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:13.380
in with their names of authority.

03:45:13.380 --> 03:45:16.350
And the example of
Denmark that was given,

03:45:16.350 --> 03:45:19.650
I saw a demo of their database
and heard about it last week,

03:45:19.650 --> 03:45:21.900
and I think that's a
very interesting concept.

03:45:21.900 --> 03:45:25.120
Maybe it's a much smaller
country, but they, for instance,

03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:27.720
would like to say,
well, I'm at point X,

03:45:27.720 --> 03:45:33.950
what administrative unit am I in,
what's my -- where do I go to vote?

03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:37.480
In other words they want to
have multiple links on this.

03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:41.320
And they were gathering
names from various sources,

03:45:41.320 --> 03:45:44.690
like the police were
interested in putting names in,

03:45:44.690 --> 03:45:47.580
and obviously they would be
one of the trusted sources.

03:45:47.580 --> 03:45:52.490 position:56%
And this would be, again, for such
a rescue [inaudible] emergency uses.

03:45:52.490 --> 03:45:56.100
So I think Denmark was making
a lot of progress on this.

03:45:56.100 --> 03:46:00.510
Other Scandinavian countries, such
as Norway and Sweden were wanting

03:46:00.510 --> 03:46:04.770
to put into their databases what
they call points of reference,

03:46:04.770 --> 03:46:08.650
and this might be even down to
the level of sort of restaurants.

03:46:08.650 --> 03:46:10.010
But then they have
to be very careful

03:46:10.010 --> 03:46:14.790
to keep commercial names
separated from other names.

03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:18.990
But, again, it's all a
question of use, I think,

03:46:18.990 --> 03:46:21.220
for probably emergencies.

03:46:21.220 --> 03:46:24.540
I think that's what happened
with the street mapping examples

03:46:24.540 --> 03:46:29.790 position:56%
like in Haiti when [inaudible] great
collection of names very suddenly

03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:33.730
to meet a particular situation,
but that doesn't mean to say

03:46:33.730 --> 03:46:36.270
that they were terribly reliable.

03:46:36.270 --> 03:46:38.730
It doesn't mean to say they
have been maintained since.

03:46:38.730 --> 03:46:42.180
So I guess there were many
questions on this name,

03:46:42.180 --> 03:46:45.070
both at the official level
and the unofficial level.

03:46:45.070 --> 03:46:48.520
And for many authorities
I think it's --

03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:52.810
even with the steps provided, it
still takes a lot of resources,

03:46:52.810 --> 03:46:54.340
and I guess that's really how

03:46:54.340 --> 03:46:58.800
to even start doing
it is a big question.

03:46:58.800 --> 03:47:00.100
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Yeah, I mean,
[inaudible] good example

03:47:00.100 --> 03:47:01.400
of one of them personally.

03:47:01.400 --> 03:47:04.410
I can say anything personally.

03:47:04.410 --> 03:47:06.640
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Yeah,
that's not just names, is it?

03:47:06.640 --> 03:47:07.940
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Hon?

03:47:07.940 --> 03:47:09.450
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: That's
not just names?

03:47:09.450 --> 03:47:10.750
&gt;&gt; David Stage: This is the
name and the coordinate.

03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:12.050
&gt;&gt; Helen Kerfoot: Yeah.

03:47:12.050 --> 03:47:13.350
&gt;&gt; David Stage: This is the
name and the coordinate.

03:47:13.350 --> 03:47:14.650 position:56%
To be honest with you, I do not know
what other information they collect,

03:47:14.650 --> 03:47:16.950
and there's a lot of other
things that goes along with it.

03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:20.660
You know, other -- there's the
authoritative process where a lot

03:47:20.660 --> 03:47:23.490
of stuff is collected
[inaudible] database.

03:47:23.490 --> 03:47:25.340
And so this is like
the minimal information

03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:28.000
to get things like moving.

03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:29.300
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell:
Thank you very much.

03:47:29.300 --> 03:47:31.100
&gt;&gt; David Stage: Thank you.

03:47:31.100 --> 03:47:38.090
[ Applause ]

03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:39.620
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: And
I should be clear on this,

03:47:39.620 --> 03:47:43.590
because sometimes there
is some confusion.

03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:48.850
For names in the United States
there is one official name

03:47:48.850 --> 03:47:50.940
that the BGN provides.

03:47:50.940 --> 03:47:56.230
For foreign names there may
be multiple approved names.

03:47:56.230 --> 03:48:00.510
So that's just the way it is.

03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:05.080
[ Laughter ]

03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:07.730
But you can imagine if some
countries have multiple languages,

03:48:07.730 --> 03:48:10.500
some countries have multiple
languages that apply only

03:48:10.500 --> 03:48:13.890
in certain areas [inaudible]
run through multiple countries.

03:48:13.890 --> 03:48:17.510
So it's not quite as
easy in those situations.

03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:20.080
Our final speaker today
I'm very pleased

03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:22.720
to introduce, Mr. Juan Valdes.

03:48:22.720 --> 03:48:26.940 position:56%
He is the Geographer and Director of
Editorial and Cartographic Research

03:48:26.940 --> 03:48:29.780
at the National Geographic Society.

03:48:29.780 --> 03:48:33.420
He is responsible for ensuring
the accuracy and consistency

03:48:33.420 --> 03:48:36.790
of National Geographic
maps and products.

03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:40.900 position:56%
Now approaching 40 years of service,
he has worked in one capacity

03:48:40.900 --> 03:48:43.960
or another on every
type of map produced

03:48:43.960 --> 03:48:49.040
by the National Geographic Society,
including map supplements, globes,

03:48:49.040 --> 03:48:53.810
page maps, dynamic mapping
platform, and five additions

03:48:53.810 --> 03:48:58.030
of National Geographic's
renowned Atlas of the world.

03:48:58.030 --> 03:49:01.000
National Geographic is
internationally recognized

03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:04.310
for their exceptional cartography.

03:49:04.310 --> 03:49:08.910 position:56%
Mr. Valdes will conclude our
presentations with an insider's view

03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:12.020
of geographic names and the
association between the BGN

03:49:12.020 --> 03:49:14.460
and the National Geographic.

03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:16.260
Thank you very much.

03:49:16.260 --> 03:49:22.510
[ Applause ]

03:49:22.510 --> 03:49:25.120
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:49:25.120 --> 03:49:28.330
&gt;&gt; Juan Jose Valdes:
All right, very good.

03:49:28.330 --> 03:49:30.690
Well, on behalf to the
National Geographic Society,

03:49:30.690 --> 03:49:34.200
I would like to extend our
congratulations to the U.S. Board

03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:37.670
on Geographic Names on its
[inaudible] centennial.

03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:39.930
And I'm going to take you in
a very different direction

03:49:39.930 --> 03:49:41.570
than the last two presenters.

03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:43.540
I'm going to give you some history

03:49:43.540 --> 03:49:46.460
as to the relationship
between organizations.

03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:50.080
And in putting this paper together,
I found out a lot of information

03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:55.370
that really I couldn't put
down on less than 33 slides.

03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:56.790
I could have been here
for a couple of hours,

03:49:56.790 --> 03:50:00.580
so I condensed this
as much as possible.

03:50:02.020 --> 03:50:05.530
Prompted by a desire to share
their scientific interests, ideas,

03:50:05.530 --> 03:50:07.790
and findings, the 33 founders

03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:10.870
of the National Geographic Society
first met in the Cosmos Club

03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:16.040
in Washington D.C. on
January 13th, 1888.

03:50:16.040 --> 03:50:21.670
Among them were four men; John
Wesley Powell, Henry Gunnett,

03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:25.960
Marcus Baker, and Herbert G. Ogden.

03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:28.120
Powell played a key role
in promoting the creation

03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:32.100
of a special government board
to deal with geographic names.

03:50:32.100 --> 03:50:36.560
Two years later, Henry Gunnett, the
father of government cartography,

03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:42.430
along with Ogden and Baker
would be among the first members

03:50:42.430 --> 03:50:43.960
of a board created for the purpose

03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:48.400 position:56%
of standardizing geographic names
throughout the executive departments

03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:52.950
of the government, the U.S.
Board on Geographic Names.

03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:55.410
In the beginning, National
Geographic relied

03:50:55.410 --> 03:50:59.830
on cartographic houses to produce
most of its maps, like the Russia

03:50:59.830 --> 03:51:05.380
in Europe inset in the
January 1898 issue.

03:51:05.380 --> 03:51:09.200
[Inaudible] source on
this map was its producer,

03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:12.290
Dodd Mead and Company publishers.

03:51:15.530 --> 03:51:18.890
Place name conventions were first
addressed in the August 1890 issue

03:51:18.890 --> 03:51:20.870 position:56%
of the National Geographic Magazine.

03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:24.340
Herbert G. Ogden, now a
Society vice president,

03:51:24.340 --> 03:51:27.830
and Marcus Baker contributed
to an article entitled,

03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:30.620
"A Geographic Nomenclature."

03:51:30.620 --> 03:51:32.650
Of [inaudible] was there suggestion

03:51:32.650 --> 03:51:35.500
that a board should be formed
consisting of representatives

03:51:35.500 --> 03:51:38.360
from the different departments
and bureaus in Washington.

03:51:38.360 --> 03:51:42.350
They issued maps, charts, and
other publications requiring

03:51:42.350 --> 03:51:44.790
geographic names.

03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:46.680
This issue also contained
an appendix

03:51:46.680 --> 03:51:50.530
which presented the British,
French and German systems

03:51:50.530 --> 03:51:55.300 position:56%
for the autography and pronunciation
of foreign geographic names.

03:51:55.300 --> 03:51:59.050
It also stated that all Society
publications would follow the rules

03:51:59.050 --> 03:52:04.930
adopted in 1855 by the Royal
Geographical Society in London.

03:52:04.930 --> 03:52:10.030
Later, in April 30th, 1891,
Herbert G. Ogden reported

03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:12.610
on President Harrison's
creation of the U.S. Board

03:52:12.610 --> 03:52:17.600
on Geographic Names on
September 4th, 1890.

03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:19.930
Interesting enough,
Ogden titled the piece,

03:52:19.930 --> 03:52:23.230
"The American Board
of Geographic Names."

03:52:23.230 --> 03:52:26.230
It addressed the composition of
the board, 10 representatives

03:52:26.230 --> 03:52:28.660
from different departments
and bureaus of the government,

03:52:28.660 --> 03:52:32.100
and included its first bulletin,
which announced the adoption

03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:34.780
of the English system for the
treatment of foreign place names

03:52:34.780 --> 03:52:38.770
and transliterations
into Roman characters.

03:52:38.770 --> 03:52:42.960
In the July 1986 issue,
Henry Gunnett expounded

03:52:42.960 --> 03:52:45.780
on the accomplishments of
the board, noting the number

03:52:45.780 --> 03:52:48.140 position:56%
of meetings it had held to date, 48,

03:52:48.140 --> 03:52:53.100
and the number of decided
cases, 2835.

03:52:53.100 --> 03:52:55.740
He also defended the
board from its detractors,

03:52:55.740 --> 03:52:59.070
noting that geographic names
may be broadly distinguished

03:52:59.070 --> 03:53:03.650
into two classes, "Those which
are established by local usage,

03:53:03.650 --> 03:53:07.250
and those which are
not so established."

03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:10.800
[Laughter] I had to read
that a couple of times.

03:53:10.800 --> 03:53:14.290
He stressed that in regard to the
former class, the primary principle

03:53:14.290 --> 03:53:16.620
which controls the
decisions of the board is

03:53:16.620 --> 03:53:20.260
that commonly local usage
[inaudible] prevail.

03:53:20.260 --> 03:53:25.150
Although Puerto Rico had been
among the first names to be adopted

03:53:25.150 --> 03:53:30.340
by the board, many including
renowned Geologist, Robert T. Hill,

03:53:30.340 --> 03:53:35.220
as the title of his March
1899 article attests,

03:53:35.220 --> 03:53:38.480
continued to promote
the use of the variant

03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:43.360
if not archaic form of
the name, Porto Rico.

03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:47.250
Nine months after this
publication, his --

03:53:47.250 --> 03:53:49.870
of his article, Hill continued
the debate over the name

03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:52.650
of the newly seated territory
by making an elaborate case

03:53:52.650 --> 03:53:57.490
for the adoption of Porto Rico
as the islands conventional name.

03:53:57.490 --> 03:54:01.140
His view of the board was
clearly expressed in the first

03:54:01.140 --> 03:54:04.530
of the five points in his argument.

03:54:04.530 --> 03:54:09.230
In that same issue, John Hyde,
the magazine's interim editor,

03:54:09.230 --> 03:54:11.800
refuted Hill's points, stressing

03:54:11.800 --> 03:54:16.680
that the National Geographic
Society regards the board as one

03:54:16.680 --> 03:54:20.200
and only standard of authority
on geographic nomenclature as far

03:54:20.200 --> 03:54:24.910
as the government and people of
the United States are concerned.

03:54:24.910 --> 03:54:26.330
So there you go [laughter].

03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:30.360
To emphasis the Society's
support of the board,

03:54:30.360 --> 03:54:31.660
Gilbert Hobygrovner
[assumed spelling],

03:54:31.660 --> 03:54:34.100
the magazine's first
managing editor,

03:54:34.100 --> 03:54:38.860
began publishing it's decisions
in the August 1900 issue,

03:54:38.860 --> 03:54:43.280
and would do so periodically
until March of 1907.

03:54:43.280 --> 03:54:46.340
When warranted, the
magazine informed its readers

03:54:46.340 --> 03:54:48.830
about the board's special reports.

03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:51.730
In this case one on the list
showing approved spellings

03:54:51.730 --> 03:54:56.450
for 4000 coastal place
names in the Philippines.

03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:59.370
To compliment the Korea
and Manchuria map insert,

03:54:59.370 --> 03:55:01.840
the board's pronunciation
guide for place names

03:55:01.840 --> 03:55:03.980
in Eastern Asia was republished

03:55:03.980 --> 03:55:08.670
as a ready reference feature
in the March 1904 issue.

03:55:08.670 --> 03:55:12.530
The editor justified it's
inclusion by stating that,

03:55:12.530 --> 03:55:16.390 position:56%
"The breaking out of the war between
Russia and Japan is bringing trouble

03:55:16.390 --> 03:55:18.570
to every household in the land.

03:55:18.570 --> 03:55:21.510
For place names of Korea and
Manchuria are spelled differently

03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:24.990
by different newspapers,
and on different maps.

03:55:24.990 --> 03:55:27.740
A system which is simple,
easy of application,

03:55:27.740 --> 03:55:30.990
and which if generally followed
reduces these variations

03:55:30.990 --> 03:55:32.720
of spellings to a minimum.

03:55:32.720 --> 03:55:34.890
Therefore, use this guide."

03:55:34.890 --> 03:55:39.240
The March 1905 issue
continued a lengthy article

03:55:39.240 --> 03:55:41.520
on the [inaudible] history
of the United States.

03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:44.340
Its aim was to let the readers
know that among the best ways

03:55:44.340 --> 03:55:49.880 position:56%
to determine the history of a place,
be it a region, city, mountain,

03:55:49.880 --> 03:55:52.670
or body of water, was by its name.

03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:56.130
A premise that still
holds true today.

03:55:56.130 --> 03:56:00.250
While the July 1905 issue contained
a listing of the board's decisions

03:56:00.250 --> 03:56:03.910
from April through June of that
year, it would be the first

03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:05.750
and last time the decisions

03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:08.350
on foreign names would
appear in the magazine.

03:56:08.350 --> 03:56:11.940
On occasion the magazine
notified its readers

03:56:11.940 --> 03:56:14.210
of key board related events.

03:56:14.210 --> 03:56:17.710
Here, President Roosevelt's
January 1906 extension

03:56:17.710 --> 03:56:23.740
of the board's responsibility was
duly noted in the March 1906 issue.

03:56:23.740 --> 03:56:25.940
In the July 1906 issue,

03:56:25.940 --> 03:56:30.150
which featured the first wildlife
photograph, signaled a start

03:56:30.150 --> 03:56:33.510
of the magazine's move from
a purely scientific journal

03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:36.930
to becoming an illustrated
monthly magazine.

03:56:36.930 --> 03:56:42.420
To this end, the March 1907 issue
was the last to carry decisions

03:56:42.420 --> 03:56:46.800
on the United States
Geographic Board.

03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:49.960
Three years after it's
formation, in March 1915,

03:56:49.960 --> 03:56:54.500 position:56%
National Geographic's Map Department
published its first map supplement,

03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:56.970
the Western Theatre of War.

03:56:56.970 --> 03:57:01.410
It was described and promoted
as, "Presenting a complete

03:57:01.410 --> 03:57:05.420
and authoritative survey
of all places, forests

03:57:05.420 --> 03:57:07.440
and river systems figuring

03:57:07.440 --> 03:57:11.440
in the [inaudible] dispatches
from the western front."

03:57:11.440 --> 03:57:14.660
Among the sources used to produce
this map insert were official maps

03:57:14.660 --> 03:57:17.110
of the French and Belgium
Departments of War,

03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:20.490
with place name assistance
from the board.

03:57:20.490 --> 03:57:23.230
Adherence to the board's
policy was not only prevalent

03:57:23.230 --> 03:57:27.680 position:56%
in place name usage in the Society's
second insert map of Africa,

03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:30.040
but in its equivalence
table as well.

03:57:30.040 --> 03:57:31.740
The table emphasized the use

03:57:31.740 --> 03:57:35.320
of the board's approved
British transliteration system,

03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:37.060
and the spelling of native names,

03:57:37.060 --> 03:57:41.230
and in expressing the English sound
equivalence of French, Italian

03:57:41.230 --> 03:57:42.810
and Portuguese spellings.

03:57:42.810 --> 03:57:45.900
Soon our other maps would
follow his convention,

03:57:45.900 --> 03:57:48.460
including our first Political Map

03:57:48.460 --> 03:57:52.740
of the World published
in December of 1922.

03:57:52.740 --> 03:57:56.490
The December 1944 issue of the
Society's new map supplement

03:57:56.490 --> 03:57:59.750
of the Soviet Union boasted
that it was the first

03:57:59.750 --> 03:58:02.450
and only available detailed
map of Soviet Russia

03:58:02.450 --> 03:58:04.670
with place names in English.

03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:06.640
It promoted the fact
that the spelling of more

03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:09.920
than 8000 place names with
the English alphabet was

03:58:09.920 --> 03:58:14.050
in itself a formidable task,
a task made much easier

03:58:14.050 --> 03:58:15.710
with the assistance of the board.

03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:21.820 position:56%
In 1958 [inaudible] 70th anniversary
of the Society's founding,

03:58:21.820 --> 03:58:23.310
a new map series was started

03:58:23.310 --> 03:58:27.420
in which the entire world
was mapped, region by region.

03:58:27.420 --> 03:58:29.510
The maps in this series
would eventually evolve

03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:32.080
into [inaudible] published in the
first edition Atlas of the World

03:58:32.080 --> 03:58:35.230
in 1963, and would go on to serve

03:58:35.230 --> 03:58:39.250
as a cartographic platform
for all future editions.

03:58:39.250 --> 03:58:43.430
Per Society policy, both the
domestic and foreign name branches

03:58:43.430 --> 03:58:44.950
of the board were consulted

03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:49.170
on appropriate place
name usage on all plates.

03:58:49.170 --> 03:58:52.960
In announcing the publication
the revised sixth edition Atlas,

03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:56.610
the November 1992 geographica
feature noted

03:58:56.610 --> 03:59:01.830
that every map naming any part
of either Yugoslavia or the USSR,

03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:04.320
even a map of Alaska, which
shares the Bering Straits

03:59:04.320 --> 03:59:06.240
with Russia, changed.

03:59:06.240 --> 03:59:11.450
And here's where I vividly
recall a former geographer,

03:59:11.450 --> 03:59:14.790 position:56%
Ted Dakara [assumed spelling], going
to BGN offices on a weekly basis

03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:18.270
and coming back with reams and
reams of place name changes,

03:59:18.270 --> 03:59:21.780
and the new countries
of Eastern Europe.

03:59:21.780 --> 03:59:27.210
This is the way we used to do place
name changes in the past, by hand.

03:59:27.210 --> 03:59:29.270
Slow and meticulous process.

03:59:29.270 --> 03:59:33.760
The 1990s witnessed the
introduced a new feature titled,

03:59:33.760 --> 03:59:35.060
"Behind the Scenes."

03:59:35.060 --> 03:59:37.940
It was intended to provide our
readers with an inside look

03:59:37.940 --> 03:59:40.830 position:56%
into the workings of the geographic.

03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:44.950
The November 1995 issue contained a
piece on Kazakhstan's new spelling

03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:46.970
as confirmed by the board.

03:59:46.970 --> 03:59:49.950
Ironically, after changing our
maps to reflect the new spelling,

03:59:49.950 --> 03:59:53.650
and promoting this piece,
the ancient Kazakhstan was

03:59:53.650 --> 03:59:55.880
to be restored a mere two
years later [laughter].

03:59:55.880 --> 04:00:01.460
As you've seen the Society's first
began disseminating BGN approved

04:00:01.460 --> 04:00:04.970
place names in its journals quickly
to be followed by its supplement,

04:00:04.970 --> 04:00:10.270
page maps, globes, atlases, apps
and other cartographic products,

04:00:10.270 --> 04:00:15.860
including our giant traveling maps
for students, which averaging 26

04:00:15.860 --> 04:00:20.530
by 35 feet in size, are the
largest maps we have ever produced.

04:00:20.530 --> 04:00:22.750
Our cartographic line
still adheres to some

04:00:22.750 --> 04:00:25.530
of the place name conventions
whose origins can be traced back

04:00:25.530 --> 04:00:28.640
to the early day sort of the
U.S. Board on Geographic Names,

04:00:28.640 --> 04:00:31.750
including the prolific use
of conventional place names

04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:35.340
for cultural and physical features.

04:00:35.340 --> 04:00:39.270
For shared geographic features.

04:00:39.270 --> 04:00:42.830
For variant place names.

04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:46.170
For transliterated place names.

04:00:46.170 --> 04:00:50.540
As well as for contentious
place names.

04:00:50.540 --> 04:00:52.770
Today the collaboration
between the Society

04:00:52.770 --> 04:00:55.280
and the board remains
as strong as ever.

04:00:55.280 --> 04:00:58.050
Any pertinent information
that we obtain,

04:00:58.050 --> 04:01:01.520
in this case the Cuban
government's official announcement

04:01:01.520 --> 04:01:06.570
on the creation of two new
provinces on January 1st of 2011,

04:01:06.570 --> 04:01:08.460
it's quickly shared
not only with the BGN

04:01:08.460 --> 04:01:11.200
but with our colleagues at state.

04:01:11.200 --> 04:01:16.040
So in keeping with John Hyde's
comments in the December 1899 issue

04:01:16.040 --> 04:01:19.490
of National Geographic, the Society
has always regarded the U.S. Board

04:01:19.490 --> 04:01:24.020 position:56%
on Geographic Names as the authority
on geographic nomenclature.

04:01:24.020 --> 04:01:28.100
A fact that is duly addressed
in the Geographic Style Manual,

04:01:28.100 --> 04:01:31.290
which is accessible
to the entire world.

04:01:32.700 --> 04:01:35.050
And one that we will
surely recognize

04:01:35.050 --> 04:01:38.510
in the board's bicentennial.

04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:53.080
[ Applause ]

04:01:53.080 --> 04:01:54.380
Questions?

04:01:54.380 --> 04:01:59.470
No questions?

04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:01.830
Okay.

04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:03.130
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Okay.

04:02:03.130 --> 04:02:04.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

04:02:04.430 --> 04:02:06.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Jose Valdes:
Thank you very much.

04:02:06.230 --> 04:02:11.380
[ Applause ]

04:02:11.380 --> 04:02:12.830
&gt;&gt; Douglas Caldwell: Okay.

04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:17.640
Again, I would like to thank
the Library of Congress

04:02:17.640 --> 04:02:18.980
for hosting the event,

04:02:18.980 --> 04:02:23.240
and the Philip Lee Phillips
Society for their sponsorship.

04:02:23.240 --> 04:02:26.090
I'd like to thank the
Special Communications,

04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:29.030
in particular the former chair,

04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:32.400
Meredith Wessington [assumed
spelling], who is [inaudible] now

04:02:32.400 --> 04:02:35.960
and not able to be with us today.

04:02:35.960 --> 04:02:37.930
I'd also to thank Mike
Fornier [assumed spelling]

04:02:37.930 --> 04:02:42.050
from the Census Bureau who helped
originate the idea for this

04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:43.350
and got it off the ground.

04:02:43.350 --> 04:02:45.350
And I'd like the members

04:02:45.350 --> 04:02:47.970
of the Special Communications
Committee to please stand up.

04:02:47.970 --> 04:02:49.270
So, thank you.

04:02:49.270 --> 04:02:52.510
So they've done all the
work that's gone into --

04:02:52.510 --> 04:03:00.580
[ Applause ]

04:03:00.580 --> 04:03:03.700
I'd also like to thank the agencies
that provided financial support

04:03:03.700 --> 04:03:07.160
for the event, including the Forest
Service, the Library of Congress,

04:03:07.160 --> 04:03:10.100
the Department of State, the
U.S. Army Corp of Engineers,

04:03:10.100 --> 04:03:12.930
and the U.S. Geological Survey.

04:03:12.930 --> 04:03:15.970
In particular I'd like to thank
our speakers who made this

04:03:15.970 --> 04:03:19.780
such a wonderful event today, and
shared knowledge that you just --

04:03:19.780 --> 04:03:21.440
you just can't find elsewhere.

04:03:21.440 --> 04:03:25.320
This is the experience
and the insight

04:03:25.320 --> 04:03:28.730
that just is not available
elsewhere,

04:03:28.730 --> 04:03:31.100
so I really want to
thank our speakers.

04:03:31.100 --> 04:03:33.750
And most of all I'd like
to thank you for coming.

04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:37.400
I tell you, our Geographic
Names would not be functioning

04:03:37.400 --> 04:03:40.760
without the support of the
public, and the interest,

04:03:40.760 --> 04:03:42.750
and the input and everything.

04:03:42.750 --> 04:03:45.430
And so I really appreciate
your coming today

04:03:45.430 --> 04:03:49.090
to share our birthday party.

04:03:49.090 --> 04:03:51.400
So now at this time we're
going to be moving downstairs

04:03:51.400 --> 04:03:54.280
to the Geography and Map
Division, which is in the basement,

04:03:54.280 --> 04:03:58.720 position:56%
for a very special open house, where
the staff has prepared a display

04:03:58.720 --> 04:04:01.970
of artifacts relating to
geographic names in general,

04:04:01.970 --> 04:04:04.120
and the BGN in particular.

04:04:04.120 --> 04:04:07.090 position:56%
You'll not only have a chance to see
rare materials that are not usually

04:04:07.090 --> 04:04:11.030
on display for the public, but
you will also have the opportunity

04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:13.790
to mingle with [inaudible].

04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:17.850
The exhibit will close
promptly at 5:00 p.m.,

04:04:17.850 --> 04:04:20.510
so without further ado, thank you.

04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:24.060
[ Applause ]

04:04:24.060 --> 04:04:27.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
