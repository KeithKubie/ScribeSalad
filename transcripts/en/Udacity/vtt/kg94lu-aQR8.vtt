00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.630
So as a brief quiz or thought

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.540
question, let's think about some approaches for coping

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.300
with the scalabilty associated with the control

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.420
and data plane separation. One could, for example,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.850
eliminate redundant data structures in the controller.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.470
Or only perform control operations for a limited

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.020
number of network operations, such as only performing

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.880
control operations for routing decisions. One might send

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.950
all traffic through the controller to minimize

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.310
forwarding decisions that routers and switches need

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.070
to make. One could cache forwarding decisions

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.440
in the switches, or run multiple controllers.
