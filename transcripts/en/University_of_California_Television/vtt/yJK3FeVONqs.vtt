00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.922
(whooshing)

00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:03.683
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV
program is presented

00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:06.422
by University of California Television.

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:07.626

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:14.158
to keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:21.995
(playful piano music)

00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:25.831
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.164
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:34.345
Long the master of
fire, tools and language

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:37.762
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.517
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:48.251
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:50.939
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.022
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:55.225
We shape the future

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:58.725
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.570
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.737
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.205
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.288
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:33.268
(dramatic piano music)

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:38.426
(light whooshing)

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:45.500
(ambient shimmering)

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:49.805
(ambient shimmering)

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:12.106
- That's kind of a
gruesome picture, isn't it?

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.031
But I like to imagine Darwin
in the dissecting room,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.603
actually helping us all out.

00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:20.996
So this is a lecture that's
an experiment for me.

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:21.831
It's shifting the focus.

00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.117
All of my previous lectures
about evolution and medicine

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.255
have been about traits, things like height

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.779
and pneumonia and cancer and all the rest.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.150
Today, I'm gonna shift
gears and try to apply

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.279
the things we've learned
about how to analyze

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.556
why traits are vulnerable
to disease, and ask instead

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.408
why genes that cause disease
persist in the genome,

00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:43.088
despite the actions of natural selection.

00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:44.943
Evolutionary medicine,
just to be very clear,

00:02:44.943 --> 00:02:47.219
is not a specialized method of practice.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.407
There's nothing alternative
about it whatsoever.

00:02:49.407 --> 00:02:52.182
It's simply applying the
well-established basic principles

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:55.368
from evolutionary biology to
medicine and public health

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:58.296
and trying to use them
to improve human health.

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.272
So the central question
I've been preoccupied by is

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:01.838
why do bodies have traits

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:03.959
that make them vulnerable to disease?

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:04.792
Completely different from

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:06.912
the usual medical research question.

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:10.269
Most medical research is about
why people are different.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.213
Our interest is instead
about why we are all the same

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.380
in ways that are kind of like
the gas tank on the Pinto.

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:20.315
There are things about our bodies,

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:21.789
from our backs to our appendices.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.983
Well, we'll get to that in a moment.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:25.454
The first half of medical school,

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:29.960
you must react with awe if
you're paying attention at all.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.703
The Loop of Henle in the
kidney, no details now,

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:34.633
but, oh, my gosh, if you're not astounded,

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.243
you're not paying attention.

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:39.155
Everybody recognizes
how great the heart is

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.286
and the valves in the right
place at the right time,

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:44.049
and the pump does not need
to be oiled every few months.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.959
The eye is miraculous in the
fact of its astounding function

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.727
although it's actually not well-designed.

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:54.233
The human hand is almost equally good

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:57.443
in terms of all of those
muscles and tendons and joints

00:03:57.443 --> 00:04:01.949
working in tandem to allow
us to do amazing things.

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.088
The clotting mechanism had
better work well or else,

00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:07.418
and then the part of
biology that I thought

00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:10.238
was absolutely ridiculous and stupid

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:12.927
and at least made me mad
when I was a medical student,

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:15.184
and now I find fascinating
because I've taken

00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:17.971
an evolutionary viewpoint, is biochemistry

00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.580
and intermediary metabolism.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.577
(audience laughing)

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:23.162
For any students in the
audience, I assure you,

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.050
don't pay attention to your professors.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.999
Go to evolutionary
thinking about these things

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.969
and it will make sense.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.541
That's the first half of medical school.

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.592
Second half, you get into the
clinic and what do you see?

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:33.172
Somebody goofed.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.465
You start off with wisdom teeth, why?

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:39.538
You go further to the appendix, whoa!

00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:41.408
You go further to the place in your arm

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:43.853
that always breaks when you fall forward?

00:04:43.853 --> 00:04:44.959
Why isn't it bigger?

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.743
The coronary arteries,
couldn't they just be

00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:48.916
a little bit wider, please?

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.381
And as for that birth
canal, why not just have

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.593
a zipper in the front instead of...

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.501
(audience laughing)

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.986
And then there's the spine,
as I mentioned before.

00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:59.592
The body could be so much better

00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:00.495
in so many different ways.

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:03.357
These are traits, not genes, just traits,

00:05:03.357 --> 00:05:05.669
and the old answer about
why natural selection

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.833
didn't do a better job is, well,

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.288
it's a random process
and it's not that strong.

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:13.472
That is absolutely one
important contribution

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:16.142
to why bodies aren't
better, but it's only one,

00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:19.292
and a foundation for
evolutionary thinking in medicine

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:20.560
has been to analyze

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.773
every kind of vulnerability of a trait

00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:26.259
in terms of six possible
different evolutionary reasons

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.009
why we're vulnerable.

00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:30.363
I'm going to list them very quickly.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.103
I've given many, many lectures about these

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.742
applying to traits, they're on
the web if you're interested.

00:05:34.742 --> 00:05:37.779
Today, I'm gonna zip through
them and apply them to genes.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.477
One is natural selection just can't do it.

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.192
Two is we're living in an environment

00:05:42.192 --> 00:05:45.434
very different from the
environment in which we evolved.

00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:47.495
Three is that pathogens,
bacteria and viruses

00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:50.040
evolve faster than we do.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.149
Four is trade-offs;
nothing can be perfect.

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.361
Everything can be adjusted
in ways that are better

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:57.088
but at the cost of making
something else worse.

00:05:57.088 --> 00:05:59.327
Five, and this is a deep one,

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:02.391
natural selection does not
shape any organism for health

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.725
or longevity or happiness or cooperation.

00:06:04.725 --> 00:06:07.093
It shapes all of them for maximizing

00:06:07.093 --> 00:06:09.244
their ability to transmit their genes.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.859
Very disturbing idea.

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:13.876
The last is useful defenses
that seem like diseases,

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:16.014
such as fever, pain, nausea,

00:06:16.014 --> 00:06:18.779
vomiting, cough and all the rest.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.074
Now, I'm gonna shift though, my usual talk

00:06:21.074 --> 00:06:24.589
and give up on talking about
traits, and ask about genes,

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.998
the focus of so much modern
medical research, and ask,

00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:31.743
why do genes that increase
risk of disease persist?

00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:34.638
And the first thing I recognized
as I started down this path

00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:37.391
is that we don't need to just
talk about the usual foci

00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:40.984
of medical research,
which are the myriad kinds

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.746
of specific variations in genes

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:44.609
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:46.159
We also need to talk about genes

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.386
that we all share, that are fixed,

00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:51.116
fixed means we all have it,

00:06:51.116 --> 00:06:53.504
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:55.076
This led me to just say
there's four different kinds

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.892
of genes we should be thinking about.

00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:59.621
First are the regular
ones, widespread variation,

00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:02.232
all the regular genetic studies.

00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:05.091
Two, variation between populations.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.478
DARC is a gene that almost
everyone in Africa has

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:10.794
because it protects against vivax malaria.

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:14.362
Hardly anyone living in
northern climates has this gene.

00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:16.769
Fixed or missing genes
for everybody recently.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.492
Recently, the past few million years.

00:07:19.492 --> 00:07:24.230
The one that Ajit Varki
studies, Neu5Gc and GLO,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.199
more about those in just a moment.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.188
The fourth category is
genes that we all have,

00:07:29.188 --> 00:07:32.151
such as genes that make bilirubin,

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:35.317
and genes that make dopamine,

00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:37.880
all of which make us
vulnerable to disease.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.892
So, a big shift in thinking
here, not just variations

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.298
among individuals and
their different genes,

00:07:42.298 --> 00:07:44.051
but genes that we all have

00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:46.080
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.056
The first reason, limits of selection.

00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:49.741
Selection can't do things,

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:54.154
and the biggest limit to
selection is mutations happen.

00:07:54.154 --> 00:07:58.552
About 60 to 130 per
individual per generation,

00:07:58.552 --> 00:08:00.923
and a deep question for another time is

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:03.465
how on earth the genome
can fail to melt down

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:06.045
given the difficulty of
getting rid of each of those,

00:08:06.045 --> 00:08:07.614
but they are all gradually

00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:09.874
selected out by natural selection,

00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:13.139
except that natural selection's
by no means all powerful.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.472
There's something that
geneticists call drift,

00:08:15.472 --> 00:08:17.204
which is really referring
to random factors

00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:19.900
that make genes become more or less common

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.901
just by luck of the draw,

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.500
not because of anything pushing them

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.944
to higher or lower frequencies.

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:28.148
This can result in good genes being lost

00:08:28.148 --> 00:08:30.963
and good genes becoming more common.

00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:33.565
Here is the biggest question that faces us

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:35.259
in medical genetics today.

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:38.098
We all thought, just about 15 years ago,

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:39.926
that the highly heritable diseases,

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:42.864
such as schizophrenia,
autism, bipolar disease,

00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:45.265
and things like diabetes and all the rest,

00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:46.913
that they were highly heritable,

00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:49.552
we know their variation in these diseases

00:08:49.552 --> 00:08:51.146
is caused by genetic variations,

00:08:51.146 --> 00:08:53.547
so we should be able to find the genes

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:55.188
and fix these diseases.

00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:56.427
This has been one of the greatest

00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:58.744
disappointments in modern medicine.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:00.226
We're making some progress, but,

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.143
it was a huge disappointment.

00:09:02.143 --> 00:09:05.728
This is a graph done by
one of my former students

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:08.447
in this college looking at
genes for schizophrenia.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.811
I say genes, what I really mean,

00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.772
for the technically inclined, is alleles.

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:13.224
That is, different variations

00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:17.174
that influence risk of
something like schizophrenia.

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:20.508
These are ones that are
relatively uncommon,

00:09:20.508 --> 00:09:22.568
and they have relatively large effects.

00:09:22.568 --> 00:09:24.124
Increase in the risk of schizophrenia

00:09:24.124 --> 00:09:26.138
by as much as five to 10 times,

00:09:26.138 --> 00:09:28.586
but they're very, very rare.

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:31.561
These re alleles that
are relatively common,

00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.595
and their effect on schizophrenia

00:09:33.595 --> 00:09:35.368
is really quite tiny.

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:39.221
They increase the risk by 1% or 2% or 3%.

00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:42.927
Notice that they all
fall on the same line.

00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:46.048
Notice next that there
are no genes over there.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:46.881
There are no effects.

00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:50.042
There are no common genes of large effect.

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:51.506
What happened to them?

00:09:51.506 --> 00:09:55.635
Natural selection eliminated
them is the main hypothesis.

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:57.998
But, more important here,

00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:00.825
all of these genes have the exact same

00:10:00.825 --> 00:10:03.201
proportion of variants explained,

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:07.017
and the data proportion
of variants is 0.04%,

00:10:07.017 --> 00:10:11.288
which is a teensy, teensy,
teensy amount of explanation.

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:12.715
This has been terribly frustrating.

00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:17.011
A gene that causes less than 5% of 5%

00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:19.049
is not gonna get you very far in terms of

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:20.987
explaining these diseases.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.516
Sickle Cell Disease has been the exemplar

00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:23.731
for evolutionary medicine,

00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:26.827
but I'd like to suggest to
you, it's a very poor exemplar.

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:29.012
It's interesting, because of the mechanism

00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:32.508
that maintains the
frequency of the alleles

00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:34.935
that cause Sickle Cell Disease.

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.481
It was first discovered, actually, in part

00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.389
by colleagues of mine at Michigan,

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:39.825
Jim Neil and his colleagues,

00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:41.415
and they pointed out that

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:42.298
when they went to Africa and looked at

00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:44.926
the distribution of malaria

00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:47.691
and the distribution
of Sickle Cell Disease,

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:50.087
it was about the same.

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.222
And, then they thought about it

00:10:51.222 --> 00:10:52.935
more deeply in a genetic way,

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:54.993
and recognized something that's called

00:10:54.993 --> 00:10:57.457
balancing selection, this maintains

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:00.953
the frequency of the alleles
that cause Sickle Cell Disease.

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:02.219
You have to have two of them

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:05.242
to get the Sickle Cell Disease
at a certain frequency.

00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:07.913
If you have two regular hemoglobin copies,

00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:09.681
you're vulnerable to Malaria,

00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:11.621
but you don't get Sickle Cell Disease.

00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:14.456
If you have two of the Sickle
Cell kinds of hemoglobin,

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:17.067
you get severe disease, often dying young,

00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:19.481
and usually not being able to reproduce.

00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:21.249
But, if you have one of each,

00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:24.393
and you're living in Africa
where the malaria is common,

00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:26.355
or around the Mediterranean,
where it's common,

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:28.491
it's not just Africa,

00:11:28.491 --> 00:11:30.149
you get some malaria protection,

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:32.052
and the anemia is not too severe.

00:11:32.052 --> 00:11:33.538
These people do better in terms of

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:36.403
having more offspring than these or these,

00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:39.693
and this means that, so long
as that gene isn't too common,

00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:41.327
if it gets too common then a lot of people

00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:42.953
get two copies, and it's terrible.

00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:46.318
If it's really rare, no
benefit, but middle range.

00:11:46.318 --> 00:11:50.404
Fascinating example, but
again, it's not a great example

00:11:50.404 --> 00:11:52.512
because what natural selection

00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:54.208
does when these kind of things happen

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.120
is find some other solution.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.990
This has only been going
on for 10 to 20,000 years,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.859
and we don't have very many other examples

00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.484
of balancing selection.

00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:04.544
I say this because so
many of my colleagues,

00:12:04.544 --> 00:12:05.756
especially in psychiatry,

00:12:05.756 --> 00:12:09.224
are constantly making up
stories about possible traits,

00:12:09.224 --> 00:12:10.331
like schizophrenia for instance,

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:12.223
resulting from heterozygote advantage

00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:13.524
or balancing selection.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.328
Usually, not much evidence for that

00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:18.360
except for other kinds
of hemoglobinopathies

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.872
to protect against malaria.

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.434
There are a few others, but
it's not a common explanation,

00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:24.150
shouldn't be the exemplar.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.497
Something that should be, though,

00:12:25.497 --> 00:12:26.667
is something like dopamine.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:28.045
You probably are all aware that

00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:30.842
dopamine in the substantia
nigra in the brain,

00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:33.570
in basal ganglia, if you
don't have enough of it,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.478
and your neurons are dying off,
you get Parkinson's Disease.

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:37.602
It's common.

00:12:37.602 --> 00:12:39.687
Why are we vulnerable
to Parkinson's Disease?

00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:41.725
Well, turns out that it's inherent

00:12:41.725 --> 00:12:43.931
to the nature of the dopamine molecule.

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.552
When it's metabolized,
the dopamine molecule

00:12:46.552 --> 00:12:49.766
makes hydrogen peroxide
and other oxygen radicals.

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:51.012
These things, whenever they

00:12:51.012 --> 00:12:53.866
glom onto a piece of
tissue, fry it, essentially.

00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:56.794
Dopamine is an inherently toxic molecule,

00:12:56.794 --> 00:12:59.031
and we're not gonna be able to replace it,

00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:00.511
because it's been used to regulate

00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:03.210
motivation systems for
about a billion years, now.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.139
No chance of changing that,

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:06.941
but it's also inherently dangerous.

00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:08.563
There are built in protection mechanisms

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:10.018
in those nerves to protect them

00:13:10.018 --> 00:13:11.449
against the effects of dopamine,

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.438
and if those aren't working quite right

00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:16.487
for one reason or another,
people get Parkinson's Disease.

00:13:16.487 --> 00:13:20.139
Second explanation, mismatch
with the environment.

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.291
We used to think that common diseases

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.447
were caused by common genes,
and we would find them.

00:13:24.447 --> 00:13:26.271
But, that turned out not to be the case.

00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:28.398
Hardly any common diseases are caused by

00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:31.114
common genes that are large effects.

00:13:31.114 --> 00:13:33.788
Most disease genes that have large effects

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:37.024
are what George Williams
and I have called quirks.

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.791
Quirks are not defective,

00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.829
they're genes that have bad effects

00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:43.162
only in modern environments.

00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:46.097
This leads to the paradoxical finding that

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:47.660
most highly heritable diseases

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.296
are caused by the environment.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.833
Doesn't that sound odd?

00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:53.529
Quirks, harmless in a natural environment,

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:55.385
cause disease in novel environment,

00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:57.035
Ken Weiss, a geneticist, says

00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:59.600
a widespread dispersion of
these common risk alleles,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.873
they're benign, the proofs are benign,

00:14:02.873 --> 00:14:04.596
so if they're associated with disease,

00:14:04.596 --> 00:14:06.739
this mans that they're interacting

00:14:06.739 --> 00:14:09.289
with modern environments
to causing disease,

00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:11.503
pointing the finger to the environment.

00:14:11.503 --> 00:14:13.314
So next time the New York Times says,

00:14:13.314 --> 00:14:16.481
"We found a gene for atherosclerosis,"

00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:20.269
it's probably a gene
that didn't do much harm

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:22.273
back in the environments with the sort

00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:23.794
that Mike Gurven was studying.

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:25.247
It's a gene that interacts with Big Macs

00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:27.535
to cause heart attacks.

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.635
Nearsightedness, whether
you're nearsighted or not

00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:33.308
depends almost entirely on your genes.

00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:35.308
So why didn't natural
selection get rid of them?

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.134
Answer, hardly anyone is

00:14:37.134 --> 00:14:39.863
nearsighted in ancestral environments.

00:14:39.863 --> 00:14:42.128
Something about modern
environments boosts the rate

00:14:42.128 --> 00:14:45.280
so that everybody that has
those genes gets nearsighted.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.330
Three candidates for that,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.250
one is doing close work,
two is high doses of sugar,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.926
three, low levels of light
because of living indoors.

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.447
Yet, to discover exactly what this is,

00:14:56.447 --> 00:14:59.625
we could eventually cure
or prevent nearsightedness

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.432
if we could find the answer.

00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:04.697
Scurvy, our ancestors didn't have scurvy

00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:06.570
because they made their own,

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.826
ancestors back a few million years,

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.507
they made their own Vitamin C.

00:15:11.507 --> 00:15:13.729
But, we lost the ability
to make Vitamin C,

00:15:13.729 --> 00:15:15.975
and we lost it right about here.

00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:18.195
All the monkeys, marmosets, and humans,

00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:19.672
and gorillas, we can't make it.

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:21.877
Lemurs and others can.

00:15:21.877 --> 00:15:24.138
Why did that ability get lost?

00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:26.368
One hypothesis has been
that it's just because

00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:29.162
we had so much fruit in
our diet, it didn't matter.

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:30.962
That's a perfectly plausible one,

00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:32.594
but other people have suggested that

00:15:32.594 --> 00:15:34.944
changes in this particular enzyme

00:15:34.944 --> 00:15:37.537
increase our ability to store fats.

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:40.008
Very interesting to try
to answer that question.

00:15:40.008 --> 00:15:41.807
Third reason is infection.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.229
Pathogens evolve faster than we do.

00:15:44.229 --> 00:15:46.122
It's too bad, and it's amazing

00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:48.617
that we can ever, ever outrun them.

00:15:48.617 --> 00:15:50.878
Therefore, it is very strong selection

00:15:50.878 --> 00:15:52.668
to survive whatever kinds of pathogens

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:54.004
and infections are around,

00:15:54.004 --> 00:15:55.695
but whenever you see a mutation

00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:59.115
that gets selected so
strongly to prevent infection,

00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:00.741
you should look very carefully to see if

00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:03.537
there might be bad side
effects to that gene.

00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:05.553
Turns out that there's lots
of evidence about this.

00:16:05.553 --> 00:16:07.905
A nice recent paper goes
through many of them,

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:12.148
shows pretty convincingly
that each epidemic shapes

00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.929
quite dramatic changes
in allele frequencies,

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:18.038
and furthermore, it points out that CCR5,

00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:19.932
you get HIV protection if you

00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:21.749
have this particular mutation,

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:24.104
but you're more vulnerable to West Nile.

00:16:24.104 --> 00:16:25.368
If you have an O blood type,

00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:26.919
you get protection against malaria,

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.996
but you're more vulnerable to cholera.

00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:31.652
We need to think about
good genes and bad genes.

00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:33.565
We need to be thinking about variations

00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:35.737
that have costs and benefits.

00:16:35.737 --> 00:16:37.576
Trade-offs, nothing in
the body is perfect.

00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:38.875
Everything is a trade-off.

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:40.909
My favorite example is bilirubin.

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:42.424
Why make bilirubin?

00:16:42.424 --> 00:16:44.113
It's toxic, it turns you yellow.

00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:46.057
Turns out, it's wonderful at stopping

00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:47.526
reactive oxygen species

00:16:47.526 --> 00:16:49.312
from burning up your tissues.

00:16:49.312 --> 00:16:50.926
And people who have a disease

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.356
causing high bilirubin levels

00:16:52.356 --> 00:16:54.746
have heart attacks at
half the rate of others.

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:56.987
Very important for practical terms

00:16:56.987 --> 00:16:58.231
in a neonatal nursery,

00:16:58.231 --> 00:17:00.105
because they're routinely put under lights

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:01.793
for even mild increases of bilirubin,

00:17:01.793 --> 00:17:03.898
even though that bilirubin decreases

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:07.732
the number of reactionary
oxygen species in their bodies.

00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:10.036
Genes for aging, George
Williams pointed out

00:17:10.036 --> 00:17:11.459
a new explanation that is,

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:13.094
they might have benefits in childhood,

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:16.929
when selection is strong,
and costs only later in life.

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:19.907
The so-called Antagonistic
Pleiotropy Theory.

00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:22.101
If, in fact, we could eliminate aging,

00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:24.182
and the mortality rate stayed the same

00:17:24.182 --> 00:17:26.509
throughout life as it is at age 20,

00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:30.240
most of us would live to
about age 800 to 1000.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.049
Amyloid Beta is the bad guy for
causing Alzheimer's Disease,

00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:35.442
but has demonstrated recently

00:17:35.442 --> 00:17:38.064
that in fact, it's potent antimicrobial.

00:17:38.064 --> 00:17:39.912
Every single one of these genes

00:17:39.912 --> 00:17:41.523
seems like it's just a bad actor,

00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:43.183
but it's there for a reason.

00:17:43.183 --> 00:17:45.324
Not all are, we shouldn't assume it,

00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:47.661
but we should consider the possibilities.

00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.838
And Ajit Varki's work, he's shown that

00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:51.772
all human are missing a gene that our

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:53.832
primate ancestors all had,

00:17:53.832 --> 00:17:55.749
that is one for Neu5Gc,

00:17:57.222 --> 00:17:59.051
and it turns out that two

00:17:59.051 --> 00:18:00.718
or three million years ago we lost it,

00:18:00.718 --> 00:18:03.829
but we keep eating other
foods that have that in it,

00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:08.061
and it may well be that
causes inflammatory reactions,

00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:10.002
which might be responsible for the

00:18:10.002 --> 00:18:14.347
high burden of inflammatory
disease in humans.

00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:16.197
It might be that the reason that happened

00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:19.817
was to help us avoid the kind of malaria

00:18:19.817 --> 00:18:21.744
that influences chimpanzees

00:18:21.744 --> 00:18:23.640
because that molecule is what

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.807
the malaria pathogen uses
to get into blood cells.

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:32.839
Change can increase
reproduction in harm health,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.605
Apo E4 increases
progesterone in reproduction,

00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:40.922
even though it causes heart
attacks and Alzheimer's Disease.

00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:43.328
Even the BRCA gene, causing breast cancer,

00:18:43.328 --> 00:18:46.718
has been said to increase
number of offspring.

00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:49.649
And finally, defenses, such as
pain, fever, and all the rest

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:52.038
are useful but at a high cost.

00:18:52.038 --> 00:18:54.995
Wrapping up, why do disease genes persist?

00:18:54.995 --> 00:18:57.766
The same six categories
that prove so useful

00:18:57.766 --> 00:18:59.657
in trying to understand why certain traits

00:18:59.657 --> 00:19:02.530
are vulnerable to causing disease

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.586
helps us understand genetic variations

00:19:05.586 --> 00:19:07.846
and genetic uniformities in ways

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.821
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:11.629
Constraints leave us with mutations

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:13.906
heterozygote advantage vulnerabilities.

00:19:13.906 --> 00:19:15.867
Mismatched results in quirks

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:18.301
that were harmless now causing disease.

00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:20.963
Trade-offs come with benefits, but costs.

00:19:20.963 --> 00:19:23.082
Pathogens create arm races.

00:19:23.082 --> 00:19:26.110
Reproduction sometimes
shapes changes in genes

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.378
that increase reproduction
at a cost to health,

00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:30.731
and defenses are dangerous and costly.

00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:32.374
Again, going back to four
different kinds of genes,

00:19:32.374 --> 00:19:34.370
variations among individuals,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.490
variations among human subgroups,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.856
recent changes that we all have,

00:19:38.856 --> 00:19:41.780
such as losing the ability
to synthesize Vitamin C,

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.288
and then other things like dopamine,

00:19:43.288 --> 00:19:45.450
that we all have had for a very long time.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.185
We need to be thinking about all these

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.078
different kinds of genes and their

00:19:49.078 --> 00:19:52.507
ways in which they make us
more vulnerable to disease.

00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:55.053
This exercise of writing
this lecture was fun for me,

00:19:55.053 --> 00:19:56.318
because it came out with surprising

00:19:56.318 --> 00:19:58.152
conclusions I hadn't anticipated.

00:19:58.152 --> 00:20:00.427
First, there's a very high proportion

00:20:00.427 --> 00:20:03.690
of disease vulnerability
genes that are shaped by

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.849
benefits of protecting against infection.

00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:09.232
And, two, they persist
because of selection for

00:20:09.232 --> 00:20:11.331
infection increase in reproduction

00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:13.374
and extending the lifespan.

00:20:13.374 --> 00:20:14.673
Those of you who are interested,

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.663
we now do have a scientific society,

00:20:16.663 --> 00:20:18.357
Evolutionary Medicine, it's called

00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:19.190
The International Society for

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.953
Evolution Medicine and Public Health.

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.261
We have a meeting in Europe

00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:24.284
that you'd be welcome to go.

00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:27.326
EvMedEd is a resource, and EvMedReview.com

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:28.904
offers news for the field,

00:20:28.904 --> 00:20:31.025
including right now a meeting that's open

00:20:31.025 --> 00:20:32.558
for anyone who wants to attend,

00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:33.797
November 10th in Berlin,

00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:36.557
and information about jobs at ASU.

00:20:36.557 --> 00:20:37.390
Thanks very much.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.640
(dramatic piano music)

00:20:44.988 --> 00:20:47.860
- As humans, we often ponder
the pleasures of life.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.727
Things like good food,

00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:53.775
a drink with friends
after a long week of work,

00:20:53.775 --> 00:20:57.158
falling in love, that's
a great thing in life,

00:20:57.158 --> 00:20:59.137
spending time with family.

00:20:59.137 --> 00:21:02.328
These are all undoubtedly great things

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:05.132
that we enjoy in our lives.

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:07.494
I'd also argue that sleep is

00:21:07.494 --> 00:21:10.134
one of those great things in our lives.

00:21:10.134 --> 00:21:12.142
There's nothing better than sleep

00:21:12.142 --> 00:21:13.898
when you're truly tired,

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.974
and the feeling of climbing into bed,

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.455
pulling up the covers,

00:21:17.455 --> 00:21:21.599
putting your head down and
falling asleep is pure bliss.

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:25.468
And we see this in cases of
extreme sleep deprivation.

00:21:25.468 --> 00:21:26.301
(audience laughing)

00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:28.875
For example, here's a
picture of Peter Tripp.

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:32.020
He was a DJ in New York in the 1950s,

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.910
and as a publicity and fundraising stunt,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.091
he tried to stay awake
for as long as he could.

00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:40.916
He managed to stay awake
for over eight days,

00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:42.404
which is pretty remarkable,

00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:44.015
on the air the entire time,

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:46.710
what's even more remarkable to me is that

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.399
others came along and
actually beat his record.

00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:52.552
I can't imagine why anyone
would wanna do this.

00:21:52.552 --> 00:21:54.697
But, on a less extreme scale,

00:21:54.697 --> 00:21:56.546
I bet that most everyone in this room

00:21:56.546 --> 00:21:58.967
follows the same pattern that I do.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:01.552
And, that is, we sleep too
little during the week,

00:22:01.552 --> 00:22:05.120
and then we catch up on
sleep on the weekend.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.202
And so, I bring up these
examples to illustrate

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:10.628
the love/hate relationship that
we seem to have with sleep.

00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:12.669
On the one hand, we love sleep,

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:15.008
and people often say, "I love sleep."

00:22:15.008 --> 00:22:17.467
But, on the other hand,
we always have something

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:21.045
better to do than sleep, isn't that right?

00:22:21.045 --> 00:22:25.212
You know, sleep is seen as
something that we can do without,

00:22:26.157 --> 00:22:28.183
or that we would like to do without,

00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:31.660
and certainly, we cut
into it very commonly,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.986
and so, just like we hear
people say, "I love sleep,"

00:22:33.986 --> 00:22:35.106
we also hear them say,

00:22:35.106 --> 00:22:38.432
"I wish I could function on less sleep."

00:22:38.432 --> 00:22:41.688
Now, today, I wanna present some findings

00:22:41.688 --> 00:22:44.385
from my lab over the last couple of years

00:22:44.385 --> 00:22:47.058
that suggest that this
love/hate relationship

00:22:47.058 --> 00:22:49.358
is not a new phenomenon.

00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:52.957
It's not a new phenomenon
associated with television,

00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:55.825
or social media, or artificial lighting,

00:22:55.825 --> 00:22:58.525
or all the other kinds of
evils you might think of

00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:02.275
if you're in sleep
medicine or sleep biology.

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.438
Instead, our findings are suggesting that

00:23:05.438 --> 00:23:09.220
natural selection has
been whittling away sleep

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.953
along the human lineage
probably for millions of years.

00:23:12.953 --> 00:23:15.595
We also think that this
might have implications

00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:18.893
for understanding some
aspects of human health.

00:23:18.893 --> 00:23:20.948
So, I wanna start with a
little bit of background.

00:23:20.948 --> 00:23:22.758
First of all, what is sleep?

00:23:22.758 --> 00:23:25.556
Sleep is a reversible state of rest.

00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:27.297
So, it's not like a coma,

00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:29.913
it can be easily reversed, sleep can.

00:23:29.913 --> 00:23:31.416
It involves reduced awareness,

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.925
and responsiveness to surroundings.

00:23:33.925 --> 00:23:35.448
It involves a rebound effect.

00:23:35.448 --> 00:23:37.395
I just talked about that
with our catch-up sleep

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:38.863
that many of us are going to have tonight

00:23:38.863 --> 00:23:41.097
after this long week of work,

00:23:41.097 --> 00:23:42.537
and travel, and everything else.

00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:45.540
You have to compensate for lost sleep.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.763
Very importantly, sleep is not one thing.

00:23:47.763 --> 00:23:49.865
It's actually two different things.

00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:51.777
Sleep, when you're not awake,

00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:54.038
you're actually in two different states.

00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:57.707
You're in non-REM sleep, or in REM sleep,

00:23:57.707 --> 00:23:58.976
rapid eye movement sleep,

00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:01.401
and REM sleep is, of course, when

00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:04.565
the most visual dreaming occurs.

00:24:04.565 --> 00:24:06.540
A sleep biologist can differentiate

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.040
these two stages based on EEG.

00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:11.381
Now, I wanna just walk you through

00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:13.978
what would be considered an ideal

00:24:13.978 --> 00:24:16.589
or normal night's sleep.

00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:18.281
This is showing and eight hour time period

00:24:18.281 --> 00:24:21.469
from about 11 p.m. until roughly 7 a.m.,

00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:24.902
so an eight hour block
of consolidated sleep.

00:24:24.902 --> 00:24:27.522
And, ideally, you would fall

00:24:27.522 --> 00:24:31.959
into the deeper stages
of non-REM sleep first,

00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:34.274
you'd spend some time in non-REM sleep,

00:24:34.274 --> 00:24:35.701
and then you'd actually arouse

00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:38.455
out of non-REM and go into REM.

00:24:38.455 --> 00:24:39.523
It's a different stage,

00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:42.290
it's not just a deeper
stage of non-REM sleep.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.195
That cycle, then, continues
throughout the night,

00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:48.083
you go into a second bout
now of non-REM sleep,

00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:52.852
into deep slow-wave sleep, and
you come out into REM sleep.

00:24:52.852 --> 00:24:54.838
Now, periodically, throughout the night,

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:56.774
you would also awaken.

00:24:56.774 --> 00:24:59.706
I wanna really focus
on one question today.

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:01.701
How does human sleep differ

00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:04.522
from the sleep we see in other primates?

00:25:04.522 --> 00:25:07.359
I wanna be a little more
provocative, and ask,

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:09.920
are humans evolutionary outliers

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.608
in terms of the kinds
of sleep that we have,

00:25:12.608 --> 00:25:15.084
in terms of the
characteristics of our sleep?

00:25:15.084 --> 00:25:17.509
And so, of course we think
in evolutionary anthropology

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:20.030
a lot about how humans are
different from other primates.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.276
Often, those are questions
about discreet traits,

00:25:23.276 --> 00:25:25.699
qualitative traits, bipedalism,

00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:28.020
how we use tools, or whether we use tools,

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.614
or whether we have a theory of mind.

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:32.326
Here, I'm interested in
a quantitative trait,

00:25:32.326 --> 00:25:34.743
the characteristics of sleep.

00:25:35.879 --> 00:25:37.630
And so, I need to first define

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.743
what I mean by an evolutionary outlier.

00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:43.209
This is a trait that's more
extreme than one would predict

00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:45.817
based on the modeling of trait evolution

00:25:45.817 --> 00:25:48.583
on a phylogeny, on an evolutionary tree.

00:25:48.583 --> 00:25:50.704
So, based on what we
know about the various

00:25:50.704 --> 00:25:54.658
socio-ecological factors that
influence sleep in primates

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.301
as well as the phylogeny

00:25:56.301 --> 00:25:58.425
and where we fall in that phylogeny,

00:25:58.425 --> 00:26:01.784
we can predict sleep
characteristics in humans.

00:26:01.784 --> 00:26:04.930
So, for example, we know that
predation risk across mammals

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.249
will tend to reduce sleep times.

00:26:08.249 --> 00:26:12.530
If animals do not have safe
place to sleep, they sleep less.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.343
And so we can use that
knowledge across mammals

00:26:14.343 --> 00:26:17.707
to actually predict what
human sleep would look like.

00:26:17.707 --> 00:26:20.000
And then, of course, once
we have a good prediction

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.905
and some confidence intervals on it,

00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:23.534
we could ask, "Where
does our observe value

00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:27.291
"of human sleep fall compared
to what is predicted?"

00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:29.108
If it falls outside that distribution,

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:30.189
we would be an outlier.

00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:31.750
We're different from
what you would predict

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.220
based on what's known about
sleep in other primates.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.977
And so we use a method that's
been developed in my lab

00:26:37.977 --> 00:26:39.733
called phylogenetic prediction

00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:42.829
where we use a statistical
model in phylogeny to predict

00:26:42.829 --> 00:26:46.243
the phenotype in a particular
species, in this case, humans.

00:26:46.243 --> 00:26:49.183
We basically have a bunch
of different variables

00:26:49.183 --> 00:26:52.301
that can go into this,
and we estimate these

00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:53.904
parameters in the model,

00:26:53.904 --> 00:26:57.261
and we also incorporate
evolutionary history.

00:26:57.261 --> 00:27:00.230
We implement this, we make
estimates of this model

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.859
using a Bayesian approach that produces

00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:07.081
a posterior probability
distribution of predictions.

00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:10.676
So this is what you might
see in this kind of a case.

00:27:10.676 --> 00:27:13.686
We use this approach and we come up with

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:16.576
a posterior probability distribution

00:27:16.576 --> 00:27:18.767
of predictions, as you see here.

00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:21.710
Then the question, of course,
is where do humans fall?

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.085
Are we above this distribution?

00:27:24.085 --> 00:27:26.901
Is our observe sleep time
above this distribution?

00:27:26.901 --> 00:27:29.263
We would be a positive outlier.

00:27:29.263 --> 00:27:31.355
Or, we could be a negative outlier,

00:27:31.355 --> 00:27:33.519
the observed value falls
below this distribution.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.866
Or, we can be about what you

00:27:34.866 --> 00:27:38.514
would expect if we were a typical primate.

00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:41.813
So, the critical question in
all of this, of course, is

00:27:41.813 --> 00:27:44.608
what value do we put on this distribution?

00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:47.817
So, what is the duration of human sleep?

00:27:47.817 --> 00:27:49.062
What would be a good estimate

00:27:49.062 --> 00:27:52.233
of the duration of human sleep?

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:54.957
Well, here, I'm gonna use
a value of seven hours,

00:27:54.957 --> 00:27:56.283
and I think that's a fairly

00:27:56.283 --> 00:27:58.069
conservative estimate based on

00:27:58.069 --> 00:27:59.962
several different lines of evidence.

00:27:59.962 --> 00:28:02.160
Some of this evidence
is from our own work,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.099
studying a traditional
population agriculturalist,

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:07.189
who live in Madagascar,
and they're a population

00:28:07.189 --> 00:28:09.288
without access to electricity.

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.325
And in this population,
I'll talk about this

00:28:11.325 --> 00:28:13.141
a little bit later in my talk,

00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:16.535
we find that people sleep, on
average, 6 1/2 hours a night.

00:28:16.535 --> 00:28:19.303
We've also studied the
Hadza hunter-gatherers,

00:28:19.303 --> 00:28:21.855
There we find that the average sleep time

00:28:21.855 --> 00:28:24.513
is 6.2 hours per night.

00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:27.180
Likewise, a recent study of
three hunter-gather groups

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.097
found that the average sleep time

00:28:29.097 --> 00:28:33.173
across those three groups
was 6.5 hours, pretty short.

00:28:33.173 --> 00:28:34.980
These guys don't have TV, right?

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.439
They don't have all the
things that we have,

00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:39.016
the social media and
the artificial lighting,

00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:42.190
and they're actually
sleeping a little bit less.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.789
Another study of a non-electric population

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:45.145
also gives seven hours,

00:28:45.145 --> 00:28:47.014
or we can look at western populations

00:28:47.014 --> 00:28:51.463
and it's about seven hours
in a recent meta-analysis.

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:52.351
And so, we think that this is

00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:56.518
a conservative estimate of
typical human sleep, seven hours.

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:01.066
Okay, so here's a picture
of a Hadza man sleeping

00:29:01.066 --> 00:29:04.399
with his fire, some weapons next to him,

00:29:05.894 --> 00:29:09.895
on the ground, which is different
from most other primates.

00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:11.295
And I just wanna share with you

00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:14.665
the three things that we've
found from our analyses.

00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:17.624
First of all, humans sleep
less than would be predicted.

00:29:17.624 --> 00:29:19.253
So we're a negative outlier.

00:29:19.253 --> 00:29:22.752
We spend a greater proportion
of time in REM sleep,

00:29:22.752 --> 00:29:24.099
that rapid eye movement sleep,

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:27.266
and we are very flexible in our sleep,

00:29:28.362 --> 00:29:31.470
more flexible than would be predicted.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.412
Alright, so, let me walk
you through the evidence

00:29:33.412 --> 00:29:35.029
for each of these three points.

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:37.403
First of all, here's the
distribution of sleep times

00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:40.019
for primates where we have data.

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:41.435
We have a pretty good number

00:29:41.435 --> 00:29:44.057
of species now studied for their sleep,

00:29:44.057 --> 00:29:45.436
and what you see is that humans

00:29:45.436 --> 00:29:49.557
are the shortest sleeping
of all the primates.

00:29:49.557 --> 00:29:52.442
Now, again, we wanna control for phylogeny

00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:54.674
and for these other ecological variables

00:29:54.674 --> 00:29:56.826
and so we've used this
phylogenetic prediction

00:29:56.826 --> 00:29:58.574
approach that I talked about.

00:29:58.574 --> 00:30:00.758
Here's our equation that we're using

00:30:00.758 --> 00:30:02.851
to predict sleep duration in humans,

00:30:02.851 --> 00:30:04.976
and here's our posterior probability

00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:06.912
distribution of those predictions.

00:30:06.912 --> 00:30:09.063
What you can see is
that the observed value

00:30:09.063 --> 00:30:11.826
falls below this distribution.

00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:13.442
We are a negative outlier.

00:30:13.442 --> 00:30:16.345
In fact, the mean predicted
sleep duration for humans

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:19.639
is 10.3 hours from this analysis,

00:30:19.639 --> 00:30:21.791
and we're clearly different from that.

00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:25.082
Here's the second result
involving REM sleep.

00:30:25.082 --> 00:30:27.083
Humans, again, have the highest percentage

00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:29.311
of REM sleep of all the primates.

00:30:29.311 --> 00:30:32.334
Now again, we wanted to
use this outlier approach,

00:30:32.334 --> 00:30:34.213
this phylogenetic prediction approach,

00:30:34.213 --> 00:30:36.783
ancestral so again, here's our equation

00:30:36.783 --> 00:30:39.880
relating REM sleep to activity period,

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.194
body mass, brain size, diet,

00:30:42.194 --> 00:30:44.701
inter-birth interval
group size and phylogeny,

00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:47.253
and you can see the posterior
distribution in this case,

00:30:47.253 --> 00:30:49.225
and here's the observed value.

00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:52.052
So, here, we're a positive outlier.

00:30:52.052 --> 00:30:53.615
We know that this is achieved

00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:56.169
via higher than expected REM sleep,

00:30:56.169 --> 00:30:57.859
so if we just look at
the total amount of REM,

00:30:57.859 --> 00:30:59.579
we're looking here at
the percentage of REM,

00:30:59.579 --> 00:31:02.628
but the total REM, we have
higher than expected REM

00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:05.167
and less than expected non-REM.

00:31:05.167 --> 00:31:07.312
It looks like both of these are shifted.

00:31:07.312 --> 00:31:10.363
Okay, then, the final set of
results I wanna share with you

00:31:10.363 --> 00:31:15.129
involves a hypothesis that
we came up with based on

00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:18.416
the ethnographic literature,
based on experimental studies,

00:31:18.416 --> 00:31:20.867
and based on the historical record.

00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:25.188
And that is that natural
human sleep is more flexible

00:31:25.188 --> 00:31:27.174
than we usually appreciate.

00:31:27.174 --> 00:31:28.448
Let me just walk you through some of the

00:31:28.448 --> 00:31:31.428
findings that were already out there

00:31:31.428 --> 00:31:34.479
before we came into the sphere.

00:31:34.479 --> 00:31:37.472
Here's an example form the
ethnographic literature.

00:31:37.472 --> 00:31:39.437
A work by Dan Everett on the Piraha

00:31:39.437 --> 00:31:41.743
South American hunter-gatherers,

00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:44.285
where he reports that
the Piraha take naps,

00:31:44.285 --> 00:31:47.199
15 minutes to two hours at the extreme

00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:48.480
during the day and night.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.822
There's loud talking in
the village all night long.

00:31:51.822 --> 00:31:53.456
Consequently it's very difficult

00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:56.471
for outsiders to sleep
well among the Piraha.

00:31:56.471 --> 00:31:59.577
In a more, sort of review article

00:31:59.577 --> 00:32:03.009
of all of this ethnographic
literature on sleep patterns,

00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:04.819
Carol Worthman notes that human nights

00:32:04.819 --> 00:32:07.218
are filled with activity and significance

00:32:07.218 --> 00:32:09.347
and nowhere do people typically sleep

00:32:09.347 --> 00:32:12.078
from evening until dawn.

00:32:12.078 --> 00:32:13.415
In terms of the historical record,

00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:16.363
some of you might be familiar
with Roger Ekirch's work

00:32:16.363 --> 00:32:18.429
in which he looked through
the historical record

00:32:18.429 --> 00:32:21.959
in multiple cultures
in Europe over the past

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:23.934
couple of thousand years,

00:32:23.934 --> 00:32:28.751
and found evidence in much
of the written record there

00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:33.453
for references to a first
sleep and a second sleep

00:32:33.453 --> 00:32:36.795
with a period of night
time activity in between.

00:32:36.795 --> 00:32:38.393
So, he found evidence for what

00:32:38.393 --> 00:32:40.657
would be called segmented sleep.

00:32:40.657 --> 00:32:42.221
And, likewise, in experimental studies,

00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:43.947
for example, Tom Ware's studies,

00:32:43.947 --> 00:32:47.427
when he put humans into
a long night condition,

00:32:47.427 --> 00:32:49.524
so a 14 hour condition where people were

00:32:49.524 --> 00:32:51.544
not allowed to have access to lighting,

00:32:51.544 --> 00:32:55.325
they shifted into a
biphasic sleep condition.

00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:56.777
So, again, segmented sleep.

00:32:56.777 --> 00:32:59.433
'Course, other primates also
show night time activity,

00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:02.976
but my colleagues and I in my lab

00:33:02.976 --> 00:33:04.411
have hypothesized that humans

00:33:04.411 --> 00:33:06.993
are more extreme than other primates.

00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:09.477
Well, unfortunately, we don't
have data on other primates,

00:33:09.477 --> 00:33:13.526
but we can look at how flexible sleep is

00:33:13.526 --> 00:33:16.572
among people living in
traditional populations.

00:33:16.572 --> 00:33:19.593
So, as I mentioned, we've
been doing in the Hadza.

00:33:19.593 --> 00:33:22.938
This is work led by a post-doc
in my lab, David Samson.

00:33:22.938 --> 00:33:26.037
We've been doing work in the
Hadza using actigraphy devices

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.816
that are just watches, basically,

00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:30.948
that measure activity levels,
and from that, with algorithms

00:33:30.948 --> 00:33:33.680
we can make inferences about sleep.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.654
Also, in the Malagasy population,

00:33:36.654 --> 00:33:38.775
the agriculturists, we've
been using actigraphy,

00:33:38.775 --> 00:33:40.950
but also EEG, so we actually have

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.545
the gold-standard measure of sleep

00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:46.075
in one of these two populations.

00:33:46.075 --> 00:33:46.908
And, I just wanna share with you

00:33:46.908 --> 00:33:48.477
some of the things that we find.

00:33:48.477 --> 00:33:51.360
This is a big table,
but let me focus on two

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.131
elements in it.

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:56.507
This is total sleep duration,
in the Madagascar population,

00:33:56.507 --> 00:33:58.712
6.5 hours, as I mentioned previously,

00:33:58.712 --> 00:34:02.245
compared to seven in a
typical western population,

00:34:02.245 --> 00:34:04.728
in this case, in the USA,
using the same techniques.

00:34:04.728 --> 00:34:08.195
Likewise, the sleep fragmentation metrics

00:34:08.195 --> 00:34:12.247
are much higher in the
Malagasy population,

00:34:12.247 --> 00:34:14.739
and sleep efficiency is much lower.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.584
So, they're up a lot
more during the night.

00:34:17.584 --> 00:34:21.201
Likewise, we found some
evidence for segmented sleep,

00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:22.659
the same kind of segmented sleep

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:24.645
that Roger Ekirch has documented

00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:27.027
in European historical record.

00:34:27.027 --> 00:34:29.956
So, this is showing a
functional linear modeling

00:34:29.956 --> 00:34:34.899
of circadian patterns among
the individuals in our sample.

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:38.909
This is the night time
hours in this population.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:42.912
What we find is a significant
bump up in activity,

00:34:42.912 --> 00:34:46.007
especially in men, just after midnight,

00:34:46.007 --> 00:34:48.221
for a substantial amount of time, in fact.

00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:49.725
This is at the time when there's over

00:34:49.725 --> 00:34:54.524
12 hours of darkness in this
population, so, their winter.

00:34:54.524 --> 00:34:57.045
And, as well, we find in
the Hadza hunter-gatherers,

00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:00.099
that once they go to
sleep, there can often be

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:02.369
long periods of wakefulness,

00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:04.476
and quite fragmented sleep,

00:35:04.476 --> 00:35:07.187
as you can see from some of these plots,

00:35:07.187 --> 00:35:10.225
where the dark lines are
indicating sleep time,

00:35:10.225 --> 00:35:12.561
with the first one being
the inferred sleep onset,

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:16.100
and then lots of activity at night.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.541
Okay, so I wanna wrap
up with three questions,

00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:20.637
very quickly go through three questions.

00:35:20.637 --> 00:35:23.188
First of all, why are
humans such short sleepers?

00:35:23.188 --> 00:35:24.635
What is going on with this?

00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:27.330
Based on this, should we
be short sleepers today?

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.868
Is this giving us some reason to think

00:35:28.868 --> 00:35:30.774
that maybe we don't
need all of this sleep?

00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:34.082
And then, finally, does the
evolution of short sleep

00:35:34.082 --> 00:35:35.783
potentially affect health?

00:35:35.783 --> 00:35:37.959
Okay, so why are humans
such short sleepers?

00:35:37.959 --> 00:35:41.272
Our answer to that is
that, just like today,

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:43.926
throughout human evolution, our ancestors

00:35:43.926 --> 00:35:47.587
have had better things to do than sleep.

00:35:47.587 --> 00:35:49.416
Some of the potential selective forces

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:52.413
that might be at play to
shorten sleep along our lineage,

00:35:52.413 --> 00:35:54.693
is that we sleep on the ground,

00:35:54.693 --> 00:35:58.181
and we know from other
species, other primates,

00:35:58.181 --> 00:36:00.743
there's greater predation
risk on the ground.

00:36:00.743 --> 00:36:03.698
If you are experiencing
greater predation risk,

00:36:03.698 --> 00:36:06.055
that should select for less sleep.

00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:09.226
As well, being on the ground
may expose individuals

00:36:09.226 --> 00:36:11.871
to greater inter and inter-group conflict,

00:36:11.871 --> 00:36:14.017
where it would be easier
for a con-specific,

00:36:14.017 --> 00:36:18.274
another member of homo-sapiens,
to attack at night

00:36:18.274 --> 00:36:20.218
because of this terrestrial sleep.

00:36:20.218 --> 00:36:23.867
But, as well, sleep comes
with opportunity costs,

00:36:23.867 --> 00:36:26.116
and one of those involves
social interaction.

00:36:26.116 --> 00:36:27.871
When you're sleeping,
you're not socializing,

00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:30.918
and we know how important
socializing is for humans.

00:36:30.918 --> 00:36:32.517
In particular, it's important

00:36:32.517 --> 00:36:35.855
in the context of social learning.

00:36:35.855 --> 00:36:37.940
From the awake time to acquire

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.652
and transmit new skills and knowledge.

00:36:40.652 --> 00:36:42.515
So, we think that many of things

00:36:42.515 --> 00:36:44.522
that have made humans so successful

00:36:44.522 --> 00:36:47.496
have also favored less sleep.

00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:50.219
Now, as well, the higher
percentage of REM sleep

00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:54.150
may relate to this last
issue because it's thought

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.040
that REM sleep also plays a role

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.006
in consolidation of memories and

00:36:58.006 --> 00:37:02.226
simulating various kinds of
threats and problem solving.

00:37:02.226 --> 00:37:05.777
So, do these results suggest
that we should sleep less?

00:37:05.777 --> 00:37:10.665
Should we be considering a
paleo-sleep plan of some kind?

00:37:10.665 --> 00:37:13.425
I think our findings and
those of others are suggesting

00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:16.462
that a paleo-sleep plan would involve

00:37:16.462 --> 00:37:18.853
very short and fragmented sleep,

00:37:18.853 --> 00:37:21.540
very broodish in another way.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.763
And I think we can turn
to evolutionary medicine

00:37:23.763 --> 00:37:25.661
to help us think about this issue.

00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:27.800
A central tenet of evolutionary medicine,

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.781
as we've heard in the previous talks,

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:31.141
is that natural selection operates

00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:34.213
on reproductive success, not on health.

00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:36.745
In fact, short, fragmented
sleep is associated

00:37:36.745 --> 00:37:38.821
with many poor health outcomes.

00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:40.940
Those include cardiovascular disease,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.608
higher rates of cardiovascular disease,

00:37:42.608 --> 00:37:45.326
metabolic dysfunction of various sorts,

00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:49.158
involving diabetes, for
example, and cancer.

00:37:49.158 --> 00:37:51.696
So there are serious problems with having

00:37:51.696 --> 00:37:53.713
a short, fragmented sleep.

00:37:53.713 --> 00:37:56.331
Yet, many of these problems
would actually occur

00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:59.256
likely later in life, post reproduction

00:37:59.256 --> 00:38:00.529
in the selection shadows.

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:03.100
And so, perhaps, we need to think about

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.799
whether reproductive success
is more relevant to us today,

00:38:06.799 --> 00:38:09.466
or health and longevity.

00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:11.370
If reproductive success is important,

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.554
maybe a paleo-sleep plan is a good one,

00:38:13.554 --> 00:38:15.585
but I bet that most people in this room

00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:18.502
are more concerned about
health and longevity,

00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:21.066
in which case this is probably a bad idea.

00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:23.087
In fact, I would suggest that humans today

00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:26.117
are having the best
sleep that we've ever had

00:38:26.117 --> 00:38:28.197
in our evolutionary history.

00:38:28.197 --> 00:38:31.486
So you could imagine that this gentleman's

00:38:31.486 --> 00:38:33.112
having a much better sleep on average

00:38:33.112 --> 00:38:36.843
than this individual is
going to have tonight.

00:38:36.843 --> 00:38:38.569
And there are many reasons to enjoy this,

00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:40.401
for those health benefits
I just mentioned,

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:43.469
as well as for better cognitive function,

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:46.529
better immune function, et cetera.

00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:47.566
Does evolution help us understand

00:38:47.566 --> 00:38:49.190
modern sleep and sleep disorders?

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.798
Of course, many people do not get to

00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:53.486
experience this kind of nice,

00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:55.941
relaxing sleep, consolidated sleep.

00:38:55.941 --> 00:38:56.970
For example, many people,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.543
about 10% of the U.S. population,

00:38:58.543 --> 00:39:00.314
has some kind of insomnia,

00:39:00.314 --> 00:39:01.830
and based on our findings,

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.749
I guess one question that arises is

00:39:03.749 --> 00:39:05.122
should we really expect to sleep

00:39:05.122 --> 00:39:07.147
through the night, every night?

00:39:07.147 --> 00:39:08.769
That doesn't look like
it's really been a part

00:39:08.769 --> 00:39:10.612
of our evolutionary history.

00:39:10.612 --> 00:39:14.358
That seems to me a modern
phenomenon that we strive for.

00:39:14.358 --> 00:39:16.931
And so, perhaps
middle-of-the-night insomnia

00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:20.167
is not so unexpected,
especially for those of us

00:39:20.167 --> 00:39:22.526
that may have ancestors who had

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:25.374
that kind of segmented sleep pattern.

00:39:25.374 --> 00:39:28.139
As well, you could
imagine that individuals

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:30.613
who experience threats of various kinds

00:39:30.613 --> 00:39:33.312
would have an adaptive
response to not sleep,

00:39:33.312 --> 00:39:35.395
and of course, in modern society,

00:39:35.395 --> 00:39:38.691
many people do experience these threats.

00:39:38.691 --> 00:39:41.482
People living in inner city
environments, for example,

00:39:41.482 --> 00:39:44.128
or people in a relationship where

00:39:44.128 --> 00:39:45.901
there might be domestic violence.

00:39:45.901 --> 00:39:49.639
As well, there's societal
threats, such as racism.

00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:52.655
Many people are now showing
that these kind of threats

00:39:52.655 --> 00:39:55.928
affect people's sleep,
leading to sleep disparities,

00:39:55.928 --> 00:39:57.256
and they're even linking that up to

00:39:57.256 --> 00:40:00.386
some of the other health
disparities that are known,

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:03.735
for example, among different
racial groups in the U.S.

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:05.679
And so, finally, does the
evolution of short sleep

00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:07.985
help us to understand disease?

00:40:07.985 --> 00:40:09.927
Is there a case of that?

00:40:09.927 --> 00:40:14.156
Recently, Randy Nesse,
Tuck Finch, and I proposed

00:40:14.156 --> 00:40:17.331
that this may help us
understand Alzheimer's Disease,

00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.969
which is thought to be a
uniquely human disease,

00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:22.945
as we heard previously in Ajit's talk.

00:40:22.945 --> 00:40:26.550
And, our ideal relates
to the Glymphatic System,

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.934
the system of the brain that's

00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:29.532
only recently been discovered

00:40:29.532 --> 00:40:30.843
in the last several years.

00:40:30.843 --> 00:40:32.747
It's an amazing set of discoveries,

00:40:32.747 --> 00:40:35.575
and this Glymphatic System
is involved in removing

00:40:35.575 --> 00:40:38.742
metabolic byproducts,
including amyloid beta,

00:40:38.742 --> 00:40:41.221
which is involved, of course, as you know,

00:40:41.221 --> 00:40:43.479
in Alzheimer's Disease.

00:40:43.479 --> 00:40:45.966
And so a lot's being
learned about this system

00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:49.266
of how the cerebral spinal
fluid moves through the brain

00:40:49.266 --> 00:40:51.383
and picks up various kinds of

00:40:51.383 --> 00:40:55.184
pollutants in the brain
and carries them away.

00:40:55.184 --> 00:40:58.109
And, most importantly for our hypothesis,

00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:59.915
is that this system functions

00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:02.559
most effectively during sleep.

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:05.343
So we're proposing that
this is one trade-off,

00:41:05.343 --> 00:41:08.037
there're probably others, of evolution

00:41:08.037 --> 00:41:11.674
acting to reduce sleep
along the human lineage.

00:41:11.674 --> 00:41:14.180
So, I hope I've convinced you that

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.470
this evolution perspective is useful

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.851
for understanding this
love/hate relationship

00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.246
that we have with sleep, and I wanna

00:41:21.246 --> 00:41:22.554
thank you all for staying wake.

00:41:22.554 --> 00:41:23.970
I didn't see anyone sleeping, thank you.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.904
(audience applauding)

00:41:25.904 --> 00:41:28.575
And I wanna especially
thank my collaborator

00:41:28.575 --> 00:41:31.138
on a lot of this, David Samson.

00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:34.388
(dramatic piano music)

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.121
- I'm talking about
adaptations to high altitude.

00:41:42.121 --> 00:41:45.711
First, let's ask what is high altitude?

00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:49.056
We typically define high altitude

00:41:49.056 --> 00:41:52.723
as 2500 meters, that
is 8000 feet or higher.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.882
That obviously covers a lot of ground.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:01.539
Down on the bottom right,
you might be thinking,

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:04.688
"Oh, high altitude and rugged mountaineers

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.757
"seeking to climb to the summit

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:09.340
"of Mt Manaslu at 27,000 feet."

00:42:10.337 --> 00:42:14.499
Or you may think of athletes
such as the soccer player

00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:18.666
from sea level who is playing
at 12,000 feet in Bolivia.

00:42:20.036 --> 00:42:21.628
And those are ways in which

00:42:21.628 --> 00:42:25.343
many, many people are
exposed to high altitude.

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.935
The top two photos describe

00:42:27.935 --> 00:42:31.234
another type of exposure to high altitude,

00:42:31.234 --> 00:42:34.797
and that is people who have been living,

00:42:34.797 --> 00:42:37.034
who are the descendants of populations

00:42:37.034 --> 00:42:39.664
that have been resident at high altitude

00:42:39.664 --> 00:42:41.833
for thousands of years.

00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:45.441
On the right are Andean
Highlander children

00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:48.023
who are descended from
the population that has

00:42:48.023 --> 00:42:51.750
lived there at high
altitude, in this case,

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.917
about 14,000 feet for
something like 14,000 years.

00:42:57.571 --> 00:43:00.559
On the left, the Tibetan woman spinning

00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:04.208
is the descendant of Tibetan populations

00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.919
and there have been people living

00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:10.337
on the Tibetan plateau
for 20 to 30,000 years.

00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:14.790
So, you can see that the
exposure and the actual altitude

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.560
varies enormously when we talk about

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.223
adaptations to high altitude.

00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:23.148
Why is high altitude so interesting?

00:43:23.148 --> 00:43:25.740
Well, one of the reasons
it's so interesting

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.157
is that there is a unique and very severe

00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:33.422
stress, and it's called hypoxia,

00:43:33.422 --> 00:43:36.089
less than the usual oxygen level

00:43:36.998 --> 00:43:40.602
If we think of ourselves
here in San Diego,

00:43:40.602 --> 00:43:43.428
think of taking a lung full of air

00:43:43.428 --> 00:43:46.903
and you get a certain number of molecules.

00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:49.322
Let's call that 100%.

00:43:49.322 --> 00:43:53.057
As you go up in altitude,
barometric pressure falls,

00:43:53.057 --> 00:43:56.173
and as we know, the
molecules grow further apart,

00:43:56.173 --> 00:44:01.080
and there are fewer
molecules per unit of volume.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.491
By the time we're in
Denver, at 1500 meters,

00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:08.324
or about 5100 feet, that
same lung full of air

00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:13.983
has only about 80% of
those oxygen molecules.

00:44:13.983 --> 00:44:17.954
At's Pike's Peak, at about 14,100 feet,

00:44:17.954 --> 00:44:20.529
each lung full of air has only

00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:23.612
about 58% of the same molecules.

00:44:24.657 --> 00:44:27.074
Now, this is a severe stress,

00:44:27.935 --> 00:44:29.959
and it's a stress that's constant.

00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.534
It doesn't go away with the seasons,

00:44:32.534 --> 00:44:35.148
it doesn't go away if
you're rich or you're poor.

00:44:35.148 --> 00:44:38.264
So, this makes it a good stress to study.

00:44:38.264 --> 00:44:40.514
Now, what is an adaptation?

00:44:41.684 --> 00:44:46.515
What does hypoxia have
to do with being a stress

00:44:46.515 --> 00:44:49.098
to which we might have to adapt?

00:44:49.098 --> 00:44:53.186
Well, we need to get a sufficient number

00:44:53.186 --> 00:44:57.353
of oxygen molecules from our
lungs in the ambient air.

00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:03.734
We need to exchange those
with our bloodstream.

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:07.038
We need to transport
those oxygen molecules

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:09.983
through the heart, the
cardiovascular system,

00:45:09.983 --> 00:45:13.660
and deliver them to our mitochondria

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.704
where they are used.

00:45:15.704 --> 00:45:19.871
And, our mitochondria must
have those oxygen molecules.

00:45:21.556 --> 00:45:24.889
So, what do we do when
faced with a situation

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:27.556
where, let's say there are only 60%

00:45:27.556 --> 00:45:30.516
of the usual number of oxygen molecules?

00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:33.812
Well, something has to
happen with gas exchange,

00:45:33.812 --> 00:45:35.979
gas transport, or gas use,

00:45:37.056 --> 00:45:40.033
and that something are adaptations.

00:45:40.033 --> 00:45:44.200
I'll use adaptation in a
very general way to refer to

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.934
a biological response that

00:45:47.934 --> 00:45:52.674
increases survival and
reproduction under a stress.

00:45:52.674 --> 00:45:55.769
And adaptations can take place

00:45:55.769 --> 00:45:59.048
on a wide range of time scales.

00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:02.501
As the X-axis shows, some acclimatizations

00:46:02.501 --> 00:46:07.165
can take place in seconds,
hours, days, or months.

00:46:07.165 --> 00:46:10.238
We refer to those that are really fast

00:46:10.238 --> 00:46:13.488
and are reversible as acclimatizations.

00:46:15.625 --> 00:46:17.742
Another type of adaptation occurs

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:20.831
if we grow up under a particular stress.

00:46:20.831 --> 00:46:24.831
That's an irreversible
developmental adaptation.

00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:29.488
Over the course of generations
and thousands of years,

00:46:29.488 --> 00:46:31.504
or hundreds of thousands of years,

00:46:31.504 --> 00:46:35.438
natural selection may
result in an increase in

00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:39.271
allele frequency of
alleles that are effective

00:46:41.904 --> 00:46:46.142
at counteracting the environmental stress.

00:46:46.142 --> 00:46:48.569
Let's first look at ourselves.

00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:50.939
I'm assuming everyone here is like me,

00:46:50.939 --> 00:46:54.157
and we've all been born
and raised at low altitude.

00:46:54.157 --> 00:46:58.457
So, we lowlanders, let's
say we go to Pike's Peak,

00:46:58.457 --> 00:47:00.477
or we go to Everest Base Camp.

00:47:00.477 --> 00:47:03.668
We acclimatize, we acclimatize

00:47:03.668 --> 00:47:06.064
at the level of oxygen exchange

00:47:06.064 --> 00:47:08.369
by increasing our breathing,

00:47:08.369 --> 00:47:10.970
and you can see from this plot that shows

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:15.721
over days at altitude from
before you go to altitude

00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:19.116
to up to about three weeks
or a month at altitude,

00:47:19.116 --> 00:47:22.888
our ventilation increases enormously.

00:47:22.888 --> 00:47:24.454
What does that do?

00:47:24.454 --> 00:47:27.566
It means that the number of liters of air

00:47:27.566 --> 00:47:31.373
that we're taking in in
a minute is increased.

00:47:31.373 --> 00:47:34.260
That's how we get enough oxygen molecules,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.432
or how our bodies are
responding to or acclimatizing

00:47:38.432 --> 00:47:41.211
so that we get enough oxygen molecules,

00:47:41.211 --> 00:47:45.378
at least at the beginning
of the transport system.

00:47:46.643 --> 00:47:49.829
This is an acclimatization that is

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:53.468
sustained for years at high altitude.

00:47:53.468 --> 00:47:58.123
After decades, it starts
to fade and become blunted.

00:47:58.123 --> 00:48:01.797
We also acclimatize at the
level of gas transport,

00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:04.902
or oxygen transport, by hemoglobin.

00:48:04.902 --> 00:48:07.069
And the way we do that is,

00:48:07.907 --> 00:48:11.734
there is an increase in an erythropoietin

00:48:11.734 --> 00:48:13.613
that stimulates the production

00:48:13.613 --> 00:48:17.282
of more red blood cells
containing more hemoglobin.

00:48:17.282 --> 00:48:20.782
More hemoglobin molecules to carry oxygen.

00:48:22.063 --> 00:48:26.332
So again, now we're adapting
at the level of gas transport.

00:48:26.332 --> 00:48:29.470
The higher the altitude,
the higher the stress,

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:33.263
the higher the hemoglobin concentration.

00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:37.211
This also is an acclimatization response

00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:41.378
that lasts indefinitely until
we return to low altitude

00:48:43.123 --> 00:48:45.123
and then it is reversed.

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:49.214
At the level of gas use, or oxygen use,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.874
something very puzzling happens

00:48:52.874 --> 00:48:56.215
and that is at least
for the first few weeks

00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:59.627
at altitude, our gas use as measured

00:48:59.627 --> 00:49:02.558
by our basal metabolic rate,

00:49:02.558 --> 00:49:07.314
that's the minimum amount
of oxygen that's required

00:49:07.314 --> 00:49:10.216
to keep us alive by our heart beating

00:49:10.216 --> 00:49:12.364
and breathing and so forth,

00:49:12.364 --> 00:49:15.205
that actually increases for

00:49:15.205 --> 00:49:17.225
the first couple of weeks at altitude.

00:49:17.225 --> 00:49:20.392
And then, by three weeks or four weeks

00:49:21.318 --> 00:49:24.818
it has returned to its pre exposure level.

00:49:27.278 --> 00:49:30.476
So, those are acclimatizations.

00:49:30.476 --> 00:49:34.056
And these are within the
per view of all people.

00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:37.978
How is it that we mount
those acclimatizations?

00:49:37.978 --> 00:49:40.267
Well, we do so, because we have

00:49:40.267 --> 00:49:43.913
an oxygen homeostasis pathway consisting

00:49:43.913 --> 00:49:48.080
of genes and proteins and
it's a very lovely pathway.

00:49:50.864 --> 00:49:55.031
The first element in the
pathway is the oxygen sensor.

00:49:56.226 --> 00:50:00.393
It is a protein that is coated
for by a gene called EGLN1.

00:50:01.876 --> 00:50:05.543
Second elements in the
pathway are sub-units

00:50:06.548 --> 00:50:10.715
of proteins that are called
hypoxyia inducible factors.

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:15.194
We have three of them,

00:50:15.194 --> 00:50:19.692
hypoxia inducible factors,
one, two, and three.

00:50:19.692 --> 00:50:23.561
Hypoxia inducible factor
one is called one,

00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:27.570
because it has a particular protein that

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:31.140
is coated for by a gene called HIF1.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:34.571
HIF for hypoxyia inducible factor one A.

00:50:34.571 --> 00:50:37.904
HIF2 has a sub-unit coated for by HIF2A,

00:50:39.487 --> 00:50:41.522
and the same for HIF3.

00:50:41.522 --> 00:50:44.605
These three hypoxia inducible factors

00:50:45.586 --> 00:50:49.142
are transcription factors, and they,

00:50:49.142 --> 00:50:53.943
once the oxygen sensor senses
that a cell is hypoxic,

00:50:53.943 --> 00:50:57.399
these hypoxia inducible factors accumulate

00:50:57.399 --> 00:50:59.508
and they induce the transcription

00:50:59.508 --> 00:51:03.675
of hundreds of target genes
that increase gas exchange,

00:51:05.586 --> 00:51:09.169
increase gas transport,
and modify gas use.

00:51:12.154 --> 00:51:15.428
One of the target genes
is the erythropoietin.

00:51:15.428 --> 00:51:19.345
Why do we have this oxygen
homeostasis pathway?

00:51:20.534 --> 00:51:23.863
Well, we have this oxygen
homeostasis pathway

00:51:23.863 --> 00:51:27.453
because we're descended from ancestors

00:51:27.453 --> 00:51:31.620
that lived at a wide range of
atmospheric oxygen content.

00:51:33.236 --> 00:51:36.528
The red line here shows the 21%.

00:51:36.528 --> 00:51:39.515
This is the number that
we all learn in school.

00:51:39.515 --> 00:51:42.122
Air contains 21% of oxygen.

00:51:42.122 --> 00:51:43.971
But, it hasn't always.

00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:47.413
Along the X-axis here,
you'll see millions of years,

00:51:47.413 --> 00:51:51.580
and we're showing that until
about 650 million years ago,

00:51:52.762 --> 00:51:57.762
the earth's atmosphere was
composed of less than 5% oxygen.

00:51:57.762 --> 00:52:01.929
Around 600 million years ago,
multicellular animals evolved.

00:52:04.408 --> 00:52:08.075
It was at this time
that HIF1A also evolved.

00:52:09.885 --> 00:52:11.571
So, we share this with all of our

00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:15.404
multicellular animal
compatriots, if you will.

00:52:17.838 --> 00:52:21.755
A little bit later, around
550 million years ago,

00:52:21.755 --> 00:52:24.838
vertebrates arose, and HIF2A evolved.

00:52:26.818 --> 00:52:30.686
Again, we share this with all
of our fellow vertebrates.

00:52:30.686 --> 00:52:35.347
At the time, oxygen
concentration was only about 12%.

00:52:35.347 --> 00:52:37.515
Then, we went through some periods

00:52:37.515 --> 00:52:40.191
of very high oxygen, low,

00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:43.675
and about 200 million
years ago, mammals evolved.

00:52:43.675 --> 00:52:45.674
And with the evolution of mammals,

00:52:45.674 --> 00:52:48.078
we see the evolution of

00:52:48.078 --> 00:52:51.958
our third hypoxia inducible factor one.

00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:56.021
So the why question of
why are we able to respond

00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:59.428
and acclimatize to high altitudes

00:52:59.428 --> 00:53:03.154
is that we are descended from a series

00:53:03.154 --> 00:53:06.634
of ancestors that evolve these elements

00:53:06.634 --> 00:53:10.144
of our oxygen homeostasis system.

00:53:10.144 --> 00:53:13.448
So that implies, then, "Well, then, okay,

00:53:13.448 --> 00:53:17.444
"we must all," we being all
seven billion of us humans,

00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:22.258
"respond in the same way to
high altitude hypoxic stress."

00:53:22.258 --> 00:53:25.062
Let's look at that, and let's ask

00:53:25.062 --> 00:53:27.931
whether women like this Tibetan highlander

00:53:27.931 --> 00:53:30.732
living in the shadow of Mt. Manaslu,

00:53:30.732 --> 00:53:33.827
acclimatize in the same way we do.

00:53:33.827 --> 00:53:38.299
Let's look at gas exchange,
and we're comparing here

00:53:38.299 --> 00:53:40.882
Tibetan and Andean highlanders.

00:53:41.775 --> 00:53:45.275
Let's focus on the area above 3500 meters,

00:53:46.237 --> 00:53:51.096
that is, the samples of people
who are under hypoxic stress.

00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:54.133
You can see that, in
general, what has happened

00:53:54.133 --> 00:53:58.340
is that Tibetan highlanders
in the blue triangles

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.282
have retained the acclimatization

00:54:01.282 --> 00:54:03.532
response of high breathing.

00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:07.824
The Andean highlanders
in general have not.

00:54:07.824 --> 00:54:10.491
They have blunted that response.

00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:16.004
With respect to gas transport,
the opposite occurs.

00:54:16.004 --> 00:54:18.284
Andean highlanders have essentially

00:54:18.284 --> 00:54:21.716
retained the acclimatization response,

00:54:21.716 --> 00:54:25.883
while Tibetan highlanders
have blunted that response.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.338
What about gas use?

00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:32.077
Here's a dissertation project for someone.

00:54:32.077 --> 00:54:34.206
We don't have very much information.

00:54:34.206 --> 00:54:36.406
The little information that we have

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:39.623
is that both Andean
and Tibetan highlanders

00:54:39.623 --> 00:54:42.540
have normal as expected oxygen use.

00:54:44.735 --> 00:54:46.179
So, we don't see any evidence

00:54:46.179 --> 00:54:49.348
for population differences there.

00:54:49.348 --> 00:54:51.819
Well, now, in addition to having

00:54:51.819 --> 00:54:55.986
three types of adaptations,
Andean, Tibetan, and lowlander,

00:54:59.216 --> 00:55:02.875
we also have to think
about acclimatizations,

00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:07.160
developmental adaptations,
and genetic adaptations.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.493
So why do we think this contrast exists?

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:16.378
Well, with genomics and being
able to examine whole genomes,

00:55:16.378 --> 00:55:18.512
we've discovered that the

00:55:18.512 --> 00:55:21.429
actual oxygen sensored gene, EGLN1,

00:55:22.882 --> 00:55:27.649
has a number of variants and
that the variants in EGLN1

00:55:27.649 --> 00:55:31.482
that exist in Andean
populations are different

00:55:32.318 --> 00:55:35.481
from those that exist
in Tibetan populations

00:55:35.481 --> 00:55:40.005
and in turn those are
different from the variants

00:55:40.005 --> 00:55:42.672
that exist here at low altitude.

00:55:43.884 --> 00:55:46.381
The variants are not fixed, but they are

00:55:46.381 --> 00:55:49.680
very different allele frequencies.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.347
So this is one reason
for Andean highlanders

00:55:55.233 --> 00:55:57.544
having the particular pattern

00:55:57.544 --> 00:56:01.627
of low-ventilation/high gas transport.

00:56:02.828 --> 00:56:06.924
Tibetans, on the other hand,
not only have mutations

00:56:06.924 --> 00:56:11.286
in the oxygen sensor,
they also have mutations

00:56:11.286 --> 00:56:15.453
in the HIF2A element of
hypoxia inducible factor 2.

00:56:18.707 --> 00:56:22.374
And these are factors
of Tibetan highlanders

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.093
that result in a dampened response

00:56:28.045 --> 00:56:30.917
to high altitude hypoxia.

00:56:30.917 --> 00:56:34.606
The particular association
that is particularly strong

00:56:34.606 --> 00:56:37.359
is that with hemoglobin concentration.

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:40.692
Homozygotes for the Tibetan form of HIF2

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:46.365
have two grams of hemoglobin
less than their compatriots

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.584
who have the ancestral,

00:56:49.584 --> 00:56:53.540
or low-altitude form of that same gene.

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.790
So the reason, then, fr this difference

00:56:58.717 --> 00:57:01.568
between Andean and Tibetan highlanders

00:57:01.568 --> 00:57:05.735
relates to natural selection
and local adaptation.

00:57:06.691 --> 00:57:10.201
We have Andean highlanders
and Tibetan highlanders

00:57:10.201 --> 00:57:12.224
who've adapted to the same stress

00:57:12.224 --> 00:57:16.755
of high altitude hypoxia,
but on a local level

00:57:16.755 --> 00:57:20.922
with different mutations and
mutations at different loci.

00:57:23.236 --> 00:57:26.358
Now, what are the
implications for medicine,

00:57:26.358 --> 00:57:29.237
whether we're at high altitude or low?

00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:32.209
You may be surprised to learn that

00:57:32.209 --> 00:57:36.292
something like 30% of
the deaths in the U.S.

00:57:37.747 --> 00:57:40.639
Are associated with hypoxia.

00:57:40.639 --> 00:57:42.364
They're not caused by hypoxia,

00:57:42.364 --> 00:57:44.898
but they're associated with hypoxia.

00:57:44.898 --> 00:57:48.391
And now that we understand that we have

00:57:48.391 --> 00:57:51.724
distinctive oxygen homeostasis pathways,

00:57:53.233 --> 00:57:56.733
genes, molecules, proteins, and responses,

00:57:58.095 --> 00:58:00.678
we can now look at those deaths

00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:03.558
that are associated with hypoxia

00:58:03.558 --> 00:58:05.730
and the diseases that precede them,

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.040
and we can ask questions about,

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.342
"Well do certain variants in
the oxygen homeostasis pathway

00:58:12.342 --> 00:58:15.925
"make us more vulnerable,
or do they change

00:58:16.822 --> 00:58:21.455
"the prognosis of a disease
associated with hypoxia?

00:58:21.455 --> 00:58:25.622
"And, does this give us
opportunity for developing

00:58:26.956 --> 00:58:30.162
"pharmacological interventions?"

00:58:30.162 --> 00:58:32.912
And, all of those are in process.

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:38.887
So this is one way where
evolutionary medicine,

00:58:38.887 --> 00:58:43.699
looking at our evolutionary
history helps us understand

00:58:43.699 --> 00:58:47.166
and come up with new ways of looking at

00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:49.916
cause and factors associated with

00:58:50.872 --> 00:58:53.797
health and disease in our own population.

00:58:53.797 --> 00:58:55.520
Thank you very much.
