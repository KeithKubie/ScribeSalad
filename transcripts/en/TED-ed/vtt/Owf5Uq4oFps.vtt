00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.455
In the year 1066,

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:15.043
7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel.

00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:19.076
Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people.

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:23.077
Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences.

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:25.206
And around the same period of time,

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:29.368
other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe,

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:33.699
going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continent’s history.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.881
So who were these warriors

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.121
and how did they leave 
their mark so far and wide?

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.530
Our story begins 
over 200 years earlier,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.492
when Vikings began to settle 
on the shores of northern France

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:51.933
as part of a great Scandinavian exodus 
across northern Europe.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.762
The French locals called 
these invaders Normans,

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:57.144
named for the direction they came from.

00:00:57.144 --> 00:01:00.043
Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks,

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:04.522
negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.675
granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.654
that came to be known as Normandy.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.264
The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life.

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:17.053
They married Frankish women,

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.680
adopted the French language,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.945
and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.714
But though they adapted,

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:26.936
they maintained the warrior tradition

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:30.116
and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears.

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:35.345
Before long, ambitious Norman knights 
were looking for new challenges.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:40.065
The Normans’ best-known achievement 
was their conquest of England.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:43.267
In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy,

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:47.923
disputed the claim of 
the new English king, Harold Godwinson.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.046
Soon after landing in England,

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:54.662
William and his knights met Harold’s army 
near the town of Hastings.

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:56.536
The climactic moment in the battle

00:01:56.536 --> 00:02:01.129
is immortalized in 
the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry,

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:06.515
where an arrow striking Harold 
in the eye seals the Norman victory.

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:11.118
William consolidated his gains 
with a huge castle-building campaign

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:14.220
and a reorganization of English society.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.081
He lived up to his nickname 
"William the Conqueror"

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.922
through a massive survey
known as the Domesday Book,

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:23.544
which recorded the population
and ownership

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.992
of every piece of land in England.

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:30.373
Norman French became the language 
of the new royal court,

00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:33.766
while commoners continued 
to speak Anglo-Saxon.

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.992
Over time, the two merged 
to give us the English we know today,

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:41.960
though the divide between lords 
and peasants can still be felt

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.542
in synonym pairs such as cow and beef.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.302
By the end of the 12th century,

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:53.359
the Normans had further expanded 
into Wales,

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.144
Scotland,

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:55.513
and Ireland.

00:02:55.513 --> 00:02:58.486
Meanwhile, independent groups 
of Norman knights

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:00.170
traveled to the Mediterranean,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.068
inspired by tales of pilgrims 
returning from Jerusalem.

00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:08.323
There, they threw themselves 
into a tangled mass of conflicts

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:11.570
among the established powers 
all over that region.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.955
They became highly prized mercenaries,

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.847
and during one of these battles,

00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:21.033
they made the first recorded 
heavy cavalry charge with couched lances,

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:25.945
a devastating tactic that soon became 
standard in medieval warfare.

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:31.647
The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99,

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:35.222
a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:37.756
in certain parts of the Middle East.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:41.190
But the Normans did more than just fight.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.067
As a result of their victories,

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.726
leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.348
secured lands throughout Southern Italy,

00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:54.772
eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.260
Under Roger II,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.509
the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.189
in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.219
Muslim Arab poets and scholars 
served in the royal court

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.621
alongside Byzantine Greek sailors 
and architects.

00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:15.839
Arabic remained an official language along
with Latin, Greek, and Norman French.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:20.120
The world’s geographical knowledge 
was compiled in The Book of Roger,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.703
whose maps of the known world

00:04:21.703 --> 00:04:25.822
would remain the most accurate 
available for 300 years.

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:30.326
And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture,

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:31.713
Arab ceilings,

00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.669
and Byzantine domes,

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.522
all decorated with
exquisite golden mosaics.

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:41.292
So if the Normans were so successful,
why aren’t they still around?

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.689
In fact, this was a key part of
their success:

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.541
not just ruling the societies 
they conquered,

00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:49.597
but becoming part of them.

00:04:49.597 --> 00:04:53.388
Although the Normans eventually 
disappeared as a distinct group,

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:55.394
their contributions remained.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:59.805
And today, from the castles and
cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:02.618
to wherever 
the English language is spoken,

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.975
the Norman legacy lives on.
