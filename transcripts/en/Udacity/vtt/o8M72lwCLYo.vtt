00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Suppose we want to send a small number--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
say it's the day of the year for some very secret event like the next Udacity party--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
using RSA. Can we do it?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Which of these solutions would work?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We could pick a large value x, and then send a pair where x is in the clear text,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we're sending the encryption of n + x encrypted with Alice's public key.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We could pick a large enough value of e so that m^e is always much greater than n.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We could pick a large random value x and send m + x encrypted with Alice's public key.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or none of these.
