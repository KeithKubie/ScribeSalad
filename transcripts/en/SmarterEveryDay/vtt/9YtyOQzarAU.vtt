00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.050
(Carl) We have our bolt and thread here to balance and we can run

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.060
the nut in and out to get the perfect balance.
(Destin) That's pretty smart. I bet a smart

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.240
guy came up with that.
(Carl) oh.. a.. brilliant person.
[laugh]

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.610
Oh hey. Yeah. You see that? You see how awesome this is?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.970
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. We're continuing our

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.160
study of helicopters and we have just come up with my best invention since the chicken

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.340
powered steady cam. Well.. Carl helped too. [laugh] You know, the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520
whole helicopter thing. It is one of the more dangerous things and you know you're living right if you

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.710
need laser goggles and a helmet.
(Carl) And where's my helmet?
[chuckle]

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.890
I only have one. He can hide in the toy closet. We're in my son's

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.070
bedroom. Alright so let's explain what we've got here.
(Carl) Alright. We've put

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.250
a laser in place of our blades.
(Destin) Lasers are like bacon

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
they make everything better.
(Carl) Oh yeah. We've balanced it out here with our high-tech little gadget

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.500
and ah we're going to show how collective and cyclic

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.690
pitch changes as a disc.
(Destin) What we do with this is we are measuring the pitch

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.870
output on this rotor grip. Excuse me, is that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
am I saying that correctly?
(Carl) Yep correct.
(Destin) So we are measuring the realtime pitch

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.080
as it goes around a revolution.
(Carl) Getting a nice visual

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.120
representation of it.
(Destin) Sweet. OK where do you want me?
(Carl) Alright how about we

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.140
ah you get right behind it. 
(Destin) Over here? (Carl) Yep right here.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.320
and ah we'll project it against the wall.
Here we go.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.430
(Destin) We'll shut the ah shut the closet. Oh another thing we made it so when it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.620
spins up it turns it on using the ah gyro force

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.680
ah excuse me the centrifugal force. Ready.
(Carl) Here we go.
[Rotor spinning up]

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.860
(Carl) Alright.
(Destin) [unintelligible excited]

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.920
(Carl) So ah here we've got zero pitch, all round.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.090
and if we give a collective input, our line goes up

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
positive collective, negative collective it will go down.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.450
If we give any cyclic input the disc will

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.490
or the line will tilt, right left forward, back.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.660
(Destin) So to be clear, we're measuring the pitch, so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.690
the rotor shaft is not changing at all, other than rotation, correct.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.870
(Carl) Yes.
(Destin) Alright so the pitch of the blade

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.070
is changing as we go around a revolution because the swashplate input

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.200
(Carl) the ah grip changes from positive to negative pitch every

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.270
revolution.
(Destin) That's awesome. I am extremely excited

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.320
about this. This is the best visual representation I've ever.. oh

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.500
there's one more thing. It's also pointing 90 degrees out of phase right?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.620
(Carl) Well, yes but that puts it in the phase that it would normally operate.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
(Destin) Alright hold on. I don't understand how you're gonna do this without a helmet.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.780
Alright, so if you think about, OK, when you say it's in

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
the phase that it would normally operate, the laser is shining 90 degrees off
(Carl) The laser is pointing this

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.970
direction and as we get a forward cyclic input tilts

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.150
down and that transitions to take effect 90 degrees when the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.330
(Destin) That's gyroscopic precession.
(Carl) Gyroscopic precession.
(Destin) Alright, so let's zoom in on the swashplate

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.380
ah just for people who don't know what swashplates do, give me a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.560
(Carl) This is the swash plate.
(Destin) Collective input up.
(Carl) Collective up.
(Destin) Collective down.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.740
(Carl) and it can tilt forward back left or right.
(Destin) That's your cyclic input.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.920
Alright you can give collective, and you can see

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.110
the light goes up, and that would pull the helicopter up [unintelligible]

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.280
negative, and if we get cyclic, it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.330
changes the tilt of our line.
(Destin) OK what is the front of the helicopter

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.520
towards you or towards this wall over here?
(Carl) The front of the helicopter is towards the camera's

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.650
left.
(Destin) Got it, so let me go back over here

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.800
and try to get it on the wall here. Alright do it again.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.970
(Carl) Alright here we go. Left, forward,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.150
Right, back, up and down.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.330
(Destin) This is so awesome I want to cry.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.480
I think our contribution to science for the day is done.
(Carl) Alright!

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.630
I'm Destin.
You're getting Smarter Every Day.
