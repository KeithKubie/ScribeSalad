00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:01.988
- [Voiceover] We've
made some good progress

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:05.017
in our derivation of parts of
the Lorentz transformation.

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:08.010
We've been able to
express x prime in terms

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.102
of our Lorentz factor and x and v and t.

00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:14.297
And we've been able to
switch things around

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.457
and represent x in terms
of the Lorentz factor

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.834
and x prime and v and t prime.

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.440
And we were able to solve
for the Lorentz factor.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.680
Now, the final missing
piece in order for us

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.885
to have the full transformation
is to express t prime

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.971
in terms of x and t.

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:32.365
So, how can do we do that?

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:34.868
Well, the way I'm going to
tackle it is I'm just going

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.348
to take this equation right over here,

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.400
let me underline it.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.337
I'm just gonna take that
equation right over there

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.931
and solve for t prime.

00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:46.582
And the parts that have an x prime in it,

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:48.640
I'm gonna substitute with this.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.468
So let's do that, let's
solve this for t prime.

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.662
The first thing that I wanna do is

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:56.914
I wanna divide both sides of this equation

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:58.982
by the Lorentz factor or by gamma.

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:01.245
So if I do that, I'm going to get,

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm gonna move it over to the
left so I have more space,.

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:07.508
It's going to be x over gamma,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.702
x over gamma

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.160
is equal to x prime.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.845
x prime plus v

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:22.640
times t prime.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.708
t prime, let me do it
in that same blue color.

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:28.537
Now everything I'm gonna do here

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:30.457
is pretty straightforward algebra,

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:31.680
but it's gonna get a little hairy,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.074
so that's why I wanna take some caution

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.154
with the colors and progress slowly.

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:38.857
Now, since I wanna solve for t prime,

00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:41.028
let me subtract x prime from both sides.

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:46.034
So the left-hand side is
going to be x over gamma.

00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:49.062
I think that looks like a v too much.

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:52.377
x over gamma minus x prime.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.268
Minus x prime

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:01.462
is equal to v times t prime.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:05.257
v times t prime.

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:07.165
And now, to solve for t prime,

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.657
let's just divide both sides by v.

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:12.971
And so, we are going to get x,

00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:15.085
let me do that white color.

00:02:15.862 --> 00:02:17.851
We're gonna get x over,

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:20.422
well, now it's going to be gamma v.

00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.542
So, gamma v,

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:25.508
v's in that orange color.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.720
Gamma v

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.668
minus x prime

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:36.457
over v

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:38.628
is going to be equal to,

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.771
is equal to t prime.

00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:44.937
So now we'll do what I said before.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.857
We've solved for t prime
in terms of now gamma v,

00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:51.850
x, and x prime, but now
we can take that x prime

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.514
and replace it with gamma
and all of this business

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:55.897
right over here, so let's do that.

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.314
If we take this

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:01.954
and substitute it in for x prime,

00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:03.862
actually, let me swap sides too,

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:06.205
we are going to get t prime

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.662
is equal to x

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:13.188
over gamma.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.102
Let me do the gamma in that red color.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.457
Over gamma

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.817
times v

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.657
minus this stuff.

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:32.171
So we're gonna have gamma times,

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:35.142
it's a little bit tedious,
but we'll power through it.

00:03:39.748 --> 00:03:42.868
x minus vt .

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.350
And if at any point you get inspired,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.600
I encourage you to run with it.

00:03:46.982 --> 00:03:49.382
So we just replaced x prime
with this stuff over here

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:51.154
and then we're gonna
have all of that over v.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.531
So, all of that

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.234
over v.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.262
And now what we can do, let's see.

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:09.440
Let's factor out a
gamma out of everything.

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.388
So we will get t prime

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:14.697
is equal to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.628
gamma times,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.830
and we're gonna have, it's
gonna get pretty hairy now.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.291
Gamma times x

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.851
over gamma squared.

00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:30.034
x over gamma squared, you
factor out a gamma here,

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:32.011
or another way to think
about gamma times x

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:33.725
over gamma squared is
gonna be x over gamma.

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:35.188
We still have that v over there.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.617
v and then minus.

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:41.348
Minus.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.537
And actually, let me just
distribute the minus sign,

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:45.405
the negative sign.

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:47.222
So, minus x over v.

00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:52.137
Minus x over v.

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.577
x over v.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.565
Looking forward to this
getting a little bit simpler.

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.731
And then a negative times
a negative is a positive,

00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:04.925
so it's gonna be plus vt divided by v.

00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:06.640
Well, that's just going to be plus t.

00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.605
Plus t.

00:05:08.605 --> 00:05:09.794
So, simplify it a little bit.

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:12.022
Plus t.

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:14.617
We're making some progress here.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.731
And so that is going to be
equal to, actually, let me just,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.131
so I don't have to keep
rewriting everything,

00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.382
let me just focus on this
part right over here,

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:25.634
try to simplify it and
actually, even better,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.862
let me just focus on that
part right over there.

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:34.342
That part, we can factor out an x.

00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:37.405
If we factor out an x,

00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:42.217
it is going to be equal to

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:46.388
x times one over gamma squared, v.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.857
So let me write that down.

00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:53.554
One over gamma squared, v.

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:55.177
Get the colors right.

00:05:55.794 --> 00:05:58.160
Gamma squared, v.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.005
Gamma squared, v,

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.891
and then minus one over v.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.480
W have the minus one over v.

00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:14.365
One over v.

00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:17.600
Now, if we want to
subtract these two things,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.348
and let me put the close parentheses.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.970
If we wanna subtract these
two things, it's nice to have

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.348
a common denominator, so
let's multiply the numerator

00:06:25.348 --> 00:06:27.440
and denominator here by gamma squared.

00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:33.154
This is gamma squared,

00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:35.280
gamma squared.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.240
And so, now I'm going to focus on

00:06:41.954 --> 00:06:43.382
this part right over here

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:45.485
and hopefully this will simplify nicely.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.531
This is the same thing as

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:51.337
one minus gamma squared,

00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:58.068
over gamma squared v.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.400
Over gamma, I picked a different color.

00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:06.308
Over gam, (chuckles) I'm having
trouble switching colors.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.828
Over

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:12.788
gamma squared, v.

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.811
Now what does this simplify to?

00:07:15.074 --> 00:07:16.582
Well, it seems like it
will be useful to have

00:07:16.582 --> 00:07:17.771
a different way of writing,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.577
well, let's just think
about what gamma squared is.

00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:22.777
Gamma is this business right
over here, which we could,

00:07:22.777 --> 00:07:25.988
if we were to square it, gamma squared.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.765
Gamma, that looks like a v again.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.020
Gamma squared is going
to be equal to one over

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.154
one minus v squared over c squared.

00:07:37.154 --> 00:07:39.108
I just squared the numerator,
one squared is one.

00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.651
Take the square of the square root,

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:41.485
you're just gonna get that.

00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.234
And if I wanted to
simplify it a little bit,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.130
I could multiply the numerator
and denominator by c squared.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.982
And so then that's going to be equal to

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:55.028
c squared over, you
multiply the denominator

00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.222
by c squared, you're gonna get c squared

00:07:57.725 --> 00:07:59.405
minus v squared.

00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:01.531
So how does that help us?

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:03.234
Well, this business.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.525
One, we can write as

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.331
c squared minus v squared

00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:13.908
over c squared minus v squared.

00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:14.560
So, let's do that.

00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:17.291
c squared minus v squared

00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:19.805
over c squared minus v squared.

00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:22.274
I just did that so it
has the same denominator

00:08:22.274 --> 00:08:23.565
as gamma squared.

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:26.868
And then, we're going to
subtract gamma squared.

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:28.297
So we're going to subtract,

00:08:29.371 --> 00:08:33.154
we're going to subtract c squared

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.177
over c squared minus v squared.

00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:40.160
And it looks like this is
going to simplify nicely.

00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:42.297
Well, let me just do one step at a time.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.965
And we're gonna have all of that over,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.440
gamma squared

00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:51.417
is once again c squared

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.097
over c squared minus v squared.

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:56.754
And we're gonna multiply that times v.

00:08:57.702 --> 00:09:00.830
Times, the v in that same color,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.148
all of that times v.

00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:06.811
Now, let's see, up here in the numerator,

00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.914
I have c squared minus v
squared minus c squared.

00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:14.137
So, what's going to happen is

00:09:15.394 --> 00:09:16.890
this, and we have the same denominator,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.508
so this and that are going to cancel.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.480
And so this whole expression
is going to simplify to

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.217
negative v, and let me do
it in that same v color.

00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:30.914
Negative v squared

00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:36.022
over c squared minus v squared.

00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.920
c squared minus v squared.

00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:42.320
And we're dividing by this

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.560
and that's the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.620
so let's multiply b the reciprocal.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.325
So, times c squared minus v squared

00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:56.308
over c squared times v.

00:09:56.308 --> 00:09:58.434
And we are now in the home stretch.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.457
c squared times v.

00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:02.891
And we could do some simplification now.

00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:04.731
That's going to cancel with that.

00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:07.817
And then, v squared divided by v,

00:10:07.817 --> 00:10:10.171
you're just gonna be left
with a v right over there.

00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:12.365
So, all of this crazy business

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:16.057
has simplified to a negative v,

00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:17.942
and I'll just write it
in that orange color.

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:21.062
It has all simplified to negative v

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.588
over c squared.

00:10:23.862 --> 00:10:26.251
So all of this

00:10:26.377 --> 00:10:30.445
has simplified to
negative v over c squared

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:31.874
and so we're in the home stretch.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.622
This expression, t prime,

00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.020
it's going to be equal to gamma times,

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.445
let's write this t first.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.102
So, t .

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.170
And then this expression has simplified

00:10:48.171 --> 00:10:50.530
to negative v over c squared times x.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.748
So we can write this as

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:57.737
minus v over c squared

00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:02.491
times x.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.497
And we're done.

00:11:03.862 --> 00:11:06.685
We have just completed our
Lorentz transformation.

00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:08.440
We started with this, that
we've been able to show

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.948
in the last few videos, and
we did a little bit of hairy,

00:11:10.948 --> 00:11:12.800
carefully, did a little
bit of hairy algebra

00:11:12.914 --> 00:11:15.702
to get this result: t
prime is equal to gamma

00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:19.805
times t minus v over c squared times x.
