00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.511
Use these semicircles, a semicircle

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.567
semi means half

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:10.018
So use these half circles to make a circle

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:11.818
so if you take two halfs of a circle

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:13.715
and if you put them together just right

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.355
You're going to make a circle

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:17.548
So how do we do that?

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:19.371
Well this first choice right over here,

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:20.933
these are no longer the semicircles

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.723
These are each a third of a circle

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:23.697
So we're not gonna,

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:26.431
and this isn't even complete the entire circle

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.623
so that didn't make a circle

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.748
This one, they took the two semicircles

00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:30.954
but they didn't make them

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:33.904
so that their outsides
completely line up with each other.

00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:36.002
so this isn't a circle

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.980
But this one they took the two semicircles

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.937
and they put them together just right

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:42.003
so now their outsides line up

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.261
and we have a full circle

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:46.496
So that's our choice

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:48.538
and we got it right

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:49.392
Let's keep doing this

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:53.816
Use these small triangles
to make a big triangle

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:55.249
All right, well here, they used them

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:56.810
to make not a triangle

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.764
but this looks like a parallelogram, a quadrilateral

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.125
Here, they've used the two triangles

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.157
and made a triangle

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:05.519
because this whole thing has three sides

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.532
one, two, three

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:11.537
Here they used those two triangles
to make a square

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.224
but we wanna make a big triangle

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:15.155
so this is our choice

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.428
Let's do a few more of these

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.975
Use these semicircles to make a circle

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.824
Well here, they're not meeting on the flat side

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:24.395
so this isn't a circle

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:25.800
This looks like something else

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.347
like two smiles or something

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:29.068
Two pieces of a blue watermelon

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.560
which is sliced on top of a purple one

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.138
This is a circle

00:01:33.138 --> 00:01:35.912
So that, they put the two semicircles
in the right way

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:37.983
Here they didn't even make the meet

00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:41.134
so this would be our choice

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.293
Use these small rectangles
to make a big rectangle

00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:48.336
Well here they didn't line them up right
to make a big rectangle

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:49.093
Here they did

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:54.177
This whole thing has one, two, three, four sides

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:55.307
so I'll click that one

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:56.364
This one doesn't look like a rectangle

00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:58.524
It looks like some type of an L or something

00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:01.286
So I'm not going to select that one

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:03.015
We got it right
