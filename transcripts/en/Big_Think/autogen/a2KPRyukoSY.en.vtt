in terms of the the most important

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600
in terms of the the most important
 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.179
in terms of the the most important
scientific discovery to come out of my

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
scientific discovery to come out of my
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.599
scientific discovery to come out of my
group there was a acute moment or the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
group there was a acute moment or the
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.679
group there was a acute moment or the
Eureka moment so to speak and and this

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
Eureka moment so to speak and and this
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.060
Eureka moment so to speak and and this
was in 1994 and by that time my

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
was in 1994 and by that time my
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010
was in 1994 and by that time my
colleagues and I have been immersed in

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
colleagues and I have been immersed in
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.979
colleagues and I have been immersed in
AIDS research already and we realized

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
AIDS research already and we realized
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.420
AIDS research already and we realized
that for any given patient with HIV

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430
that for any given patient with HIV
 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.229
that for any given patient with HIV
infection his or her viral load or the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
infection his or her viral load or the
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569
infection his or her viral load or the
amount of virus and the blood tends to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
amount of virus and the blood tends to
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.139
amount of virus and the blood tends to
remain rather constant over time and and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
remain rather constant over time and and
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.630
remain rather constant over time and and
we've been thinking about that why does

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
we've been thinking about that why does
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.680
we've been thinking about that why does
it remain constant and gradually we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
it remain constant and gradually we
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.069
it remain constant and gradually we
really realized that it was a what we

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
really realized that it was a what we
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319
really realized that it was a what we
call dynamic equilibrium that is the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
call dynamic equilibrium that is the
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270
call dynamic equilibrium that is the
amount of the virus being made is

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
amount of the virus being made is
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640
amount of the virus being made is
approximately equal to the amount of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
approximately equal to the amount of
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.120
approximately equal to the amount of
virus being cleared so it was a steady

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
virus being cleared so it was a steady
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149
virus being cleared so it was a steady
state and then the eureka moment came

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
state and then the eureka moment came
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920
state and then the eureka moment came
when we had the opportunity to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
when we had the opportunity to
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.310
when we had the opportunity to
administer new drugs to HIV infected

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
administer new drugs to HIV infected
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.510
administer new drugs to HIV infected
people and then within weeks of doing so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
people and then within weeks of doing so
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399
people and then within weeks of doing so
we collected the data and showed that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
we collected the data and showed that
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.710
we collected the data and showed that
viral load actually dropped

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
viral load actually dropped
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.679
viral load actually dropped
precipitously and of course that is a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
precipitously and of course that is a
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569
precipitously and of course that is a
great outcome for the patient and for

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
great outcome for the patient and for
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730
great outcome for the patient and for
the doctor but the question that we

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
the doctor but the question that we
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.510
the doctor but the question that we
posed was why does it drop and why does

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
posed was why does it drop and why does
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.569
posed was why does it drop and why does
it drop in that acute manner and and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
it drop in that acute manner and and
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.240
it drop in that acute manner and and
this is where my quantitative background

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
this is where my quantitative background
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.270
this is where my quantitative background
in physics applied is that we we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
in physics applied is that we we
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580
in physics applied is that we we
realized that we could actually write

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
realized that we could actually write
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.389
realized that we could actually write
that out mathematically in a straight

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399
that out mathematically in a straight
 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.300
that out mathematically in a straight
forward differential equation that ap

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
forward differential equation that ap
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.450
forward differential equation that ap
high school student would be able to do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
high school student would be able to do
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.569
high school student would be able to do
and from there you fitting the data and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
and from there you fitting the data and
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.719
and from there you fitting the data and
doing the calculation we were able to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
doing the calculation we were able to
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.650
doing the calculation we were able to
come up with the idea that that it was a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
come up with the idea that that it was a
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.619
come up with the idea that that it was a
we were using the drugs to block virus

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
we were using the drugs to block virus
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.309
we were using the drugs to block virus
in

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
in
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.780
in
affection and production and therefore

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
affection and production and therefore
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.259
affection and production and therefore
the precipitous decline reflect the fact

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269
the precipitous decline reflect the fact
 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.179
the precipitous decline reflect the fact
that the virus was constantly being

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189
that the virus was constantly being
 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.390
that the virus was constantly being
clear at a very rapid rate and so using

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
clear at a very rapid rate and so using
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190
clear at a very rapid rate and so using
that quantitative background we were

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
that quantitative background we were
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.970
that quantitative background we were
able to calculate what the turnover of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
able to calculate what the turnover of
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.800
able to calculate what the turnover of
virus was all the time in a given

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
virus was all the time in a given
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.629
virus was all the time in a given
infected person and that number turned

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639
infected person and that number turned
 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.420
infected person and that number turned
out to be enormous ly large so the virus

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
out to be enormous ly large so the virus
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.209
out to be enormous ly large so the virus
was just replicating away at a rapid

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219
was just replicating away at a rapid
 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.800
was just replicating away at a rapid
clip and from there we also knew that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
clip and from there we also knew that
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.069
clip and from there we also knew that
HIV eat changes every time it replicates

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
HIV eat changes every time it replicates
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.629
HIV eat changes every time it replicates
so high replication rate met high error

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639
so high replication rate met high error
 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.300
so high replication rate met high error
rate and therefore HIV was able to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
rate and therefore HIV was able to
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.270
rate and therefore HIV was able to
mutate very quickly and we could then do

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
mutate very quickly and we could then do
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640
mutate very quickly and we could then do
the additional calculation to show that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
the additional calculation to show that
 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.330
the additional calculation to show that
well if you treat this virus with one or

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340
well if you treat this virus with one or
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.439
well if you treat this virus with one or
two drugs at a time the virus is

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:08.449
two drugs at a time the virus is
 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.349
two drugs at a time the virus is
predictably going to mutate and escape

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359
predictably going to mutate and escape
 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.319
predictably going to mutate and escape
from the action of the drugs but at the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329
from the action of the drugs but at the
 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.209
from the action of the drugs but at the
same time we could also calculate what

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219
same time we could also calculate what
 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.599
same time we could also calculate what
it would take to corner the virus so

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
it would take to corner the virus so
 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.969
it would take to corner the virus so
it's not able to escape and those

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979
it's not able to escape and those
 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.399
it's not able to escape and those
calculations suggested to us that three

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409
calculations suggested to us that three
 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.129
calculations suggested to us that three
or more drugs would do the trick and so

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139
or more drugs would do the trick and so
 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.610
or more drugs would do the trick and so
we knew that by 1995 and and and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
we knew that by 1995 and and and
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.429
we knew that by 1995 and and and
launched a series of experiments in

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439
launched a series of experiments in
 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.429
launched a series of experiments in
patients using what is now called a

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439
patients using what is now called a
 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.589
patients using what is now called a
cocktail therapy throughout three drugs

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599
cocktail therapy throughout three drugs
 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.509
cocktail therapy throughout three drugs
or more and immediately within weeks we

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
or more and immediately within weeks we
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.399
or more and immediately within weeks we
saw the good result but we wanted to

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409
saw the good result but we wanted to
 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.129
saw the good result but we wanted to
wait to see if the results could be

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139
wait to see if the results could be
 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.330
wait to see if the results could be
sustained and it was only by middle of

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
sustained and it was only by middle of
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.360
sustained and it was only by middle of
1996 we realized that we were able to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370
1996 we realized that we were able to
 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.949
1996 we realized that we were able to
keep the virus below detection level for

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
keep the virus below detection level for
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.030
keep the virus below detection level for
a good year and that opened up the door

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
a good year and that opened up the door
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.550
a good year and that opened up the door
for for what is called combination

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
for for what is called combination
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.970
for for what is called combination
therapy today

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980
 
 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.280
 
I'm not sure there was one moment that

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290
I'm not sure there was one moment that
 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.039
I'm not sure there was one moment that
sparked my interest in math and sciences

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
sparked my interest in math and sciences
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.210
sparked my interest in math and sciences
I think as far as I could recall I have

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220
I think as far as I could recall I have
 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.210
I think as far as I could recall I have
always had some interests in these areas

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220
always had some interests in these areas
 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.140
always had some interests in these areas
I certainly remember being a very

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
I certainly remember being a very
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.120
I certainly remember being a very
curious child and perhaps that has that

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130
curious child and perhaps that has that
 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.469
curious child and perhaps that has that
is a precursor to pursuing science but I

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479
is a precursor to pursuing science but I
 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.290
is a precursor to pursuing science but I
think there's also quite a bit of family

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
think there's also quite a bit of family
 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.020
think there's also quite a bit of family
influence that affected me gradually and

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030
influence that affected me gradually and
 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.960
influence that affected me gradually and
and that has to do with having a number

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
and that has to do with having a number
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.680
and that has to do with having a number
of important family members who pursue

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690
of important family members who pursue
 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.689
of important family members who pursue
science or engineering including my

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699
science or engineering including my
 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.560
science or engineering including my
father in a very important uncle and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570
father in a very important uncle and
 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.200
father in a very important uncle and
they they're interested in technology

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210
they they're interested in technology
 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.909
they they're interested in technology
and in sciences I think had a great deal

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919
and in sciences I think had a great deal
 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.010
and in sciences I think had a great deal
of influence on my decision ultimately

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020
of influence on my decision ultimately
 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.840
of influence on my decision ultimately
to to pursue science

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850
 
 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.190
 
in terms of the mass education in Taiwan

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200
in terms of the mass education in Taiwan
 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.830
in terms of the mass education in Taiwan
it was quite intense and so the math

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840
it was quite intense and so the math
 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.650
it was quite intense and so the math
that I had learned by 6 grey served me

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660
that I had learned by 6 grey served me
 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.660
that I had learned by 6 grey served me
pretty well until about eighth or ninth

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670
pretty well until about eighth or ninth
 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.660
pretty well until about eighth or ninth
grade here in the US in terms of science

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670
grade here in the US in terms of science
 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.460
grade here in the US in terms of science
education we didn't have that much

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470
education we didn't have that much
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.270
education we didn't have that much
formal science in Taiwan and I began to

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280
formal science in Taiwan and I began to
 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.470
formal science in Taiwan and I began to
be exposed to that in the later years in

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480
be exposed to that in the later years in
 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.570
be exposed to that in the later years in
middle school and of course in high

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580
middle school and of course in high
 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.710
middle school and of course in high
school and so I think I was first

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720
school and so I think I was first
 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.020
school and so I think I was first
grounded in math and then gradually

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030
grounded in math and then gradually
 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.280
grounded in math and then gradually
shifted into the sciences that's what I

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290
shifted into the sciences that's what I
 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.910
shifted into the sciences that's what I
remember

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920
 
 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.910
 
my career did not go as planned

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920
my career did not go as planned
 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.970
my career did not go as planned
initially as I said my interest was in

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980
initially as I said my interest was in
 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.840
initially as I said my interest was in
physics but through my college education

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850
physics but through my college education
 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.930
physics but through my college education
I saw the coming of new biology and and

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940
I saw the coming of new biology and and
 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.230
I saw the coming of new biology and and
and the promises of biomedical research

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240
and the promises of biomedical research
 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.110
and the promises of biomedical research
so I shifted my interest from physics to

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120
so I shifted my interest from physics to
 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.670
so I shifted my interest from physics to
to life sciences and and ultimately went

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
to life sciences and and ultimately went
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.400
to life sciences and and ultimately went
to medical school with the idea that I

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410
to medical school with the idea that I
 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.010
to medical school with the idea that I
would somehow pursue medical research

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020
would somehow pursue medical research
 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.170
would somehow pursue medical research
and my real focus in medicine did not

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180
and my real focus in medicine did not
 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.140
and my real focus in medicine did not
come until sometime later when I was

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150
come until sometime later when I was
 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.010
come until sometime later when I was
doing my clinical training and when I

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020
doing my clinical training and when I
 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.370
doing my clinical training and when I
first encountered patients with what we

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380
first encountered patients with what we
 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.940
first encountered patients with what we
now call AIDS and that sparked a real

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950
now call AIDS and that sparked a real
 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.170
now call AIDS and that sparked a real
interest in me and I have pursued that

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180
interest in me and I have pursued that
 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.590
interest in me and I have pursued that
kind of research ever since now 1982

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600
 
 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.230
 
I I was initially interested in

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
I I was initially interested in
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.190
I I was initially interested in
cardiology but gradually I realize

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200
cardiology but gradually I realize
 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.870
cardiology but gradually I realize
infections affect many many people

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880
infections affect many many people
 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.810
infections affect many many people
throughout the world and many of the

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820
throughout the world and many of the
 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.380
throughout the world and many of the
infections are actually manageable or

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390
infections are actually manageable or
 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.630
infections are actually manageable or
treatable and we could make an impact

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640
treatable and we could make an impact
 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.250
treatable and we could make an impact
and in particular I was interested in

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260
and in particular I was interested in
 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.580
and in particular I was interested in
new infections that plagued the world

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590
new infections that plagued the world
 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.000
new infections that plagued the world
and when I was doing my medical training

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010
and when I was doing my medical training
 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.430
and when I was doing my medical training
there were a number of new infections

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440
there were a number of new infections
 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.770
there were a number of new infections
that emerge including what we call

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780
that emerge including what we call
 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.900
that emerge including what we call
Legionnaires disease and Lyme disease

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910
Legionnaires disease and Lyme disease
 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.160
Legionnaires disease and Lyme disease
today but as I was finishing medical

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170
today but as I was finishing medical
 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.440
today but as I was finishing medical
training I encounter some of the

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.450
training I encounter some of the
 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.430
training I encounter some of the
earliest cases of hiv/aids and I

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440
earliest cases of hiv/aids and I
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.380
earliest cases of hiv/aids and I
realized that was a fascinating

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390
realized that was a fascinating
 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.330
realized that was a fascinating
scientific challenge in terms of trying

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.340
scientific challenge in terms of trying
 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.920
scientific challenge in terms of trying
to understand what was the underlying

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930
to understand what was the underlying
 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.640
to understand what was the underlying
cause but I did not realize that he

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650
cause but I did not realize that he
 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.260
cause but I did not realize that he
would become a major public health

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.270
would become a major public health
 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.680
would become a major public health
problem until sometime later

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:00.690
 
 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.050
 
well I was doing my chief medical year

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.060
well I was doing my chief medical year
 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.810
well I was doing my chief medical year
as chief resident in internal medicine

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:08.820
as chief resident in internal medicine
 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.530
as chief resident in internal medicine
in the west side of Los Angeles when the

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:12.540
in the west side of Los Angeles when the
 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.070
in the west side of Los Angeles when the
very first case was a young homosexual

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080
very first case was a young homosexual
 

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.950
very first case was a young homosexual
man who presented to the hospital with a

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960
man who presented to the hospital with a
 

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.830
man who presented to the hospital with a
multitude of problems all of which

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840
multitude of problems all of which
 

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.170
multitude of problems all of which
suggests that his immune system was not

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180
suggests that his immune system was not
 

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.990
suggests that his immune system was not
functioning very well and that was

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000
functioning very well and that was
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.750
functioning very well and that was
curious to me because he was not getting

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:29.760
curious to me because he was not getting
 

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.020
curious to me because he was not getting
any chemotherapy or radiation or any

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.030
any chemotherapy or radiation or any
 

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.520
any chemotherapy or radiation or any
drugs that would suppress the immune

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:34.530
drugs that would suppress the immune
 

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.670
drugs that would suppress the immune
system it was immediately clear that we

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680
system it was immediately clear that we
 

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.089
system it was immediately clear that we
were looking at something new because

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:40.099
were looking at something new because
 

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:42.980
were looking at something new because
such a case was never described in the

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:42.990
such a case was never described in the
 

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.230
such a case was never described in the
textbooks and and then he was treated

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240
textbooks and and then he was treated
 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.390
textbooks and and then he was treated
for his acute problems but only to die a

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.400
for his acute problems but only to die a
 

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.690
for his acute problems but only to die a
few weeks later and then another case

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700
few weeks later and then another case
 

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.210
few weeks later and then another case
that was quite similar came in and

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220
that was quite similar came in and
 

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.910
that was quite similar came in and
another and another in rapid succession

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920
another and another in rapid succession
 

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.540
another and another in rapid succession
we had five such cases and it was too

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:05.550
we had five such cases and it was too
 

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.800
we had five such cases and it was too
much of a coincidence to observe this

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
much of a coincidence to observe this
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.110
much of a coincidence to observe this
and we realized that something was going

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120
and we realized that something was going
 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.320
and we realized that something was going
on with a common theme and from there

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.330
on with a common theme and from there
 

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.390
on with a common theme and from there
medical history it was pretty clear that

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.400
medical history it was pretty clear that
 

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.980
medical history it was pretty clear that
it was a transmissible disease and the

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:21.990
it was a transmissible disease and the
 

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.470
it was a transmissible disease and the
search was on to hunt down that that

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480
search was on to hunt down that that
 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:33.680
search was on to hunt down that that
microbe that was the underlying cause

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:33.690
