00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:02.517
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:05.485
is discuss the difference
between normative statements

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:09.664
and positive statements, and
you'll see these words used

00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:11.894
usually in an economic context,

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:13.921
sometimes a philosophical one.

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.629
A normative statement is
one that really is a matter

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:19.312
of opinion, maybe a matter of ethics,

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:23.415
something that someone thinks
is how the world should be.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.834
While a positive statement
is something that,

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:27.920
it doesn't necessarily have to be true

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.616
but it's something that can be tested.

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:32.329
So what we're going to do in this video

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.598
is look at a bunch of
statements around economics

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.633
and think about whether
they would be classified

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.494
as normative statements,
things that are opinions,

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:42.588
that are a matter of ethics or morals,

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:44.689
or whether they are positive statements,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.005
things that can be tested.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.088
So let's look at our first statement.

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:53.006
This says, "Paying people
who aren't working,

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:57.389
"even though they could
work, is wrong and unfair."

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.454
So regardless of whether or not you agree

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.681
with this statement, is
it a normative statement

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.120
or a positive statement?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.152
Well the fact that
someone's saying it's wrong

00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:10.362
and it's unfair, this is pretty
clearly a matter of opinion

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.904
so this would be a normative statement.

00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:17.708
You can't test whether
this is wrong or unfair,

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:21.871
you would just have to believe
that it is wrong and unfair.

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.871
Now let's look at another statement.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.407
Programs like welfare reduce the incentive

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:31.990
for people to work.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.348
Is this a normative statement
or a positive statement?

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:40.354
Well it might feel a little normative,

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:42.029
it might feel like this is an opinion,

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.209
but it actually can be tested.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.864
You could institute some welfare
program on some small scale

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:49.755
and compare it to a comparable place

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:52.590
where there isn't a welfare
program and see what it does

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.262
for incentives to work, you survey people,

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:58.388
you see how many people work
in one situation or another.

00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:01.336
It might be a false statement,
it might be a true statement,

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:04.499
but either way, it actually can be tested,

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.582
so this would be a positive statement

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:12.785
so I'll put it in this
category right over here,

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:16.328
this is a positive, positive statement.

00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:18.258
Alright, let's look at another one.

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:22.091
This say, "Raising taxes
on the wealthy to pay

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.474
"for government programs
grows the economy."

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:31.235
Is that a normative statement
or a positive statement?

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.459
Well once again, this can be tested.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.427
It might be true, it might
be false, maybe your test

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:40.061
is even inconclusive,
but it can be tested,

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.156
you could try to run a
simulation, you could look

00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:44.627
at case studies of
countries that did do this

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:46.991
and see what happens to their economy

00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:48.573
versus ones that didn't do it.

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:50.600
And so this is, even though
it looks like something

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.966
that someone who favors
raising taxes on the wealthy

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:56.513
maybe out of fairness arguments,
something that they would

00:02:56.513 --> 00:03:00.298
say, this statement
itself is not normative,

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:02.460
the statement can be tested,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.127
so this is a positive statement.

00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:10.317
A good giveaway for normative statement,

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:13.019
if it said something like
it is fair to raise taxes

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.395
on the wealthy to pay
for government programs,

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.050
that would have been a normative statement

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.406
or we should do this, that
would have been a normative

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:22.622
statement but here, this is
something that's testable.

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:27.467
Now the next statement,
"Raising taxes on the wealthy

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.252
"slows economic growth."

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:34.419
Is that a normative statement
or a positive statement?

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.334
Well, once again, this
might feel like someone

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.384
who is against raising
taxes, who think it's unfair

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:44.185
to raise taxes on the wealthy,
something that they would say

00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:47.133
but the statement itself
can actually be tested.

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.206
So this is also a positive statement,

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:51.394
even though in some ways
it's the opposite statement

00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:53.419
as the one that we just did.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.527
Because once again, we could
look at countries that did this

00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.796
and countries that didn't do this,

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:01.964
we could run a computer
simulation to try to understand

00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:04.359
whether this statement is true.

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.122
Let's do one last statement.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:11.083
This says, "The government
should raise taxes

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.872
"on the wealthy to pay
for helping the poor."

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:16.621
Is this normative or positive?

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:17.972
Well in this situation,

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:20.319
the word should is a pretty big giveaway,

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.946
should, or it's fair or unfair,
this is someone's opinion,

00:04:23.946 --> 00:04:25.648
it's not something that's testable,

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:27.738
you can't test whether this
statement is right or wrong,

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:30.815
it's based on, do you
believe ethically, morally,

00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:32.315
that this is true?

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.817
And so this is a normative statement,

00:04:36.817 --> 00:04:40.067
so I'll put it in the normative column.

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:44.868
So big picture, these words
normative and positive,

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.531
these are fancy words but
all they mean is normative

00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.617
is a matter of morals or opinion
and can't really be tested

00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:54.752
while a positive statement,
whether they're right or wrong

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.766
or whether you agree
or disagree with them,

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:59.859
these are things that in
theory could be tested.
