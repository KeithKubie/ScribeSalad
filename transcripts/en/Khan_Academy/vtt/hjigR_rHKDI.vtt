00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.320
Solve the system of equations
by graphing.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.800
Check your solution
algebraically.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.810
Let's graph each of these, and
let's start-- let me find a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.620
nice dark color to
graph these with.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.180
Let me graph this top equation
in blue, this parabola.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.170
The first thing to think about
is this going to be an upward

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.690
opening-- one, how did I
know it's a parabola?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.180
That's because it's a quadratic
function: we have an

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.510
x squared term, a second
degree term, here.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.870
Then we have to think about:
it is going to be upward

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.370
opening, or downward
opening parabola?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.940
You see that it's a negative
coefficient in front of the x

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.520
squared, so it's going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.500
What is going to be
its maximum point?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.330
Let's think about that
for a second.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.410
This whole term right here is
always going to be negative,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.540
or it's always going
to be non-positive.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.710
x squared will be non-negative
when you multiply it by a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.240
negative, so it's going
to be non-positive.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.560
So, the highest value that this
thing can take on is when

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.100
x is going to be equal to 0--
the vertex of this parabola is

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.560
when x is equal to 0,
and y is equal to 6.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
So, x is equal to 0, and
y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.710
So that right there is the
highest point of our parabola.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.480
Then, if we want, we can a
graph a couple of other

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.810
points, just to see
what happens.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.950
So let's see what happens when
x is equal to-- let me just

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.680
draw a little table here--
2, what is y?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.020
It's negative x squared
plus 6.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.090
So when x is 2, what is y?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.430
You have 2 squared, which is
4, but you have negative 2

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.200
squared, so it's negative 4
plus 6-- it is equal to 2.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.120
It's the same thing when
x is negative 2.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.500
You put negative 2 there, you
square it, then you have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.430
positive 4, but you have a
negative there, so it's

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.510
negative 4 plus 6 is 2.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.930
You have both of those points
there, so 2 comma 2, and then

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.450
you have a negative 2 comma 2.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.590
If I were to graph it, Let's try
it with 3, as well-- if we

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.190
put a 3 there, 3 squared is 9.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.419
It then becomes a negative 9
plus 3, it becomes negative 3,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.770
and negative 3 will also
become a negative 3.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.230
Negative 3 squared is positive
9, you have a negative out

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.250
front, it becomes negative 9
plus 6, which is negative 3.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.850
You have negative 3, negative
3, and then you have 3,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.780
negative 3.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.690
So those are all good points.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.000
Now we can graph our parabola.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.820
Our parabola will look
something-- I was doing well

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.480
until that second part --like
that, and let me just do the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.475
second part.

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:48.610
That second part is hard to
draw-- let me do it from here.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.530
It looks something like that.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.960
We connect to this dot
right here, and then

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.820
let me connect this.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.310
So that it looks something
like that.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.150
That's what our parabola looks
like, and obviously it keeps

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.990
going down in that direction.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.180
So that's that first graph.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.180
Let's graph this second one
over here: y is equal to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.660
negative 2x minus 2.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.830
This is just going
to be a line.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.510
It's a linear equation, and the
highest degree here is 1.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.420
Our y-intercept is negative
2, so 0, 1, 2.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.440
Our y-intercept is negative 2.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.820
Our slope is negative 2.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.420
If we move 1 in the x direction,
we're going to go 2

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.480
in the y-direction, and if we
move 2 in the x direction,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.600
we're going to move down
4 in the y direction.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.580
If we move back 2, we're going
to move up 2 in the y

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.800
direction, and it looks like we
found one of our points of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.090
intersection.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.370
Let's just draw that line, so
that line will look something

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.135
like-- It's hard for my hand to
draw that, but let me try

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:48.520
as best as I can.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.780
This is the hardest part.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.690
It will look something like
that right there.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.820
The question is, where
do they intersect?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.100
One point of intersection does
immediately pop out at us,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.330
because they asked us to
do it graphically.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.420
That point right there, which
is the point negative 2, 2.

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:19.690
It seems to pop out at
us, so this is the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.190
point negative 2, 2.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.440
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.150
When you have the point negative
2, when you put x is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.540
equal to negative 2 here,
negative 2 times negative 2 is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.370
4 minus 2, and y
is equal to 2.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.860
When you put negative 2 here, y
is also equal to 2, so that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.860
makes sense.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.070
There's going to be some other
point way out here where they

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.520
also intersect.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.090
There's also going to be some
other point way out here if we

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.210
keep making this parabola.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.600
When y is equal to positive 4,
and you have negative 16 plus

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.680
6, you get negative 10.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760
So, positive 1, 2, 3, 4, and
then you go down 10.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.300
That looks like that might
be our other point of

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.680
intersection, so let me connect
this right there.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.140
Our other point of intersection

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.210
looks to be right there.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.670
If we just follow this red
line it looks like we

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.850
intersect there.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.490
Let's verify that
it works out.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.130
So 4, negative 10.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.980
We know that that's on this
blue line, so let's see if

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.940
it's on this other line.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.370
So negative 2 times 4 minus 2,
that is negative 8 minus 2,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.180
which is equal to negative 10.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.000
The point 4, negative 10,
is on both of them.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.070
When x is equal to 4, y is
negative 10 for both equations

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.670
here, so they both definitely
work out.
