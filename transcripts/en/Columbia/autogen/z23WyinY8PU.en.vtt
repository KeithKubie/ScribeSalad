stockpiling transfer use or threatening
 

00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:05.379
stockpiling transfer use or threatening
to use the nuclear weapons which is this

to use the nuclear weapons which is this
 

00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:08.529
to use the nuclear weapons which is this
was a very controversial aspect because

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:08.539
was a very controversial aspect because
 

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:12.580
was a very controversial aspect because
by prohibiting the threat of use one is

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:12.590
by prohibiting the threat of use one is
 

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.249
by prohibiting the threat of use one is
also the legitimizing nuclear deterrence

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.109
prohibition norm in addition of course
it will be very easy to negotiate a

00:30:39.109 --> 00:30:39.119
it will be very easy to negotiate a
 

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:44.570
it will be very easy to negotiate a
treaty among nuclear non-nuclear States

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580
 
 

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.210
 
and that was the initial focus of the

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:48.220
and that was the initial focus of the
 

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.980

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.080
so that created a very important
complexity in the negotiation so that we

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.090
complexity in the negotiation so that we
 

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.330
complexity in the negotiation so that we
create norms and procedures not only for

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:06.340
create norms and procedures not only for
 

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.340
create norms and procedures not only for
the accession of non-nuclear States but

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:08.350
the accession of non-nuclear States but
 

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.190
the accession of non-nuclear States but
also for the accession of nuclear powers

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200
also for the accession of nuclear powers
 

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.169
also for the accession of nuclear powers
meaning a state that has possessed

00:31:13.169 --> 00:31:13.179
meaning a state that has possessed
 

00:31:13.179 --> 00:31:16.139
meaning a state that has possessed
nuclear weapons can destroy the nuclear

00:31:16.139 --> 00:31:16.149
nuclear weapons can destroy the nuclear
 

00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:18.810
nuclear weapons can destroy the nuclear
weapons and enjoy the treaty having

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:18.820
weapons and enjoy the treaty having
 

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.430

I confronted their input with
delegations that were negotiating these

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:52.700
delegations that were negotiating these
 

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.850
delegations that were negotiating these
aspects and sometimes the guys didn't

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:54.860
aspects and sometimes the guys didn't
 

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.010
aspects and sometimes the guys didn't
like that very much but at the end it

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.020
like that very much but at the end it
 

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.540

you know we are government delegates I
 

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.270
you know we are government delegates I
mean we are not here to negotiate with

to avert many risks that the opponents
 

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.240
to avert many risks that the opponents
of the treaty had mentioned that the

but not least the conference was able to

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:41.750
but not least the conference was able to
 

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.740
but not least the conference was able to
benefit from a very very strong

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:44.750
benefit from a very very strong
 

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.380

also because I myself had not been
engaged in nuclear politics before so it

00:40:24.609 --> 00:40:24.619

in the tropical areas as you know we've

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:30.830
in the tropical areas as you know we've
 

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:35.380

countries such as the United States in
 

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:40.060
countries such as the United States in
Europe and so the only way to handle

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:40.070
Europe and so the only way to handle
 

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:43.780

that is through education in the

and controlling the vectors and
 

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.430
and controlling the vectors and
and the way to do that is preventing the

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440
and the way to do that is preventing the
 

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.010
and the way to do that is preventing the
mosquitoes to lay their eggs in stagnant
