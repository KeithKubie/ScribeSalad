00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.909
For this project I’m going to show you how
to take homemade treats to the next level,

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.649
by making your own silicone candy molds, at
home.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.619
To start this project we’re going to need
some LEGO.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.240
I went to a local store and picked out a bunch
of random pieces for around $9, but the stuff

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.740
you’ve got lying around your house will
work just as well.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.120
You’re also going to need a baseplate for
holding the bricks in place, and if you want

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.490
to copy the style of my mold, then you’ll
need 4 1x1 bricks (maroon), 9 1x2s (blue),

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.830
15 2x2s (green), 2 1x3s (grey), 4 2x4s (yellow),
4 1x4s (black), and 6 2x4 bricks.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.500
Oh yeah, and you’re going to need another
46 2x4s so you can start building a retaining wall 2 layers tall.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.989
The baseplate I got is 32 studs wide by 32
studs across, and if you start with one of

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.620
the 2x4s and press it into place leaving 4
nubs exposed on the bottom and 3 nubs exposed

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.690
on the side, then everything else should come
together perfectly.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.350
Continue laying the big bricks down in a straight
line until you get within 4 stubs of the end, then turn left.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.649
You’ll want to keep placing more bricks
until you’ve formed a square, then move

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.549
up one layer so you can do the same thing
on top, but this time, overlapping the bricks so they’re staggered.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.759
Ok our retaining wall is looking pretty good,
so let’s move on to filling the inside with

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.839
whatever LEGO shapes we want our candies to
look like.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.680
I decided to keep my mold relatively simple
by arranging the bricks in a way that optimizes

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
the space and keeps it as user friendly as
possible. But you can get really creative

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.529
and make your mold any shape or size you want
to.

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.259
Whatever you choose it’s important to make
sure everything is pressed down and compacted

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.600
tightly enough, so that it minimizes any gaps
between the pieces.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.660
Ok with all these pieces pressed firmly into
place our LEGO candy mold is optimized and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.549
ready to be cast with silicone, so let’s
move on to doing that next.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.759
Now I cast my rubber candy molds with a 1lb
kit of general purpose silicone I got from

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.969
a local special effects supply company.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.689
If you don’t have anything like that nearby,
or just prefer to use food grade silicone

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.029
instead, then check the video description
for a link on where you can find a 2lb kit for about the same price.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:57.649
Opening up the big container you can see it's
full of a white silicone goop, that has the consistency of wood glue.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.420
Ok, now let’s dump the entire contents of
the second bottle into the mix and be prepared

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.239
to work relatively quickly, because once these
two substances mix together, you only get

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.459
around 30 minutes of work time before the
silicone starts setting up.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.220
This second liquid is a catalyst that’ll
help get the silicone hardening, and it’s

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.920
bright blue so we can tell when the two substances
are thoroughly mixed together.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.500
The idea here is to to keep folding the 2
parts together until the color is completely

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500
uniform. And as soon as it is, I recommend
transferring the mix to a second paper bowl,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
and double-checking that nothing got missed
accidentally.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.670
Alright you can see our mix is blended really
well at this point, and if we had access to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.410
a vacuum chamber, this would be the time to
suck all the air bubbles out so we could get the best results.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.360
But I don’t have a vacuum chamber and you
probably don’t either, so let’s just skip

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.660
that part and pour the silicone goop directly
into the center of our mold instead.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.480
This stuff is about the same consistency as
processed honey, so as it dribbles straight

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.720
down into the center of the mold, the liquid
naturally begins flowing in to fill all the spaces below.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.750
As the silicone slowly spreads out, it gently
pushes any air out of the bottom, which is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.090
really important for making the finished product
look nice.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.670
At this point we’ve got the entire one-pound
mix of silicone poured into the mold, and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.870
all that’s left to do is just give the mold a little wiggle to encourage any loose air

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.880
bubbles to rise to the top,  then leave it out to set for about 24 hours.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.500
When you come back the next day, your silicone
will probably look exactly the same, but this

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.340
time, instead of being sticky and gooey like
it was before, you’ll find it feels strangely

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.980
hard and rubbery, which is exactly what you
want.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.680
Let’s go ahead and take it out, and clean
it up a bit.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.320
Start by gently prying the entire LEGO mold
upward, and let the rubber release from the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.530
baseplate at whatever pace it needs to.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.460
When it finally detaches, take a look underneath
and you should see all the LEGO pieces stuck

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.610
inside, and completely encapsulated by rubber.
How cool is that?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.560
Go ahead and break the retaining wall off
from around the sides, then pick the bricks

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.000
out of the center, to reveal, your brand new
candy mold creation.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.720
Now there will probably be some areas where
the silicone seeped in between the cracks

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.940
a bit, but that’s not a big deal at all.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.770
Just grab the rubber tags with your fingers
and give them a quick tug rip them off.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.440
It doesn’t take much effort, and after about
5 minutes of tidying up, you should have yourself

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.209
a very clean, and very professional looking
LEGO candy mold.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.170
These custom candy molds are fun and rubbery,
extremely stretchy, and very durable.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.430
And if you look closely, you can see how the
silicone captures every minute detail perfectly,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.120
which means your candies will come out looking
exactly like the real thing.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
The silicone molds are dishwasher safe and
can be cleaned really easily just by running hot water over them.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.699
And not only will they make a mountain of
gummy candies like the ones I showed you in

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.069
a previous video, but they’ll cast chocolates
as well.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.789
Now some people might wonder if it’s ok
to use general purpose silicone for casting

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.379
candies, and with the stuff I’m using it’s
just fine because casting silicone is inert

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.430
and impressively non-reactive.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.939
You could probably eat pieces of the mold
itself and be just fine. But if you have any

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:37.330
concerns at all, just make yours with “food
grade” silicone instead.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.419
I found this 2lb kit online for about the
same price, and I’ll put a link in the description

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.879
to where you can find it.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.759
One pound of silicone makes one LEGO mold
like this, so a two-pound kit will make two of them.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.919
But if you want to try playing around and
experimenting a bit, you can cast just about

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.379
anything you can think of.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.479
I made a mini LEGO mold for my kids to play
with, and another mold for casting custom

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.379
chocolate bars, which I’ll show you how
to make in another project video.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:06.219
Well now you know how to use LEGO bricks and
a 2 part silicone mix, to create custom silicone candy molds at home.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.449
That’s it for now. If you liked this project,
perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
