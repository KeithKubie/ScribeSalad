00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.371
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.007
- That's why Plato
was a huge jagoff.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:08.842
(bell ringing)

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.877
Class dismissed.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:14.113
- Wait but you didn't
give us any homework.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:18.218
- Dave can I talk to you
for a second in private.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Look if this is
about the dick pics,

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.257 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean you can't just
say hey that's your dick.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:26.725
- No, that' not, that's not it.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.360
What do you mean by dick pics?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.297
- My friend his name's
Dick and he's short.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.565
- Okay.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.233
Well listen Dave,
I understand that

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.636 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're quite a
competitor with women.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.804
- You mean a player?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.405
- Yes a player.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:43.942 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now I'm getting into the
game and I needed some advice

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:45.577
'cause I'm going out with a very

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:47.580
high temperatured woman tonight.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.747
- You mean hot woman?

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:51.750 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yes hot Woman
Studies professor, yes.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.820
- I don't think I can help you.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.788
- Well then maybe I'll
do a little investigation

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.924
into those ding
dong photographs.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.593
- I'll help.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.095
- Good, thank you.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.633
Okay, now what happens when a
woman and a guy, they go out.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.436
(tinkling music)

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.339
I'm professor Rich,
expert in science.

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:16.442
These are my devoted students.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.844
Together with the aid
of harmless drugs,

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:23.616 align:start size:97% position:3%
we explore sciences greatest
hypothetical questions.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.252
(upbeat music)

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
E equals MC squared,
discovered by Albert Einstein.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.971
What does it mean to us?

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.540
- Well it's perhaps the most
famous scientific equation

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.874
in all of history.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.442
- Boom.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:54.714
- Hmm if it's so famous then
why have I never heard of it?

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The beauty of this
equation is it's simplicity.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.487 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
E which stands for
energy, equal mass times

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.656 line:0%
the speed of light squared.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.192
- So what you're saying
is E equals MC squared.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.527
- Yeah, exactly.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.297
But what if we were wrong?

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.167
What if E did not
equal MC squared?

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.636 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well I guess
that would make it

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.905
two times that I
don't give shit.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.173
- I don't know professor,

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.508 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean it's a pretty
iron clad theory.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.809
Countless scientists.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.813
- Come on people
open up your minds.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.149
(grunting)

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.551
Not that way Pat.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.353
I needed to speak to
someone well versed

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:37.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
in Einstein's
field of expertise.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.993 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I tracked down a
professor on the internet.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:44.864 line:0%
So if you could explain
in the simplest terms

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.434 line:0%
Einsteins' equation
E equals MC squared.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.435
- Oh of course.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.936
- I mean I know it, but.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.871 align:start size:97% position:3%
- When Einstein came up
with that equation the basic

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.542 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
statement he was making
was that you can get energy

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
from mass and from mass
you can get energy.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:05.050 line:0%
And what made those equal was
C the speed of light squared.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.286
So E is equal to MC squared.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.556
- What if we turn this
on it's head and said,

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:14.026
what if E did not
equal MC squared?

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:15.194
- Right.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.096 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- I know I have trouble
carrying the one,

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.565 line:0%
what if Einstein
forgot to do that.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.302 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The main question we have
is how does general relativity

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:26.238 line:0%
tie into quantum mechanics
which is the small scale.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.774
Once we are able to do
that we're gonna be able

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:32.645 align:start size:97% position:3%
to tie the big structure of
the universe to the tiny atom.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.479
- I have a question.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.914
- Sure, go ahead.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.916 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm having a date
tonight and I was wondering

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.084
if I should wear a bolo tie?

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:41.420 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well do you have a really
good cowboy hat to go with it?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.621
- I have no hats.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.124 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Then you shouldn't
wear a bolo tie.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.260
- Thank you very much.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.263
(upbeat rock music)

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:56.268
- Wow.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:59.438
Nice outfit, midlife crisis.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:00.273
- Thanks.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.109 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Here's the thing you just
don't wanna do anything weird.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.077
Laters.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:06.111
- Wait, where are you going?

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.647
I need you to be my wing man.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.914
(laughing)

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:09.849
- On a date?

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.951
No that is a bad idea.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.186
- I need you to give me
some advice like close by

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.322
like those ear piece shows.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.491
I don't wanna end up with soup
all over me or something, no.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.293
- There she is.

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.327
Okay just go.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.161
Yeah go.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.433 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hello, I'm Professor
Susan Camberwell.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.968
You must be Professor Rich.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:29.869
- Enchante.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.706
Um who gives a shit right?

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.644
- Right, well um, shall
we get something to eat

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
or is that too
compassionate for you?

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:41.981
(laughing)

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.948
- Oh!

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.717
- Made you flinch.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.352
- Why?

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.021
- I dunno, it's fun.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.830 align:start size:97% position:3%
Food here is very
underrated don't you think?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.465
- I usually don't come here.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.068
I'm a strict vegan
so I go off campus.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.636
Have you ever been to
Papadums Don't Preach?

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:08.340
- Yes, I mean no,
but I mean I think

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.843
off campus is very underrated.

00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:14.213
- Where do you go, like what?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.482
- Local Art.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.850
- Local Art.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.486 align:start position:0%
- Oh, have you been to
Schwartz's Gallery they feature

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:24.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
these art paintings
directly from vaginas.

00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:25.358
- Ow!

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.493
- It's a ghost.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.194
Ah I gotta go, great date.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.364
(shrieking)

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:34.534
- God, I knew this
plan wouldn't work.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:36.535
I tried to tell him.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.170
I'm sorry.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.005
I'm David.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:41.207
- Hi.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.875
- Fucking soup.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.510
I was confused.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.179
I needed to speak
to the man himself.

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:51.083
Surprisingly I found
him on the internet.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.853
In 5,000 words or less
how would you describe

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
your special Theory
of Relativity?

00:05:57.222 --> 00:06:01.394
- E equal MC squared where E
equals energy, M equals mass,

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:07.233
C equals the speed of light.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.570 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
The speed of light is
186,000 miles per second.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.804
- Okay Einstein.

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:12.705 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.539
- No really.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.440
- Oh, okay.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:17.542
- Oh keep going.

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:20.245
- So it was that equation that

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:22.749
gave birth to the atomic bomb.

00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:26.919
- Have you ever been
wrong about anything?

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.821
- Well I have to think
real hard about that one,

00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:32.425
but I denied quantum mechanics,

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:36.629
and I was wrong about that one.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.233
- Is it possible that E
doesn't equal MC squared?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.633
I rest my case.

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:44.269
- No it's not, it's impossible.

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:47.106
When the light went near
the Sun, then it bent.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.007
- Right.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.107
- That took care of that.

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:51.077
- Explain please.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.612
- It's in the math.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.781
- So wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.684
You expect us to believe that
you met with Albert Einstein?

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.786
- Did he say that his
theory could be wrong?

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:03.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well you know, humans
are wrong, he said,

00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:06.459
so his theories could be wrong.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.764
He loves Warcraft by the way.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.598
- [Girl Student] Oh.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.432
- Really?

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.633
- [Rich] Yeah.

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:17.469
- Maybe I should
look into this guy.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:20.439
- Oh hi Susan, what
brings you here?

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.007
- I just came to apologize.

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:25.010
- Oh don't worry I mean I think
we got of on the wrong foot.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.947
- Uh I'm sorry I had to
leave your dorm so fast,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.147
I had an early class.

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:32.117
- Oh don't worry about it baby.

00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:33.318
You forgot your toothbrush.

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:34.320
- Thank you.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.822
And thanks for that dick pic.

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.625 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Ah if it's long,
send it along.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.460
(laughing)

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.360
- Come here.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.328
- You want a kiss or something?

00:07:43.328 --> 00:07:44.163
- Yeah.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.332
- Alright.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.901
(bright music)

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.904
- I'll see you later.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.505
- Wait.

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:54.340
- Okay.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.844
- That's how you do it.

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.413
(upbeat music)

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.757
- My first marriage
I had two children.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.325
- Uh huh.

00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:15.194
- And then like I said she
wasn't taking care of me.
