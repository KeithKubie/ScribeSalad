00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.820
GEORGE ZAIDAN: All right.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.409
We're going to
talk about hosting.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.450
I'm going to go through
rules quickly, guidelines

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.960
just the same as we did before.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.720
Then I'm going to read a short
section of one of your scripts.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.350
You're going to
critique my hosting.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.800
And then we'll do the same
thing for some of you.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.500
Again, we won't do everyone.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.550
This we covered already.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.371
Don't read it.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:46.870
Tell it.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.665
This is the Hourglass
video from before.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.880
This is a subtle point.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.390
You can start off by imitating
someone else's hosting style,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.990
but you'll invariably just
get caught, as like that's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.099
the only thing that you can do.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.220
And since it's not
your own personality,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
it's just sort of weird and
unnatural, and doesn't work.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.130
I did this when I was
first starting out.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.570
It did not end well.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.090
These are my words
of wisdom to you.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.800
And no more needs to
be said about that.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.890
This is a really hard one.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.770
So there's this device
called interview something.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.834
I don't know.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.500
There's a famous
director, who basically

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.070
has a silver mirror that he
puts in front of the camera.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.767
And there's an image below.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.850
It's like a teleprompter,
except, instead of text,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.040
you see a person's face.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.420
You see the interviewer's face.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.890
So the interviewee is looking
straight into the camera lens,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.410
but that person
is actually seeing

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.486
the face of the person
who's interviewing them.

00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.110
So who's seen the
movie The Fog of War?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.860
No one else?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.497
OK.

00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:01.330
You should watch it.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.639
It's really interesting.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:03.430
It's a documentary.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.630
It's an interview movie.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.620
And not Richard Nixon.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.420
The Secretary of War for the
Vietnam War was McNamara.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.940
So he was interviewed on that
movie using this technique.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.840
And it's a really
interesting technique.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.240
But the point is when you
look into the camera--

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.490
we don't have a fancy device
like that, unfortunately.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.150
But when you look into a
camera, see a person's face,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.630
preferably someone
that you know,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.000
whether it's like a
friend, husband, wife, son,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.260
daughter, whatever it is.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.820
Pick someone, and see
their face on camera.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.470
That is the quickest
and easiest way

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.660
to make your hosting more
natural without really

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.060
thinking about it.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.150
And that's very hard
to do, because you're

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.970
thinking of your script.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.740
You're thinking of
18,000 other things.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.510
But that's the most
important rule.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.620
Usually, the camera
tones you down.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.410
So if you are talking like
you would normally talk,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.140
you will kind of seem
like this on camera.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.000
It just tones you down
and slows you down,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.780
and lowers your energy level,
unless it's right in your face.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.370
Then it's different.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.180
But usually it's not
right in your face.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.150
So you need to
compensate by-- I really

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.530
hesitate to say, up
your energy level,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.800
because when people say that the
initial reaction is to be like,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.470
and then, you need
to talk like this,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.710
because that's how-- and that
just doesn't work either.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.760
So you want to be a
more energetic version

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.850
of your natural self.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.410
So think of if you were just
really excited about something,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.570
how would you actually be?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.430
That's how you
should be on camera.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.710
ELIZABETH CHOE: And just
to have physical metrics,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.272
higher energy doesn't mean
higher pitch and tone.

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:43.910
That's the biggest thing that
happens when they say, now,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.710
with more energy.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.420
Then people talk with a
higher tone, like this.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.010
And that's the last thing
you want to do, generally.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.190
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.820
So now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to read this.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.010
And you all are going to
critique my hosting style.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.320
And I'm going to read
it as if-- I'm going

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.490
to deliver it as if-- oh, wait.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.800
No, most of this is a quote.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.500
So let me do something else.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.680
I'll do this.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.891
I'm going to deliver this
as though it's not my job.

00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.390
OK.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.800
Ready?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.299
Here we go.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.110
Why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.070
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.320
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside with all

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.810
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.630
while others can wear one
layer for a morning jog?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.470
What makes all the difference?

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.210
OK.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.432
Critique.

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:36.244
What was wrong with that?

00:04:36.244 --> 00:04:36.743
Yeah?

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.550
AUDIENCE: I felt like
you could do more.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.830
GEORGE ZAIDAN: In what way?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.786
AUDIENCE: So you were
restrained by the fact

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:44.030
that you were looking
at somebody else's work.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.010
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.760
That is true.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.680
So if I was reading something
that I had written myself,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.370
I'd probably do a better job.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.590
But in this case-- you will
be reading your own work.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.540
So that won't be quite the same.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.130
Yeah?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.940
AUDIENCE: So I think
just how you read it,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.690
it seemed like you
were asking a question,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.810
but there's no, oh yeah,
I've never thought about it.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.124
It's like, why do some people
handle cold better than others?

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:07.040
Maybe if you changed it
to like, have you ever

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.847
wondered why some
people-- and try to-- I

00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:11.680
don't know if it's the
structure of sentence

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.681
or just how you said it.

00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:14.680
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And this
is part of the exercise,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.030
as I'm reading it word for word.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.030
So let's assume that I
can't change the wording.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.279
I mean, in real life, you can.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.740
But what could I do just
with intonation of my voice,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.035
or what else?

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:27.482
AUDIENCE: Maybe slow
down a little bit,

00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:29.580
and really hit
that question hard.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.330
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.440
You were going to-- no,
you had your hand up.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.320
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to think a bit more.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.260
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.730
AUDIENCE: The intonation,
when you ask a question,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.046
you probably want to
raise it at the end.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:48.516
And if you were to ask
a very [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:50.432
because there are a
couple of questions there.

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:53.288
So I guess you can pick the
one that you really want them

00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:55.160
to think and give them pause.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.900
So get them to think
before you [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.790
ELIZABETH CHOE:
That's a good point,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.230
that you can create suspension
in your tone of voice.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.460
But a lot of people
make the mistake

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.050
of assuming that every question
has to end with an uptone.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.550
Right?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.860
A powerful question can be posed
with the tone ending downwards.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.610
Why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.360
That is still a
strong question even

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.270
though I didn't say, why
do some people handle

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.990
the cold better than others?

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.740
That actually is--

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.323
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Well, you didn't
end upward on either of those.

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:32.640
The ending upward is like,
why do some people handle

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.330
cold better than others?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.150
That's the traditional way
that people asks questions.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.170
But I agree with you.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.710
The way that I read it, all
the questions were flat.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.496
All had the same intonation.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:43.870
What I really want
to do is vary.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.840
So something like,
why do some people

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.680
handle cold better than others?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.670
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.620
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.760
the winter gear, all the
mask and all that stuff,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.030
where other people can just
where one layer for a morning

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.529
jog?

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.280
What's the difference?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.061
So each question I asked there
in a totally different way.

00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:04.560
What else?

00:07:08.814 --> 00:07:10.480
ELIZABETH CHOE: So a
big piece of advice

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.915
that we give to students
is to think about the words

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:15.062
that you're saying,
which is also the hardest

00:07:15.062 --> 00:07:17.270
thing to do when you're
trying to remember everything

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.250
that you're saying.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.040
You have a camera
in front of you.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.870
But that's also why we
often take the script away

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.380
from the students.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.050
It's easy to get
caught up in, oh shoot,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.860
I have to remember
all the words.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.140
And I'm very, very
guilty of this as well.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.100
So I totally understand
how hard it is to do.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.920
But when you are asking
the question genuinely,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.860
why do some people get cold
while other people don't?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.930
The way I said that was
very different than why

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.270
do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.020
When I'm actually thinking
about the words that I'm saying,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.910
which is a very obvious
suggestion to make, but,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.420
again, very hard to
implement yourself,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.402
the intonation and
the delivery become

00:07:57.402 --> 00:07:59.319
a lot more natural and genuine.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.360
I don't know if you want
to add anything to that.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.440
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah,
and that's another rule.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.731
Like when you look into the
camera, see someone's face,

00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:07.960
that's something that you
can do that doesn't-- I mean,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.230
it requires some preparation.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.046
But it doesn't require thought
while you're actually doing it.

00:08:12.046 --> 00:08:14.170
So when you look in the
camera, see someone's face.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.510
And actually think about
the words that you're saying

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.401
is helpful too.

00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:20.150
ELIZABETH CHOE: You
want to avoid monotony

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.900
not just in the intonation.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.350
So you don't want to say,
why do some people handle

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.510
cold better than the others?

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.540
Why is it that some
are so fearful-- right,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.809
that's monotonous in tone, but
it's also monotonous in rhythm.

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:32.309
All right.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.530
So when George said
it the second time,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.210
he rushed through
some of the words

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.860
in the middle that were in a
list, which is very natural.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.250
When we're like, this
morning I have to go to work,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.541
and I have to do this, and
I have to do this, and this,

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:45.310
you rush through
things that you list.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.030
Whereas, if you're just
reading like you would read,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.326
you say it with the
same rhythmic pacing.

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.480
You make the pauses
where the punctuation is.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.900
You sound very even with the
way you break up your words.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.420
And that's super unnatural.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.270
That's why it sounds robotic.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.180
So when you mix up not only
the intonation, but also

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.569
the speed at which you're
delivering some of the words--

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:09.110
I don't know.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.901
You can do it again
and maybe pay attention

00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:12.000
to how he does it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.230
That's kind of also why it
feels a lot more natural.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.000
So I'm going to do it again,
this time completely different,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.710
and get your critique as well.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.600
Why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.850
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.740
that they would rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.590
the winter gear on, mask
and all, while others can

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.800
where one layer
for a morning jog?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.830
What's the difference?

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.210
Was that better or worse
than the first time I did it?

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.106
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like a Ted Ed video.

00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:43.980
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It sounds
like a Ted Ed video?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.539
Oh man, then I'm not making
very good Ted Ed videos.

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:48.997
AUDIENCE: Better than the first,
not as good as the second.

00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:50.140
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.640
Why?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.384
What was inauthentic about that?

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:59.417
AUDIENCE: You sounded too
intentionally energized.

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:00.250
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.940
So normally, when we say
to someone, up your energy,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.670
or when anyone says that,
that's what comes out.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.920
You get this weird,
I have to really try

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.024
to be excited about this,
because I don't really

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:13.940
know what I'm reading.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.930
But I'm going to just
emphasize random words

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.190
and say them louder.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.860
And that makes it exciting.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.890
No, it doesn't make it.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.972
And especially, if you mix that
in with a bit of newscastery,

00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:27.430
then you're just
dead in the water,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:33.040
because you end up with the
most unwatchable video ever.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.040
ELIZABETH CHOE: And you
sound like you're trying

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.612
to talk to a 2-year-old too.

00:10:37.612 --> 00:10:42.500
I think that's the final
effect, which we want to avoid.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.250
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.841
Now, I'm going to read it again.

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.590
And this is going to
be a bit more subtle.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.990
Here we go.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.570
Why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.630
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.004
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:56.490
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.500
while others can wear
one layer and be fine?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.985
What makes the difference?

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:02.360
What does that
sound like to you?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.794
AUDIENCE: It sounds
more natural,

00:11:03.794 --> 00:11:05.085
like you're talking to someone.

00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:07.500
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It definitely
sounds more natural.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.550
Any critique of it?

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.242
AUDIENCE: I think it sounded a
little disinterested at parts.

00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:13.970
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Uh-huh.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.148
Why?

00:11:15.148 --> 00:11:17.439
AUDIENCE: It was kind of like
a little bit of a mumble,

00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:20.579
like when I talk, and I'm
going on like this. [MUMBLING]

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.370
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's
like, yeah, [MUMBLING].

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.450
It is very natural.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.410
But there is a lack of wonder.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.850
This is a topic that I am
sort of taking for granted.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.110
And I sort of expect that
you'll take it for granted too,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.670
so you do take it for granted.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.217
All right.

00:11:42.217 --> 00:11:44.300
I've sort of run out of
different ways to do that.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.620
So let's have you guys try.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.601
Who did not have
their script analyzed?

00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:53.100
Come on up.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.410
So take my hot seat there.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.350
And give us a read.

00:12:10.316 --> 00:12:12.440
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.450
than others?

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.510
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.490
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.310
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.550
while others can wear one
layer for a morning jog?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.940
What makes all the difference?

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.386
GEORGE ZAIDAN: One more time.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.150
Differently.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.700
Do it differently.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.671
By the way, those of you that
will do production with me

00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:38.420
and Elizabeth, that
is the phrase that you

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.990
will hear most throughout
the week is, one more time.

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:46.390
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.640
than others?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.450
Why is it that some people
are so fearful of the cold

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.960
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.970
the winter gear on, mask
and all, while others can

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.230
where one layer
for a morning jog?

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.009
What makes all the difference?

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:02.342
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Do you have
the first sentence memorized?

00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:03.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.280
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Deliver it
without looking at the script.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.405
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:08.050
than others?

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.633
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Now,
look at Elizabeth,

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:10.870
and just ask that question.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.994
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:13.670
than others?

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.580
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Now, don't
have the line in your head.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.035
Just ask her.

00:13:20.035 --> 00:13:22.160
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.960
than others?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.361
ELIZABETH CHOE: Now, ask me
as if I were Eric Lander.

00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:30.610
AUDIENCE: I've never seen him.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.320
Why do some people handle
the cold better than others?

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.970
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Elizabeth, sit closer.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.230
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.690
I'm a professor.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.130
And you're at my office hours.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.940
And I've given you
the piece at question

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.745
relating to hypothermia.

00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:52.870
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.100
than others?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.270
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Now, ask the
question in your own words.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.550
Don't use the words that
are written on the script.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.280
Ask Elizabeth.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.870
AUDIENCE: Why are some
people so immune to the cold?

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.625
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So do people
see how hard this is?

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.230
This is really not easy.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.190
Right?

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.690
Thanks.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.189
You're good.

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:21.620
Come on back.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.120
All right.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.781
Who's next?

00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:23.280
Your turn.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.350
Same paragraph.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.183
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.770
Why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.695
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:44.070
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.885
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.320
while others can wear one
layer for a morning jog?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.910
What makes all the difference?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.195
GEORGE ZAIDAN: One more time.

00:14:51.195 --> 00:14:53.320
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.084
than others?

00:14:54.084 --> 00:14:56.000
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.990
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.540
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.495
while others can wear one
layer for a morning jog?

00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:03.930
What makes all the difference?

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.305
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Now, do the
first time without reading it.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.263
AUDIENCE: I have
a horrible memory.

00:15:11.263 --> 00:15:13.096
ELIZABETH CHOE: Don't
worry about the words.

00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:14.429
You can say it however you want.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.150
AUDIENCE: I guess, it's just--

00:15:32.979 --> 00:15:34.562
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What's
the video about?

00:15:34.562 --> 00:15:36.210
What's the video about?

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.130
AUDIENCE: Dealing
with the cold weather.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.759
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Say who
is dealing with it.

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:43.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.770
I have it.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.360
Why are some people better at
dealing with cold than others?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.740
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.448
You can sit down.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.960
Anyone else want to go?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.870
Anyone else want
to give it a shot?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.820
Yeah, come on up.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.475
Same paragraph.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.590
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.690
than others?

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.500
Why is it that some people
are so fearful of the cold

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.995
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:16.490
the winter gear
on, mask and all,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.890
while others can wear one
layer in the morning jog?

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.440
What makes all the difference?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.960
GEORGE ZAIDAN: One more time.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.085
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle the cold better

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:25.600
than others?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.949
Why is it that some are
so fearful of the cold

00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:29.490
that they'd rather
die than be caught

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.890
outside without the winter
gear on, mask and all,

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.040
while others can wear one
layer in the morning jog?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.920
What makes all the difference?

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.584
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Great, thanks.

00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:41.250
What time is it?

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.564
Do we have time?

00:16:42.564 --> 00:16:44.480
ELIZABETH CHOE: You only
have like 10 minutes.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.420
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.924
What did you guys
notice about all

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.215
of those, all three deliveries?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.080
Were they different or similar?

00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:04.980
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.830
Their personalities
came through.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:07.580
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.170
But-- it sounds like
there was a but.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.420
AUDIENCE: But they
had a really hard time

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.624
doing something different than
what they did the first time.

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:22.290
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I don't
know why this is.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.700
I don't have any
cognitive theory

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:32.004
as to why it's so hard to do
something so differently-- when

00:17:32.004 --> 00:17:33.670
you have the same
words in front of you,

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.280
why it's very difficult to
read them in different ways.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.600
But this just happens
with everyone.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.180
And especially, if you've
written the script yourself,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.820
you know the words
so well, you've

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.570
looked at it a million
times, when it comes time

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.119
to actually be on camera
and perform that script

00:17:56.119 --> 00:17:58.160
and we say like, OK, well,
that was great, but do

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.080
it a different way.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.740
You're like, well, I
wrote it this one way.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.060
Why should I do it
a different way?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.768
Maybe that's what your
brain is thinking.

00:18:03.768 --> 00:18:06.460
And so you just don't know
how to do it a different way.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.890
Let's try something a
little weird and creative.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.800
Julia, right?

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.530
Do the first line,
but try and do

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.950
it as different from your first
reading as you possibly can.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.670
And I mean, if you
want to exaggerate--

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.530
don't think of this
as I'm hosting a line.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:40.510
Just think of it as I'm going
to say these words in the most

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.907
different way I can think of.

00:18:41.907 --> 00:18:43.130
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's OK if
it doesn't make any sense.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.150
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.900
AUDIENCE: Like, why do something
handle cold better than others?

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.150
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So valley girl.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.279
OK, good.

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.320
That was very different
than your first delivery.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.142
Great.

00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:53.350
Remind me of your name again.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.170
AUDIENCE: Joshua.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.690
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Joshua.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.190
Go ahead.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.770
Do the first line totally
different than the way you did

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.144
it, and not valley girl either.

00:19:00.144 --> 00:19:02.597
AUDIENCE: Why do people
some-- OK, let me try again.

00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:03.680
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.512
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:19:04.512 --> 00:19:07.410
Why do people sometimes handle
cold better than others?

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.160
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.240
That was an accent.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.217
So great, very different.

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.425
Remind me of your name again.

00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:12.700
AUDIENCE: Nathan.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.075
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Nathan, your turn.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.310
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle cold better than others?

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.847
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Julia, yell the line.

00:19:22.847 --> 00:19:24.430
AUDIENCE: [YELLING]
Why do some people

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.870
handle cold better than others?

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.950
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK,
now, close your eyes.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.620
And just say it.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.736
Ask the question.

00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:35.900
AUDIENCE: Why do some people
handle cold better than others?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.640
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, that
was your best delivery.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.440
I don't know why.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.530
Sometimes getting people to step
way outside their comfort zone

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.580
and do a line in a
totally ridiculous way

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.610
that you would
never actually use

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.360
resets something in
your mental circuitry.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.540
I have no explanation
for why this works.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.949
But you get out of your normal,
and then you just sort of do it

00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:58.490
the way that you
would normally do it

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.764
if you were talking to someone.

00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:02.180
That's a technique
that we'll also

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.070
use when we're in production.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.700
We'll be like, OK-- actually,
we might even say, do

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.870
this line as a valley girl.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.745
Do it with an accent.

00:20:09.745 --> 00:20:12.220
Yell it out loud.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.040
Do it like a robot.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.748
[TALKING LIKE A ROBOT]
Why do some people

00:20:14.748 --> 00:20:16.992
handle cold better than others?

00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:18.450
And then do it in
your normal-- why

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.240
do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.740
I mean, that was
different than how

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.224
I've done it every single time.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.430
What other hosting
tech-- I mean,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:31.210
this is just one of those
things that practice--

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.150
you need to practice.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.390
And you should do it,
like I was saying earlier,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.867
with an audio recorder.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:36.950
You have them doing vlogs.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.210
Right?

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:37.950
ELIZABETH CHOE: Mhm.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.658
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It
might be good to change

00:20:39.658 --> 00:20:42.321
one of those assignments
into an audio vlog versus a--

00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:44.820
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, actually,
for your daily reflections--

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.585
I know Siri did a video just to
make sure that you guys knew.

00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:49.720
But you don't have to
do text reflections.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.870
You can do an audio
recording if you want.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.700
You can do a video
blog if you want.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.610
And I think that's
a great opportunity

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.910
to practice some of this stuff.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.210
Your reflection last
night, it was really good.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.100
It was really authentic.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.300
You weren't trying to host.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.750
But I thought you did a
pretty good job on camera.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.512
And it was very different
from your pitch.

00:21:10.512 --> 00:21:11.900
Right?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.340
I would suggest that you
go back and watch yourself

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.450
on both your pitch and
on your blog last night.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.730
And you'll see a pretty
surprising difference.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.750
And it happens to all of us.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.550
GEORGE ZAIDAN: When
you listen to-- that's

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.008
the other part of
this is that once

00:21:25.008 --> 00:21:29.830
you do your vlog, reflection,
or audio vlog, or whatever,

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.780
listen to it, and see
what you sound like.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.980
Do one where you're just
talking off the cuff.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.770
You're like, today was great.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.900
We had this guy.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.830
He was terrible.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.914
But he had some good
points, whatever, whatever.

00:21:40.914 --> 00:21:42.330
And then do one
where you actually

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.927
read-- you can read even this
same paragraph if you want,

00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:46.510
or pick something
that you've written.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.130
And listen to the difference.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.170
I think it's only
by sort of really

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.580
listening to yourself that
you will learn to do this.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.080
Yeah?

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.186
AUDIENCE: Have you ever tried
to have people do practice

00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.900
dry-runs, and maybe tell
them that it's not running--

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.732
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yes, we
do that all the time.

00:22:04.732 --> 00:22:06.190
We'll say, oh, this
is a rehearsal.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.999
We're not rolling, but go ahead
and deliver the line anyway.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:10.790
Sometimes it works.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.456
It usually doesn't,
because you've still

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:13.580
got the camera there.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.400
It's still--

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:18.330
ELIZABETH CHOE:
And the other thing

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.980
is even though we want you to
sound as natural as possible,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.120
when it comes to
the day of shooting,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.420
the more you've
practiced your lines,

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.197
it just takes out one more
confounding variable that

00:22:29.197 --> 00:22:32.630
will stress you out
during the day of shoot.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.734
The students, you can
really tell if they've

00:22:34.734 --> 00:22:35.650
rehearsed their lines.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.160
Even if we end up changing
a lot of the wording,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.670
they're just much
more comfortable,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.950
because they're not worrying
about remembering things.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.480
They actually are thinking about
the words that they're saying.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.800
For tonight's
assignment, it will just

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:53.750
be to recreate
your episode pitch.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.920
I would suggest that
you redraft your script.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.900
We are going to do a
table read next Monday.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.180
And there's no
official assignment

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.790
for another draft of
a script until then.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.870
If you want feedback on any
material that you write,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:13.318
which I would recommend, I
am happy to give feedback.

00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:13.818
George--

00:23:13.818 --> 00:23:15.120
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yep, I'm going
to write my email right now

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.434
ELIZABETH CHOE: --is happy
to give-- his email's also

00:23:17.434 --> 00:23:18.100
on the syllabus.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.760
We're all happy
to give feedback.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.130
We will have traditional office
hours today, tomorrow, Friday.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.700
So there's lots of
opportunity for feedback

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.010
before the table read.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.850
But just so you guys
know for tonight,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:39.387
it's just a repitching of
an idea for your episode.

00:23:39.387 --> 00:23:41.470
GEORGE ZAIDAN: That's all
the material that I had.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.951
Does anyone have any questions
in the two minutes remaining?

00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:46.200
And I'm going to stick around.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.241
So if you guys want to
chat with me individually,

00:23:48.241 --> 00:23:49.286
that's fine too.

00:23:49.286 --> 00:23:52.990
AUDIENCE: So basically,
to host, just be yourself.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.800
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.932
To the most extent that
you can, be yourself.

00:23:58.932 --> 00:24:00.890
ELIZABETH CHOE: And I
mean there are exceptions

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.960
to every single rule.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.365
I know that when I host,
I'm very different than I

00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:07.130
am in real life.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.685
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Not really.

00:24:07.685 --> 00:24:08.080
ELIZABETH CHOE: Really?

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.571
GEORGE ZAIDAN: No,
you're pretty similar.

00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:11.062
ELIZABETH CHOE: You said
that my hosting persona

00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:12.560
was a lot different
than you were expecting.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.351
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I was
just messing with you.

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.180
ELIZABETH CHOE: But for
the most part, be yourself.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.680
And we mean that very literally.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.350
Right?

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.840
I don't know if
you guys noticed,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.980
but that time you asked that
question at the very end,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.905
it was how you would say it,
and it was the best delivery.

00:24:30.905 --> 00:24:33.230
It really was.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.770
AUDIENCE: So less of like a
pitch to get people excited,

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.200
but just kind of explain
what you're doing?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.905
Because a pitch, just
[INAUDIBLE] kind of

00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:42.680
like excited.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.610
ELIZABETH CHOE: Well,
when you think of pitch,

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.670
you think of Shark Tank.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.620
And you think of, I have 30
seconds to buy into my idea.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.080
So I'm just going to be as loud
and exaggerated as possible.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.860
So please don't
mistake pitch for that.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.270
Keep it under a
minute and a half.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.390
A lot of your videos were
five and a half minutes.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.760
That's longer than your
entire episode is going to be.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.700
Keep it under a
minute and a half.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.700
Not just as a challenge,
but that'll really help

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:14.190
structure the way you deliver.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.190
And that should be the
point of the video.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.446
So maybe don't think about it
as a pitch as it is a point,

00:25:21.446 --> 00:25:22.320
like a thesis almost.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.600
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Think of it
as explaining your video

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.818
to someone else.

00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:31.780
AUDIENCE: So it's not the
actual stuff that you wrote?

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.580
ELIZABETH CHOE:
It's like a trailer.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Remember-- Paul, right?

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.910
Remember when Paul was
doing his shoebox thing.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.560
It's that.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.779
AUDIENCE: I don't think
I have a shoebox, but--

00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:47.320
GEORGE ZAIDAN: You
can just mime one.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.900
ELIZABETH CHOE: We've got a
budget for a cardboard box.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.160
Let me tell you.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.100
GEORGE ZAIDAN: We've
got about $1.50.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.310
OK, thanks, guys.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.393
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

00:25:57.393 --> 00:26:00.170
We'll stick around for a while
if you guys have questions.
