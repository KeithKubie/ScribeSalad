00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.550
So there's no right answer for this quiz. But I find

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.983
that a lot of developers and designers usually think too detailed.

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:07.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I find myself as a developer,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.370
and along with many other developers, I think

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.400
following the trap where we try to reuse

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.980
existing code and also I think too detailed.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.361
&gt;&gt; Yep.
