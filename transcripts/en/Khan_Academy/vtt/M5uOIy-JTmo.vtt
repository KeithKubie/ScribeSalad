00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.820
In the last video, we
saw that a system

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.970
could do work by expanding.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.710
And in the situation we drew,
we had a situation where the

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.880
ceiling was movable.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.790
We had this piston and we, like
in our process video, we

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.660
had a bunch of pebbles.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.370
We removed a pebble, so the
pressure in our system, if we

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.480
assume that it was just so small
that the pressure was

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.600
constant, it pushed up on the
piston with some force.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.280
We figured out that that force,
since pressure is force

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.865
per area, we just multiplied
pressure times the area of our

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.300
piston, and we got the amount
of force we're applying.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.530
We apply that, and then we
multiply that times the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.730
distance that we push the piston
up, and then we get the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.950
amount of work that it
did by expansion, or

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.310
the expansion work.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.780
We said, well, you know we could
have rewritten that.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
If you said pressure times our
area, times our distance, we

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.440
could instead write that as
pressure, times the area,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.210
times the distance.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.780
And the area times
the distance is

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.380
the change in volume.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.780
And so we came up with a neat
little formulation, that the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.260
work done by a system could be
written as the pressure times

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.590
the change in volume.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.620
So in this case, I wrote the
internal energy formula, where

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.400
it's the work done
by the system.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.120
So I did a minus, right?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.210
Because when you do work, you
are giving energy away to

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.720
someone else.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.500
So in that situation,
we did a minus.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.940
And so instead of writing work,
we could say, minus the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.370
pressure, times the
change in volume.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.265
And remember this is a
quasi-static process.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:30.590
And we're doing it at very
small increments.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.190
We're assuming that this change
in volume is very

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.010
small, and that the pressure
is roughly constant while

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.840
we're doing this.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.230
And of course that's not
the case, right?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.780
If we did this, if this was a
large change in volume, or if

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.910
this happened all of a sudden,
if these were really big

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.090
pebbles, then our pressure
will change as we expand.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.540
So it's hard to say what
the pressure times the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.050
change in volume is.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.890
But if we assume things are
really, really being done in

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.300
very, very small increments,
we could say, OK, let's say

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.140
the pressure was constant over
that small increment, and then

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.760
we can multiply it by the
change in volume.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.460
Now let's see how this can
relate to some of what we've

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.980
done before with
the PV-diagram.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.900
And so far, all we've seen the
PV-diagram, or what I used it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.110
for, is to kind of help explain
the difference between

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.060
quasi-static processes,
or to say when

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.080
macrostates are defined.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.910
But let me now do something
more useful with it.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.120
And this will give you an idea,
or start giving you an

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.870
idea of why people who
study thermodynamics

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.480
love these so much.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.555
So before I did anything, when
my canister was just here, I

00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:34.510
had all the pebbles on it.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.290
And we were in a state
of equilibrium.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.520
I could describe all of its
macrostates, its pressure, its

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.000
volume, its temperature.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.802
I could describe its internal
energy as well.

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:46.170
So let me draw it here.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.040
So let's say I was
at this state.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.030
This was state number 1.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.180
State number 1 was
right there.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150
And then, let's say I just
start removing pebbles.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.370
Remember, if I just remove all
the pebbles at once, the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.290
system's going to
go into flux.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.025
We wouldn't be doing a
quasi-static process, or a

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:08.140
reversible process, which isn't
always the same thing.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.810
But for our purposes, we
wouldn't be in equilibrium the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.170
whole time.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.475
And we would have to wait
to get to equilibrium.

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:15.560
And at some point we'd have
some pressure and volume

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.810
that's down here.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.180
This is if we weren't doing it
as a quasi-static process.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.140
Now we are, what I showed in the
last video, we are doing

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.640
it as a, or we're trying to get
close to a quasi-static

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.410
process, because we're doing it
in small increments, with

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.180
these little pebbles.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.760
And if these aren't small enough
for you, you could do

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.320
it in smaller pebbles.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.650
So we're moving incrementally.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.170
So, for example, in that
last video, we

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.380
maybe moved from there.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.950
We removed one pebble and
we got right there.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.920
You remove another pebble
and you go right there.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.880
You remove another pebble
and you go right there.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.630
And the benefit of doing these
quasi-static processes is you

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.820
really get a path going from
one state to the next.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.340
Let's say when you remove all
but one of the pebbles, just,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.870
you know, this describes
our path.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.020
So let's say we are in state 2
and we've removed all but one.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.870
Let me draw that.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.705
So state 2 will look something
like this.

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:06.850
I'll draw it really quick.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.900
So that's our container.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.070
That's our piston.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.730
We only have one pebble
left on top.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.430
And then of course we
have the gas now.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.410
Let me write this down.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.070
This is state 2.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.860
And let me write state 1 was
something like this.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.600
State 1, the ceiling
was lower.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.570
We had a bunch of pebbles
on top of it.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.400
And we had a smaller volume,
and so the gas was bumping

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.750
into the ceiling and the walls
and the floor a lot more.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.640
I'll just draw the
same number.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.310
So we had a higher pressure.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.140
So pressure was high
and volume low.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.590
Now in state 2-- so this
is pressure high.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.610
This pressure is this axis.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.290
This is volume.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.760
So we had high pressure,
low volume.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.310
And we got to a situation after

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.145
removing all but one pebble.

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:01.940
And we're doing it slowly, so
we're always in equilibrium.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.910
So we have a path.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.660
This is after removing each of
the pebbles, so that our

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.450
pressure and volume
macro states

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.360
are always well defined.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.270
But in state 2, we now
have a pressure low

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.150
and volume is high.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.810
The volume is high, you can just
see that, because we kept

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.760
pushing the piston up slowly,
slowly, trying to maintain

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.170
ourselves in equilibrium so our

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.180
macrostates are always defined.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.740
And our pressure is lower just
because we could have the same

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.260
number of particles, but they're
just going to bump

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.640
into the walls a little bit
less, because they have a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.550
little bit more room
to move around.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.770
And that's all fair and dandy.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.440
So this describes the path of
our system as it transitioned

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.260
or as it experienced this
process, which was a

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.910
quasi-static process.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.560
Everything was defined
at every point.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.910
Now we said that the work done
at any given point by the

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.760
system is the pressure times
the change in volume.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.210
Now, how does that
relate to here?

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.810
Change in volume is
just a certain

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.350
distance along this x-axis.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.220
Along, more like I should
call it the volume-axis.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.660
This is a change in volume.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.690
We started off at this volume,
and let's say when we removed

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.260
one pebble we got
to this volume.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.390
Now, we want to multiply that
times our pressure.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.370
Since we did it over such a
small increment, and we're so

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.840
close to equilibrium, we could
assume that our pressure's is

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.150
roughly constant over
that period of time.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.820
So we could say that this
is the pressure over

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.950
that period of time.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.370
And so how much work we did,
it's this pressure over here,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.820
times this volume, which is
the area of this rectangle

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.030
right there.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.830
And for any of you all who've
seen my calculus videos, this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.490
should start looking a
little bit familiar.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.880
And then what about when we
could take our next pebble?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.950
Well now our pressure is
a little bit lower.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.050
This is our new pressure.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.560
Our pressure is a little
bit lower.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.440
And we multiply that times our
new change in volume-- times

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.390
this change in volume-- and we
have that increment of work.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.040
Once again, this is the area
of this rectangle.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.440
And if you keep doing that, the
amount of work we do is

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.700
essentially the area of all of
these rectangles as we remove

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.670
each pebble.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.640
And now you might say,
especially those of you who

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.500
haven't watched my calculus
videos, gee, you know, this

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.140
might be getting close, but the
area of these rectangles

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.120
isn't exactly the area
of this curve.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.010
It's a little inexact.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.970
There's a little error here.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.880
And what I would say is, well if
you're worried about that,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.630
what you should do is use
smaller increments of volume.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.730
And if you want to have smaller
changes in volume

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.260
along each step, what
you do is you remove

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.520
even smaller pebbles.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.790
And this goes back to trying
to get to that ideal

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.900
quasi-static process.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.630
So if you did that of,
eventually the delta V's would

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.430
get smaller and smaller and
smaller, and the rectangles

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.350
would get thinner and
thinner and thinner.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.710
You'd have to do it over
more and more steps.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.730
But eventually you'll get to a
point, if you assume really

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.150
small changes in our delta V.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.370
In calculus world, that
infinitely small changes, you

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.040
write it as dV.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.940
So if you take a sum of all the
pressures, times the dV's

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.780
you get the area under
this curve.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.880
So the way to think about it
when you're looking at this

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.480
PV-diagram, if someone says,
you're going from this point

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.130
to this pressure and this
volume, to this pressure and

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.010
this volume.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.380
And they say, how much
work did you do?

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.690
You say, oh, well I just had to
figure out the area under

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.770
this curve.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.540
If you want to know the real
math behind it, if you could

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.120
get your pressure as a function
of volume-- and if

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.820
you haven't watched the calculus
videos you can ignore

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.010
this little aside I'm
going to do here.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.169
This is this curve right here.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.450
If you could write it this way,
let's say you could write

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.370
pressure as a function
of volume.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.290
When you're in algebra, you
learn a curve is, you know, y

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.150
is a function of x.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.000
But here, y is the pressure
and x is volume, so its

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.920
pressure is a function
of volume.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.780
So the area under this curve
is the integral of the

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.580
pressure as a function of
volume, that's the height at

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:10.850
any point, times our very
small change in volume.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.480
So times our very small
change in volume.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.910
And you take the sum from our
starting volume, so volume

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.280
initial to volume final.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.130
And we'll do this in the future,
especially when we

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.230
start touching on entropy.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.650
But this is a neat result.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.575
Even if you don't know the
calculus, or if this confuses

00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:30.870
you, if you've never seen
an integral before, you

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.850
could ignore it.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.020
But you could look at this
intuitively and see the work I

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.500
did is the area under
this curve.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.860
Now, let me ask you
one more thing.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.700
Let's say some work is being
done to the system.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.690
So we start adding some
marbles back.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.300
So let's say-- actually,
let's say we're

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.350
going from this direction.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.880
Let's say we start at state 2
and we go in that direction.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.680
So direction matters.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.010
So let's say we go in that
direction right there.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.370
So I should put some arrows.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.410
And I'm overloading this
picture so much.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.140
Actually let me just do a new
picture, that's probably the

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.490
best thing to do.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.966
So it's pressure, volume-- I'm
actually going to do two.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:16.000
Let me just do pressure,
volume.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.320
I'm going to do two
graphs here.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.170
All right.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.070
So in the first one
it's pressure,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.510
volume, pressure, volume.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:31.220
We started here at 1, and
we went here to 2.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.950
So our system was essentially
pushed up on the piston.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.160
And it could be a curve or a
line, I'm not going to get too

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.450
particular right now, but it was
going in this direction.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.960
And so we can say that the work
done was the pressure

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.980
times the increase in volume
at any moment.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.610
So the work done was the
area under this curve.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:02.300
Now, if we started at position
2 and we go to position 1.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.430
2 to 1.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.260
Now what's happening?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.250
Now we're compressing.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.885
So if we're going in that
direction, you might say, oh

00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:11.220
OK, maybe the work done by
the system is still the

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.490
area under the curve.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.480
Well you'd be close.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.280
Because what's happening now?

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.780
We're now compressing
the system or

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.440
adding the marbles back.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.680
We're putting energy
into the system.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.310
So if we do that, remember, your
work done by the system

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.880
was pressure times an
increase in volume.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.710
Now it's going to be
your pressure times

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.360
a decrease in volume.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.870
So when you go back in this
direction, the area is not the

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.225
work done by the system, it's
the work done to the system.

00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:43.630
And maybe I'll do that in a
different color, so green for

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.090
work done to the system.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.840
Now let me throw you another
little interesting idea.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.330
And this is actually
a key idea.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.850
It's good to get the
intuition here.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.470
So let me just draw a very
simple PV-diagram again.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.450
So let's say we start
at some state here.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.540
State 1.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.640
And I do something, you know,
I'm in a quasi-static process

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.450
and it, you know, it's doing
something weird, and I get to

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.230
state 2 here.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.370
And it's going in
this direction.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.470
So my volume is increasing.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.720
So in this situation, what is
the work done by the system?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.890
Easy enough, it's the area
under this curve.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:38.770
Now let's say that I keep
doing some type of

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.340
quasi-static process, but it
takes a different path.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.370
I'm doing something else, other
than adding the marbles

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.670
directly back.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:51.110
So my new path looks something
like this to get

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.360
back to state 1.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.150
So these arrows are
going back.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.440
So now what is the work
done to the system?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.230
well my volume is decreasing,
so it's the area under the

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.090
second curve.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.700
The area under the second
curve is the

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.650
work done to the system.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.420
So if I want to know what the
net work the system did, going

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.110
from state 1 to state 2, and
then going back to state 1--

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.640
remember, this is a pressure
and volume

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.550
diagram-- what is it?

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.380
Well the work that the system
did was this whole area under

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.630
this brown curve.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.790
And then it had some work done
to it, which is the area under

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.010
this magenta curve.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.150
So the net work it did is
essentially the white, the

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.730
whole area, minus
this red area.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.620
So the net work it did would be
essentially just the area

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.960
inside this loop.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.660
And hopefully you don't have to
know calculus to do this,

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.120
although calculus you would
actually use to

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.140
compute these areas.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.530
But I just want to give you that
intuition, that the area

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.720
inside this closed loop is
actually the amount of work

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.740
that our system has done.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.560
And what's important is the
direction that it's going.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.705
So it increased volume, then
decreased volume, so it's kind

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:07.770
of this clockwise motion.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.690
This is the work that our system
has done, which, I

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.430
don't know, to me is a pretty
interesting thing.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.900
And later we can use this notion
to come up with some

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.230
other ideas behind our
state variables

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.060
I'll make one little
aside here.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.880
Remember, our state variable
pressure volume, we did stuff

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.230
to it then we went back
to that state.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.330
That stayed the same.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.550
And I want to say
another thing.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.280
For our purposes, when we're
dealing with ideal gases,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.080
where the internal energy is
essentially the kinetic energy

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.440
of the system, if we go and do
all sorts of crazy stuff and

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.230
come back, our internal
energy hasn't changed.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.580
So the internal energy is always
going to be the same at

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.190
this point.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.840
So if I said, I did all of this
stuff and came back here,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.660
what is my change in
internal energy?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.245
It's 0.

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:52.780
The change is 0.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.040
Now if I said I went from here
to here, I would have a

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.570
different internal energy
and my change would

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.900
be something real.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.670
But since this is a state
function, it doesn't care how

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.330
I got there.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.450
If I took all these loops and
got back there, it just says,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.220
look, if I'm at this point in
the PV-diagram, my internal

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.200
energy is the same thing.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.890
So if I start at this point,
and I finish again at this

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.890
point, I have had no change
in internal energy.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.120
And we'll talk more about
that in the next video.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.910
But I just wanted to leave you
there and get you this

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.620
intuition behind the areas
under the curves in the

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.870
PV-diagram.
