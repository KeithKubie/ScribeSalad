00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.336
For the diffuse component, the angle of the viewer to the surface or light

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.817
doesn't matter. The amount of illumination depends on just the angle of the

00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:11.095
light to the surface. So the correct answer is to not check any of the boxes.

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:15.900
With specular surfaces, the shininess is brightest in the reflection direction.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.105
This can actually vary a bit in real life materials. For example, some

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.228
roughened metals can have what are called off specular peaks. Even then, the

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:27.610
eye at location c would still see the brightest reflection off a surface.
