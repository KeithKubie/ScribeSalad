00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.510
How many times do you complete something just
right in just one try?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.120
Very frequently, the first draft is not the
final draft, and some revisions are made to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.140
better the product.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.300
Those behind some of the biggest Hollywood
productions know this all too well, as reshoots

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.520
have became a main staple of the industry.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.010
After completing principal photography and
reviewing the footage, directors will reassemble

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.839
their team to work on new material.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.839
Whenever word of pickups becomes public, fans
start to fear for the worse and think something

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.529
could be wrong with the movie.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.560
But that isn’t always the case.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.690
Here are 10 movie reshoots that saved popular
movies.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.950
The Avengers

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.590
Joss Whedon’s first Avengers movie is full
of memorable moments that made it a standout

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
in the superhero genre, but one of the funniest
was a very late addition in the process.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.750
The now-famous second post-credits scene features
Earth’s Mightiest dining on shawarma in

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.760
New York following their big battle.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.420
Whedon thought it would be a fun bit to add
towards the end of editing, and with the cast

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.739
back together for the movie’s premiere,
the actors quickly shot it so it could be

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.369
included in the theatrical release.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.170
The button scene was only a minor part of
The Avengers, but it’s hard to picture the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.899
movie without this little cherry on top.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:13.899
E.T.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.899
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.210
Steven Spielberg’s beloved sci-fi classic
is noteworthy for its emotional conclusion

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.850
that tugs at the heartstrings to this day,
but originally the ending was far, far more

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.850
tragic.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.960
An early test screening of the Best Picture
nominee had E.T. die while in the government

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.060
facility, and he never came back to life.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.600
Audiences were very upset by this turn of
events and hated the film, which pushed Spielberg

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.490
to revise the third act so E.T. was resurrected
and went back home in the final scene.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.780
Reshoots were arranged, and the film was all
the better for it – it’s now a timeless

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.520
family classic.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520
Rocky

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.549
The original Rocky film was shot on a minimal
budget, which means it couldn’t sport the

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.799
production values of its many sequels.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.330
This was readily apparent to Sylvester Stallone
when he viewed the original ending, which

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.289
saw Rocky crowdsurf triumphantly after his
fight against Apollo Creed.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.890
The scene wasn’t convincing since there
weren’t enough extras on-set to support

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
Stallone.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.999
He went back to reshoot it, using whatever
friends and family Stallone could find to

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.229
populate the boxing ring.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.670
The result was a touching moment between Rocky
and Adrian, one that ended the film on a powerful

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.860
and resonate note.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.860
World War Z

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.409
The adaptation of Max Brooks’ novel was
plagued by various production woes, with producer

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.030
and star Brad Pitt calling the first wave
of shooting “atrocious.”

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.860
The third act in particular was difficult
to figure out, since the filmmakers were torn

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.650
between setting up future sequels and designing
a more self-contained conclusion.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.769
World War Z’s finale was the product of
reshoots, featuring a number of tense sequences

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.000
in a W.H.O. building as Pitt and others search
for a cure.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.829
In the end, the film proved to be a commercial
success and grossed enough to warrant a followup

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.549
that will explore the zombie war further.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.140
It’ll be interesting to see if the sequel
goes smoother than the original.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.980
Thor: The Dark World

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.459
The second solo Thor movie is considered one
of the weaker entries in the MCU, but it still

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.660
has its fair share of entertaining moments.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.590
Many of these come courtesy of Loki, so fans
will be happy to know that the Thor 2 team

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.950
made sure to include him as much as possible.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.140
During reshoots, several key Loki scenes were
added, including the villain being sentenced

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.409
to prison by Odin and the God of Mischief’s
fun shapeshifting where he impersonates Captain

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.030
America in front of Thor.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.090
Loki is without question the best antagonist
in the entire franchise, so it’d be hard

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.290
to go wrong with more of him.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.730
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.140
When Edgar Wright was filming this cult classic,
the comic book on which it was based wasn’t

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.780
completed yet, which meant he had to toy around
with his own ideas at points.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.260
It was up to Wright to give the story an ending,
and he originally felt it would be for the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.469
best if Scott decided to stay with Knives
instead of pursuing Ramona.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.220
The conclusion was shot and screened for test
audiences, who didn’t like the fact that

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.319
the protagonist spent the entire film fighting
for Ramona’s affection only to turn her

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.319
away.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.980
Wright went back and reshot an ending where
Scott and Ramona became a couple, which was

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.760
used in the final cut.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
Jaws

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.180
The original summer blockbuster had a troubled
journey to the big screen, since filming on

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.230
water presented numerous challenges for Steven
Spielberg.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.959
The mechanical shark was a nightmare to work
with, as it frequently sank and malfunctioned.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.749
The original script for Jaws called for the
shark to be featured frequently on-camera,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.129
but Spielberg couldn’t get the necessary
shots.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.879
After viewing his initial footage, Spielberg
altered the plan so that the shark would barely

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.269
be on-screen, which gave Jaws a Hitchcockian
vibe that thrilled audiences.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.250
He added more to the moments that worked well
in reshoots, and the rest is history.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.250
Back to the Future

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.610
Michael J. Fox was always the top choice for
Marty McFly, but scheduling conflicts due

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.680
to his commitments to Family Ties prevented
him from signing on.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.300
Eric Stoltz was cast instead, but early on
in production director Robert Zemeckis knew

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.319
the actor wasn’t the right fit.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.741
Stoltz was giving an intense performance that
clashed with the light heartedness of the

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.741
tone.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:47.150
Fox was approached again, and the actor planned
out a schedule that allowed him to make the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.450
movie and still star in the TV show.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.130
Production had to start from scratch, but
it was worth it in the end when Fox completely

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.270
embodied Marty.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.669
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.880
Michael Bay has an interesting relationship
with moviegoers, since not all are a fan of

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.020
his approach to beloved properties like Transformers
and TMNT.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.000
When the Bay-produced reboot of the heroes
in a half shell was in production, the project

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.310
made waves due to the casting of Caucasian
actor William Fichtner as the turtles’ arch

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.690
nemesis Shredder.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.880
That would have been a substantial departure
from the source material, and viewers wanted

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.080
to see a Japanese thespian in the role.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.870
In reshoots, the movie was changed so that
Shredder was played by Tohoru Masamune, while

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630
Fichtner became a mere underling.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.460
TMNT was still panned by most critics, but
things weren’t as bad as they could have

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.830
been.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.250
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.150
One of Episode 7’s standout moments is the
lightsaber duel between Rey and Kylo Ren,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.790
and some of its most memorable bits were reshoots.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.760
In his audio commentary on the Blu-ray, J.J.
Abrams revealed that Rey’s self-reflection

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.520
before she lashes out at Kylo was added in
pickups to give the scene something more emotionally

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520
powerful.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.930
Also, a quick shot of Rey looking fierce right
before stabbing her opponent was added in

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.340
reshoots at the suggestion of Selma director
Ava DuVernay.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.710
The Force Awakens was probably great before
these additions, but they give the final product

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.520
another element and it’s impossible to envision
the duel without them.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.150
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.290
This past summer, many became concerned about
the potential quality of Lucasfilm’s first

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.289
Star Wars anthology film when it was revealed
the project underwent extensive reshoots.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.300
Bourne screenwriter Tony Gilroy was brought
on board to rewrite the script and oversee

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.320
the post-production alongside director Gareth
Edwards and became an integral part of the

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320
team.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.810
Fans were nervous about what to expect, but
all the pickups seemed to have paid off.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.160
During the Rogue One press junket, members
of the media saw 28 minutes of footage and

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720
the response was very positive.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.060
It may not be the full movie, but that’s
highly encouraging to hear.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.500
Those are just some of the instances where
reshoots improved the film.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.530
Are there any we missed?

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.590
Which ones are your favorites?
