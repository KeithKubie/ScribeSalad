00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.703
I used to go on stage.
I have a bad knee,

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:04.805
and I would go on stage
with a cane sometimes,

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.039
and I was like,

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.308
"I wonder if this
will get me that pity laugh?"

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.877
And it was like,
"Hey, look at that guy,

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.078
he had to hobble up there,"

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.579
but then the next day
the weather would change

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.814
and my knee would feel okay,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.349
so I couldn't do it
all the time.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.950
I'd feel really bad
if I was like,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.952
"Yeah, no, sometimes
I need the cane."

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.455
But maybe something like that.
Maybe a neck brace.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.263
Holidays are a lot of work.
Let's not dance around it.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.530
I mean,
it really is a lot of work.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.765
It is.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.201
That's why these ecards
are the way to go.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.338
Do you know what that is?
We just email someone.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.073
You could just have said,
"Happy holidays," but, no,

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.709
it has to be some elaborate code
that you have to enter

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.779
and you have to answer
two identity questions,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.016
and then you get to see a Santa,
Santa and a reindeer.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.984
It's a lot of work
for nothing, but ...

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.753
Oh, I used to love those ecards

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.988
when they first
came on the scene in 1998.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.256
Blue Mountain.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.758
I assume you could make it
your own,

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.226
more of an erotic thing
than usual.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.594
Yeah?

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.730
I don't know. I'm not really big
on the web, but let's see.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.432
Let's go around the room here.
Who's local?

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:10.070
Who's New York? Anybody?
Gridlock in effect coming up.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.338
Jenn's local.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:12.706
Yes.
Jenn?

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.941
I'm in New Jersey.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.309
There you go.
I consider that local.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.543
Yeah.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.045
So I assume you'll go
to Asbury Park?

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.313
Yeah, I do.

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.914
What would your Christmas be?

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.817
No, I stay in Somerset
by New Brunswick, so ...

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.052
Not bad.

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:26.253
Just hang out there.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.487
You can treat yourself
to a night

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.755
at the Stress Factory
if you'd like.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.057
Yes, yes.
Yes.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.659
Come early because the buffet,
they start it at six.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.196
Dave, what's your holiday plan?

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.198
Well it already passed.
Thanks, Nikki. It's Hanukkah.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.933
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's right. Is it done?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.735
So now, this is really just
a dead space for me.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:45.072
I hang low.
I noticed in the lobby

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.107
there's an elaborate
Christmas tree,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:51.311
a very tasteful yet practical
menorah off to the right.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.681
Is Hanukkah over?

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.949
It definitely is over.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.184
Oh, damn. Okay.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:02:01.154
It was over 4000 years ago,
I think.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.159
It definitely never really got
the same power it used to.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.595
I don't really
celebrate the holidays.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.197
Of course New Year's,
I work on New Year's.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.465
Do you work on New Year's?

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going to be in Providence.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.036
I'm at Cincinnati Go Bananas.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.139
Nice.
Sarah, you working New Year's?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.340
No.
What are your plans?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.775
I'm going to go see
Margot Price.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.010
Who's that?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.244
She's a country singer.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.545
-Oh, nice.
-Where?

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.748
Somewhere in Brooklyn. I forgot.
Joe got the tickets.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:28.949
Oh, that's cool.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.251
Yeah. I wish I could just ...

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.387
I don't know.
I always get scared that ...

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:36.390
I work all the time, because
I'm scared I have no fun plans.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.226
So that's the thing.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:40.527
Do you get that moment
of loneliness

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.430
where you just did the show,
and then it's the countdown,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.998
and then everyone's
kissing and hugging,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.167
and you're just
standing there talking

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.638
to the owner of the club?
It's a sad time.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.040
About your numbers.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.274
Yeah.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.509
Not good.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.611
Well, the worst is
when you do a whole show,

00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.348
and then your show
ends at 11:48,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.716
and then the MC
has to go back out.

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:03.917
I've done this a lot.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.752
Have you never had
to do the countdown?

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:06.953
Yes.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.622
Well, I come back out on stage.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.491
The MC comes back up,
does some buffer time.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.027
I don't ever know
why I can't just end it

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.996
and do the countdown
and then say goodnight.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.597
Yeah. I never had the buffer.
I've had to just do it.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.832
I'm always brought back up.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.367
Yeah. I just had to do it, yeah.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.601
It's so awkward.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.670
And then, like you said,
everyone's kissing,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.139
everyone's celebrating,
and I'm hugging the MC

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.542
and trying to give good
friend vibes to him.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.776
Right. I understand.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.145
That is the portrait
of a comedian right there.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.915
That's the best, what do you
call it, allegory or whatever?

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.149
I don't know.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.119
I don't think I've ever kissed
someone on New Year's Eve.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.255
How about this? They pay you
extra to do the countdown?

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.191
That's a negotiation thing.

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.692
Like I won't do
the entire countdown.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:50.630
I'll come in on a hard five,
four, three, two, one.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.467
You can let the opener
kind of get it going.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.069
I would love to do that.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.338
I also do it in ...

00:03:58.338 --> 00:03:59.706
I do countdowns
around the world.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.675
I like to watch as it's
New Year's Eve around there

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.009
and do it
in their language.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.845
Mm-hmm
Yeah.

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.646
Where does it start?
In New Zealand.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.348
I like a nice woke New Year's.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.119
You are busy that whole day
just counting down.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.021
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
You can't get me away.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.758
But yeah,
that's a tough night.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.393
I'd say that's the worst night
to be a comic

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.761
is New Year's Eve.
That's the worst one.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.063
Halloween?

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.265
The second one
would be Thanksgiving.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.466
Oh, yeah.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.935
Halloween, yeah, but that's like
some places it's a party,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.437
some places
it's a train wreck,

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.406
but it's usually like no one
expects that much on Halloween,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.674
but New Year's Eve,
they do.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.976
What about Thanksgiving?
Why Thanksgiving?

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.177
Yeah, why ... Yeah.

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:40.714
Because it's all families there,
and it's always that weird ...

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.916
They'll always tell you there's
a lot of kids home from college

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.151
so it's going to be
a wild show,

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.453
but it really just turns out
to be people

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.787
bringing
their old relatives out,

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.022
because they have nothing
to do with them.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.223
Yes, yes.
Yeah.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.491
We all agree on that one, or no?

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.726
Yeah, no, that's a good point.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.562
I guess I don't really work
that often on Thanksgiving,

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:56.897
but even just
the days around it-

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.165
That's true.

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:01.234
It's that similar vibe
of it's all kids from back home.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.970
They're all drunk and it's
usually families begrudgingly.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.172
It's tough. It really is.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.840
Yeah. What do you do? I have-

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.041
Wait, I have more dates.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.276
Okay.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.312
Pearl Harbor, December 7th
is not that good for me.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.613
Arbor Day, brutal.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.683
Arbor Day, it's a touch
and go kind of way.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.352
I would also say ...

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:25.125
Just Wednesday is never
any fun, any Wednesday.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.528
Any Wednesday is
really bad for comedy.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.065
Valentine's Day, uch.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.934
Yeah, that's a tough one.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.403
That's another one
where you just feel lonely

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.771
and what am I doing?

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.005
And they don't
really want to be ...

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.575
It's not necessarily a good ...

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.978
There's not first dates there,
but there are. I don't know.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:47.113
And is that a really
romantic night out?

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.982
I mean, I never really
understood that.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:52.619
It's like we love each other,
now let's go watch a comic.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:54.554
I could see if it was a musician
or something like that.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.755
Sure.
Yes.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:58.058
It's a little different.
But, yeah, it is weird.

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.459
Comedy, I'm always perplexed

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.128
why people bring first dates
to comedy shows,

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.598
because, although it's what
I do for a living

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.466
and I think it's a great
form of entertainment,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.001
it can be awkward
for a first date.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.236
For sure.
I think so.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:12.772
It brings up subjects that you
just don't want to get into yet.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.174
You don't feel comfortable.

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:16.710
Even me, I would feel
uncomfortable laughing

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.044
at certain things
next to a boy

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.613
I might be trying
to impress or like.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:20.814
Really?

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.549
If it's something gross,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.484
or a girl says
something on stage

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.319
that's really disgusting
about shitting her pants,

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.654
and I relate to it
and I laugh,

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:29.623
then this guy is thinking
about me shitting my pants,

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.958
and that's just not something
I want to have on a first date.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.994
Yeah, but he probably is also
on his best behavior,

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.597
so he's probably waiting to see
if you laugh at it,

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.666
and then he'll laugh at it.
So you won't think he's a creep.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.101
And then it's like why bring
that energy

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:42.302
into a first date
of having to even-

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:43.536
Sure.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.038
So what's the alternative?
What are you thinking?

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:49.142
Trap room, or, I mean,
pick your own adventure?

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.213
Those escape rooms, I can't
think of anything worse.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:56.783
Well, Nikki, I really love that
you came on the Bumping Mics,

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.218
and it was so cool
to see her in LA.

00:06:58.218 --> 00:06:59.552
And I grilled her
about living in LA,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:00.787
because you lived there
for a while.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.022
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:05.225
And I thought it would be a
wild party, but it's stressful.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.459
It was.
It's a lot.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.095
Did you guys ever live in LA
or anything? No?

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.964
No. Did you Sarah? No, you-

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.299
I did for a year.

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.067
Okay. And how was
your experience?

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.536
I was an alcoholic
that whole year.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.104
I told Dave the same thing.
Oh, that's good.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.306
That's what I did.
That's cool.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.540
drink, yeah.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.142
Yeah.
Do you think it's ...

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:23.843
Have you ever ...

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.315
It's one thing moving to LA
with all the hope and promise,

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.582
and then moving away from LA.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.884
I think people
should make more of that.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.085
Yes.

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.386
It's like, "I'm done
with this town."

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.654
Yes.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.057
They should be able to do a rant
at the airport.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:42.662
You should be able to tape
an exit video.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.632
You're leaving Big Brother,
something like, "This is great."

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.034
You should have a final.
That's a good idea.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.636
Were you excited to get out,
or were you-

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.304
Well, I've been back twice now.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.539
Yeah, you seem like-

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:55.975
I moved there right out
of college, no money,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.044
and I was babysitting
and temping,

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.346
and then I got
on The Tonight Show,

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.448
and after three years of being
there I was on The Tonight Show,

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.016
and I thought everything
would change,

00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:04.751
and I was still broke,
nothing changed,

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.486
and then two months later
I had to move back home

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.687
to St. Louis
to live with my parents.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.955
Oh.

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.623
And then I moved back there
when I had a TV show,

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:13.226
so it was a different
experience, and I was sober.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.761
But when I was living
there initially,

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.330
I mean, I was drinking
so much every night,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.834
and I was driving home from ...
I was flirting with a DUI.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.702
That's why I really had
to get out of that town.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.338
I did not have $10,000
to get a DUI.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:29.342
I was driving buzzed one block
home from Residuals, the bar in-

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.710
Yeah. I know that bar.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.379
... The Valley, where you can go

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.813
and bring a residual check
under a dollar.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.048
Oh, you lived in The Valley.

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:36.649
Yeah. I lived in The Valley.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:40.086
But I am so lucky I got out
of that town without a DUI,

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.956
because that was in
the works for me.

00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:44.324
Hey, you know what?

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.659
I think that's good
that you got out of there.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.361
New York is a more
drinking friendly town.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.596
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.898
Oh, my God, it was amazing
to come here, and ...

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.666
You haven't drank for a while,
though, right?

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.468
No. Decades now, but-
Decades now?

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.270
I was wondering why you picked
to come back

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.305
East instead of going,
"You know what?

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.808
I'm in LA already,
let's give Hawaii a shot."

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:05.211
I'd think about it.
Well, because there's-

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.446
Good Morning, Maui.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.515
You could have been the host
of that show for a while,

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.184
and then worked your way
onto the new Magnum P.I.

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.019
There's a lot of new shows
out there.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.422
NCIS Pearl Harbor,
whatever it is.

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:20.693
Could you imagine the people who
were on these TV shows there,

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:23.363
and they're just hanging out
waiting for the next one?

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:24.898
What do you mean?
The shows that shoot there?

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.099
In Hawaii.
Like Lost and stuff?

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.333
Like the actors and stuff.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.369
Yeah. Like Lost, exactly.
That's what I was looking for.

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:30.770
I think it would amazing
to be out there.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.038
Well, then you just
come back to-

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.339
Me?

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.642
To be out there shooting a show,
to live in Hawaii, my dream is-

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:36.876
You would like that?

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.312
I would love to get on a show
and go be forced to live

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.448
in Vancouver, or Denver, or ...
I-

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:42.816
-Are you a beach person?
-No.

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.150
I thought you didn't like
the sun.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.385
No, not at all.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.653
I would never even go out
in the sun,

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:49.022
but I want the opportunity
to live other places

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.356
than New York or LA.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.624
Okay.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:52.826
Just for a couple months
at a time.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.060
How about England?
Would you do that?

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.295
Sure. I haven't been there.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.529
What's your take on it
over there?

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:57.764
I was there years ago.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.632
I think it's more
of a Hollywood England

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.034
now than it was
when I was there.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:02.235
Oh, yeah?

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:07.006
Now, it's like everybody
there is on our TV shows

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.274
or hosting our TV shows,

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.376
so it's really probably
the same thing.

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.479
But I heard a lot
of comics love it.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:15.281
It's a really good place
for comedy,

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.016
so maybe that's the way to go,
I don't know.

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:18.251
Do you like ...

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.488
I get this all the time,
but where are the best crowds?

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.823
What's your favorite city?
I hate that question,

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.558
but I feel like you have
a good answer to it.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.093
I don't know, I seem to do
really well in DC.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.361
Yes.

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.662
And I think that's
both the smart ...

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:30.897
You get the people from Virginia

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:32.565
and you also get the DC people,
so it's a good mix.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.766
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.034
Love DC.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.737
San Francisco, that area
still has a good kick to it.

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.739
When you get out
of the IT world,

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:44.077
and that used to be a real
incubator of great comics,

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:47.914
so I still always have a soft
spot for SF and that area,

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:52.519
but I would say anywhere where
I can actually get a crowd.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.521
Hilarities in Cleveland,
I always do really well there.

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:55.755
That's good.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.457
And they're usually a really
cool crowd,

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:58.958
not as much moaning
and groaning.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.295
I'd say that New York and LA are
the most sensitive of the towns,

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:05.298
so it's tough to work
on new material here,

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:06.666
but it still is-

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.601
Is it the tourists here?
I really don't know.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.471
I think it's a combination
of just like a lot of people

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.172
were working all day long,

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.775
and it's hard for them
to turn off their filter

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.176
to really get it.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.145
But then there's people who come
from all over the country

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.813
and they want to hear
New York comedy,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.750
so it's kind of a hard balance.
What do you guys think?

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.051
I think LA, it's just ...

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.819
I mean, we were at the Laugh
Factory on Saturday night.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.788
Yeah, that was a good show
though, you killed it.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.590
It was a good show,
but it was like it's ...

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.126
We were talking about it,
it's like there is no audience

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.694
like that anywhere else.
In LA or-

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.995
Right, that LA audience,
yeah.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.196
Yeah, it's-

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.232
They're pretty spoiled, because
they do get a lot of celebs.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:40.833
If you go
to the Comedy Store,

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.436
within two hours
you'll see five great comics.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.871
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, they are spoiled.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.072
Yeah.
That's a good point.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.874
But I always say
about New York,

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.910
it's like you become
a better comic here,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.312
not just because
of the stage time,

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.481
but because you have to follow,
and I always give your name,

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.183
you have to follow people
like Dave Attell,

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.518
and you watch him
and you're like,

00:11:58.518 --> 00:11:59.719
"Well, I got to step it up."

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.722
Whereas in LA you're following
really famous, good comedians,

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.925
but people are a little bit more
just phoning it in,

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.393
just messing around.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:11.264
They're not bringing it
as hard as New York comics,

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:12.532
and, here, you just have to ...

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:15.134
You go,
"Unless I try super hard,

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:17.303
I'm not going to be able to
follow Dave Attell in any way,"

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:18.805
and so it forces you
to become better.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.440
Yeah, but you're killing it,
and-

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.674
Because of you.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:23.543
... in New York,
the good thing about it

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.744
is it starts so much later,

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.746
whereas in LA,
which is what I hate the most,

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.948
it's like, "Hey, we got you
some spots tonight."

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.883
"What time?" It's like,
"Okay, we got an 8:30."

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.218
I'm like, "8:30?
Man."

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.754
Yeah, you love the late spots.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.156
I love it later, so you can do
everything else

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.591
and get a sleep in and all that.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.560
I like that, yeah.
I don't like it early.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.328
Yeah, you always
close out the shows.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:43.830
I'm like, "How does he

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.064
I don't close them out anymore.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.466
I'm lucky I don't have
to do that anymore.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:49.636
Well, yeah, you come in
pretty late though, but do-

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:51.204
Yeah, I like to do
the late show,

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:52.672
but that used to be
the coolest show.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:54.140
Now, I'd say
that's just like ...

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.508
You really do get a ...

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.144
It's a grab bag, you never know
what is a good show anymore.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.379
Who's going to be crowd
that kicks it.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.647
Sorry.

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:02.181
I know.
It is all over the place,

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:04.951
but there's so many rooms
there now at the Cellar.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.286
That Fat Black I love.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.754
Yeah, that's great.
That is cool.

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.055
And then the Village
Underground,

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:10.623
it's like I love that.
That can be so hot too-

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.824
So good.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.126
... with the music
and everything.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.560
Well, here's a town that
I'm sure you've played,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.129
but there really is no club
is New Orleans.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.397
Yeah.
Have you played there?

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:18.965
Yeah. I've done a rock venue,
but no club.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.199
Why is there no club?

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.434
Yeah, there's no club there.

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:23.202
There's just too much
other entertainment down there.

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:24.404
Yeah.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.472
And let's not dance
around it, Voodoo.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.008
I mean, there's
some kind of weird,

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:32.178
never interview
with a vampire,

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.514
never have a laugh house
in this town.

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:36.482
But, yeah, no, there's just
too many other things going on.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.184
But that would be
a cool place to go.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.886
Like when I played
the Comedy Cellar in Vegas,

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.054
that was cool.

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:42.822
I was like, "That's great
that they have a venue here,"

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.457
because Vegas
was another place where,

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:46.859
unless you could sell out
2000 seats

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.695
or you work with a tiger,

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.898
there was no in
between in Vegas, really.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:56.436
It was just either horribly sad
comedy or big arena comedy.

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:58.104
Dave?
Yeah?

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:00.673
How do you keep track
of all your jokes?

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.108
Oh, that's an
interesting point.

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:04.744
Yeah. You have so many,
and there are so many

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.412
that I bring up to you
all the time, like,

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.680
"That one.
Do you ever do that?"

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.449
And you're like,
"Oh, I haven't thought ...

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:10.950
Do you write them all ...

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.486
Do you have notebooks?
Do you have it in your phone?

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.221
Well, I have two people
that work with me.

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.091
One handles my jokes, the other
one handles my zingers.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:21.828
So I have them
on two different phones.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.696
No, I used to do the notebook
like everybody else.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.931
Sure.

00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.033
And then I still tape
every show,

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.836
but I can not honestly say
I listen to every show,

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:32.004
and that is really
the most painful thing to do,

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:36.776
is to listen to your horrible
jokes doing horribly in a place

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.144
somewhere you don't
even remember.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.412
You're like,
"What? Where was that?"

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:40.613
I know.

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.448
And that, to me,
is the real work of comedy,

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.716
is listening to your tape.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.520
But, yeah, I don't do
the notebooks anymore.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.856
I write them down,
but, really, it's more about

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:52.625
when I look at my work on sheet,

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.194
which is these are jokes that
have not been working for years,

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.263
I look at them and it's like,
"Oh, man, I can't believe

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.765
I still haven't gotten
a vitamin joke," you know?

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.032
Yes.

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.601
And then when I get one,
I'll use it,

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:02.869
and then it'll stop working

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:04.637
and it has to go back
on the work on sheet.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.872
So that sucks.

00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:07.640
Yeah, the work on sheet.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.941
I don't even have
that actual sheet,

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.209
but we talk about it
all the time.

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.245
It's that joke you do on stage,
and you go,

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.514
"Oh, that's been a placeholder,
that punchline has been

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:18.518
a placeholder for six years,"
and I've always been like,

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:20.353
"Think of something
more specific and better,"

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:22.255
and you just never do,
it's always just a C.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.790
Yeah, because in your brain,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.725
that is now the stop
of that thought,

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:28.394
and it's really hard
to take it out of there,

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.963
and sometimes you're like,
"Oh, maybe if the joke bombs,

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.231
if I can make it bomb,

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.267
and then that'll activate
something else in my head."

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.501
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.570
But I notice with
the younger crowds now,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.405
they're kind of joke averse.

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.274
If it's too jokey for them,
they get all whatever,

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.844
but if it's too raw,
they get all nervous

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.313
and all that stuff,
so it's like this fine line.

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.315
But I will say one thing,
is that in LA,

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.551
tags, don't bring them.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:52.752
Really?

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:54.020
For some reason I had
three shows

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.055
where I was doing tags on jokes,
and they were like,

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.423
"We already laughed
at your joke, dude,

00:15:57.423 --> 00:16:00.059
move onto the next thought."
I was like, "Wow."

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.462
That's interesting, I've never
thought about that one before.

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:04.697
Maybe it's just probably me.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.633
No, that's probably a thing.
I think you're so right

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.570
though about they want something
in between of set up ,..

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:13.973
They don't like to see
the work in it.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.175
They don't want you to just,
essentially, read a Tweet,

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:18.177
but if you share
something too raw ...

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.545
There's been times
where I'm like,

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.981
"Something happened yesterday,"
and literally yesterday.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.716
We always say yesterday,
but it's not yesterday.

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:24.951
Yeah.

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.385
And they can sense that it was.

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.588
They're like, "We can smell
the jizz on you."

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:30.489
-Oh.
-You know what I mean?

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.892
Like you haven't showered
since that joke,

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:34.994
and they're grossed out,
and I'm almost like,

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.796
"Do you guys want me to give you
more distance from that

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:39.232
and say it was last week,
as opposed ...

00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:42.268
Because if it's too raw, you're
right, they kind of recoil.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:43.903
It doesn't even have to be
salacious stuff.

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:45.171
No, of course, yeah.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.006
It could just be something
inappropriate

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.775
and I can just
feel them pulling away.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.210
Yeah.
What do you guys think?

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.580
I don't know, sometimes I feel
like they'll recognize

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.949
that maybe I'm too angry,
if it's a personal ...

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.217
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:16:58.217 --> 00:16:59.485
-Yeah
-Yeah

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:00.720
And it doesn't read funny,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.455
it just sounds like
you're just bitter.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:03.656
Yes.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:04.857
Yeah.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.360
It really tricks them,
I've found, if you just ...

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:09.829
Laughing at your own jokes,
I know,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.597
it's the most repulsive thing

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.866
to watch a comic enjoy
their own set,

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.102
but it really does trick
audiences into liking you more.

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:17.303
Oh, yeah.

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:18.938
It's such a trick.

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.040
Until now. You just let it out.

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:24.844
Any other game cheats
you want to let go?
