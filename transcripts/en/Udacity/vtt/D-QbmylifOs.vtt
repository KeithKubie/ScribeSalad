00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.530
Did you predict ln of 3 minus ln of 7? If so, you were right. Let's check out

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.825
the values of each of these and see what we get. First, let's find natural log

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:16.105
of 3 over 7. So we press the ln button on the calculator, and then 3 divided by

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:23.330
7. Interesting. We get negative 0.8472, and so on and so forth. Let's write

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.790
that down. So, now we've got one side of our equation into number form. Let's

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.995
check out the other side now on the calculator. Okay, so we want ln of 3 minus

00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:38.708
ln of 7. I've got it plugged in right, so let's press equals. And sure enough,

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.748
we get exactly the same decimals we have over here. So, our calculator has

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:48.044
helped us confirm this prediction. ln of 3 over 7 is equal to ln of 3 minus ln

00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:49.783
of 7.
