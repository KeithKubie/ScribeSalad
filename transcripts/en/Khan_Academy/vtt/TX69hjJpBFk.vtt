00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:05.046
- [Instructor] The base b of
t of a triangle is decreasing

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.713
at a rate of 13 meters per hour,

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.864
and the height h of t of
the triangle is increasing

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:16.104
at a rate of six meters per hour.

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.984
At a certain instant t sub zero,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:23.509
the base is five meters and
the height is one meter.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.440
What is the rate of
change of the area A of t,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.704
so our area is going to be a function t,

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.809
what is the rate of change of the area

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.024
of the triangle at that instant?

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:37.131
And so what we're going
to do in this exercise,

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:39.402
instead of going straight
and trying to solve it,

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:42.480
what we need to do here is
to identify the various units

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.631
of different expressions
and then try to think about

00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.206
what information is given and what's not.

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.577
And then that will actually equip us

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.702
to actually solve this
rate of change problem.

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:55.531
So let's just do this first part.

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.266
Let's match each
expression with its units.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.883
And like always, pause the video,

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:02.418
and see if you can do it on your own.

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:06.412
All right, so the first
one is b prime of t.

00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:08.823
So this is the rate of change at which,

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:12.100
of which the base is changing
with respect to time.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.908
So if we think about it,
b of t, that is the base.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.302
That is going to be in meters.

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:21.015
So this is going to be in meters.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:22.932
If we say b prime of t,

00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:27.133
this is going to be how
much our base is changing

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.566
with respect to time.

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:32.147
So this is going to be meters per,

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:33.506
and they give us right over here,

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:36.691
they say it's decreasing at
a rate of 13 meters per hour,

00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:40.134
so the units here are meters per hour.

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.301
And so b prime of t, that is
going to be in meters per hour.

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:46.692
A at

00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:48.758
time t sub zero,

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:51.770
remember, A is the area of our triangle.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.736
And we're measuring everything in meters.

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.241
You can tell from the
information they've given us.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.502
And so area is going
to be in square units,

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:02.919
and so it's going to be in square meters.

00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:07.435
Now, the height at time t sub zero,

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:11.227
well, both the base and the
height, those are lengths.

00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:13.171
They're gonna be measured in meters,

00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:16.843
and so our height at
time t sub zero is going

00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:18.176
to be in meters.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.151
And then here we have the rate of change

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.817
of our area with respect to time.

00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:27.050
So our area, we already
know is in meters squared.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.620
But we want know this here,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.536
that this is going to
be the rate of change

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:32.480
of our area with respect to time.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.403
So it's going to be an
amount of area per unit time.

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:39.049
And time here, we're using
hours, as you can see

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.519
from some of the information
they've given us.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.545
So this is going to be area per unit time,

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:47.135
or meters squared per hour.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:49.021
So it's going to be right over here.

00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:51.633
That's area per unit time.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.446
And the length we're
using in this is meters,

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:56.117
and time is hours.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.371
All right.

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:01.517
Now they say match each
expression with its given value.

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:03.143
So what is

00:03:03.143 --> 00:03:05.793
the base of the triangle

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:07.728
at time t sub zero?

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:10.351
Do they give that to us?

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:11.295
Well, let's see.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.019
They say, at a certain time,

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.991
at a certain instant t sub zero, the base,

00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:17.767
I'm gonna underline this
in a different color,

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.302
the base at a certain

00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:22.063
instant t sub zero,

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:24.530
the base is five meters.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.373
So they say the base at time t sub zero,

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.262
the base is a function of time,

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:32.090
but they tell us that it is five meters.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.357
So this is five meters right over here.

00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:37.291
Now what about the rate of change

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.724
of the base with respect to time?

00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:42.138
Do they tell us that?

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.515
Well, look right over here.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.332
That's actually the first piece
of information they gave us.

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:49.366
The base b of t of a
triangle is decreasing

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:52.414
at a rate of 13 meters per hour.

00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:55.336
So the rate of change of the base,

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.086
that it b prime of t,

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.473
which is equal to db/dt,

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.344
and they tell us that that is,

00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:06.629
it's decreasing at a rate
of 13 meters per hour.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.902
So that would be negative
13 meters per hour.

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:14.187
And so the rate of change of
the base with respect to time

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.734
is going to be negative 13.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:18.632
They gave us that.

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.700
Now A prime of t, this is the
rate of change of the area

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.283
at time t sub zero.

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.294
Did they give us this?

00:04:27.294 --> 00:04:28.390
Well, they ask us that.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.419
What is the rate of
change of the area A of t

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.276
of the triangle at that instant?

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:36.628
So this is what we actually
need to figure out,

00:04:36.628 --> 00:04:37.942
but they haven't given it to us,

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:39.916
otherwise there is no problem to solve.

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.841
So this one right over here is not given.

00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:45.284
In fact, this is what we
are trying to solve for.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:48.039
And then finally we have

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.398
the first derivative of the
height with respect to time.

00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:54.820
So you could view this as dh/dt.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.473
What is this going to be?

00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:58.362
Do they give it to us?

00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.641
Well, look right over here.

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:03.689
They say the height of
the triangle is increasing

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.439
at a rate of six meters per hour.

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:10.348
So if they're saying h of t is increasing,

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:11.859
they're telling us the rate of change

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:14.115
of h of t with respect to time,

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:15.821
so that's h prime of t.

00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.351
And they're telling us
that it is increasing

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.583
at six meters per hour,

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:22.610
so it's gonna be positive
six meters per hour.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.579
So they did indeed give us that.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:30.228
Now why is all of this a
useful exercise to go through?

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:34.480
Well, now we are really
ready to solve the question.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.955
Because, in general, if we're
talking about any triangle,

00:05:36.955 --> 00:05:39.041
we know that area

00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:43.238
is equal to 1/2 base times height.

00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:47.236
Now in this situation, area
and our base and our height,

00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:48.869
they're all going to be functions of t,

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.869
so we could write A of t

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:55.096
is equal to 1/2 times b of t

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:57.095
times h of t.

00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:02.033
And if we want to find the rate of change

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:04.106
of our area at that instant,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:05.792
and the instant that they're talking about

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:07.766
is at time t sub zero,

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:10.026
well, then what we would want
to do is take the derivative

00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:12.099
of both sides with respect to t.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.677
So the derivative on the left-hand side

00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:17.275
with respect to t would be A prime of t,

00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:20.667
and then on the right-hand
side it would be 1/2 times,

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.652
and we would actually
use a combination of,

00:06:23.652 --> 00:06:26.022
well, it's really just the
product rule right over here.

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:28.679
The derivative of the first
function with respect to t,

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:32.292
so it's b prime of t
times the second function,

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.251
this is just the product rule here,

00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.751
plus the first function b of t

00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:40.041
times the derivative
of the second function

00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:41.977
with respect to time.

00:06:41.977 --> 00:06:45.438
And we need to figure out not
just the general expression,

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.799
they want us to know what the
rate of change of the area,

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:52.578
so A prime of t at that
instant, at t sub zero.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.538
So what we want to figure out,

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:58.318
we want to figure out A
prime at time t sub zero.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:02.032
Well, that's just going to
be equal to 1/2 times b prime

00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:05.032
of t sub zero times h of t sub zero,

00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:08.578
plus b of t sub zero,

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:11.147
times h prime of t sub zero.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:12.601
Now this might seem daunting,

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:15.627
except they've given us a
lot of this information.

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:17.578
What is b prime

00:07:17.578 --> 00:07:18.745
of t sub zero?

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:21.523
Well, they tell us the rate of change

00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:22.872
of b with respect to time,

00:07:22.872 --> 00:07:24.864
and it seems like it's just gonna stay

00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:27.665
at negative 13 meters per hour.

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.537
So they gave us this.

00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:32.698
H, what is the height at time t sub zero?

00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:35.615
Well, they tell us right over here.

00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:39.308
At a certain instant,
the base is five meters

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:40.488
and the height is one meter.

00:07:40.488 --> 00:07:43.450
So they give us both
b and h at t sub zero.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.885
So they gave us this.

00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:46.096
They gave us this.

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:47.801
And what is the rate
of change of the height

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.316
at time t sub zero?

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:50.505
Well, they tell us.

00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:52.722
The height of the triangle is increasing

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.725
at a rate of six meters per hour.

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:57.476
So they tell us that as well.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.931
All of that stuff is given,

00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:00.906
and so you just have to
plug it in to figure out

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:04.456
what is the rate of change
of the area at t sub zero,

00:08:04.456 --> 00:08:05.789
at that instant.
