00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.800
Generous, thoughtful, sensitive people

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.840
are often drawn to the view that we shouldn't expect economies to grow.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.060
After all, the earth and its resources are limited.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.260
So why keep asking for GDP to expand?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.780
It's understandable if this opinion is widespread,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.500
but perhaps a good future depends not on minimizing capitalism, but on radically extending it.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.660
At its best, capitalism should address the full range of mankind's true needs

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.200
as efficiently and effectively as possible.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.760
This is not currently happening.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.380
Despite all the factories, the concrete, the highways, and the logistics chains,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.200
the economy is as yet,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.560
far too small and desperately undeveloped.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.000
Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.840
capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs--

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.180
for sanitation, shelter, food supply and healthcare.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.600
The largest and most successful corporations have been those that satisfied appetites

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.040
that we would categorize as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow's famous "Pyramid of Needs."

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.560
Oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, insurance and banking...

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.740
But the briefest glance at the Pyramid of Needs reveals a fascinating possibility--

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
that the future growth of business might lie in an assort on a vast array of needs

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.480
further up the pyramid-- in the areas of love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.840
Capitalists and companies are seemingly semi-consciously aware of this issue;

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.300
the evidence lies in advertising.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.520
Advertising almost always tries to sell us stuff

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880
with an appeal to our higher needs

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.040
by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfillment,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.120
authenticity,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280
good relationships,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.300
and a sense of true achievement.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.660
But as yet, the corporations who pay for the adverts

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.220
are not actually devoted to meeting the needs

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.580
that their marketing people have so skillfully evoked.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.080
We get promised friendship or love

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.260
and end up with a 4 by 4 or a new barbecue set.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.580
Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.740
It already trades on all the right fantasies--

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.520
it's just that there are, as yet, very few of the truly right products in services out there.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.200
What we call a business idea,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.120
is at heart,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.360
just an, as yet, unexplored need.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.500
To trace the future shape of capitalism,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.320
we only have to think of all the needs that we have

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.260
that are currently poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.700
There's no shortage;

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.360
we need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.620
We need help in bringing up children.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.340
We need help in calming down at key moments.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.020
We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.540
and understanding where we can best deploy them.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660
We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires--

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.520
elegant town centers, charming high streets and sweet villages

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.600
are in desperately short supply,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.140
and are therefore, absurdly expensive.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.520
Just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.260
but were very rare, and only for the very rich.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.980
These higher needs are not trivial or minor ones--

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420
little things that we could easily survive without.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.560
They are, in many ways, absolutely central to our lives.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.680
We simply accept it without really thinking about it--

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.620
that there's nothing we could do to address them.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.180
And yet, to be able to structure businesses around these needs

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.420
would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.700
or the invention of the electric light bulb.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.940
We don't know today quite what the businesses of the future will look like;

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.760
just as, in 1975, no one could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.040
But, we know the direction we need to head to.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.400
We need the drive and inventiveness of capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.000
This will offer an exit for many of the failings and miseries that attend capitalism today.
