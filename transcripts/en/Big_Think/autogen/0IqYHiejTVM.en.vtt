studies of children have shown that we

studies of children have shown that we
are born with this instinct for what's

are born with this instinct for what's
 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.039
are born with this instinct for what's
called substance dualism the idea that

instruction naturally assume that they
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.600

have a soul and so I think a lot of

evolution why there's a whole host of

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180
evolution why there's a whole host of
 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.520
evolution why there's a whole host of
reasons for that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530
reasons for that
 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.710
reasons for that
I mean I suppose that if you're an

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720
I mean I suppose that if you're an
 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.290
I mean I suppose that if you're an
unbeliever you think that it's just some

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300
unbeliever you think that it's just some
 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.570
unbeliever you think that it's just some
kind of evolutionary accident it's a

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580
kind of evolutionary accident it's a
 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.720
kind of evolutionary accident it's a
trick of the mind if as it were that

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730
trick of the mind if as it were that
 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.080

if you're a believer you think that it's

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369
if you're a believer you think that it's
 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.069
if you're a believer you think that it's
probably because there is a soul and

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079
probably because there is a soul and
 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.340
probably because there is a soul and
maybe perhaps that we were intentionally

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350
maybe perhaps that we were intentionally
 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.450
maybe perhaps that we were intentionally
created in such a way as to think that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460
created in such a way as to think that
 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.520
created in such a way as to think that
there is more to us than just the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530
there is more to us than just the
 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130
there is more to us than just the
material realm it's really a choice but

what cannot be denied is that belief in

what cannot be denied is that belief in
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.239
what cannot be denied is that belief in
the soul is a belief that all peoples

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249
the soul is a belief that all peoples
 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.760
the soul is a belief that all peoples
share regardless of their culture or

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
share regardless of their culture or
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.219
share regardless of their culture or
their religion and it's a belief that

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
their religion and it's a belief that
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.279
their religion and it's a belief that
goes back as far back in time as we can

goes back as far back in time as we can
 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.959
goes back as far back in time as we can
possibly trace it and if these

possibly trace it and if these

psychological studies that I was talking
 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.349
psychological studies that I was talking
about our right it's a belief that were

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359
about our right it's a belief that were
 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.789
about our right it's a belief that were
born with over the last couple of

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799
born with over the last couple of
 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.330
born with over the last couple of
hundred years there's been an enormous

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340
hundred years there's been an enormous
 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.300
hundred years there's been an enormous
amount of thought that's gone into the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
amount of thought that's gone into the
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.029
amount of thought that's gone into the
question of why religion you know the

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039
question of why religion you know the
 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.199
question of why religion you know the
one thing that we all agree on is that

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209
one thing that we all agree on is that
 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.539
one thing that we all agree on is that
religion has been a part of the human

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
religion has been a part of the human
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.480
religion has been a part of the human
experience from the beginning in fact we

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490
experience from the beginning in fact we
 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.699
experience from the beginning in fact we
can trace the origin of religious

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709
can trace the origin of religious
 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.450
can trace the origin of religious
experience to before homo sapiens we can

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460
experience to before homo sapiens we can
 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.760
experience to before homo sapiens we can
shape we can trace it with some measure

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
shape we can trace it with some measure
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.830
shape we can trace it with some measure
of confidence to me

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
of confidence to me
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.470
of confidence to me
and earth all's we can measure it with a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
and earth all's we can measure it with a
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.170
and earth all's we can measure it with a
little less confidence all the way to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
little less confidence all the way to
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.809

Homo erectus so we're talking hundreds

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819
Homo erectus so we're talking hundreds
 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.570
Homo erectus so we're talking hundreds
of thousands of years before our species

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580
of thousands of years before our species
 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.339
of thousands of years before our species
even existed so the question is why

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349
even existed so the question is why
 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.160
even existed so the question is why
you know if religion is a universal

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
you know if religion is a universal
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.930
you know if religion is a universal
phenomenon or rather I should say

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
phenomenon or rather I should say
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640
phenomenon or rather I should say
religious experience

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650
religious experience
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.369
religious experience
if religious experience is a universal

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379
if religious experience is a universal
 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.309
if religious experience is a universal
phenomenon if it can be traced in all

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319
phenomenon if it can be traced in all
 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.920
phenomenon if it can be traced in all
peoples all cultures and throughout all

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
peoples all cultures and throughout all
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.740
peoples all cultures and throughout all
time then there must be some

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750
time then there must be some
 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.020
time then there must be some
evolutionary reason for it there must be

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
evolutionary reason for it there must be
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.910
evolutionary reason for it there must be
a reason some adaptive advantage to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
a reason some adaptive advantage to
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.520
a reason some adaptive advantage to
having religious experience or faith

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
having religious experience or faith
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.180
having religious experience or faith
experience otherwise it wouldn't exist

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
experience otherwise it wouldn't exist
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.520
experience otherwise it wouldn't exist
and so there have been over the last

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530
and so there have been over the last
 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.580
and so there have been over the last
couple of centuries numerous attempts to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590
couple of centuries numerous attempts to
 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.770
couple of centuries numerous attempts to
figure out exactly what that adaptive

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780
figure out exactly what that adaptive
 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.619
figure out exactly what that adaptive
advantage would be the most popular

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629
advantage would be the most popular
 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.300
advantage would be the most popular
explanation of course is the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310
explanation of course is the
 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.660
explanation of course is the
sociological one that religion creates a

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670
sociological one that religion creates a
 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.650
sociological one that religion creates a
sense of cohesion amongst a group and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660
sense of cohesion amongst a group and
 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.590
sense of cohesion amongst a group and
that that sense of cohesion the idea

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600
that that sense of cohesion the idea
 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.590
that that sense of cohesion the idea
that we could come together and create a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600
that we could come together and create a
 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.050
that we could come together and create a
collective identity based on shared

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
collective identity based on shared
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.129
collective identity based on shared
symbols or shared metaphors gave an

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139
symbols or shared metaphors gave an
 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.199
symbols or shared metaphors gave an
adaptive advantage to believing

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209
adaptive advantage to believing
 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.970
adaptive advantage to believing
communities that non believing

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
communities that non believing
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.400
communities that non believing
communities did not have that's a pretty

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
communities did not have that's a pretty
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.210
communities did not have that's a pretty
good answer the problem is that religion

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220
good answer the problem is that religion
 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.300
good answer the problem is that religion
is as much a divisive issue as it is a

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310
is as much a divisive issue as it is a
 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.140
is as much a divisive issue as it is a
cohesive one it says good at creating

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150
cohesive one it says good at creating
 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.319
cohesive one it says good at creating
out groups as it is in groups and more

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329
out groups as it is in groups and more
 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.650
out groups as it is in groups and more
importantly the problem with that the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660
importantly the problem with that the
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.670
importantly the problem with that the
social cohesion theory is that kinship

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680
social cohesion theory is that kinship
 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.509
social cohesion theory is that kinship
was a much more powerful and much more

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519
was a much more powerful and much more
 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.050
was a much more powerful and much more
dominant form of social cohesion than

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
dominant form of social cohesion than
 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.740
dominant form of social cohesion than
religion was our ancestors lived in

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750
religion was our ancestors lived in
 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.780
religion was our ancestors lived in
small communities that were bound

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
small communities that were bound
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.529
small communities that were bound
together by by blood by relationship by

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539
together by by blood by relationship by
 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.490
together by by blood by relationship by
by kinship long before they created

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500
by kinship long before they created
 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.980
by kinship long before they created
symbols and mythologies in order to

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990
symbols and mythologies in order to
 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.649
symbols and mythologies in order to
unify them so it's a pretty good answer

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659
unify them so it's a pretty good answer
 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.879
unify them so it's a pretty good answer
but it doesn't really

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889
but it doesn't really
 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.119
but it doesn't really
it doesn't really explain what adaptive

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129
it doesn't really explain what adaptive
 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.480
it doesn't really explain what adaptive
advantage religion would have had as

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
advantage religion would have had as
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.600

us you know answers to the the

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939
us you know answers to the the
 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.209
us you know answers to the the
unanswerable questions of the world that

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219
unanswerable questions of the world that

unanswerable questions of the world that
what it did was create a sense of

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379
what it did was create a sense of
 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.629
what it did was create a sense of
knowledge about the universe that

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639
knowledge about the universe that
 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.409
knowledge about the universe that
lessened anxiety in some way and that

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419
lessened anxiety in some way and that
 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.899
lessened anxiety in some way and that
was an adaptive advantage well even if

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909
was an adaptive advantage well even if
 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.480
was an adaptive advantage well even if
that were true and there's truly no

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
that were true and there's truly no
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.670
that were true and there's truly no
reason scientifically to think that it

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680
reason scientifically to think that it
 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.830
reason scientifically to think that it
was it's really hard to make an argument

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840
was it's really hard to make an argument
 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.649
was it's really hard to make an argument
about why that would necessarily be an

about why that would necessarily be an
 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.189
about why that would necessarily be an
adaptive advantage particularly because

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199
adaptive advantage particularly because
 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.649
adaptive advantage particularly because
religion actually causes far more

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659
religion actually causes far more
 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.369
religion actually causes far more
anxiety than it lessens in fact to put

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379
anxiety than it lessens in fact to put

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.240
it in evolutionary terms the cost of
religious expression is enormous it's

the countless different answers that
 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.950
the countless different answers that
have been given for why religion fail

have been given for why religion fail
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.079
have been given for why religion fail
primarily because they're functionalist

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089
primarily because they're functionalist
 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.439
primarily because they're functionalist
answers what they primarily say is what

answers what they primarily say is what
religion does not why religion exists

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080
religion does not why religion exists
 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.510
religion does not why religion exists
and so a group of cognitive scientists

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520
and so a group of cognitive scientists
 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.889
and so a group of cognitive scientists
particularly cognitive scientists who

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:02.899
particularly cognitive scientists who
 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.219
particularly cognitive scientists who
focus on religion have tried to look to

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229
focus on religion have tried to look to
 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.639
focus on religion have tried to look to
a different way of answering this

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:09.649
a different way of answering this
 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:12.999
a different way of answering this
question of why religion and what

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009
question of why religion and what
 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.689
question of why religion and what
they've discovered is that number one

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699
they've discovered is that number one
 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.579
they've discovered is that number one
there is in the end no adaptive

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:18.589
there is in the end no adaptive
 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.829
there is in the end no adaptive
advantage to religious faith

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839
advantage to religious faith
 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.010
advantage to religious faith
and number two that the reason that

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020
and number two that the reason that
 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.070
and number two that the reason that
religion exists it's big is because it

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080
religion exists it's big is because it
 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.439
religion exists it's big is because it
is an accidental byproduct of some other

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449
is an accidental byproduct of some other
 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.300
is an accidental byproduct of some other
adaptive advantage and here we get into

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310
adaptive advantage and here we get into
 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.449
adaptive advantage and here we get into
very complicated conversations about

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:37.459
very complicated conversations about
 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:39.879
very complicated conversations about
cognitive theory and and the development

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889
cognitive theory and and the development
 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.559
cognitive theory and and the development
of our frontal lobes and

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569
of our frontal lobes and
 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:42.879
of our frontal lobes and
things like that but to put it in its

things like that but to put it in its
 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.399
things like that but to put it in its
simplest way religious thinking is

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409
simplest way religious thinking is
 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.279
simplest way religious thinking is
embedded in our cognitive processes it

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289
embedded in our cognitive processes it
 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.359

it's part of our DNA the question then
 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.189
it's part of our DNA the question then
becomes why one answer is that there is

becomes why one answer is that there is
 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.409

adaptations I should say or if you're a

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:16.189
adaptations I should say or if you're a
 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.699
adaptations I should say or if you're a
believer you would say because we were

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:18.709
believer you would say because we were
 

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:23.219
believer you would say because we were
made that way because we are designed to

made that way because we are designed to
 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.469
made that way because we are designed to

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479
believe that there is more to this world
 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.869

knowing that exists in our brain is
 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.329
knowing that exists in our brain is
there for a reason either answer is fine

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:34.339
there for a reason either answer is fine
 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.519
there for a reason either answer is fine
there are some people who say well what

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:36.529
there are some people who say well what
 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.499
there are some people who say well what
religion really does and the reason that

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509
religion really does and the reason that
 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.499
religion really does and the reason that
it exists is that it creates some

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:40.509
it exists is that it creates some
 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.839
it exists is that it creates some
morality right that if you if we imagine

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:43.849
morality right that if you if we imagine
 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.149
morality right that if you if we imagine
that there's this absolute moral

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159
that there's this absolute moral
 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:49.119
that there's this absolute moral
lawgiver then we're less likely to kill

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:49.129
lawgiver then we're less likely to kill
 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:51.100
lawgiver then we're less likely to kill
our neighbor and that creates some sort

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.110
our neighbor and that creates some sort

of adaptive advantage the problem with

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599
of adaptive advantage the problem with
 

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.019
of adaptive advantage the problem with
that theory of course is that the

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029
that theory of course is that the
 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.779
that theory of course is that the
concept of a moral lawgiver is barely

00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:58.789
concept of a moral lawgiver is barely
 

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.909
concept of a moral lawgiver is barely
five thousand years old and religious

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919
five thousand years old and religious
 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:03.459
five thousand years old and religious
expression goes hundreds of thousands of

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:03.469
expression goes hundreds of thousands of
 

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:05.529
expression goes hundreds of thousands of
years I mean if you even think about the

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:05.539
years I mean if you even think about the
 

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.899
years I mean if you even think about the
Mesopotamian gods or the Egyptian gods

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:07.909
Mesopotamian gods or the Egyptian gods
 

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:09.850
Mesopotamian gods or the Egyptian gods
and this is again six seven eight

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:09.860
and this is again six seven eight
 

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.730
and this is again six seven eight
thousand years ago these were not moral

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:12.740
thousand years ago these were not moral
 

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.939
thousand years ago these were not moral
beings on the contrary they were amoral

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:15.949
beings on the contrary they were amoral
 

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:20.499
beings on the contrary they were amoral
and often immoral being so the idea that

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:20.509
and often immoral being so the idea that
 

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:23.920
and often immoral being so the idea that
religion is about morality is a very new

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:23.930
religion is about morality is a very new
 

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.109
religion is about morality is a very new
idea

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:25.119
idea
 

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:27.749
idea
others say that religion is about

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759
others say that religion is about
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.769
others say that religion is about
Authority it's a it's a way of

Authority it's a it's a way of
 

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:32.139

maintaining control and power over a
 

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:36.360
maintaining control and power over a
group and perhaps those groups that were

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.370
group and perhaps those groups that were
 

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.399
group and perhaps those groups that were
religiously inclined had an adaptive

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:39.409
religiously inclined had an adaptive
 

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.219
religiously inclined had an adaptive
advantage because that notion of an

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:42.229
advantage because that notion of an
 

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:44.410

authority structure allowed them to

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:44.420
authority structure allowed them to
 

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.269
authority structure allowed them to
survive better again that's a pretty

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279
survive better again that's a pretty
 

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:48.069
survive better again that's a pretty
good answer the problem is is that

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:48.079
good answer the problem is is that
 

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:50.710
good answer the problem is is that
you're talking about institutionalized

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720
you're talking about institutionalized
 

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.510
you're talking about institutionalized
religious expression which maybe

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:54.520
religious expression which maybe
 

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.130
religious expression which maybe
is 12 to 14 thousand years old that's as

00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.140
is 12 to 14 thousand years old that's as
 

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.800
is 12 to 14 thousand years old that's as
far back as we can trace anything that

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.810
far back as we can trace anything that
 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.650
far back as we can trace anything that
looks like an institutional religious

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.660
looks like an institutional religious
 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.010
looks like an institutional religious
authority and again that does not
