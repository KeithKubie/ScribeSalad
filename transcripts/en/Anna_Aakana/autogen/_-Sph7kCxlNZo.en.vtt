00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.160
[Philip]: Here's... Here's.... We need a photo op, Anna,
this is very important

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
[Anna]:This doesn't work!
[Philip]: Here, use mine. Use mine.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.800
[Anna]: Thank you.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.160
(Audience cheers)

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.280
Wow! This is beautiful and not gold.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.780
(audience laughs)

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200
I have a speech prepared, guys!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
Two drinks in and I'm on medication,
so we'll see how this goes.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.740
First off, I just want to say I am– I am incredibly honored to be here

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.360
when Wes and Phil and Dan told me
that they wanted to give me this award.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.620
I thought, wow, you know my years of
friendship with them have finally paid off.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.300
(audience laughs)

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.040
Joke success!

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.940
Yes, um, I always wanted to be in entertainment.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.600
You know when I was a kid, I told my dad I wanted to be an actor,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
so he immediately enrolled me in karate classes.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.360
But, of course, I didn't seriously pursue
my dream until I was an adult

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.140
and only because I lost my little sister to suicide.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.640
And I realized that when I died, I wanted to at least know that I had lived doing what I had loved.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.000
Before my sister died, I thought that I was gonna be like a military officer or a veterinarian

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.440
because that's the practical route, right? That's a realistic path.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:48.060
She killed herself when I was 17, and I was a senior in high school and I did not laugh for two years.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.680
Um, it wasn't until I saw a stand-up special on TV that I laughed for the very first time

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.710
and the person on my TV was Margaret Cho.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.860
You know, I looked at her on stage and I was like: "Oh hey, you know, maybe I can do that."

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.710
It was the very first time I had ever seen an Asian woman do stand up and before that,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.530
the only Asian female face I had ever
seen on TV was of course... Lucy Liu.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.450
Right? That's all we had.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.650
And seven years later... here I am.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.160
(one woo)

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.580
Thank you for the one woo, appreciate that.
(Audience cheers)

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.020
(Audience cheers)
Thank you.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.200
But it– it is all thanks to seeing that one face on the screen that looked like mine

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.980
because I was able to think: 
"Oh, she's doing that, maybe I could do that too."

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.740
You know I used to think that being Asian gave me an edge in this industry.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.280
You know you would see how hard people worked and you're like: "Oh shit, I could do way better than that."

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.740
And hard work equals success, right?
That's what we're taught by our parents,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.440
that if you work hard, success will come.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.180
So I thought that's what must happen with Hollywood.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.040
But last year I booked the lead role
in a feature film with a major studio.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100
(Audience cheers)

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.220
Thank you.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.560
I auditioned, I did callbacks with producers, and I met with the executives of the studio at the company.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.640
We shook hands, they told me:
"Oh, we can't wait to work with you."

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.180
"We're so excited that you're the lead of our movie."

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.840
And I drove home, like, singing the Katy Perry in my car.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.480
Because this was my dream and I was finally living it and it had actually come true.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.600
You know I could not believe that I wasn't just like a one-line co-star on "Awkward' talking about my small boobs.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.740
Or I wasn't like, a supporting best friend who was like, upset about a B minus.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.040
I was the lead.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.060
A few days later my manager called me while I was on set, directing a short film

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.400
and he was very confused.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.880
He was like: "When you met with those executives, are you sure that you booked the lead role?"

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.160
And I was like: "Well yeah, we were talking about the lead character,"

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.120
"We mentioned it by name,
I had auditioned with that dialogue."

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.560
"Why?"

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.940
And he said that they'd gotten the
official paperwork in for the offer,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.320
and what I was being given
was the role of the best friend.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.380
The lead was going instead to a white woman.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.700
And we sat in silence for a bit and then,
finally, I asked him very quietly,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.410
I said: "Is it because I'm Asian?"

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.240
And he didn't say anything for a hot minute,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.080
but then he said:
"Honestly? You know, that's what I'm thinking."

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.000
"I mean what else could it be? What could
have changed in those couple of days?"

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.920
That was the very first time in my career that I realized that the color of my skin,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.360
might actually stand in the way of me and my dream.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.800
You know we hear stories of racism in Hollywood all the time.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.640
We've encountered racism in our real life,
we're not fucking idiots.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.070
Sorry, there's children here.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.780
But somehow, this was– this was so different because it had never mattered before

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.620
you know I thought: "Oh if you work hard enough, you can achieve your dreams. If you work hard enough,"

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.040
"and hone your craft enough, and are talented enough, how can a Hollywood ignore you?"

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.440
And to me it felt crazy. 'Cause it was like, I thought this lead role was the success

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.900
after seven years of performing stand-up,
and being in improv and acting classes,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.870
and writing and editing and producing
and directing and creating short films

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.110
and web series and weekly content,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.710
and building a following and hosting a podcast,
and running a clothing line,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.490
and audition, and hustling,
and just working fucking hard.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.750
(Audience cheers)

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.480
Thank you.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.000
I would like to mention, just for clarity,
I was Asian the whole time.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.240
(Audience laughs)

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.100
In the audition room, in the callback,
in the meeting with the producers.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.200
'Cause for two seconds I was freaking out, I was like:

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.520
"Did I wear foundation that was like, way too light for my skin?"

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.520
But the studio would not budge.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.610
I was either the best friend or I was out.
So I was out.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.420
Then, there was Emma Stone in "Aloha," there was Scarlett Johansson in "Ghost in the Shell,"

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.040
there was Tilda Swinton,
and Kimmy Schmidt season 2 episode 3,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.820
the giant middle finger to the Asian community by calling us: Respectful Asian Portrayals in Entertainment

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.760
aka RAPE.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.240
What the fuck?

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.900
How is this still happening? But more importantly:
How can we change it?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.630
You know, Phil had a 17 minute video
about whitewashing in Hollywood,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.160
and it was great.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.920
And the one thing I took away from it that I thought he– he put so perfectly was that it starts with us.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.280
You know? Not demanding to be included
but creating our own space in this world.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.900
To encourage our peers to be writers and actors and directors and producers

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.350
and creators, instead of letting our parents convince us that we should be doctors and lawyers and scientists.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.810
We all need to be someone's Margaret Cho.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.400
Because the only way we will be heard,
is if enough of our voices speak out.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.460
Thank you.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:38.260
(Applause and cheers)
