00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.720
I don't think I actually liked Rauschenberg's
work when I first saw it.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.830
Rauschenberg seemed too anarchic for me, it
was too much about the world.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.720
But I think Rauschenberg is really interesting in that sense of being able to pull so much

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.480
of the world into the work.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.869
And the world is a anarchic, you know, so it
is a kind of reflection of what the world is.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.580
But he also knows how to compose a picture, so there is that sort of odd tension between

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.500
like there is lace and there's red paint and
there's newspapers and there's an eagle and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.680
there's, you know, whatever.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.850
But it all works somehow.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.120
And that's kind of his challenge to other
artists, is like how do you make all that work

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.210
He has an incredible eye but also it's a challenge
in terms of an approach to the world in artwork,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.210
you know?

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.210
Like what is an artwork?

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.550
What does it reflect?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.220
How does it sit in the world?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.790
And does the newspaper stop there or does it...?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.050
Yeah, it stops there.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.680
Right, okay.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.130
Because I think you would see it through the black.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.470
Yeah, all right.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.870
And this is definitely asphalt, tar.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.000
Oh, it's tar?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
A lot of abstraction is about not having markers
of time, a kind of timelessness.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.680
And Rauschenberg's abstraction has these markers
of time in it because "Ashville Citizen,"

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.540
"Untitled (Ashville Citizen)," has newspaper
in it.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.420
So you're looking at that newspaper and you
realize it's from a specific date and has

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.100
a specific content in it.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.020
So you're always aware that it's made at a
particular moment.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.280
I think it's interesting in this painting
that the newspaper is so legible, because

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.000
most of the other paintings that I've seen,
black paintings, red paintings, which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.250
use newspaper or use paper in them, the paper
is just paper.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
It's not really meant to be read as such.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.440
But in "Asheville Citizen," you're very aware
because it takes up so much of the canvas

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.090
that it is a newspaper.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.390
And it's quite legible.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.980
And it's actually quite interesting because
it's 1951, it's North Carolina.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.560
It's the segregated south.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.730
So you see ads for employment or real estate.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.140
And then in the middle of the page, you know,
where are those wants ads are, is the colored section

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.060
And it's interesting to me that the paper
just happens to be called "Asheville Citizen"

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.250
because that implies a wide range of citizens.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.270
But clearly, in the segregated south in the
'50s, "citizenship" needs to be said in quotes.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.630
So whether he is aware that or was thinking
about that, I don't know.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.860
I don't know the scholarship well enough but
I think it reads to us now in very interesting ways.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.280
This painting has these want ads in it, has
a colored section, and the structure of the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.300
painting is this newspaper that
at one point was, you know, newspaper color—

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300
white—and then has these borders of black,
you know?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.800
And so the structure of what you're seeing
in the newspaper on the physical page is somewhat

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.490
echoed for me in the structure of the painting
itself, these dividing lines between these

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.480
different colors.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.300
You know, Rauschenberg is
an artist that likes to put a lot of different

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.290
things together.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.310
And so he becomes a model a way to do that.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.019
He sort of models that behavior

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.080
And in some ways, I always feel like he's
one of those artists that I'm constantly trying to catch up with

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.200
He's always kind of the future, you know?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.440
Even though these paintings are from the 50s,
they're all still kind of the future, you know?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.940
When I'm switching from say, painting
to a photo project or a film project,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.059
it's about a kind of necessity.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:25.800
The things that I wanna say in that photo
project or in that film project are not possible

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.370
to say in painting.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.540
And maybe that's my failing as an artist is
I haven't, you know, kind of dived in deep

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.490
enough into painting to figure out how to
say certain kinds of things.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.319
But I think it's also interesting to work
in a medium you don't know much about, partially

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.340
because you just, you learn things.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.139
And what's the point of making art if not
to learn things?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.480
I admire that ability to constantly embrace the new.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.220
Or not even embrace the new within the genre
that one might know him for but decide I'm

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.860
going to do sets or I'm going to, you
know, work with dancers and choreograph something.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.439
Or I'm gonna make a giant bubbling pool of
mud as a sculpture.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.900
I kind of like that he just embraced these
new technologies and new ways of working and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.360
that they kind of free up, you know, his practice
to all these other avenues.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.740
It's really interesting to me but also
a bit unnerving, you know?

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.640
My &nbsp;bubbling mud paintings are coming.
