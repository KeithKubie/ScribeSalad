00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.208
The color slice in the previous exercise gives a sense of the limits of what

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.452
colors can be displayed on your monitor. This is a different kind of color

00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:13.426
space. We won't get heavily into this diagram, which shows what is called the

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:18.180
CIE XYZ color space. But I want to point out a few key bits. Along this curved

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.355
edge are the pure spectral colors. The values here are the wavelengths of light

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:27.033
that produce various colors. You can in fact, see the colors of the rainbow as

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.530
you move along it. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and so on. You might also

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.255
notice a funny artifact along here and here. I find these lines will show up

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:41.595
more strongly if I look at my computer screen from a different angle. These

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:44.829
bands which are called Mach Bands are something you might run into every now and

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.952
then in computer graphics. It turns out that the pure spectral colors on this

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:52.882
outer rim are not something a monitor can actually display. The pixels in a

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.908
monitor each have a red, green and blue component, and none of these components

00:00:56.908 --> 00:01:00.860
is a pure spectral color but rather a mix of differing wavelengths of light.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.022
What this means is that our monitors have limits on the colors that they can

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:08.580
display. What is happening outside of these dashed lines is that the illustrator

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.610
is just faking it, by picking the best possible color and repeating it on out to

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.802
the edge of the curve. What the diagram of displayable colors looks like is

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:22.102
this. This triangle is called the device's color gamma. The vertices are the

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:26.443
same, RGB vertices we used to form our own color triangle. And there's a slice

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:30.734
out of the color cue. This whole area reminds me of seeing advertisements for

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:34.684
TVs on television. The announcer would talk about how their new TV's image was

00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:38.319
brighter, sharper and with richer colors. On the screen they chose some bright,

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.800
crisp video. But of course I was seeing this video with my old TV, so there

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.722
wasn't much point in them showing me anything in the advertisement at all. The

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:49.232
key take-away in all this is that the RGB color's base is directly connected to

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:54.167
the monitor. And that monitors have limits as to what colors they can display.

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:57.828
The idea of a color gamut is also important in printing. For example, for

00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:03.263
high-end printing, custom inks can be used to increase the extent of the gamut.
