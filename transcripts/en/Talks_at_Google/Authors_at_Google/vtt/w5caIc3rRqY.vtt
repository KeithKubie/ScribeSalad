And then you're thinking,
what about my family?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.659
And what about my friends that
I haven't had a glass of wine

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:03.330
with for the last six months--

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.410
and one of them my
really, really best friend

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.440
that I haven't even met
for the last 12 months.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.370
So very often, the busier
we get, the more successful

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.140
we get, the more we
climb that ladder,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.170
the more it starts to feel
more like a tight rope rather

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.770
than a ladder.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.480
If you can relate
to that, please

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.859
can I ask you to scream
"yes" in your language.

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:21.442
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:21.984
AUDIENCE: Tá.

00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:24.108
ENDA MCNULTY: Now, we've
got a bit of a lower tone.

00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:26.350
Now, you realize this
session will be a lot of fun,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.170
but also a bit of
a serious side.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.670
If I say to change
seats by the way,

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.264
I'm very wary of the people
on my right-hand side.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:33.930
I want you to change
seats very quickly.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.690
The person who's the
slowest to change seats

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.490
will have a pushups penalty.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.250
OK?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.750
Please be [INAUDIBLE] conscious.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.960
Pushups penalty means you're
going to be up here doing

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.441
at least 10 pushups.

00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:48.940
Change!

00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:00.480
OK.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.040
So one of the things--

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.230
in talking to Carly in
advance to this session--

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.600
Carly, thank you very much
for the work you're doing.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.420
I turned to Carly and she talked
about one of the big things

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.130
she'd like us to refer
to is confidence.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.170
I left the Irish rugby camp last
night at 12:30 in Carton House

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.780
after spending about 4 and
1/2 hours in back-to-back one

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.656
on ones with some of the Irish
international rugby players.

00:08:25.656 --> 00:08:27.030
Then, we had a
management meeting

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.580
talking about the game,
obviously, the weekend.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.980
Would you believe a lot
of the international stars

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.860
would come to me on a
regular basis and say, Enda,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.299
I'm not confident.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.390
Please, can you help
me in my confidence.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.520
But yet in the corporate
world, we very, very seldomly

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.159
get gentlemen to come
to us to say they

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.540
need work on their confidence.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.730
Women will come to us
a lot more regularly.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.680
They knock on the
door and say, listen,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.970
I don't have enough
confidence as a manager.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.862
I actually am not confident
enough now in my current role.

00:08:56.862 --> 00:08:58.320
I don't know if
I'm confident I can

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.230
continue to grow in this
organization-- and so on.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.940
So in this session,
hopefully, we'll

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.740
give you a snapshot into how
you can improve your confidence.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.240
But I would like you to think
about-- imagine that everybody

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.450
in this room for the next
12 months fully committed

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.300
to your potential.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.890
What would be the
impact personally?

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.700
What would be the
impact in terms

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.887
of your professional life?

00:09:18.887 --> 00:09:20.970
What would be the impact
in terms of your friends?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.545
What would be the impact in
terms of getting the most out

00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:25.920
of your life, even getting
the most out of your weekends?

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.378
Would you agree
with me that if you

00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:28.890
did that, you'd
have dramatic impact

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.940
on all aspects of your life?

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.398
Would you strongly
agree with that?

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:33.782
Just raise your hands and
clap your hands vigorously

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:34.740
if you agree with that.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.240
Go.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.150
[CLAPPING]

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.410
Faster, faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster, faster,

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.775
faster, faster.

00:09:42.775 --> 00:09:43.515
Cut!

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:44.640
So that's what we're about.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.020
We're about helping you
unlock your potential.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.220
And again, I don't know about
you ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.220
but I would guess that if you're
here, by this time next year,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.679
you're going to
have to go to here.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.344
If you're a bit more
experienced and you

00:09:57.344 --> 00:09:59.380
feel like you're here,
by this time next year,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.660
you're going to
have to go to there.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.910
And maybe if you're here
and you think you've arrived

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.287
or you've started to arrive,
I bet you you'll probably

00:10:06.287 --> 00:10:08.370
have to go back to that--
whether it's you're just

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.860
about to have your first
child, whether it's you're just

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.980
about to change role, whether
it's you're going to say,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.720
I really need to
look after my body.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.490
I really need to look
after my body now.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.380
I'm up here in terms of where
I am in my professional life,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.590
but I'm down here in terms
of my physical fitness

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.430
and well-being.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.930
If you can relate
to that, can I ask

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.240
you to jump up and
clap at the same time.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.010
Go.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.830
[CLAPPING]

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.660
Excellent.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.550
Take a seat quickly!

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.620
So in terms of mindset,
we're going to give you

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.760
a quick masterclass in mindset.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.420
And rather than me talking
at you and preaching at you,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.690
let's do the opposite.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.300
I'm going to ask you
in groups of twos

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.790
with the guy or the girl
sitting alongside you,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.490
just discuss three
things for me, please.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.230
Number one, how would you
rate your mindset out of 10?

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.770
10 out of 10 is the best
it possibly could be.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.050
9 out of 10 is your mindset
actually is holding you

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.190
back significantly.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.270
We actually call that
mindset sabotage.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.050
OK?

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.360
Number two, please
talk about someone

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.910
who inspires you in life
in terms of mindset,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.460
whether that's an amazing
female actress, whether that's

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.220
your mother, whether that
is perhaps your girlfriend,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.989
or whatever.

00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:16.780
Please talk about
somebody who inspires you

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.340
in mindset, number two.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.090
And the last thing I want you
to speak about very quickly

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.610
is, what's the
single biggest thing

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.904
holding your mindset back.

00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:27.820
You must discuss all
that in about 60 seconds.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.960
So please, go to work.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.460
Go.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.925
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.840
ENDA MCNULTY: Really, really
love your energy, guys.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.490
Love your energy,
love your enthusiasm.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.850
Have any of you ever heard
something in the last five

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.580
or 10 or 15 years, and you can
remember almost every word that

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.080
was said?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.690
And for some reason, that
impact or that session,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.240
or that experience had a
very inspirational impact

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.930
on your life?

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.179
Hands up if you can relate
to that over the last five,

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:02.790
or 10, or 15 years, please.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.430
Well, let's imagine that if this
session was like that for you

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.000
and your personal life
or your professional life

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.660
in the next five or 10 or 15
years, that will mean everybody

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.630
would need to be incredibly
tuned and incredibly,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.790
let's say, engaged from
an energy point of view.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.200
Is that OK to ask?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.900
So we're going to
run pretty fast,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.650
but then we're going
to slow it right down

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.191
and, hopefully, make
an impact on you

00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.430
in terms of your potential.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.895
I wonder if you were to
think about mindset--

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.150
will you think about
something challenging

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.275
in your personal life,
would you say it's something

00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:33.339
challenging at work?

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:34.380
Or where would you start?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.990
I'm going to start by
telling your story.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.460
I'm from Northern Ireland,
just across the border.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.760
I'm about probably five
miles across the border

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.190
into Northern Ireland,
brought up there, obviously

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.880
my whole life.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.796
And then, eventually, I
moved into Dublin here

00:12:49.796 --> 00:12:51.140
about 10 years ago.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.860
And when I was a
child, for some reason

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:58.170
I was stunned brushing my
teeth at the bathroom window,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.150
looking into the mirror,
brushing my teeth--

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.510
nice and calm, nice and
relaxed as a little boy.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.880
And for some reason, I got
the sense in my stomach, shit,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.230
there's something
not right here.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.150
Don't know why.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.840
But almost a second sense
or this sixth sense--

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.860
something not right.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.960
And as I was brushing my teeth,
next thing [SMACK] The window

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.680
that I was brushing
my teeth into--

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.690
and the mirror smashed
all over my face.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.740
And I can remember
having glass under my--

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.410
and going, what the hell
is out there happening?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.750
It was a bomb attack.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.180
The Irish Republican Army had
planted a bomb beside my house

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.274
at home and blew the
windows into smithereens

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.940
and the glass literally
was in my mouth.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.150
And I was taking
the toothbrush out

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.860
of my mouth, spitting into the
sink, with blood in the sink--

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.584
what the hell is
out there happening?

00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:48.000
This is actually
the image of what

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.110
happened that particular day.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.644
The Irish Republican Army
had killed British soldiers.

00:13:52.644 --> 00:13:54.060
We won't be getting
into politics.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.900
Don't worry.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.300
But that particular day,
they killed British soldiers

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.640
just very close to
my house and home--

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.340
and a really, really
bad bomb attack.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.330
But that's not the
important part.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.380
The important part is, I walked
into the corridor of the home.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.630
We have a big, long corridor--
a bit like the corridor

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.870
through the middle of
where you guys are sitting.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.230
And I walked in and next thing,
I can hear my little sister

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.230
Emer screaming, Sarah!

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.530
My older sister had
already left for school

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.910
and had been outside the house.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.300
Screaming, Sarah!

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.570
Screaming.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.710
She was inconsolable--
screaming, and shouting,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.710
and ranting, and raving.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.350
And next thing, Sarah ran back
towards the house-- thankfully,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.436
Sarah was OK--

00:14:33.436 --> 00:14:34.560
ran back towards the house.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.440
But all I can remember
was her lower legs--

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.660
blood running down
her lower legs.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.270
For whatever reason, the
shrapnel from the bomb

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.760
had hit her lower legs, and
she had a little bit of blood

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.220
on our lower legs.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.230
I remember my mother.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.540
My mother was in the house,
and she remained ice cool--

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.620
completely calm,
completely resilient,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.280
completely compassionate,
completely caring.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.854
Everybody else in the house
was going crazy, frantic--

00:15:04.854 --> 00:15:05.520
what's going on?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.302
What's happening?

00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:08.260
The windows were shattered
in around the house.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.810
Everybody in the
house-- my father,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.610
my sisters, my
brothers-- all gone

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.530
frantic-- screaming
and worrying.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.850
She literally never
blinked her eyes--

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.324
ice cool, resilient,
caring, and compassionate.

00:15:21.324 --> 00:15:22.990
She says, get a seat
in the living room.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.540
The living room is a small room
in the middle of the house.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.450
The window wasn't broken.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.806
Sit down there on the couch.

00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:30.055
She went and offered me a tea.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.850
She brought the tea in as
if was any other Sunday.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.031
She brought the tea in as
any Irish mummy would do--

00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:36.780
brought the tea in,
and sat us all around,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.961
and said, calm down.

00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:38.460
It's OK.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.967
Calm down.

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:41.550
Put the TV on in the
background to see

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.050
if there was anything starting
to come through on the news

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.133
flash, or whatever it was.

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.830
That was well before
CNN and Sky Sports.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.290
Sat us all down, 15 minutes
later, she says to me--

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.390
and I'll never forget it--

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.230
Enda, have you got
football during the day?

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.800
Yeah.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.040
Mommy, yeah, yeah.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.234
Go and get your bag.

00:15:58.234 --> 00:15:59.400
What do you mean get my bag?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.600
Well, I'm not going--

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.770
You're going to school.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.514
Get your gag.

00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:04.430
So she says, and go and
get your football bag.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.340
Go and get your schoolbag.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.090
Your father's going
to take you to school.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.940
So my father drove us to school.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.100
And that day, at
about 3:30, we were

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.470
training for football
like any other day.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.155
My mother in that
little instance--

00:16:15.155 --> 00:16:17.850
it was only probably
three to four minutes--

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.070
gave us a lifelong
lesson in how resilient

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.520
we can train ourselves
to become in adversity--

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.250
on how the impact
of your mindset

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.810
can impact everything
in your life,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.770
even in a very
difficult, challenging,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.750
adverse environment.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.030
The vast majority of
people aren't even

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.570
tapping into a tenth
of a resilience

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.520
and a tenth of a kid belief
from a mindset point of view.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.020
So that little
story, even though it

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.380
was a very short,
little occurrence,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.930
inspired me for the
rest of my life.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.590
My mother still is very healthy.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.329
She's still an incredible woman.

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:55.370
And she still inspires me
and the local community

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.500
in terms of their potential.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.210
She was a teacher.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.810
She spent 35 years of her
life teaching young kids--

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.210
whether it was in English
language or English literature.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.584
But most importantly,
I think she

00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:09.602
was a teacher of how you
unlock your potential.

00:17:09.602 --> 00:17:11.060
So I'm going to
devote and dedicate

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.829
this session to my mother.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.300
Please stay tuned.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.188
Tackle.

00:17:15.188 --> 00:17:17.060
[COLLECTIVE ROAR]

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.414
Ireland are much sharper than
South Africa, very clearly.

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:20.914
Engage.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.180
OK.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.050
So you might say, but Enda,
that's a really grinding story.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.500
I wanted to grind you in that.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.790
Let's make it a
bit more positive.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.550
This is a picture of
my friend [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.130
who's featured very firmly
in the book "Commit."

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.324
He spent 25 years in New
York City as a fireman.

00:17:43.324 --> 00:17:45.490
I know a lot of you are in
leadership and management

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.073
roles, and I've been inspired
by a lot of leaders and managers

00:17:48.073 --> 00:17:49.340
in business.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.740
But to be honest with
you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.530
I have never met
anybody who's even

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.750
close to this gentleman
in terms of leading

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.960
and inspiring--
never even close.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.206
He learned his trade in
the Bronx in New York City.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.580
If you're in the
Bronx and you're

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.170
ahead and downtown in an
unbelievable, cohesive unit

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.620
in a fire engine, and you're
heading downtown expecting

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.890
to come across really
big challenges,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.770
you're going to learn
leadership and pretty quickly.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.300
In my Gaelic
football career, I'm

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.810
lucky to have been coached
by him for about five years.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.270
He treated everybody equally.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.580
He challenged us every
day to be at our best.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.980
He challenged us every day
to bring our best energy

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.269
and bring our A-game.

00:18:31.269 --> 00:18:33.310
He challenged us to be
better leaders, and better

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.850
footballers, or a better men
as well as better [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.140
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.730
How many of you think that
if you had somebody like that

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.560
in your life, it would
significantly allow

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.870
you to unlock your potential?

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.220
Pretty important.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.230
If you're in a leadership
role, that's your role.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.550
Your role is to help other
people unlock their potential.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.320
Your role is to help
inspire other people.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.944
I don't mean at an
offsite once a year.

00:18:56.944 --> 00:18:59.424
I know Google do offsites
better than anybody.

00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:00.840
And I don't mean
at a Google talk.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.600
I mean on an ongoing basis,
your role is to inspire people.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.760
[INAUDIBLE] is now
76 years of age.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.290
He is still winning medals.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.330
Billy from County [INAUDIBLE]
is 84 years of age.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.790
He's still winning medals.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.520
These guys' mindset
is incredible--

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.990
always growing, always
learning, always stretching

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.660
the boundaries, always
thinking-- can they get fitter,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.760
can they improve, can
they improve their brain,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.290
can they improve their body.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.160
What about you guys
in the audience?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.840
Do you think you can improve?

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.440
Because I would bet you
everybody in this audience

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.830
in the next 12 months, whether
you're 30, whether you're 25,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.500
whether you're 40,
whether you're 45,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.810
we're going to have a
lot of mountains ahead.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.310
Whether it's
mountains in our jobs,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.260
whether it's mountains
in our personal lives,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.870
whether it's mountains in
terms or financial scenarios,

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.460
whether it's
mountains physically,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.460
we're going to be encountering
those in the next 12, 24 months

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:54.960
and beyond.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.440
The research says we're
going to meet adversely

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.954
about every seven weeks.

00:19:58.954 --> 00:20:00.870
We normally say you're
going to meet adversity

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.389
about every seven days.

00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:03.930
Let's give you the
skills to know how

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.330
to deal with that adversity.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.870
So if you think about what
is the definition of mindset,

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.280
in 30 seconds with the guy
or the girl on your left,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.250
your right, define
what mindset means.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.036
Go.

00:20:16.036 --> 00:20:19.410
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:26.880
ENDA MCNULTY: So no, this isn't
coming up for whatever reason

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.463
on the screen.

00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:30.030
I want you all at the same
time as me to scream this out

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.690
in unison.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.620
Is that OK?

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.080
Mindset is-- let me start here.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.590
Here we go.

00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:37.663
AUDIENCE: A set of beliefs
or a way of thinking

00:20:37.663 --> 00:20:41.287
that determines one's behavior,
outlook, and mental attitude.

00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:43.980
ENDA MCNULTY: That's a pretty
profound definition of mindset,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.820
isn't it?

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.470
Think about the significance
of that in your life-- over 20,

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.740
30, 40, 50, 60 years.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.930
If you get your
mindset right, imagine,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.760
therefore you get
your beliefs right;

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.360
therefore you get
your thinking right;

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.870
therefore you get your behavior
right, your outlook right,

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.297
and your mental attitude right.

00:20:59.297 --> 00:21:00.630
But let's flip that on its head.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.350
What have you got wrong?

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.600
I don't want to talk about it.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600
Let's keep this session
really, really positive.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.220
Let's keep it on getting
it very much right.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.730
And please imagine this is that
classroom that my mother taught

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.050
in in Northern Ireland.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.384
If you get your mindset
right, we get our--

00:21:15.384 --> 00:21:16.248
AUDIENCE: Attitude.

00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:17.753
ENDA MCNULTY: Get our
attitude right, we get our--

00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:18.328
AUDIENCE: Behavior.

00:21:18.328 --> 00:21:20.430
ENDA MCNULTY: Get your behavior
right, please all in unison,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.880
we get our--

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:20.970
AUDIENCE: Actions.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.860
ENDA MCNULTY: We get our
actions right, we get our--

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.610
AUDIENCE: Results.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.670
ENDA MCNULTY: So most
companies focus on results most

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.480
of the time--

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.760
[INAUDIBLE] results,
sales results.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.330
I'm bored.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.350
What am I talking about mindset?

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.060
What about uncovering
somebody's mindset?

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.560
What about unlocking
their mindset

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.020
and therefore imagine the
results the team can achieve.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.930

And I'm using that
one as a funny one,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.160
but maybe that's a more
important way of finding out

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.960
how you're doing at home, never
mind how you're doing at work.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.918
How many of you can relate
to that one, please?

00:28:55.918 --> 00:28:58.990
Seek and hunt for feedback,
coaching, and mentoring?

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.600
Hands up-- how many in
the audience have a coach?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.267
That's not even a
third of the audience.

00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:05.933
The rest of you are
basically telling me

00:29:05.933 --> 00:29:07.600
you don't really
value your improvement

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.752
and your development.

00:29:08.752 --> 00:29:10.210
How many of the
Irish rugby players

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.084
would it be acceptable
to say they don't have

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:15.310
a coach, or Novak Djokovic
not to have a coach,

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.420
or [INAUDIBLE] not to have a
coach, or maybe even someone

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.030
like Oprah not to have a coach.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.910
What do you think?

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.120
Or Madonna not to
have a voice coach.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.450
What do you think?

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.850
It's pretty important, isn't it?

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.810
AUDIENCE: It's different,
though, in a sporting

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.679
environment because you have so
many coaches available to you.

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:34.220
Whereas in the
corporate environment,

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.025
you have to seek
out that person.

00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:37.650
And it's harder to
seek out that person

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.987
unless you go outside
your profession

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:41.570
and you have to pay
a lot for someone.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.320
ENDA MCNULTY: Aislinn
Connolly is probably

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.532
one of the best camogie
players in Ireland.

00:29:45.532 --> 00:29:47.240
Give her a big round
of applause, please.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.330
So Aislinn is right.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.310
It is easier in sports.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.099
But guys, that's
exactly the point--

00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:55.140
differentiate yourselves.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.070
Go and get a coach.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.604
I don't mean get
a coach in here.

00:29:57.604 --> 00:29:58.770
But get a coach out of here.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.020
But find a coach who's going
to help you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.067
You don't have to pay.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:03.900
Find somebody on your
team who can coach you

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.858
and you can coach them.

00:30:04.858 --> 00:30:06.180
Develop your coaching skills.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.740
Upgrade your thinking.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.770
Take risks and see
failure as necessary.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.269
I guess that's one
of the big things

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:12.590
about your culture in general.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.270
Do something once a week that
scares the life out of you.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.405
We've actually been testing
you in this session.

00:30:17.405 --> 00:30:19.530
Are you willing to do little
things that scare you,

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.050
and challenge you, and help
you grow your comfort zones?

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.710
And then, obviously, move
towards growth mindset?

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.690
Continuous reading--
even Warren Buffett

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.134
talks about five hours a day.

00:30:29.134 --> 00:30:31.550
I know all you guys are doing
five hours a day of reading.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.600
I know you are.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.600
Absolutely.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.659
Development and obviously
learning-- tackle.

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:39.413
[COLLECTIVE ROAR]

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.170
So what I want to
challenge you on is,

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.896
I'm going to challenge you
that in the next seven days,

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:48.270
everybody in the audience is
going to have an experiment.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.853
One aspect of your experiment
is going to be a growth mindset.

00:30:50.853 --> 00:30:53.280
So if your friend says to you,
let's go to salsa dancing,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.196
you don't go-- no, no,
no, I haven't got time.

00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:55.909
Go.

00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:58.200
Or if your friends says,
let's start the gym next week,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.500
and let's do a really
good six weeks between now

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.550
and Christmas--

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.750
yeah, I'm on for it.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.690
Not, well, actually.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.120
I'm working late this evening.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.010
Let's say another one
of your friends says,

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.900
let's make sure we
do that Mark Pollock

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.540
5k run in the dark that's only
in about two or three weeks

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.110
time.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.010
Let's do it for charity.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.230
Let's do it with our friends.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.910
And let's do with
some family members.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:17.190
Right?

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.090
Say, I'm on for it.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.320
Growth mindset.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.111
I'm going to challenge
you in the next week

00:31:21.111 --> 00:31:23.580
as well in every interaction
you have with your manager,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.500
or with your boss, or
maybe with your team.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.530
Say, can you give me feedback?

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.160
How did I do today?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.931
Really important question.

00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:32.430
I wouldn't talk
about the people who

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.290
are very fortunate to have
worked with over the last 20

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:34.930
years.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.000
But I would say there's one
big thing they have in common.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.140
They're constantly
looking for feedback--

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.670
the best of the best to them.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.836
Whether it's the eye surgeon,
whether it's the elite

00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:47.490
superstar soccer player, whether
it's the world-class golfer,

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.450
or maybe it's the young
superstar female teacher

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.550
who's incredible in getting
opportunities all over

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.190
the world to go and
teach other teachers--

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.990
they're constantly
seeking feedback.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.100
So please, can we ask you
to start on that journey

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.980
in the next week?

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.640
Moving swiftly forward,
if this lands on green,

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.960
you guys will do jump jacks.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.330
If it lands on red, you
guys are going to do boxing.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.200
If it lands on yellow, you're
going to be doing squat jumps.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.380
And if it lands on
blue, you're going

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.884
to do what I call
a "stork stance."

00:32:17.884 --> 00:32:19.050
I want to test your balance.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.130
Is that clear enough?

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.339
Yes, Mr. Waters, let's get
the music on, ready to go.

00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:24.838
So whatever the color is, I'm
going to give you an exercise.

00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:25.530
We all ready?

00:32:28.332 --> 00:32:30.540
Orange-- everybody on your
feet, running on the spot.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.290
Go quickly.

00:32:35.074 --> 00:32:35.574
Faster!

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.810
Faster.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.450
Take a seat quickly!

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.852
Good!

00:32:46.852 --> 00:32:48.685
This one here I know
what it's going to be--

00:32:48.685 --> 00:32:51.960
blue shadowboxing
with a partner.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.041
Shadowboxing.

00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:53.541
Go.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.370
We're very fortunate that in
the last couple of months,

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.380
one of the companies
brought us to Costa Rica

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.880
to work with their
global leadership

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.979
team for a full week.

00:33:08.979 --> 00:33:11.520
They said the global leadership
team was actually burned out.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.240
And they wanted to spend a
full week rejuvenating them.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.114
I bet you there's people
in this audience who

00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:18.582
in the last year or two have
felt as if you're burned out.

00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:20.540
I bet you some of you
know people in your teams

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.090
that are burned out.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.580
I bet some of you know
people in your families

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.870
that have been burned out.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.690
And in Costa Rica, we got the
most incredible inspiration

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.419
about energy and wellness.

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.210
I'm going to try and
get that across to you

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.280
in about three minutes.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.500
It's Sesame Street simple.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.970
In Costa Rica, they talk
about moving naturally.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.630
Going to the gym once a
day isn't good enough.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.260
We need to build movement into
our days-- our every days.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.450
We need to be up and
moving constantly

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.670
if we want to live
long, healthy lives.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.200
That is scientifically
proven, guys.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.680
Whether you absolutely
believe in science

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.000
or you don't, that's
a different story.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.580
That's related to your mindset.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.520
We need to exercise every single
day, whether it's in the gym

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.660
or whether it's a run.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.720
But we also need to move
every single day constantly--

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.700
number one.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.990
Number two, and your food
at Google is incredible.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.739
But the only problem
with being incredible

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:09.949
is you eat a lot of it--

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.560
eat incredibly
well, but eat less.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.710
Don't fill your stomachs
up constantly-- number two.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.070
Number three, sleep is the
number one silver bullet it

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.600
in your health
and your wellness.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.330
Number one, how many of you
need to improve the quality

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.230
and the quantity of your sleep?

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.639
Hands up nice and high.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.910
It's a corporate epidemic.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:30.409
People are not
sleeping well enough.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.120
It's a major, major issue.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.650
By the way, your sleep is
related to how much you move

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.800
and, of course,
how well you eat.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.909
Stress is a secret killer.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.190
One of our colleagues
is a cardiac surgeon

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.530
who says the single
biggest issue

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:50.190
he has every single day in
performing surgery isn't food.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.790
It isn't a lack of exercise,
or smoking, or alcohol.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.889
It's people in the
corporate world who

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.870
are not dealing with stress.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.760
If he can relate to
that, please can ask you

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.382
to have a big deep sigh for me.

00:35:01.382 --> 00:35:03.330
[SIGHS]

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:04.419
It's a big issue.

00:35:04.419 --> 00:35:05.960
And it's not Google's
responsibility.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.160
It's your responsibility
to manage stress.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.830
There's a lot of young guys
and girls in the audience.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.996
And the guys and girls in
the audience not so young,

00:35:11.996 --> 00:35:14.360
a bit like me, we need to
manage our own stress--

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.760
take 100% responsibility.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.552
And then, alcohol--

00:35:17.552 --> 00:35:19.134
I know you guys don't
drink at Google.

00:35:19.134 --> 00:35:21.120
I don't need to talk
about that one obviously.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.786
So I'm going to try
to actually give you

00:35:22.786 --> 00:35:24.380
a quick masterclass into that.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.719
Is that fair enough?

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:27.260
I had you doing the
boxing earlier on

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.120
and you were all sort of going
through the motions-- what's

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.977
all this about?

00:35:29.977 --> 00:35:32.060
I'm going to show you what
happens if you actually

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.460
get yourself fully
engaged in your life

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.040
if you do all these
things incredibly well.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.874
Can I ask you to do a
little gentle stretch?

00:35:38.874 --> 00:35:40.248
Just roll your

00:35:40.248 --> 00:35:41.570
We're going to go to Rocky now.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.450
Roll your shoulders
forward, nice and gently,

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.350
and roll your shoulders back.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:48.480
Head to the left and head to the
right, up towards the ceiling,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.700
down towards your navel.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.200
Can I ask you to
jog nice and gently

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.366
with your feet on the floor?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.630
A bit faster.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.966
Bit faster.

00:35:58.966 --> 00:36:01.090
So where you're sitting,
can I ask you to be boxing

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.060
as you're sitting down?

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.560

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.460
Faster.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.790
Faster.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.977
Just ease off for a second.

00:36:08.977 --> 00:36:11.310

want you bringing your best

figure that out yourself.

OK.

You're too busy to

I'll never forget 25 years
ago, almost to the day,

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:12.950
a teacher in Northern
Ireland, again,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.310
stood up and said something in
an old basketball gym to all

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.014

a boys school--

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.950
OK?

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.510
But he said something that
had a profound impact on me

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.551
for the rest of the life.

00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:45.050
He said, health is the
crown on well people's head

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.870
that nobody sees
other than the sick.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.380
That's a pretty big
statement, isn't it.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.550
Health is the crown
on well people's head

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.800
that nobody sees
other than the sick.

In other words, we don't really
appreciate it until it's gone--

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.670

We're losing it badly.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.210
We don't need very
advanced technology.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.890
All we need is simple
technology-- a skipping rope,

a cattle bell at home, a
bicycle to work in the morning,

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.010

scales, great food.

five top tips in this capacity

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.910
and the five top
tips are grounded

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.570
in the best practice in the
world in terms of longevity,

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.850
but also in terms of wellness.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.680
Top tip one, you
need to eat well--

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.480
90% of the time.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.810
Top tip two, you need to be
exercising five times a week

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.530
for a minimum of 35 minutes,
and you need to move constantly.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.440
Top tip number three
is, your sleep--

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.600
as we say in
high-performance sport--

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.485
your sleep is the
secret silver bullet.

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:42.860
If you're not
getting your sleep,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.350

other aspects of performance

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.460
and your health.

look at this anymore.

stress better?

let's say in 2017 in November,

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.610
you're standing here and
you're thinking about what

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.007
does the future hold for you.

Are you going to stay in

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.650
Are you going to go
start your own company?

Are you going to
be really healthy?

00:41:19.108 --> 00:41:22.510
Or perhaps, are you not
so sure about your future?

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.260
Three of the big lessons
I would be giving

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.930
to you all in principles would
be, number one, your mindset

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.756
is going to be critical
as you go on this journey.

00:41:29.756 --> 00:41:31.380
Make sure you've got
the right mindset.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.790
It's a bit like having the
right equipment with you here

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.610
as you go on your journey.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.610
Number two, if you if you
don't have the energy,

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.193
you're not going to
be able to climb--

00:41:39.193 --> 00:41:40.310
nice and simple.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.710
And you only have energy by
doing the physical exercise--

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.170
by eating well, by sleeping
well, by hydrating well,

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.980
and so on.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.470
If you don't have the energy,
you don't have the capacity,

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.785
as we say it, to do work.

00:41:49.785 --> 00:41:51.910
Whether that's work climbing
through the mountains,

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.995
or whether that's
work on relationships,

00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:55.010
or whether that's work
on COs, or whether that's

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:58.910
work on your technology,
let's say, challenges--

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.260
you need energy to do work.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.300
The more energy you
have, the more capacity.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.720
you have to do work.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.835
The less energy you
have, the less capacity

00:42:07.835 --> 00:42:09.840
you have to do work.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.500
I interviewed a girl
recently and she says,

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.665
I've got loads of energy.

00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:15.290

passion for the--

There's nobody in the

They just haven't found
their purpose yet.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.687
Does that make sense to you?

00:42:30.687 --> 00:42:33.020
If you're not motivated,
there's nothing wrong with you.

You just haven't
found your purpose.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.086
If you find your purpose,
you'll find passion,

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.490
and you'll find energy.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.959

your Google goals.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.090
Maybe you had unbelievable
weekend away with your friends

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.490

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.540
a once in a lifetime.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.700

to get in groups of fives,

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.130
but you must get your teams to
look like, sound like, and move

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.220
like a high-performance team.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.540
It could be boxers, or rowers,
or swimmers, or cyclers,

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:45.780
but you must get them to move
like, sound like, be like,

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.010
and almost look like a
high-performance team.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.680

So guys, what I
would say to you is,

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.450
imagine that, for the next
week, everybody in this room

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.900
made a commitment to
challenge yourself

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.409
on mindset continually.

00:47:14.409 --> 00:47:16.200
Whether it's getting
feedback, whether it's

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.850
when you walking
to a meeting, go,

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.170
I'm going to try to be at
my best in this meeting.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.211
Whether it's when you're
in the gym this evening,

00:47:22.211 --> 00:47:24.150
you try and bring your
best energy in the gym,

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.240
rather than just in
another gym session.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.850
Imagine the next week you only
seek to eat good, quality food,

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.680
and you only seek
to make sure you're

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.357
having lots of water on board--

00:47:33.357 --> 00:47:34.940
obviously, even if
you're socializing.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:35.814
Does that make sense?

00:47:35.814 --> 00:47:38.530
So have your few drinks, but
drink lots of water as well.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.080
Imagine the next
week that you make

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.760
sure that you start to think
about your long-term goals

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.410
for 2018, 2019
and beyond, right?

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.800
Imagine the next week you
challenge yourself vigorously

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.420
to go and get a coach.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.880
I don't care whether you get
it internally or externally.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.530
And finally in
the next week, you

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.620
create what I call a map-- a
massive action plan about how

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.300
to unlock your potential.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.147

never mind in a year,

scream yes in your language.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.580

massive action in
terms of your energy,

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.285
and your fitness, and your
well-being; and massive action

00:48:35.285 --> 00:48:38.170
in terms of actually have
a big, long-term goal,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.800
and therefore a mission that
you're chasing hard after?

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.750
Because it's much easier
to motivate yourself

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.160
when you know what that is.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.537
That is my simple
call to action.

But you're going to do it
in a very creative way.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.010
It could be a high five.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.150
It could be a low five.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.552
It could be jumping up
and double high five.

00:49:08.552 --> 00:49:11.010
But you're must do it with
every single person in the room.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.620
Bring your best energy, and
bring a little bit of fun,

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.870
a little bit of flair, and
a little bit of creativity.
