00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.139
The Celestial Message in a Bottle

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.600
Imagine for a moment that it’s 40,000 years
in the future in a solar system far, far,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.950
away on a planet thriving with intelligent
life.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.800
Extraterrestrial beings inhabit this place.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.349
Perhaps they look like the cuddly ET, the
blob, ALF, or maybe even like the dreadlocked

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.550
beings from Predator; but either way, they
are not human.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.269
An approaching speck in space catches the
beings’ eyes (assuming they have them).

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.419
Upon sending a craft to retrieve it, they
find a probe containing a disk.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.190
Using instructions on the disk, they manage
to play it.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.229
What they are about to hear and see are the
sounds and images from an ancient alien civilization

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.850
– 1977 Earth.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.370
Flashback about 40 millenia to Cornell University
in Ithaca, New York, Earth in January, 1977.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.510
A brilliant, 43 year old professor named Carl
Sagan is the director of the Laboratory of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.030
Planetary Studies there.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.090
In 1975, he had won the Pulitzer Prize for
his book “The Dragons of Eden,” a dissertation

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.680
on the evolution of human intelligence.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.900
He helped shape the field of exobiology, the
study of the potential for life on other planets.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.920
Sagan had also been a key adviser for NASA
dating all the way back to its earliest days.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.970
Working out of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, California as a visiting scientist,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590
he helped design and manage several space
exploration missions, including the Mariner

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.540
2’s trip to Venus and Viking one &amp; two’s
trips to Mars.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.950
Also, in the late 1950s, he was involved in
a plan the U.S. had to nuke the moon.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.560
So, when Dr. Sagan received a call to come
to the JPL once again to help NASA, this wasn’t

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.780
out of the ordinary.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.600
But this wasn’t an ordinary mission.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.480
In August of 1977, NASA planned on launching
twin unmanned space probes called Voyager

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.170
1 &amp; Voyager 2.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.040
The probes’ original mission was to explore
and take pictures of the giants of our solar

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.660
system, Jupiter, Saturn, plus all of their
moons.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.440
There was also a hope that if the probe’s
instruments continued to operate, the probes

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.160
could do the same with Uranus and Neptune.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.560
Due to “a rare geometric arrangement of
the outer planets” that only happens every

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.410
175 years, all four planets were positioned
perfectly so that a probe launched into space

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.820
at the proper angle, time, and speed would
be able to pass all of them.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.530
Pluto was never part of the mission due to
it being elsewhere in its orbit and not part

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.460
of this geometric arrangement.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.170
The probes were built to last five years,
but there was considerable optimism, that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.180
has since proved founded, that they would
last many years more.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.250
There was also a possible additional mission-
if all went as planned and they were able

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.210
to carry it out, they would be the first Earth
crafts to leave our solar system and become

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.540
interstellar travelers.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.770
This is what NASA wanted Dr. Sagan for.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.260
In less than nine months, NASA wanted Dr.
Sagan to compile a team and devise a message

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.080
in case of contact with an extraterrestrial
civilization outside of our solar system,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.510
a message that needed to convey what life
was like on Earth and be relatively easily

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.880
understood by those who receive it.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.660
Now, the chances of the probes ever being
found, detected, or recovered by an extraterrestrial

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.130
civilization are incredibly small.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.240
The probes are the size of a small car which
doesn’t even register as a blip in the vastness

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.240
of the universe.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.090
For that matter, the Milky Way itself is barely
a blip on that scale.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.270
Additionally, the probes wouldn’t even reach
another planetary system until around 40,000

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.270
years into the future.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.290
At that point, Voyager 1 will be nearing Gliese
445 and Voyager 2 will be close to Ross 248.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.850
Nevertheless, it was decided such a message
should be included, just in case.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.930
The decision was made pretty early on that
whatever was sent up there needed to showcase

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.620
Earth – the sights and sounds of our home
planet.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.620
It had to be a “cultural Noah’s Ark with
a shelf life of hundreds of millions of years.”

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.640
Now, the question was what sights and sounds
exactly?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.560
To answer this question, Dr. Sagan compiled
his team.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.599
Dr. Frank Drake worked with Sagan on the Pioneer
plaque in 1972, which among other things included

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.840
the location of Earth, mapping it out via
pulsars.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.360
Ann Druyan was a friend of Sagan’s (later,
his wife) and a young scientific novelist.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.930
She was put in charge of music selection.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.299
Timothy Ferris (at the time, engaged to Druyan)
was a writer for Rolling Stone and would go

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.740
on to become “the best scientific journalist
of his generation.”

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.340
He helped pick the images that were to be
included.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.849
Jon Lomberg had already been Dr. Sagan’s
artistic collaborator for several years; his

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.639
job was to bring color and artistic beauty
to what the interstellar beings would see.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.330
Finally, there was Linda Sagan, Carl’s wife.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.509
She had created the artwork on the Pioneer
plaque and was to help produce this project.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.029
Their first order of business was to figure
out how they were going to convey this message.

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.349
The receptacle for this kind of message had
to last for thousands of years and be simple

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.349
to play.

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.969
Drake suggested the old-school technology
of a phonographic record.

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.229
It was rather simple to play and as long as
the physical record itself was protected,

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.809
it wouldn’t erode over time.

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:05.319
The etchings on a metallic phonographic record
could last, according to estimations, for

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.629
hundreds of millions of years with very little
degradation.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.449
Additionally, they decided to make it a copper
disk coated in gold, further protecting it

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.180
from magnetic fields and heat, as well as
placing it in a protective aluminum jacket.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.779
Coupled with an included needle and cartridge,
an alien civilization would be able to play

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:23.779
it.

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.979
They also decided to design it to run at 16
2/3 revolutions per minute, as opposed to

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.289
the normal 33 1/3 revolutions.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.190
This was done so that they could jam as many
pictures, music, greetings, and information

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.089
as they could onto the record.

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.039
In order to make sure the aliens knew what
to do with the disk, needle, and cartridge,

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.690
symbols were etched in showing how it was
to be used.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.320
For instance, to make sure they know what
speed to rotate the record at, this is etched

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.089
in binary arithmetic expressed as a factor
of the fundamental transition of the hydrogen

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:53.139
atom.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.110
In order to demonstrate how the pictures are
to be decoded and viewed, the upper right

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.150
portion of the cover shows the analog signal
that is the start of the picture, and in binary

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.939
how the first three vertical lines are marked.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.009
They further show how many vertical lines
to a picture.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.750
On the face is also a carefully chosen picture
of the first picture on the record, for calibration

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.750
purposes.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.280
Next, and possibly the most arduous task,
was to determine what exactly would be on

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.440
this record.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.129
The team wanted the golden record to represent
what life was like on Earth; the sights, sounds,

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.909
and feelings we encounter everyday.

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:32.960
After much deliberation, 115 images encoded
in analog form (including a picture of DNA,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.220
human anatomy, Olympic sprinters, an African
hut, and a diagram of vertebrate evolution)

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.550
and an audio “track list” with greetings,
sounds, and music were included.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.009
The audio portion began with “Greetings
in 55 languages.”

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.750
The first greeting, in English, was from then-Secretary
General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.590
The rest of the greetings included ones in
Sumerian (“may all be well”), Zulu (“We

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.749
greet you, great ones.

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.949
We wish you longevity”), Czech (“Dear
Friends, we wish you the best.”), and even

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.800
a “whale greeting.”

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.759
The next audio section was known as “sounds
of Earth.”

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.949
They included things like a baby crying, a
volcano erupting, birds calling, and a train

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.169
roaring past.

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.240
The last audio section was the music, overseen
by Ann Druyan.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.139
Among the tracks selected for this section
was Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, a Pygmy

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:25.639
girls’ initiation song from Zaire, Peruvian
panpipes and drums, and “Johnny B. Goode,”

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.080
by Chuck Berry.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.849
Noticeably absent was any song from the Beatles.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.550
While the band wanted their hit “Here Comes
the Sun” to be included, they didn’t own

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.680
the rights to their songs.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.169
Their publishing company, EMI, did and they
did not allow it to happen.

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.699
For everything the team included on this golden
record, probably the most unique – and telling

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.939
– inclusion was an EEG brain scan of a young
woman, newly in love.

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:50.229
That woman turned out to be Ann Druyan.

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.749
Druyan had planned on going through “a mental
itinerary of the ideas and individuals of

00:07:54.749 --> 00:08:00.149
history whose memory I hoped to perpetuate,”
as well as thoughts of her fiancé Tim Ferris

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:02.020
while being connected to the EEG.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.080
But two days before the recording, something
extraordinary happened.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.610
She fell in love with Dr. Carl Sagan.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.389
Days before, they had shared a rather intimate
phone call where they ruminated about life

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:14.449
when they both realized they loved one another.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:19.259
They hadn’t had a single date nor a kiss
or even a romantic moment before this, but

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:23.020
they decided to marry, despite them both being
in other relationships.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.449
As described by Druyan herself, “It was
a Eureka! moment for both of us—the idea

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:29.240
that we could find the perfect match.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.959
It was a discovery that has been reaffirmed
in countless ways since.”

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.019
As for the brain scan, she stated,
Earlier I had asked Carl if those putative

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:41.060
extraterrestrials of a billion years from
now could conceivably interpret the brain

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.149
waves of a meditator.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:43.289
‘Who knows?

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.690
A billion years is a long, long time,’ was
his reply.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.819
‘On the chance that it might be possible
why don’t we give it a try?’

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:55.089
Two days after our life-changing phone call,
I entered a laboratory at Bellevue Hospital

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:59.519
in New York City and was hooked up to a computer
that turned all the data from my brain and

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.709
heart into sound.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:04.959
I had a one-hour mental itinerary of the information
I wished to convey.

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:09.130
I began by thinking about the history of Earth
and the life it sustains.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.480
To the best of my abilities I tried to think
something of the history of ideas and human

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.950
social organization.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.480
I thought about the predicament that our civilization
finds itself in and about the violence and

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.470
poverty that make this planet a hell for so
many of its inhabitants.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.680
Toward the end I permitted myself a personal
statement of what it was like to fall in love.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.410
On August 20, 1977 Voyager 2 lifted off into
space.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.259
Voyager 1 joined its twin 16 days later.

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.690
Over the next four years, they explored and
took snapshots of Jupiter and Saturn.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.000
In 1986, Voyager arrived at Uranus.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.959
By 1989, it had passed by Neptune.

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:52.490
Voyager 1 officially entered interstellar
space on August 25, 2012 and as of February

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:58.200
20, 2014, it was 127.25 AU from Earth.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.350
The farthest away of any man-made object.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.500
With perhaps as many as 500 billion galaxies
each with billions of stars (for reference

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.560
the Milky Way has about 300 billion), many
of which have planetary objects orbiting them,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.459
it seems likely enough we’re not alone in
the universe.

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:18.589
The Voyager probes will orbit the Milky Way
indefinitely, so you never know.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:23.170
One of them might encounter an intelligent
alien civilization, maybe even long after

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.360
humans have gone the way of the Dodo bird.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.449
And if that day does come when a Voyager Golden
Record is found, first contact may well be

00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:36.269
dreadlocked Predator-like extraterrestrials
listening to Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:37.269
Good.”

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.810
While it’s a long-shot, as Sagan himself
noted,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.560
“The spacecraft will be encountered and
the record played only if there are advanced

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.270
spacefaring civilizations in interstellar
space.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.420
But the launching of this bottle into the
cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.829
life on this planet.”

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:57.710
Bonus Facts:
• In order to allow the recipients to view

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.709
certain images in color, three consecutive
images were used in these cases, each representing

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:04.430
red, green, and blue.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.000
In order for them to determine whether they
are calibrating it correctly, a picture of

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.850
our sun was included.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.570
Using the pulsar map to locate it, the aliens
should be able to directly compare our sun’s

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.140
exact color (which isn’t yellow by the way,
but rather white in the human visual spectrum)

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.110
with the image included.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.870
• As one could imagine, despite the cute
love story between Dr. Sagan and Ann Druyan,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.889
there were pretty dire consequences due to
their secret marriage.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:33.899
They both decided not to reveal it to their
partners until the project was completed.

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:38.720
But when they eventually did, it led to an
eight year legal battle between Carl and Linda,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.480
longer than it took the Voyagers to pass by
Jupiter.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.829
• The team was able to secure a rather valuable
and heartfelt audio message for the probe

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:49.850
from US President Jimmy Carter.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.600
The message said: “This is a present from
a small distant world, a token of our sounds,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.000
our science, our images, our music, our thoughts,
and our feelings.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.800
We are attempting to survive our time so we
may live into yours.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.810
We hope someday, having solved the problems
we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:15.299
This record represents our hope and our determination,
and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.”
