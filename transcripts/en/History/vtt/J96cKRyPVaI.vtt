00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.130
NARRATOR: Mere
feet from the face

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.630
of an imposing
mountain peak, Morgan

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.300
is adrift without power--

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.800
NARRATOR: --attempting one of
the most dangerous emergency

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.530
maneuvers in a pilot's arsenal.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.100
NARRATOR: The box canyon
turn is a sharp, 180 degree

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.500
about face that can
mean the difference

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.600
between life and death.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.270
NARRATOR: But to turn
on a dime, the pilot

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.100
cuts the engine mid-flight--

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.630
NARRATOR: --putting the plane
at the mercy of the winter winds

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.530
and the pilot's skill.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.870
MORGAN: Oh, it's amazing,
actually, how well that worked

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.970
and how tight of a turn we made.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.330
You could be in a
pretty narrow spot,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.030
and if you commit to this turn,
you could get out of there.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.470
NARRATOR: In an extreme
emergency at this altitude,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.330
the only option may be to touch
down on a mountain ridge--

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.230
NARRATOR: --the only flat
surface for miles around.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.430
But landing here
is a last resort,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030
because the conditions
are impossible to judge

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.370
from the air.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.370
MORGAN: The ski could
strike an obscure rock

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.630
and, obviously, you
could slide off the edge.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.370
MORGAN: You're already--
got a little adrenalin

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.830
going, just landing in general.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.070
When you're landing on a ridge,
that's a whole different game.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.630
MORGAN: There was a little bit
of a cross wind coming over,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.030
and then the skis
just started to drift

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.000
to the right and
we we're starting

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.800
to slide off the other side.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.000
NARRATOR: It's a hard
lesson in what it takes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.570
to become an expert pilot
in the most extreme flying

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.100
conditions on Earth.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.870
MORGAN: You know, it could
have been pretty bad.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.370
Luckily, Arctic
took the airplane,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.600
got us off the ground.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.870
It was pretty
humbling, you know.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.400
That's why you have an
instructor in the plane,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
to help recover when
you do make a mistake.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.130
NARRATOR: But close
call or not, Morgan

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.170
can't quit until he's made the
mountain landing on his own.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.970
MORGAN: After that
flawed landing there,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.370
I'm a little nervous.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.700
That's what I'm here
for, so I'm going

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.630
to try to suck it up and line
up in a better direction,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.100
and try to figure
out what the wind's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.770
doing to land into the wind.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:04:09.870
[ski hitting mountain]

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.100
MORGAN: The bridge
landing was pretty tricky,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.170
but it's good to have
done it now in case

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.800
I absolutely have to sometime.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.330
NARRATOR: It'll take years for
Morgan to master every skill,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.830
but for now, he's
ready to fly solo.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.630
MORGAN: We put a lot of
time and money and effort

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.400
into getting the necessary
skills to fly out here.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.200
I still have a lot
to learn, but now I

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.270
am ready to give it a shot.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.570
It's going to be
pretty exciting.
