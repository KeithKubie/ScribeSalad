00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:01.482
- [Instructor] So we have a type of

00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:03.907
statistical study described here.

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:05.675
I encourage you to pause
this video, read it,

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:06.658
and see if you can figure out,

00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:09.978
is this a sample study, is
it an observational study,

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:11.270
is it an experiment?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.592
And then also think about
what type of conclusions

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.747
can you make based on the
information in this study.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.122
Alright, now let's work on this together.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.987
British researchers were
interested in the relationship

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.830
between farmers' approach to their cows

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.211
and cows' milk yield.

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:30.521
They prepared a survey
questionnaire regarding

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.840
the farmers' perception of
the cows' mental capacity,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.966
the treatment they give to the cows,

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.524
and the cows' yield.

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:41.839
The survey was filled by all
the farms in Great Britain.

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.067
After analyzing their results,
they found that on farms

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:48.710
where cows were called by name, milk yield

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.746
was 258 liters higher on average

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:54.277
than on farms where this was not the case.

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:55.408
Alright, so they're making a connection

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.960
between two variables.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.566
One was whether cows called by name,

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.399
whether,

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:04.494
whether cows named, alright.

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:05.850
Whether

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.265
cows

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:08.849
named

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.485
and this would be a categorical variable

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.446
because for any given farmer

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.473
it's gonna be a yes or a
no, that the cows are named,

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:16.886
and so they're trying to form a connection

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.979
between whether the cows are named, and,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.229
and milk yield.

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:23.528
And this would be a quantitative variable,

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:24.909
'cause you can, you're measuring it

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.866
in terms of number of liters.

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.366
Milk, milk, yield.

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:32.841
Whether we are drawing a connection.

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.429
And they are able to draw
some form a connection.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.287
They're saying, hey when the
cows were called by name,

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:41.870
milk yield was 258
liters higher on average

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:45.675
than on farms where this was not the case.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.239
So first is the thing of what
type of statistical study

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.217
this is, and we could think, okay,

00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:52.803
is this a sample study,

00:01:52.803 --> 00:01:54.195
is this a sample study,

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.859
is this an observational study,

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.830
observational,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.913
or is this an experiment?

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:03.662
Now, a sample study,

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:04.579
experiment,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.303
a sample study, you would
be trying to estimate

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:12.279
a parameter for a broader population.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.241
Here, it's not so much
that they're estimating

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.156
the parameter, they're
trying to see the connection

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:19.173
between two variables, and that

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:21.106
brings us to observational study,

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:23.349
'cause that's what an
observational study is all about.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.116
Can we draw a connection, can we draw

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.320
a positive or a negative correlation

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.693
between variables based on observations?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.505
So we surveyed a population here,

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.646
the farmers in Great Britain,

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:38.427
and we are able to draw some type of

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.616
connection between these variables.

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:43.626
And so this is clearly an observational,

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.409
an observational study.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.229
Now this is not an experiment.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.057
If it was an experiment,
we would take the farmers

00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:53.552
and we would randomly assign
them into one or two groups.

00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:57.920
And in one group we would
say, don't name, no name,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.148
no naming, and in the
other group we would say,

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:01.967
name your cows.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.591
And then we would wait some period of time

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.109
and we would see the
average milk production

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.198
going into the experiment
in the no naming group

00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:09.572
and the naming group,
and then we would see,

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:12.080
we wait some period of
time, six months, a year,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.420
and then we would see the
average milk production

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.750
after either not naming or
naming the cows for six months.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.990
So this is not what occurred here.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.810
Here we just did the survey to everybody

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.406
and we just asked them this question,

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:24.079
and we were able to find this,

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.612
we were able to find this connection

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:27.219
between whether the cows were named

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.432
and the actual milk yield.

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:32.166
So clearly, not an experiment,
this was an observational,

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.889
observational study.

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.269
Now the next thing is,
what can we conclude here?

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.962
We know when, you know, they're telling us

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:39.998
that when the cows were named,

00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:43.230
it looks like there was a 258 liter

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.983
higher yield on average.

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.756
So, the conclusion that
we can strictly make here,

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:50.999
is like, well, for

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.480
for farmers in Great Britain
there's a correlation,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.920
a positive correlation
between whether cows are named

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.735
and the milk yield.

00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:02.165
So that we can say for sure.

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:03.715
So let me write that down.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:05.342
So for Great Britain,

00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:07.925
for, for Great Britain farmers,

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:10.977
Great Britain farmers,

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:13.508
farmers,

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:17.765
we have a positive correlation.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:19.432
Positive correlation

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.816
between naming cows,

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:25.501
between naming

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:29.826
cows

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:32.983
and milk yield.

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:34.233
And milk yield.

00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:37.596
That's pretty much what we can say here.

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:40.561
Now, some people might be
tempted to try to draw causality.

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.025
We'll see this all the
time where you see these

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:44.584
observational studies,
and people try to hint

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.387
that maybe there's a
causal relationship here,

00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:49.113
maybe the naming is actually what makes

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:51.682
the milk yield go up.

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.916
Or maybe it's the other way,

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.473
the cows produce a lot of milk,

00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:56.788
the farmers like them more
and they wanna name them,

00:04:56.788 --> 00:04:59.899
because it's like hey, that's
my high milk producing cow.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.612
So, there's a lot of,

00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:04.022
there's a lot of temptation to say,

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:05.355
you know naming,

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:10.924
that maybe there's a causality
that naming causes more milk,

00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:11.757
more milk,

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:15.949
or that maybe more milk causes naming.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.870
You know, the farmers
really like that cow,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.018
so they start naming them,

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.599
or whatever, whatever it might be.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.663
But you can't make this
causal relationship

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:26.315
based on this observational study.

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:27.381
You might've been able to do it

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:29.687
with a well constructed experiment,

00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:31.480
but not with an observational study.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.441
And that's because there could be some

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:36.938
confounding variable that
is driving both of them.

00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:39.568
So, for example, that confounding variable

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:41.901
might just be a nice farmer.

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:44.791
A nice farmer.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.323
And you know we can define
nice in a lot of ways,

00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:50.043
they're gentle, they,

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:52.720
and a nice farmer is more likely to name,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.805
and a nice farmer's more likely to get,

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:57.977
gets a higher yield.

00:05:57.977 --> 00:05:59.587
And the reason why this
is a confounding variable,

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:01.040
if you were to control for that,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.636
if you just take, well let's
just control for nice farmers

00:06:04.636 --> 00:06:06.116
and then see if naming makes a difference.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.315
It might not make a difference.

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:10.227
If the farmer is, you
know, petting the cows

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.504
and treating them humanely,
and doing other things,

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:14.089
it might not matter whether the,

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.565
whether the farmer names them or not.

00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:19.468
Likewise, if you take
some less nice farmers

00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:21.940
who, you know, hit their cows, and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.927
and they have really inhumane conditions,

00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:24.975
it might not make a difference

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:27.563
whether they name the cows or not.

00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:29.118
And so it's very important that you,

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:30.969
from the observational studies, you might,

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.344
if they're well constructed,
you might be able to make a,

00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:35.904
you might be able to say
there's a correlation,

00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:38.913
but, you won't be able to make a,

00:06:38.913 --> 00:06:42.580
drive a causal, or make
a causal conclusion.
