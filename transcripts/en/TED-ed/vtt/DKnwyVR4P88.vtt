00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.652
Sometime in the early 1750s,

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:13.972
a 22-year-old man named
Benjamin Banneker

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:17.821
sat industriously carving cogs
and gears out of wood.

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.052
He pieced the parts together

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.692
to create the complex inner working
of a striking clock

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:26.079
that would, hopefully, 
chime every hour.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.803
All he had to help him was 
a pocket watch for inspiration

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:32.107
and his own calculations.

00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:34.829
And yet, his careful engineering worked.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.790
Striking clocks had already been
around for hundreds of years,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.898
but Banneker's may have been
the first created in America,

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:46.603
and it drew fascinated visitors from
across the country.

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:48.106
In a show of his brilliance,

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:53.172
the clock continued to chime
for the rest of Banneker's life.

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:57.223
Born in 1731 to freed slaves
on a farm in Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.633
from his earliest days,

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:01.822
the young Banneker was obsessed
with math and science.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:06.492
And his appetite for knowledge only grew
as he taught himself astronomy,

00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:07.852
mathematics,

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:08.932
engineering,

00:01:08.932 --> 00:01:11.623
and the study of the natural world.

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:14.614
As an adult, he used astronomy
to accurately predict

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:16.804
lunar and solar events,

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.754
like the solar eclipse of 1789,

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:24.344
and even applied his mathematical skills
to land use planning.

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:28.594
These talents caught the eye of a local
Baltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott,

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:32.634
who was also the Surveyor General
of the United States.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.824
Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791,

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:39.934
Ellicott appointed him as an assistant
to work on a prestigious new project,

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:43.244
planning the layout 
of the nation's capitol.

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:47.105
Meanwhile, Banneker turned 
his brilliant mind to farming.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:51.467
He used his scientific expertise
to pioneer new agricultural methods

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.126
on his family's tobacco farm.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:56.105
His fascination with the natural world

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:00.946
also led to a study on the plague
life cycle of locusts.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:05.315
Then in 1792, Banneker 
began publishing almanacs.

00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:09.986
These provided detailed annual information
on moon and sun cycles,

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.295
weather forecasts,

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:14.596
and planting and tidal time tables.

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:17.374
Banneker sent a handwritten copy
of his first almanac

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:20.988
to Virginia's Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:24.335
This was a decade before Jefferson
became president.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:27.206
Banneker included a letter imploring
Jefferson to

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.948
"embrace every opportunity to eradicate

00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:33.067
that train of absurd 
and false ideas and opinions"

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.166
that caused prejudice 
against black people.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:40.306
Jefferson read the almanac and wrote
back in praise of Banneker's work.

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:42.856
Banneker's correspondence with 
the future president

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.976
is now considered to be one of the first
documented examples

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:49.156
of a civil rights 
protest letter in America.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:51.706
For the rest of his life,
he fought for this cause,

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:56.137
sharing his opposition to slavery
through his writing.

00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:58.639
In 1806 at the age of 75,

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.567
Banneker died after a lifetime
of study and activism.

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:05.898
On the day of his funeral,
his house mysteriously burned down,

00:03:05.898 --> 00:03:07.838
and the majority of his life's work,

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.327
including his striking clock, 
was destroyed.

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:13.848
But still, his legacy lives on.
