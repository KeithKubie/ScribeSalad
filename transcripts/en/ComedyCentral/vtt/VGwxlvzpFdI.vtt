 â™ª It's human nature â™ª

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.907
 - Men are in crisis.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.111
 Mansplaining, manspreading,
 mayonaise, times up,

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:15.515
  Woody Allen, Dave Nevaro,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.683
we've got a lot of issues guys.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.819
 Thankfully I'm here to help.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.721
Now why am I qualified,
because I've got a

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.624
popular podcast, a
gender neutral haircut,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.727
 and I've dealt with every
 problem that a man can have.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.663
 I've got erectile
 dysfunction right now.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:33.900
  I'm Theo Vonn and
  this is Man Up.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.642
 So this weeks episode
 is about growth.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.877
 And I got a call from Calila,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.380
 who is a girlfriend of
 an old friend of mine

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.982
 named Bobby Lire or Bob Li.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.984
 And some of you
 guys have seen him,

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:54.921
 and he hasn't really exhibited
 growth very well in his life.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:58.491
 So first things first, I
 went over there to help out.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.164
 - He's the absolute
 love of my life.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:08.334
 I don't see a
 future without him,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.938
 but there are some barriers
 to our relationship.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.373
 Namely, my step dad.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.576
 My step dad's a little
 bit more traditional

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.612
  and he has some concerns.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.881
  - Say if I were a
  peeping tom right,

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.416
 and you're not here.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:25.184
 And I show up, 'cause
 I got a ladder,

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.419
 and I got everything
 I need right.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.321
  I got the gloves,
  I got a thermos,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.922
 you know I got time to kill,

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.491
you know I'm unemployed.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.626
 And I'm here watching
 through the windows

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.362
and I see Bobby, what's
he gonna be doing.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.964
 What am I gonna see him doing?

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.299
 - 16 hours of video game play

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.135
 with the occasional
 intermittent break

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.504
 of masterbatory activities.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.538
- Jesus christ.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.241
  I know when I see somebody

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.809
 that needs to
 evolve a little bit.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.043
- Right.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.311
 - And for me it just
 seems like Bobby

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.179
 just wants to play
 this child forever.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.213
  - He's a man baby.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.181
  - He's a man baby.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.782
 - When I first moved in here,

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.718
I would walk out to the balcony

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.054
 and I would always get this
 strong smell of ammonia.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.424
Then I see this massive
jug of yellow fluid.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:08.327
 So I asked him,
 Bobby what is that?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.729
 - His natural urine isn't it.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.596
 - His natural urine.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.531
 - That's an easy one.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.099
 - He says it's a Korean thing,

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.033
I don't buy it.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.735
 - Yeah I don't buy that either

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.236
 I've watched a lot of
 Korean shit online,

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.738
 I've never seen
 anything like that.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.307
  And I used to pee in my
  girlfriends sink at night

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.176
  and the cats would show up

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.410
and they started peeing
in there and that's

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.612
 how her mom knew I
 was peeing in there.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:30.516
 So it's you know
 there's a lot of ways

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.018
  to get caught up in that.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.022
 - Let me give you an example
 of my step dads 70th birthday.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.290
- Okay.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.258
 - Six people in the
 table, fancy dinner,

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.460
 I asked Bobby hey no gadgets,

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:43.696
 so he didn't know what
 to do with his hands.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.168
 So naturally his hands
 found my breasts.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.303
  - Oh wow.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.704
- During dinner.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.372
 - Crotch too or just
 breasts? Honestly.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:56.175
  - Mostly breasts.
  Mostly waist up.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.109
 - Did he witness some of it.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.611
  - He witnessed all of it.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.413
 - Jesus dude.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.148
That makes my fucking neck hurt.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:05.818
 - That 70th birthday fiasco
 is what I want to erase

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:07.386
  out of everyone's memory.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.621
- Right.

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:10.189
- So I want to have a
dinner with my step dad.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:11.224
I want a re do.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.792
- Yes I got a good idea.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:13.759
  If you don't mind
  I'd like to maybe

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.561
take him aside for a little bit

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:17.797
 and see if we can't
 do some things.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.199
 Crack into that
 jaundice phenomemon

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.901
that's going on behind his eyes.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.169
 And see what we can create.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.003
  - Please.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:24.837
- Okay.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.372
  Look I can relate.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.940
 Bobby has extra urine around
 the house, I've been there.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:29.842
 You know I've done a
 lot of poor choices.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.011
 I've got two bags of body
 hair under my sink right now.

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.946
 One of them is mine.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.715
  But I know that
  I have to change.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:39.218
 The mission now was
 getting Bobby to know

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.154
that he needs to change as well.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.124
- [Theo] I hear him, I hear him.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.659
  Stand up straight.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:49.696
 - Hey honey.

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.334
  - Sup Bob.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:57.237
 He has nothing crazy.

00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:00.773
 - What's deal? What is this?

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.609
  - Uh just hanging out man,
  seeing if you were home.

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:04.944
  - Yeah I am home I'm here.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.445
- Yeah you weren't home.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.180
- Okay.

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.682
 - What's going on man

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:10.916
 - hey

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:11.751
 - good to see you bro

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:12.585
  - What's going on.

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:13.419
 - Yeah you look good.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:14.654
- What is this?

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.588
 - Just like a little,
 it's gonna be like,

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.522
 kind of like an intervention,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:17.723
  but nobody's here but us.

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.759
 - Intervention?
 I've been sober for

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.494
  like 15 years so I'm good.

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:25.265
 - It's not about
 that though. Right?

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:28.267
 She's good, nobody's pregnant.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.837
 Let's go outside.
 If it's alright man.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.072
 - What

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.774
 - Yeah bro we're not
 being crazy I promise.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:38.277
  I mean some people are
  crazy, but we're not them.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.146
 - You're not gonna
 call me and tell me.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.648
 - About 80 feet it looks like.

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.016
- Dude, dude, just call
me and tell me that

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.018
you're going to do this.

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:47.253
  - My bad.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.220
 - What do you mean your bad?

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.388
  Is this like just call me.

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.890
 - I'm saying I feel bad now.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.591
  - Yeah but there's a crew
  in my house it's weird.

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:55.528
 - Well Calila, first of all
 Calila reached out to me.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.363
 Okay I'm not trying
 to be rude but.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:58.597
  - She called you?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.498
- She said something to
me yeah, on the phone.

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.399
 She called.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.567
- Weird.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.401
- She said straight up.

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:03.803
 - Everything's fine.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:04.737
  - Well that's not exactly
  how she framed it.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.638
- Yeah but how did she frame it?

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:06.906
 - I'll say it.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.475
  Bobby masturbates
  around the house,

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:11.877
  different places,
  urinates outdoors,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.112
 - And.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.847
 - Dude there's people
 that live out here.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.681
 Neighbors man. That could be

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:16.916
- Yeah I'm also

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:17.983
 - Is that a school.

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.185
- Oh can I just say this though

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:20.119
- Yeah. Say it.

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.354
- I just defend myself alright.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.390
In society we make these
rules like etiquette.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:25.624
- Okay.

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:27.526
- Right. But these rules
are made to be broken.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.796
 - Yeah, in high school
 Bobby, in junior high.

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:33.265
You know in
kindergarten, in pre-K.

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:35.101
People shitting off the
balcony and you know

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.369
 pissing in front of people.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.837
  There's 60 people
  living over there.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.105
  - Alright.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.374
 - So I'm just saying
 let's try this bro.

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.876
 We go to this thing
 today with me.

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.579
  And then we go to another
  event with his family.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:49.382
 And we see if you
 can step it up bro.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.716
  It's her step dad!

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.184
  She's already down
  to her second dad.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:55.121
 - I gotta go places
 with you? Alright.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.056
- She's already down to
her second dad Bobby.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.591
 - Next time though,
 seriously next time,

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.494
 you call me and you tell me
 that you're going to do this

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.195
 because it's fucking bullshit.

00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:04.730
- Okay is your phone
on? I tried to text you.

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:05.598
  - No it's not on.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.032
 - Because of my southern roots

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:10.736
 I know that manners
 are important.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:13.072
  And what Babbabear
  here is missing

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:15.541
is a little bit of them manoirs.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:18.444
 So I took little Bobby
 to a Cotillion class

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:21.214
 with some high society types.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.015
  You ready?

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.551
- Yeah.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.253
 - Alright, sayonara.

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:35.027
 - Say hello everyone
 to our gues-

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.896
 oh we're going in for a hug.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:41.934
Okay I actually went for
that because I didn't

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:44.804
 want to be rude, but we're
 gonna work on introductions.

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.272
 - You don't like ethnic storm.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.008
 - No it has nothing
 to do with ethnicity.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.076
 I'm an all inclusive person.

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:52.812
- I just went in a
little too hot I think.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.013
 - You went in like we-

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.315
 a little too
 familiar I would say.

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:59.585
 We are all here to actually
 teach you some manners today.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.987
 - I know all the
 manners but alright.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.423
  - Well I'm here to teach
  you all of things that you

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.692
don't know that you don't know.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:09.161
 - Like if I lived in
 England in a castle?

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:11.263
 - No this is actually
 what I like to call

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:13.165
  real life skills.

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:17.169
 These are everyday courtesy's
 that you should know.

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:19.038
And anyone should know.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.607
  For both your personal and
  your professional life.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.808
  - Alright.

00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:23.609
- Alright that's- we're
gonna work on that.

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:25.611
No that's not happening.

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:27.646
  Anytime you meet someone,

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.715
 you need to know
 the proper greeting.

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:32.184
 You want to have one
 arms length distance

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:34.553
which is about 18 inches
between another person.

00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:38.157
We are not going to flap
our wings like a birdie.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.892
 We're going to pretend
 we have books on

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.161
  either side of our waist.

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.896
 And we are going
 to act as if we are

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:45.664
conducting an orchestra.

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:46.599
- This is ridiculous, I've never

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.901
 - Okay here we go, here we go.

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:51.303
- It's absolute ludicy.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:52.771
- Here we go, stop, stop, stop.

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:54.573
 - I made all these
 arrangements for Bobby

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:57.543
to take a moment to
not think about himself

00:07:57.576 --> 00:07:59.211
and to listen to somebody else,

00:07:59.244 --> 00:08:03.582
 and to actually display a
 little bit of congeniality.

00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:04.984
 - Chew and swallow,
 chew and swallow.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.152
 - And I was just bool.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.456
 - And honestly he
 didn't really show up.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.258
 - I swear to god I
 farted twice already,

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.859
  but it was quiet.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.261
(kids squealing)

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:16.896
- Okay this is so not a
regular manners class.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:21.767
 - In America we are
 told to chew quietly.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.036
 - Oh here in America,
 I did not know that.

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:25.471
 - Yeah well.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:29.141
  - Thank you so much,
  white lady for telling me

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:30.609
 how to eat in America.

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:31.877
- I am not teasing him.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.279
- Look I think our last
hope is to see if Bobby

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.180
 can properly know
 how to make a toast,

00:08:35.213 --> 00:08:36.715
  otherwise I don't even
  see how he's gonna survive

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.217
 this tomorrow dude.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.818
 - Yeah you're not placing
 good bets on, or good odds.

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:41.253
 - You want me to do a toast.

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:42.121
  Hear hear.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.423
 - Hear hear.

00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:47.192
- I would like to salut.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.794
- Excuse me I have to interrupt.

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:50.429
You open with the lines,

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.831
I would like to propose a toast.

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:54.600
 Hear hear is at the
 end of the toast.

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:55.601
 Let's try it again.

00:08:56.468 --> 00:08:58.003
- Bobby.

00:08:58.036 --> 00:09:00.039
  - You're laughing, but
  this is serious business.

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.541
 - This is the worst
 human experience

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:04.143
  I've ever had in my life.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.312
 - How does that make me feel.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.246
 - That's your problem.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.414
  - No I think you're great.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.248
 - That makes me feel so badly.

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:10.082
  (laughter)

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:11.817
  I'm going to cry.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.519
 - Now he's laughing.

00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:18.190
 - It's not funny guys.

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:19.825
 So things hadn't gone well,

00:09:19.858 --> 00:09:22.461
  the big dinner had arrived
  and I realized that

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:24.797
 Bobby was gonna need
 some assistance.

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:35.274
  - That was weird.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:39.845
 - Okay hello.

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:41.413
- How you doing/

00:09:41.446 --> 00:09:42.481
 - You alright.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:44.049
 - Yeah I feel fine.

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.884
  - You don't always
  pull out my chair.

00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:49.555
 - I know because
 I'm a different man.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:53.325
 - Before we start, I
 called the both of you

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:55.160
 to have dinner because
 the last dinner

00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:58.163
 that we had together
 didn't go so well.

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:02.835
 - When we go out to
 eat you are constantly

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:06.138
  groping her in
  front of everyone.

00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:07.339
 - Can I say something.

00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:10.309
- No just wait a second,
just hear this out.

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:11.510
- Okay.

00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:14.113
- When you do this,
it's kind of insulting.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.982
 - Okay that's good,
 I understand that.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:18.751
 - Good evening guys,
 my name's chuckie,

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.152
 I'll be your waiter
 this evening.

00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:20.986
 - What's your name?

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:21.820
  - Chuckie.

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:23.322
 - Hey Chuckie.

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.657
 - Nice to see you, just the
 three of you guys tonight?

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.891
  - Mm hmm,

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:27.359
  - Awesome, welcome
  to The District,

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:28.994
 have anybody told you
 about our specials.

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:30.295
  - Not yet.

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.231
 - No you're the
 first guy to say hi.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:36.402
- Excellent tonight we
have a seven ounce duck,

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:39.338
  - Yeah that's it?

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.373
 - That's it.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.274
  - Yeah that's gonna be it.

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:43.475
 - And what's on it?

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:45.044
  - The duck comes natural,

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.446
  it comes in its
  own sauce and it's

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:49.381
 - What kind of sauce is it?

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:50.683
  - I can ask the
  chef for you sir.

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.384
- Well you should know
that right as a waiter.

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:53.252
 - I'm new here sir.

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.054
- Okay.

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.689
 Alright thank you very much.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.057
 - Thanks man.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.759
 - I know it's, I'm just gonna.

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:02.595
 'cause my girlfriend's
 so pretty.

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:08.400
 Okay.

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:11.003
  - Suck it in, suck
  it in a little.

00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:13.472
  I need your belly
  to go down a bit.

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:14.874
  Okay there we go.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.676
Oh god.

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:18.611
- Bobby.

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:22.948
 I knew that Bobby
 might need some help,

00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.484
 so I slipped him an ear piece.

00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:27.553
  Bobby, time for the toast.

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:28.854
 - Time for the toast.

00:11:30.188 --> 00:11:31.957
 Hear, hear.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.197
 Calila, Roger, Both of you,

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:42.701
 I am grateful to
 have you in my life.

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:47.740
Calila you are my native
American love sister.

00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:50.576
  - I'm not Native American.

00:11:52.177 --> 00:11:54.379
  - You look like Pocahontas
  right now though.

00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:57.282
  And that's what- you know
  exactly what I'm saying.

00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:58.784
  - I don't.

00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:00.252
 - Let me start over.

00:12:01.753 --> 00:12:06.592
 Calila, I just want
 to say I'm sorry,

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:11.530
 because I spend a lot of
 time thinking about myself.

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:12.465
  You are my angel.

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:15.801
- Come here, give me your face.

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:18.137
- You are special to me.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.141
 And I am so happy to
 have you in my life.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:23.542
 - Thank you sweetie
 that means a lot.

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:26.278
 - And I am grateful to Roger,

00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:30.215
  because just like
  me he recognizes

00:12:30.248 --> 00:12:34.553
amazing women when he sees them.

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:40.726
  Even though you're dating
  her mom and not her.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.861
 You know what I mean.

00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:44.963
 I love you.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:46.165
  Hear hear.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.800
  - Cheers.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.234
  - Everyone says hear hear.

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:50.435
 - Hear hear.

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:51.470
 - Everyone in the
 restaurant, hear hear.

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:53.772
 - What I learned
 from watching Bobby

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:56.341
is you have to take
your problems seriously.

00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:57.976
  You have to step
  into the situation

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:59.111
 and you have to do it.

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:00.913
You have to do the work.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:02.648
 And did Bobby do
 the work today, no.

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.117
  I don't think he did, but
  he at least showed up.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.518
- Cheers

00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:07.786
 - And hopefully, you show
 up, you show up, you show up.

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:09.221
 - I did it.

00:13:09.254 --> 00:13:12.357
 - And sometime you feel
 comfortable enough to man up.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.628
 And maybe next week we will
 have a different outcome.

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:17.863
 But thank you guys for
 being here with me,

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:20.566
 I'm Theo Vonn, and
 this has been Man Up.
