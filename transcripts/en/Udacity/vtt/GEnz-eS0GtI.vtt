00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.740
In this lesson you got some hands-on
experience working with real APIs.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.640
I encourage you to keep
exploring other APIs, and

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.500
get used to going through documentation
so you can use them for future projects.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.870
I listed some of my favorite
APIs in the instructor notes.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.070
In this next lesson, you're going
to learn to create your own APIs,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.680
that you and
other developers can implement.
