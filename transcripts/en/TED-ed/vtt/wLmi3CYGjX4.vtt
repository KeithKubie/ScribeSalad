00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:15.386
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.679
Jade,

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.618
a hard, typically green stone.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.828
Until relatively recently,

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:25.075
gemstones were believed

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.889
to have magical, medicinal properties,

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.342
and nothing was more effective

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.910
at treating a kidney disorder than jade.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.504
In the 16th century,

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:37.132
the Spanish returned from the New World

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:39.573
with the mineral in their cargo holds

00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:42.917
and christened it, "piedra de la ijada,"

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.499
or loin stone.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.657
It quickly became popular
throughout Europe,

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.133
both as a cure for internal ailments

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.596
and as a decorative ornament

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.594
and was renamed jade by the French,

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:57.827
a word that was borrowed by the English

00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:00.713
and remains in use to this day.

00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:02.608
In the 19th century,

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:04.572
French mineralogists discovered

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:06.063
that jade was being used

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:08.899
to describe two distinct minerals:

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.411
jadeite, which takes its name from jade,

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:14.789
and the more common nephrite,

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:18.028
the root of which is the Greek
word nephros,

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.959
meaning kidney.

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:23.191
In addition to describing
these two minerals,

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.248
jade also has an English homonym.

00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:28.803
With roots that predate the popularity

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.463
of the lustral gemstone,

00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:32.373
jade was used to refer to

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:34.899
either a disreputable woman

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:37.333
or a broken-down horse.

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:40.584
Thus, the word jaded, meaning worn out

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:42.424
or lacking enthusiasm,

00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:45.221
has nothing to do with the gemstone,

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:47.598
and instead, comes from the archaic,

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:50.213
equine-related definition.
