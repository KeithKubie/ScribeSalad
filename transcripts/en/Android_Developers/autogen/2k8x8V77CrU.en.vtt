services and they're registered in your
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039
services and they're registered in your
Android manifests and really they are

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
Android manifests and really they are
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
and we had a very interesting quote from
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.289
and we had a very interesting quote from
Dianne Hackborn back in 2016 that once

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

we've gotten into this entry point to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
we've gotten into this entry point to
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.910
we've gotten into this entry point to
your UI we really don't care how you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
your UI we really don't care how you
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.940
your UI we really don't care how you
organize the flow inside 2016 and I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
organize the flow inside 2016 and I
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.230
organize the flow inside 2016 and I
think it was controversial I guess in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
think it was controversial I guess in
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.889
think it was controversial I guess in
2016 maybe we'll just say it had 77

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
2016 maybe we'll just say it had 77
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.149

a lot of people were really enthusiastic
about this post but really like what

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
about this post but really like what
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.130
about this post but really like what
what does it mean right like well what I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
what does it mean right like well what I
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.500
what does it mean right like well what I
think it means is that the framework

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
think it means is that the framework
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.860
think it means is that the framework
shouldn't care the framework shouldn't

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870
shouldn't care the framework shouldn't
 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.570
shouldn't care the framework shouldn't
care about your applications

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580
care about your applications
 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.360
care about your applications
architecture right it needs to provide

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370
architecture right it needs to provide
 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.330
architecture right it needs to provide
the hooks needed for the android

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
the hooks needed for the android
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.110
the hooks needed for the android
framework to start your application but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
framework to start your application but
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.720
framework to start your application but
you should probably care about the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
you should probably care about the
 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.520
you should probably care about the
architecture if you're out that's why

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
architecture if you're out that's why
 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.680
architecture if you're out that's why
you're all here today and I love having

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690
you're all here today and I love having
 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.729
you're all here today and I love having
you here so the biggest problem is that

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
you here so the biggest problem is that
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.780
you here so the biggest problem is that
you really don't know what an activity

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
you really don't know what an activity
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.759
you really don't know what an activity
is actually going to do so what's the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769
is actually going to do so what's the
 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.640
is actually going to do so what's the
default animation for an activity well

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650
default animation for an activity well
 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.250
default animation for an activity well
it depends depends on the version of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260
it depends depends on the version of
 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.640
it depends depends on the version of
Android what manufacturer you're on and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
Android what manufacturer you're on and
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.610
Android what manufacturer you're on and
even what seems they've the user has

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
even what seems they've the user has
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.410
even what seems they've the user has
selected right so similarly we had

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420
selected right so similarly we had
 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.229
selected right so similarly we had
property animations that were added in

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239
property animations that were added in
 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.059
property animations that were added in
API 11 and they're much superior to view

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069
API 11 and they're much superior to view
 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.240
API 11 and they're much superior to view
animations and the thing is is that

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
animations and the thing is is that
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.830
animations and the thing is is that
while these new things become possible

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840
while these new things become possible
 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.409
while these new things become possible
on new versions of Android they're not

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419
on new versions of Android they're not
 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.690
on new versions of Android they're not
always applied to everything and things

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
always applied to everything and things
 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.449
always applied to everything and things
like activities they don't support

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459
like activities they don't support
 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.430
like activities they don't support
property animations at all even today

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
property animations at all even today
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.759
property animations at all even today
and even if we were to add them in the

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769
and even if we were to add them in the
 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.460
and even if we were to add them in the
next version of Android maybe the letter

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
next version of Android maybe the letter
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.509
next version of Android maybe the letter
after P we wouldn't be able to back port

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
after P we wouldn't be able to back port
 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.430
after P we wouldn't be able to back port
them because they're part of the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
them because they're part of the
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.729
them because they're part of the
framework right so thinking about all

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739
framework right so thinking about all
 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.830
framework right so thinking about all
these things it's like well okay what

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
these things it's like well okay what
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.589
these things it's like well okay what
what should an activity be used for

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599
what should an activity be used for
 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.270
what should an activity be used for
right well why why do we even have

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
right well why why do we even have
 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.550
right well why why do we even have
activities they're useful as this entry

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560
activities they're useful as this entry
 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.650
activities they're useful as this entry
point but then beyond that you're in

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
point but then beyond that you're in
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.319
point but then beyond that you're in
your realm right you're in your realm of

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329
your realm right you're in your realm of
 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.599
your realm right you're in your realm of
what your app needs to do and you don't

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609
what your app needs to do and you don't
 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.509
what your app needs to do and you don't
necessarily need to rely on activities

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519
necessarily need to rely on activities
 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.270
necessarily need to rely on activities
being the thing that you have to work

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280
being the thing that you have to work
 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.650
being the thing that you have to work
with so let's take an example here we

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660
with so let's take an example here we
 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.599
with so let's take an example here we
have some code like this we're calling

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609
have some code like this we're calling
 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.939
have some code like this we're calling
start activity and we have to use

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949
start activity and we have to use
 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.979
start activity and we have to use
activity compat because we want to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989
activity compat because we want to
 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.620
activity compat because we want to
a shared element transition alright so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630
a shared element transition alright so
 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.320
a shared element transition alright so
great our intent and then we say oh we

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
great our intent and then we say oh we
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.499
great our intent and then we say oh we
want to have this one element shared

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509
want to have this one element shared
 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.040
want to have this one element shared
well what API does actually work on well

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050
well what API does actually work on well
 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.330
well what API does actually work on well
it depends on what you mean by work

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340
it depends on what you mean by work
 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.969
it depends on what you mean by work
right it technically launches an

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979
right it technically launches an
 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.010
right it technically launches an
activity that's true

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020
activity that's true
 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.960
activity that's true
but it's only actually going to do a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970
but it's only actually going to do a
 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.969
but it's only actually going to do a
shared element transition on newer

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979
shared element transition on newer
 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.800
shared element transition on newer
devices API 21 plus and really how many

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810
devices API 21 plus and really how many
 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.839
devices API 21 plus and really how many
compactions do we need in our life it

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849
compactions do we need in our life it
 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.059
compactions do we need in our life it
technically works you're saving some API

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069
technically works you're saving some API
 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.550
technically works you're saving some API
checks but really this isn't the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
checks but really this isn't the
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.790
checks but really this isn't the
prettiest code to look at and similarly

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800
prettiest code to look at and similarly
 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.100
prettiest code to look at and similarly
are there any hidden gotchas right if

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110
are there any hidden gotchas right if
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.960
are there any hidden gotchas right if
you are testing this on the latest

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970
you are testing this on the latest
 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.999
you are testing this on the latest
version of Android if you test it on an

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009
version of Android if you test it on an
 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:04.990
version of Android if you test it on an
older version of Android are you

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
older version of Android are you
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.920
older version of Android are you
actually going to get the same

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930
actually going to get the same
 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.559
actually going to get the same
experience well in this example I

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569
experience well in this example I
 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.589
experience well in this example I
actually ran into this and I was like oh

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599
actually ran into this and I was like oh
 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.890
actually ran into this and I was like oh
like well things are fading in and out

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900
like well things are fading in and out
 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.800
like well things are fading in and out
and like sure I chose fade but it turns

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810
and like sure I chose fade but it turns
 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.600
and like sure I chose fade but it turns
out you need to exclude things like the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610
out you need to exclude things like the
 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.490
out you need to exclude things like the
status bar a navigation bar otherwise

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500
status bar a navigation bar otherwise
 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.810
status bar a navigation bar otherwise
still flicker and I was like well okay

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820
still flicker and I was like well okay
 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.159
still flicker and I was like well okay
well that's fun I wouldn't have ever

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169
well that's fun I wouldn't have ever
 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.159
well that's fun I wouldn't have ever
known that unless I tried it once and I

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169
known that unless I tried it once and I
 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.450
known that unless I tried it once and I
tried it on a whole bunch of different

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
tried it on a whole bunch of different
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.100
tried it on a whole bunch of different
devices and turns out on some devices

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
devices and turns out on some devices
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.890
devices and turns out on some devices
it's totally fine and other devices not

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900
it's totally fine and other devices not
 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.379
it's totally fine and other devices not
so much so there's a lot of little

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389
so much so there's a lot of little
 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.270
so much so there's a lot of little
hidden gotchas here that you can't

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280
hidden gotchas here that you can't
 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.980
hidden gotchas here that you can't
actually control or rely on in your app

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990
actually control or rely on in your app
 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.080
actually control or rely on in your app
another example where we have multiple

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090
another example where we have multiple
 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.779
another example where we have multiple
activities right and really each

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789
activities right and really each
 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.749
activities right and really each
activity is kind of its own component in

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759
activity is kind of its own component in
 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.240
activity is kind of its own component in
your app right so if you have two

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250
your app right so if you have two
 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.129
your app right so if you have two
activities and you want to share data

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139
activities and you want to share data
 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.950
activities and you want to share data
between them well there's not really a

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960
between them well there's not really a
 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.260
between them well there's not really a
scope for that there is a scope for that

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270
scope for that there is a scope for that
 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.850
scope for that there is a scope for that
but it's called your application scope

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860
but it's called your application scope
 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.129
but it's called your application scope
it's the same scope that's shared by

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139
it's the same scope that's shared by
 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.459
it's the same scope that's shared by
services and everything else in your app

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.469
services and everything else in your app
 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.899
services and everything else in your app
but you really want kind of a shared

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909
but you really want kind of a shared
 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.149
but you really want kind of a shared
scope that's just within a couple of

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159
scope that's just within a couple of
 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.510
scope that's just within a couple of
components so this is a structure that

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520
components so this is a structure that
 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.939
components so this is a structure that
Android provides but it's maybe not the

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949
Android provides but it's maybe not the
 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.659
Android provides but it's maybe not the
one you actually want to use so what you

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669
one you actually want to use so what you
 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.129
one you actually want to use so what you
actually want is you want to build the

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139
actually want is you want to build the
 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.830
actually want is you want to build the
layering you actually need so in this

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840
layering you actually need so in this
 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.070
layering you actually need so in this
case we can have multiple things

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080
case we can have multiple things
 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.709
case we can have multiple things
multiple destinations within an activity

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719
multiple destinations within an activity
 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.660
multiple destinations within an activity
right and share in

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670
right and share in
 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.680
right and share in
across each of these destinations by

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690
across each of these destinations by
 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.410
across each of these destinations by
using the activity scope as an actual

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420
using the activity scope as an actual
 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.960
using the activity scope as an actual
useful element now so for example you

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970
useful element now so for example you
 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.600
useful element now so for example you
could have a shared view element or view

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610
could have a shared view element or view
 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.680
could have a shared view element or view
model that both destinations talk to so

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690
model that both destinations talk to so
 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.840
model that both destinations talk to so
one destination could put data in and

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850
one destination could put data in and
 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.670
one destination could put data in and
the other one could observe changes to

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680
the other one could observe changes to
 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.190
the other one could observe changes to
that data right you don't need to work

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200
that data right you don't need to work
 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.440
that data right you don't need to work
at the application scope level for this

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450
at the application scope level for this
 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.640
at the application scope level for this
to work so I mention this for a

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650
to work so I mention this for a
 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.760
to work so I mention this for a
destination so what is a destination

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770
destination so what is a destination
 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.280
destination so what is a destination
well really it's just a subsection of

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290
well really it's just a subsection of
 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.900
well really it's just a subsection of
your UI right so for most destinations

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910
your UI right so for most destinations
 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.400
your UI right so for most destinations
they're going to take over the majority

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410
they're going to take over the majority
 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.470
they're going to take over the majority
of your screen right like when you move

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480
of your screen right like when you move
 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.270
of your screen right like when you move
from one screen to the next screen in

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280
from one screen to the next screen in
 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.760
from one screen to the next screen in
your app it's gonna change the vast

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770
your app it's gonna change the vast
 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.770
your app it's gonna change the vast
majority of your screen right maybe you

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:23.780
majority of your screen right maybe you
 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.170
majority of your screen right maybe you
have some global navigation like a

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180
have some global navigation like a
 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.390
have some global navigation like a
bottom nav or maybe you have an action

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400
bottom nav or maybe you have an action
 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.570
bottom nav or maybe you have an action
bar at the top but the rest of this is

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580
bar at the top but the rest of this is
 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.230
bar at the top but the rest of this is
all in a destination so the sub section

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240
all in a destination so the sub section
 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.120
all in a destination so the sub section
of your I we have a word for this it's

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130
of your I we have a word for this it's
 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.000
of your I we have a word for this it's
called a fragment but a fragments really

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010
called a fragment but a fragments really
 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.120
called a fragment but a fragments really
just one implementation of this idea of

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130
just one implementation of this idea of
 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.270
just one implementation of this idea of
having separate destinations for each

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280
having separate destinations for each
 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.790
having separate destinations for each
screen in your app and really this

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800
screen in your app and really this
 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.460
screen in your app and really this
fragment is serving as kind of the view

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470
fragment is serving as kind of the view
 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.130
fragment is serving as kind of the view
controller right the thing that isn't a

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.140
controller right the thing that isn't a
 

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.220
controller right the thing that isn't a
view itself but something that owns and

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.230
view itself but something that owns and
 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.250
view itself but something that owns and
changes those views which are really

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
changes those views which are really
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.700
changes those views which are really
more about display all right so really

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:03.710
more about display all right so really
 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.700
more about display all right so really
the activity instead of owning all of

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:06.710
the activity instead of owning all of
 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.350
the activity instead of owning all of
this business logic and things like that

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360
this business logic and things like that
 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.170
this business logic and things like that
is really as small as is physically

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.180
is really as small as is physically
 

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.020
is really as small as is physically
possible and really only working on the

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.030
possible and really only working on the
 

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.940
possible and really only working on the
kind of that shared UI that's shared

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:15.950
kind of that shared UI that's shared
 

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.530
kind of that shared UI that's shared
across all destinations so what we're

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:20.540
across all destinations so what we're
 

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.990
across all destinations so what we're
thinking about this like if we're moving

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000
thinking about this like if we're moving
 

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.420
thinking about this like if we're moving
from this activity world to a

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.430
from this activity world to a
 

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.130
from this activity world to a
destination rolled we really want to

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.140
destination rolled we really want to
 

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.290
destination rolled we really want to
make that world as easy as possible

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:29.300
make that world as easy as possible
 

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.960
make that world as easy as possible
right otherwise why it would be moved

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:30.970
right otherwise why it would be moved
 

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:36.520
right otherwise why it would be moved
and we focused on kind of two things one

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:36.530
and we focused on kind of two things one
 

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.400
and we focused on kind of two things one
was the that global UI kind of thing

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:39.410
was the that global UI kind of thing
 

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.410
was the that global UI kind of thing
like how can we make that part easy

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.420
like how can we make that part easy
 

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.540
like how can we make that part easy
right like it's something that every app

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:43.550
right like it's something that every app
 

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.550
right like it's something that every app
kind of has the same kind of patterns

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560
kind of has the same kind of patterns
 

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.380
kind of has the same kind of patterns
and we really don't want that to be some

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.390
and we really don't want that to be some
 

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.800
and we really don't want that to be some
that takes a lot of effort to do

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:51.810
that takes a lot of effort to do
 

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.520
that takes a lot of effort to do
also the navigating between destinations

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:55.530
also the navigating between destinations
 

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.070
also the navigating between destinations
right that start activity activity

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080
right that start activity activity
 

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.440
right that start activity activity
compat thing can we make that even

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:00.450
compat thing can we make that even
 

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.950
compat thing can we make that even
easier so we started the navigation

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:03.960
easier so we started the navigation
 

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.110
easier so we started the navigation
architecture component and we introduced

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120
architecture component and we introduced
 

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.990
architecture component and we introduced
it to you all in IO this last year in

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000
it to you all in IO this last year in
 

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.370
it to you all in IO this last year in
2018 it is still an alpha right now and

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.380
2018 it is still an alpha right now and
 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.810
2018 it is still an alpha right now and
we're looking to fill out all the

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820
we're looking to fill out all the
 

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.330
we're looking to fill out all the
feature gaps before taking it to 1.0

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.340
feature gaps before taking it to 1.0
 

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.710
feature gaps before taking it to 1.0
here soon but really what this allows us

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720
here soon but really what this allows us
 

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.310
here soon but really what this allows us
to do is take a super simple activity

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320
to do is take a super simple activity
 

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.250
to do is take a super simple activity
like this the content view will set us

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260
like this the content view will set us
 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.030
like this the content view will set us
action bar because that's a thing right

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040
action bar because that's a thing right
 

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.170
action bar because that's a thing right
and we want to make this smart we want

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180
and we want to make this smart we want
 

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.730
and we want to make this smart we want
to make this useful but we still want it

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740
to make this useful but we still want it
 

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.690
to make this useful but we still want it
to fit on this one code slide so some of

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700
to fit on this one code slide so some of
 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.540
to fit on this one code slide so some of
this is we need a nav controller a nav

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:44.550
this is we need a nav controller a nav
 

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.060
this is we need a nav controller a nav
controller is really the heart of

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.070
controller is really the heart of
 

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.990
controller is really the heart of
navigation it's the thing that knows

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000
navigation it's the thing that knows
 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.710
navigation it's the thing that knows
everything about how your app works via

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720
everything about how your app works via
 

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.440
everything about how your app works via
a navigation graph and we can get one

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:54.450
a navigation graph and we can get one
 

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.630
a navigation graph and we can get one
we're using Kotlin here column

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640
we're using Kotlin here column
 

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.540
we're using Kotlin here column
extensions and call fine nav controller

00:09:59.540 --> 00:09:59.550
extensions and call fine nav controller
 

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.210
extensions and call fine nav controller
and here we're just giving it the ID of

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220
and here we're just giving it the ID of
 

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.850
and here we're just giving it the ID of
a nav host fragment the nav host

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860
a nav host fragment the nav host
 

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.860
a nav host fragment the nav host
fragment is basically that part of your

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:06.870
fragment is basically that part of your
 

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.720
fragment is basically that part of your
UI that's going to change whenever you

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:08.730
UI that's going to change whenever you
 

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.630
UI that's going to change whenever you
change destinations we'll also add an

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640
change destinations we'll also add an
 

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.760
change destinations we'll also add an
app bar configurations this is what

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:13.770
app bar configurations this is what
 

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.240
app bar configurations this is what
controls the up action and what needs to

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.250
controls the up action and what needs to
 

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.310
controls the up action and what needs to
happen when you move up from a

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320
happen when you move up from a
 

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.970
happen when you move up from a
destination and how do we hook those up

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:21.980
destination and how do we hook those up
 

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.100
destination and how do we hook those up
nice one-liner that just says set up the

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.110
nice one-liner that just says set up the
 

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.720
nice one-liner that just says set up the
action bar gives us an app controller

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:26.730
action bar gives us an app controller
 

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.930
action bar gives us an app controller
and gives it an app bar configuration

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:28.940
and gives it an app bar configuration
 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.360
and gives it an app bar configuration
now because we're using a drawer layout

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.370
now because we're using a drawer layout
 

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.350
now because we're using a drawer layout
here in our app bar configuration we

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360
here in our app bar configuration we
 

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.150
here in our app bar configuration we
also want to open and shut the drawer

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160
also want to open and shut the drawer
 

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.100
also want to open and shut the drawer
when you hit the UP button so we'll call

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.110
when you hit the UP button so we'll call
 

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.100
when you hit the UP button so we'll call
navigate up in our support navigate up

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.110
navigate up in our support navigate up
 

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.730
navigate up in our support navigate up
and we've set up our whole action bar

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740
and we've set up our whole action bar
 

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.710
and we've set up our whole action bar
now it changes titles as our

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720
now it changes titles as our
 

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.560
now it changes titles as our
destinations change we're good if we

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:51.570
destinations change we're good if we
 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.620
destinations change we're good if we
want to add the navigation view and make

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.630
want to add the navigation view and make
 

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.540
want to add the navigation view and make
sure that we can click on things in our

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:56.550
sure that we can click on things in our
 

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.640
sure that we can click on things in our
side nav and they go to the right place

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:58.650
side nav and they go to the right place
 

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.670
side nav and they go to the right place
that's again one line because we can do

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680
that's again one line because we can do
 

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.210
that's again one line because we can do
this all

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220
this all
 

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.700
this all
because the nav controller knows about

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:04.710
because the nav controller knows about
 

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.080
because the nav controller knows about
our destinations in our app so then how

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.090
our destinations in our app so then how
 

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.450
our destinations in our app so then how
do we actually do navigate actions if

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:11.460
do we actually do navigate actions if
 

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.700
do we actually do navigate actions if
we're not doing fancy one-liner stuff

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:13.710
we're not doing fancy one-liner stuff
 

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.370
we're not doing fancy one-liner stuff
well we can get a nav controller from

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380
well we can get a nav controller from
 

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.960
well we can get a nav controller from
basically anywhere if we're in our

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:17.970
basically anywhere if we're in our
 

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.390
basically anywhere if we're in our
activity news find nav controller it's

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:20.400
activity news find nav controller it's
 

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.850
activity news find nav controller it's
even easier from a fragment we can just

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860
even easier from a fragment we can just
 

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.710
even easier from a fragment we can just
call find nav controller and we built

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720
call find nav controller and we built
 

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.470
call find nav controller and we built
the Kotlin extension for this and

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480
the Kotlin extension for this and
 

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.840
the Kotlin extension for this and
similarly even from a view any view

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:29.850
similarly even from a view any view
 

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.120
similarly even from a view any view
that's created by any fragment in your

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.130
that's created by any fragment in your
 

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.750
that's created by any fragment in your
navigation graph can just call find have

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760
navigation graph can just call find have
 

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.480
navigation graph can just call find have
controller from a view so you have this

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.490
controller from a view so you have this
 

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.700
controller from a view so you have this
reference to it from basically anywhere

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:40.710
reference to it from basically anywhere
 

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.000
reference to it from basically anywhere
and we really tried to think alike all

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.010
and we really tried to think alike all
 

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.010
and we really tried to think alike all
right well you know if you have

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:46.020
right well you know if you have
 

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.930
right well you know if you have
arguments to something how do we make

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940
arguments to something how do we make
 

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.010
arguments to something how do we make
this nice so we built a Gradle plugin

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.020
this nice so we built a Gradle plugin
 

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.890
this nice so we built a Gradle plugin
called safe args which for every

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:54.900
called safe args which for every
 

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.900
called safe args which for every
destination in your graph such as this

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:56.910
destination in your graph such as this
 

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.750
destination in your graph such as this
main fragment we generate a directions

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760
main fragment we generate a directions
 

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.570
main fragment we generate a directions
object which has a nice simple show

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:02.580
object which has a nice simple show
 

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.150
object which has a nice simple show
profile method which gives you a

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160
profile method which gives you a
 

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.910
profile method which gives you a
directions object with type safe

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920
directions object with type safe
 

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.890
directions object with type safe
arguments that you define in your

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:09.900
arguments that you define in your
 

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.690
arguments that you define in your
navigation graph and then you just call

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700
navigation graph and then you just call
 

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.750
navigation graph and then you just call
navigate and that's it will take care of

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760
navigate and that's it will take care of
 

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.580
navigate and that's it will take care of
all of the fragment transaction and all

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:16.590
all of the fragment transaction and all
 

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.670
all of the fragment transaction and all
of that sort of stuff for you so this

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680
of that sort of stuff for you so this
 

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.770
of that sort of stuff for you so this
makes a lot easier but we can really go

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:21.780
makes a lot easier but we can really go
 

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.800
makes a lot easier but we can really go
a lot farther with navigation so has

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:24.810
a lot farther with navigation so has
 

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.420
a lot farther with navigation so has
anyone ever built an intent filter

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.430
anyone ever built an intent filter
 

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.330
anyone ever built an intent filter

anyone enjoyed that experience great one

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:33.690
anyone enjoyed that experience great one
 

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.580
anyone enjoyed that experience great one
person enjoyed that experience and

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:36.590
person enjoyed that experience and
 

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.290
person enjoyed that experience and
really you have to do this because this

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300
really you have to do this because this
 

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.760
really you have to do this because this
is what the android framework knows

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:40.770
is what the android framework knows
 

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.030
is what the android framework knows
right it knows I can par as an intent

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040
right it knows I can par as an intent
 

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.940
right it knows I can par as an intent
filter and start an activity right but

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:46.950
filter and start an activity right but
 

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.160
filter and start an activity right but
in so oftentimes like that's not quite

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.170
in so oftentimes like that's not quite
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.350
in so oftentimes like that's not quite
enough I'm you need to go a little bit

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360
enough I'm you need to go a little bit
 

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.200
enough I'm you need to go a little bit
farther right so what we've done in

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.210
farther right so what we've done in
 

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.360
farther right so what we've done in
navigation is for any one of your

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:56.370
navigation is for any one of your
 

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.490
navigation is for any one of your
fragments any destination in your graph

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500
fragments any destination in your graph
 

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.520
fragments any destination in your graph
you can add a deep link it's a simple

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:01.530
you can add a deep link it's a simple
 

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.220
you can add a deep link it's a simple
one-liner and you can even add arguments

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:04.230
one-liner and you can even add arguments
 

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.350
one-liner and you can even add arguments
right here and we'll parse those out

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360
right here and we'll parse those out
 

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.510
right here and we'll parse those out
even for things like query parameters

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:08.520
even for things like query parameters
 

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.250
even for things like query parameters
will parse those out and give you them

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260
will parse those out and give you them
 

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.210
will parse those out and give you them
as arguments to your destination and

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:13.220
as arguments to your destination and
 

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.590
as arguments to your destination and
then because no one likes writing

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600
then because no one likes writing
 

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.260
then because no one likes writing
intentional

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.270
intentional
 

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.660
intentional
elders will also generate the intent

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.670
elders will also generate the intent
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.970
elders will also generate the intent
filters for you by adding a navigation

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:20.980
filters for you by adding a navigation
 

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.260
filters for you by adding a navigation
graph so this was something we actually

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:22.270
graph so this was something we actually
 

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.750
graph so this was something we actually
added to manifest merger to kind of

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760
added to manifest merger to kind of
 

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.230
added to manifest merger to kind of
generate that for you so all this

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240
generate that for you so all this
 

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.450
generate that for you so all this
layering helps us build nicer api's but

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:33.460
layering helps us build nicer api's but
 

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.510
layering helps us build nicer api's but
it also makes it easier to test your

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:36.520
it also makes it easier to test your
 

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.120
it also makes it easier to test your
application right if you're testing at

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.130
application right if you're testing at
 

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.730
application right if you're testing at
the activity level all of a sudden that

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:41.740
the activity level all of a sudden that
 

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.160
the activity level all of a sudden that
means okay well how do I test that start

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.170
means okay well how do I test that start
 

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.770
means okay well how do I test that start
activity actually did the right intent

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:46.780
activity actually did the right intent
 

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.140
activity actually did the right intent
and we have to build extra testing

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.150
and we have to build extra testing
 

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.090
and we have to build extra testing
frameworks on top of testing frameworks

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.100
frameworks on top of testing frameworks
 

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.440
frameworks on top of testing frameworks
to try and mock out these things but if

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:55.450
to try and mock out these things but if
 

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.600
to try and mock out these things but if
we're moving towards more of a single

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:57.610
we're moving towards more of a single
 

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.100
we're moving towards more of a single
activity model into the navigation

00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.110
activity model into the navigation
 

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.500
activity model into the navigation
controller world like we still want to

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.510
controller world like we still want to
 

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.360
controller world like we still want to
test all of those things we want that to

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:03.370
test all of those things we want that to
 

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.260
test all of those things we want that to
be easy to test so rule number one of

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.270
be easy to test so rule number one of
 

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.780
be easy to test so rule number one of
testing things at the destination level

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:09.790
testing things at the destination level
 

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.970
testing things at the destination level
is don't test at the destination level

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980
is don't test at the destination level
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.280
is don't test at the destination level
it's really the number one thing with

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.290
it's really the number one thing with
 

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.320
it's really the number one thing with
testing right is making things nice and

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:19.330
testing right is making things nice and
 

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.960
testing right is making things nice and
separate and extracting some of that

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:21.970
separate and extracting some of that
 

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.330
separate and extracting some of that
business logic out of a destination and

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:24.340
business logic out of a destination and
 

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.670
business logic out of a destination and
into something you can test in isolation

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680
into something you can test in isolation
 

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.220
into something you can test in isolation
right so example a view model is a

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:29.230
right so example a view model is a
 

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.050
right so example a view model is a
really nice place to put some of your

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.060
really nice place to put some of your
 

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.000
really nice place to put some of your
business logic because you can test it

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.010
business logic because you can test it
 

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.440
business logic because you can test it
in isolation

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:34.450
in isolation
 

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.390
in isolation
alright we have a view model provider

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:36.400
alright we have a view model provider
 

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.360
alright we have a view model provider
Factory for providing view models where

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.370
Factory for providing view models where
 

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.370
Factory for providing view models where
you can just inject things into your

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.380
you can just inject things into your
 

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.830
you can just inject things into your
view model test that totally separate

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:43.840
view model test that totally separate
 

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.430
view model test that totally separate
from your UI but that doesn't mean you

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440
from your UI but that doesn't mean you
 

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.580
from your UI but that doesn't mean you
don't want to test any of your UI stuff

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:50.590
don't want to test any of your UI stuff
 

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.950
don't want to test any of your UI stuff
at all right we have espresso tests for

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:52.960
at all right we have espresso tests for
 

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.020
at all right we have espresso tests for
a reason right we want to make sure that

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.030
a reason right we want to make sure that
 

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.630
a reason right we want to make sure that
all parts of our app work well and are

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:57.640
all parts of our app work well and are
 

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.250
all parts of our app work well and are
testable so how can we do this

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:02.260
testable so how can we do this
 

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.420
testable so how can we do this
so last this Monday we released fragment

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:06.430
so last this Monday we released fragment
 

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.870
so last this Monday we released fragment
1.1 the first alpha and with this became

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880
1.1 the first alpha and with this became
 

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.090
1.1 the first alpha and with this became
a new artifact called fragment testing

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:12.100
a new artifact called fragment testing
 

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.690
a new artifact called fragment testing
which is about like six years overdue

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:14.700
which is about like six years overdue
 

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.900
which is about like six years overdue
and it's really around being able to

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:18.910
and it's really around being able to
 

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.110
and it's really around being able to
test your Android X fragments in

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120
test your Android X fragments in
 

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.020
test your Android X fragments in
isolation right separate from an

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.030
isolation right separate from an
 

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.730
isolation right separate from an
activity separate from everything else

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:26.740
activity separate from everything else
 

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.310
activity separate from everything else
but being able to test and verify that

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:29.320
but being able to test and verify that
 

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.980
but being able to test and verify that
that fragment

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:29.990
that fragment
 

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.680
that fragment
doing the right thing so super useful

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:32.690
doing the right thing so super useful
 

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.630
doing the right thing so super useful
for things like espresso tests where you

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:34.640
for things like espresso tests where you
 

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.310
for things like espresso tests where you
do want to test that logic right your

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320
do want to test that logic right your
 

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.490
do want to test that logic right your
business logic separate object but your

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:39.500
business logic separate object but your
 

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.980
business logic separate object but your
UI logic right what happens when you

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:41.990
UI logic right what happens when you
 

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.780
UI logic right what happens when you
click that button is still something

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:43.790
click that button is still something
 

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.170
click that button is still something
that we want to verify is correct now

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:47.180
that we want to verify is correct now
 

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.490
that we want to verify is correct now
the nice part about this it's called

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500
the nice part about this it's called
 

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.350
the nice part about this it's called
fragment scenario because it's actually

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360
fragment scenario because it's actually
 

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.510
fragment scenario because it's actually
built on a different class called

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:52.520
built on a different class called
 

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.240
built on a different class called
activity scenario which is part of the

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.250
activity scenario which is part of the
 

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.790
activity scenario which is part of the
Android X testing team and actually the

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800
Android X testing team and actually the
 

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.769
Android X testing team and actually the
testing team was instrumental in getting

00:15:59.769 --> 00:15:59.779
testing team was instrumental in getting
 

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:03.010
testing team was instrumental in getting
fragment scenario out there but the best

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:03.020
fragment scenario out there but the best
 

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.900
fragment scenario out there but the best
part about this whole scenario is that

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:04.910
part about this whole scenario is that
 

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.240
part about this whole scenario is that
it works both on instrumentation tests

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.250
it works both on instrumentation tests
 

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.180
it works both on instrumentation tests
tests on your actual device and on

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:10.190
tests on your actual device and on
 

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.010
tests on your actual device and on
robolectric

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.020
robolectric
 

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.050
robolectric
so you get one test framework that works

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:14.060
so you get one test framework that works
 

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.420
so you get one test framework that works
on both of these so really exciting

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.430
on both of these so really exciting
 

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.040
on both of these so really exciting
opportunity and something that now you

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.050
opportunity and something that now you
 

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.560
opportunity and something that now you
can test with fragments so what does

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:20.570
can test with fragments so what does
 

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.800
can test with fragments so what does
this look like so let's say we want to

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:23.810
this look like so let's say we want to
 

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.350
this look like so let's say we want to
test our profile fragment right we did

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360
test our profile fragment right we did
 

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.750
test our profile fragment right we did
our directions thing right we're passing

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:28.760
our directions thing right we're passing
 

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.040
our directions thing right we're passing
in a fake user ID here and we call

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.050
in a fake user ID here and we call
 

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.430
in a fake user ID here and we call
launch fragment in container not that's

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440
launch fragment in container not that's
 

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.210
launch fragment in container not that's
it the this one line has both created an

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220
it the this one line has both created an
 

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.430
it the this one line has both created an
empty hosting activity added the

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440
empty hosting activity added the
 

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.860
empty hosting activity added the
fragment to it and waited it for it to

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:44.870
fragment to it and waited it for it to
 

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.280
fragment to it and waited it for it to
be resumed and now it's ready like you

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:48.290
be resumed and now it's ready like you
 

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.889
be resumed and now it's ready like you
can now use this fragment so if you want

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:50.899
can now use this fragment so if you want
 

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:53.530
can now use this fragment so if you want
to call on fragment and run some code on

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:53.540
to call on fragment and run some code on
 

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.050
to call on fragment and run some code on
your fragment and say like well is the

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:56.060
your fragment and say like well is the
 

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.210
your fragment and say like well is the
fragment in the right state great you

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.220
fragment in the right state great you
 

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.310
fragment in the right state great you
can do that here we're just gonna check

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320
can do that here we're just gonna check
 

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.110
can do that here we're just gonna check
to see if our args are what we think

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120
to see if our args are what we think
 

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.079
to see if our args are what we think
they are we've passed in a user ID we

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:05.089
they are we've passed in a user ID we
 

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.150
they are we've passed in a user ID we
can use the other half of safe args

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160
can use the other half of safe args
 

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.850
can use the other half of safe args
using the args class another generated

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:09.860
using the args class another generated
 

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.549
using the args class another generated
class and just say like well is the args

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559
class and just say like well is the args
 

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.100
class and just say like well is the args
user ID actually equal to the user ID we

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.110
user ID actually equal to the user ID we
 

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.439
user ID actually equal to the user ID we
passed in right did we not mess up on

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:17.449
passed in right did we not mess up on
 

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:19.600
passed in right did we not mess up on
all that sort of stuff but you can see

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:19.610
all that sort of stuff but you can see
 

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.880
all that sort of stuff but you can see
if you could run any logic any method on

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:21.890
if you could run any logic any method on
 

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.329
if you could run any logic any method on
your fragment right from here or we just

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:25.339
your fragment right from here or we just
 

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.790
your fragment right from here or we just
run espresso tests right you say is the

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:27.800
run espresso tests right you say is the
 

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.620
run espresso tests right you say is the
username actually equal to the user ID

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.630
username actually equal to the user ID
 

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.600
username actually equal to the user ID
we passed in right when we click the

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:31.610
we passed in right when we click the
 

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.730
we passed in right when we click the
subscribe button does it actually change

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:33.740
subscribe button does it actually change
 

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.220
subscribe button does it actually change
the text to subscribed right does it do

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.230
the text to subscribed right does it do
 

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.770
the text to subscribed right does it do
its thing right and all we can do this

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:38.780
its thing right and all we can do this
 

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.930
its thing right and all we can do this
with just that one line of launch

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:40.940
with just that one line of launch
 

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.870
with just that one line of launch
fragment in container four

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880
fragment in container four
 

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.700
fragment in container four
the users it'll be fragment scenario

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:45.710
the users it'll be fragment scenario
 

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.360
the users it'll be fragment scenario
launch in container we obviously make

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.370
launch in container we obviously make
 

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.690
launch in container we obviously make
that a little bit nicer for you guys but

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:52.700
that a little bit nicer for you guys but
 

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.440
that a little bit nicer for you guys but
you don't test a fragment in isolation

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:56.450
you don't test a fragment in isolation
 

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.990
you don't test a fragment in isolation
because you know fragments do talk to

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000
because you know fragments do talk to
 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.600
because you know fragments do talk to
other fragments right and like I work on

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:01.610
other fragments right and like I work on
 

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.790
other fragments right and like I work on
navigation so there's that other bit of

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:03.800
navigation so there's that other bit of
 

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.880
navigation so there's that other bit of
testing of how can we test the links

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:06.890
testing of how can we test the links
 

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.610
testing of how can we test the links
between different destinations right

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:09.620
between different destinations right
 

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.190
between different destinations right
between different fragments and really

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200
between different fragments and really
 

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.130
between different fragments and really
the nice part here that we have because

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.140
the nice part here that we have because
 

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.380
the nice part here that we have because
we're using these higher-level

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:16.390
we're using these higher-level
 

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.670
we're using these higher-level
components and not something like

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:18.680
components and not something like
 

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.930
components and not something like
activity is that we have unlockable

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:22.940
activity is that we have unlockable
 

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.540
activity is that we have unlockable
layer right one of the things that we

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:25.550
layer right one of the things that we
 

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.300
layer right one of the things that we
found when building navigation is that

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:28.310
found when building navigation is that
 

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.610
found when building navigation is that
most companies once they got to a

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:30.620
most companies once they got to a
 

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.470
most companies once they got to a
certain point and they're like wow we

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480
certain point and they're like wow we
 

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.270
certain point and they're like wow we
should add some testing and they're like

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280
should add some testing and they're like
 

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.980
should add some testing and they're like
wow we can't really test start

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:35.990
wow we can't really test start
 

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.090
wow we can't really test start
activities so they built their own

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.100
activities so they built their own
 

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.880
activities so they built their own
navigator which just provides a layer to

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:39.890
navigator which just provides a layer to
 

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.490
navigator which just provides a layer to
mock out the start activity calls

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:42.500
mock out the start activity calls
 

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.490
mock out the start activity calls
well that that layer is handled for you

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:45.500
well that that layer is handled for you
 

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.740
well that that layer is handled for you
it's called nav controller we test nav

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:47.750
it's called nav controller we test nav
 

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.560
it's called nav controller we test nav
controller so now what we can do in our

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:50.570
controller so now what we can do in our
 

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.170
controller so now what we can do in our
activities is just mock out that nav

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:53.180
activities is just mock out that nav
 

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.040
activities is just mock out that nav
controller and confirm that yes you're

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.050
controller and confirm that yes you're
 

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.190
controller and confirm that yes you're
calling the right navigate calls so here

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200
calling the right navigate calls so here
 

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.020
calling the right navigate calls so here
we have our profile fragment again and

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.030
we have our profile fragment again and
 

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.300
we have our profile fragment again and
now it's getting our user ID and really

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.310
now it's getting our user ID and really
 

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.270
now it's getting our user ID and really
what we want to test is this on view

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280
what we want to test is this on view
 

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.280
what we want to test is this on view
subscribers button alright so you could

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:09.290
subscribers button alright so you could
 

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.720
subscribers button alright so you could
tell like all right well we click this

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:10.730
tell like all right well we click this
 

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.330
tell like all right well we click this
and like oh my god it's like doing

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:13.340
and like oh my god it's like doing
 

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.790
and like oh my god it's like doing
something complicated in the fragment

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:15.800
something complicated in the fragment
 

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.560
something complicated in the fragment
how are we going to test this

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:17.570
how are we going to test this
 

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.690
how are we going to test this
here it's calling navigate right like

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:19.700
here it's calling navigate right like
 

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.280
here it's calling navigate right like
how can we make sure that this is

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.290
how can we make sure that this is
 

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.520
how can we make sure that this is
actually doing what we want it to do

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:23.530
actually doing what we want it to do
 

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.350
actually doing what we want it to do
well it's pretty easy we can do our

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360
well it's pretty easy we can do our
 

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.970
well it's pretty easy we can do our
scenario thing just the same launch

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:27.980
scenario thing just the same launch
 

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.480
scenario thing just the same launch
fragment and now we can just mock out or

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.490
fragment and now we can just mock out or
 

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.570
fragment and now we can just mock out or
a nav controller and now you call on

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:34.580
a nav controller and now you call on
 

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.060
a nav controller and now you call on
fragment and what we're doing here is

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.070
fragment and what we're doing here is
 

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.420
fragment and what we're doing here is
actually just creating our own nav

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:40.430
actually just creating our own nav
 

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.850
actually just creating our own nav
controller right there's no nav host

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:42.860
controller right there's no nav host
 

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.050
controller right there's no nav host
here but we can just eject one right

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.060
here but we can just eject one right
 

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.390
here but we can just eject one right
this is actually what nav host fragment

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400
this is actually what nav host fragment
 

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.730
this is actually what nav host fragment
is doing under the covers it's calling

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:51.740
is doing under the covers it's calling
 

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.820
is doing under the covers it's calling
sat nav controller on a view and saying

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:54.830
sat nav controller on a view and saying
 

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.200
sat nav controller on a view and saying
here's my nav controller but now

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.210
here's my nav controller but now
 

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.570
here's my nav controller but now
we've done is from this fragments point

00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580
we've done is from this fragments point
 

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.580
we've done is from this fragments point
of view it has a navigation controller

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.590
of view it has a navigation controller
 

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.820
of view it has a navigation controller
all those fine nav controls or calls

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:04.830
all those fine nav controls or calls
 

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.520
all those fine nav controls or calls
that normally you'd have to inject

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:07.530
that normally you'd have to inject
 

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.680
that normally you'd have to inject
something in to get your nav controller

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:09.690
something in to get your nav controller
 

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.290
something in to get your nav controller
now it just it just works like they're

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:12.300
now it just it just works like they're
 

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.320
now it just it just works like they're
in there right and now we can just run

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:15.330
in there right and now we can just run
 

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.720
in there right and now we can just run
espresso tests and say like click on the

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:17.730
espresso tests and say like click on the
 

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.210
espresso tests and say like click on the
view subscribers button and the nice

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220
view subscribers button and the nice
 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.860
view subscribers button and the nice
part is is that because we're using

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:21.870
part is is that because we're using
 

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.230
part is is that because we're using
these directions class we can use them

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240
these directions class we can use them
 

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.870
these directions class we can use them
also in our tests and because they

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880
also in our tests and because they
 

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.630
also in our tests and because they
implement equals we can just do a simple

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640
implement equals we can just do a simple
 

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.910
implement equals we can just do a simple
verify and say verify did you actually

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:31.920
verify and say verify did you actually
 

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.770
verify and say verify did you actually
navigate to where we think you're

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780
navigate to where we think you're
 

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.080
navigate to where we think you're
navigating all right and even if there's

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.090
navigating all right and even if there's
 

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.360
navigating all right and even if there's
a lot of parameters in there if there's

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:38.370
a lot of parameters in there if there's
 

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.150
a lot of parameters in there if there's
extras and other options in there we can

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160
extras and other options in there we can
 

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.330
extras and other options in there we can
now just verify right and this makes it

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340
now just verify right and this makes it
 

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.860
now just verify right and this makes it
so much easier to test those

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:45.870
so much easier to test those
 

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.780
so much easier to test those
interconnections between each

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:47.790
interconnections between each
 

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:53.480
interconnections between each
destination so nav controller is kind of

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.490
destination so nav controller is kind of
 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.060
destination so nav controller is kind of
a special case because we find an app

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.070
a special case because we find an app
 

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.400
a special case because we find an app
controller right so many other things

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.410
controller right so many other things
 

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.540
controller right so many other things
aren't a service locator kind of pattern

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:02.550
aren't a service locator kind of pattern
 

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.640
aren't a service locator kind of pattern
it's we need to inject in those

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:04.650
it's we need to inject in those
 

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.400
it's we need to inject in those
dependencies and this is another one of

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:07.410
dependencies and this is another one of
 

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.800
dependencies and this is another one of
those like 6 years too late kind of a

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:09.810
those like 6 years too late kind of a
 

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.730
those like 6 years too late kind of a
thing

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740
thing
 

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.760
thing
but we're finally working on it so

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:13.770
but we're finally working on it so
 

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.570
but we're finally working on it so
there's a class in Android P called app

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580
there's a class in Android P called app
 

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.770
there's a class in Android P called app
component Factory

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780
component Factory
 

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.810
component Factory
which allows you to construct activities

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820
which allows you to construct activities
 

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.000
which allows you to construct activities
services broadcast receivers and

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.010
services broadcast receivers and
 

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.990
services broadcast receivers and
services all via dependency injection

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000
services all via dependency injection
 

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.540
services all via dependency injection
right you get a chance of calling the

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:29.550
right you get a chance of calling the
 

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.850
right you get a chance of calling the
constructor instead of the system

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860
constructor instead of the system
 

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.160
constructor instead of the system
calling your constructor same thing here

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.170
calling your constructor same thing here
 

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.770
calling your constructor same thing here
with fragments where now you can't

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780
with fragments where now you can't
 

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.530
with fragments where now you can't
actually do constructor injection into

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:39.540
actually do constructor injection into
 

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.990
actually do constructor injection into
fragments right you no longer need to

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000
fragments right you no longer need to
 

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.170
fragments right you no longer need to
only have a no args constructor to use

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:45.180
only have a no args constructor to use
 

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.450
only have a no args constructor to use
fragments you can use a fragment factory

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460
fragments you can use a fragment factory
 

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.380
fragments you can use a fragment factory
to instantiate your fragments for you so

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.390
to instantiate your fragments for you so
 

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.930
to instantiate your fragments for you so
this is really useful also for cases

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940
this is really useful also for cases
 

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.480
this is really useful also for cases
where your fragment was like casting

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:56.490
where your fragment was like casting
 

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.910
where your fragment was like casting
your activity to something I know we

00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:58.920
your activity to something I know we
 

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.790
your activity to something I know we
probably still have a template that does

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:01.800
probably still have a template that does
 

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.540
probably still have a template that does
this we'll fix that and there's a lot of

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:05.550
this we'll fix that and there's a lot of
 

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.700
this we'll fix that and there's a lot of
ways where really we want to inject in

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:07.710
ways where really we want to inject in
 

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.710
ways where really we want to inject in
all of those external dependencies so we

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720
all of those external dependencies so we
 

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.550
all of those external dependencies so we
can test

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:10.560
can test
 

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.400
can test
again in isolation and fragment factory

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.410
again in isolation and fragment factory
 

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.840
again in isolation and fragment factory
works great with our fragment scenario

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:17.850
works great with our fragment scenario
 

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.000
works great with our fragment scenario
so what does this look like we know how

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.010
so what does this look like we know how
 

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.970
so what does this look like we know how
to test a view model right it's just an

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980
to test a view model right it's just an
 

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.010
to test a view model right it's just an
object you instantiate it you do the

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020
object you instantiate it you do the
 

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.110
object you instantiate it you do the
thing and it has a real method called

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120
thing and it has a real method called
 

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.960
thing and it has a real method called
subscribe right but really we want to

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:29.970
subscribe right but really we want to
 

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.870
subscribe right but really we want to
test our fragment and our fragment has a

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880
test our fragment and our fragment has a
 

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.820
test our fragment and our fragment has a
non subscribed method that calls you

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:34.830
non subscribed method that calls you
 

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.040
non subscribed method that calls you
model dot Subscribe right and it does

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.050
model dot Subscribe right and it does
 

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.470
model dot Subscribe right and it does
its thing how do we get this view model

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480
its thing how do we get this view model
 

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.940
its thing how do we get this view model
well we can inject the factory itself

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:42.950
well we can inject the factory itself
 

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.600
well we can inject the factory itself
inject the view model Factory and here

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:47.610
inject the view model Factory and here
 

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.070
inject the view model Factory and here
we're using some of the other new stuff

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080
we're using some of the other new stuff
 

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.500
we're using some of the other new stuff
in fragment 1.1 this by view models

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:51.510
in fragment 1.1 this by view models
 

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.680
in fragment 1.1 this by view models
another collin property delegate that

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:54.690
another collin property delegate that
 

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.230
another collin property delegate that
does all that view model providers of

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240
does all that view model providers of
 

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.890
does all that view model providers of
kind of stuff for you but we now have a

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900
kind of stuff for you but we now have a
 

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.750
kind of stuff for you but we now have a
fragment that well we've injected

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760
fragment that well we've injected
 

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.000
fragment that well we've injected
something but then we still need to test

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.010
something but then we still need to test
 

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.130
something but then we still need to test
like okay well did it actually call

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140
like okay well did it actually call
 

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.200
like okay well did it actually call
subscribe right we're back to the same

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.210
subscribe right we're back to the same
 

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.750
subscribe right we're back to the same
situation of building testable code so

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760
situation of building testable code so
 

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.180
situation of building testable code so
we can build a navigation activity this

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:17.190
we can build a navigation activity this
 

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.470
we can build a navigation activity this
is what it's going to look like in real

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480
is what it's going to look like in real
 

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.020
is what it's going to look like in real
life right we're going to inject our

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.030
life right we're going to inject our
 

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.260
life right we're going to inject our
view model factory and then because code

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:24.270
view model factory and then because code
 

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.350
view model factory and then because code
is hard and I wanted to write things on

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360
is hard and I wanted to write things on
 

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.170
is hard and I wanted to write things on
slides I built a helper class called an

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:30.180
slides I built a helper class called an
 

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.450
slides I built a helper class called an
initializer fragment Factory that

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460
initializer fragment Factory that
 

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.100
initializer fragment Factory that
basically you just call add initializer

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.110
basically you just call add initializer
 

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.490
basically you just call add initializer
for each fragment and we call that

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500
for each fragment and we call that
 

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.500
for each fragment and we call that
method to construct your fragment rather

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:39.510
method to construct your fragment rather
 

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.680
method to construct your fragment rather
than use the default no Arg constructor

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:42.690
than use the default no Arg constructor
 

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.200
than use the default no Arg constructor
so a little bit of magic there's a link

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.210
so a little bit of magic there's a link
 

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.670
so a little bit of magic there's a link
here if you want to check it out

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:46.680
here if you want to check it out
 

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.290
here if you want to check it out
we're looking at trying to integrate

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:48.300
we're looking at trying to integrate
 

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.720
we're looking at trying to integrate
this more deeply into the actual library

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.730
this more deeply into the actual library
 

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.000
this more deeply into the actual library
itself but once you've called this

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.010
itself but once you've called this
 

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.790
itself but once you've called this
fragment factory now whenever your

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:55.800
fragment factory now whenever your
 

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.760
fragment factory now whenever your
activity creates a profile fragment

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:58.770
activity creates a profile fragment
 

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.620
activity creates a profile fragment
instead of using that no art constructor

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.630
instead of using that no art constructor
 

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.840
instead of using that no art constructor
it's gonna use this constructor it's

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:02.850
it's gonna use this constructor it's
 

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.990
it's gonna use this constructor it's
gonna pass in our view model Factory

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000
gonna pass in our view model Factory
 

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.260
gonna pass in our view model Factory
great

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.270
great
 

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:11.000
great
so our activity looks fine but our tests

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.010
so our activity looks fine but our tests
 

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.840
so our activity looks fine but our tests
how's that look well we create a mock of

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:14.850
how's that look well we create a mock of
 

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.990
how's that look well we create a mock of
our profile view model and then we can

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000
our profile view model and then we can
 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.200
our profile view model and then we can
set up a factory for it and then again

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.210
set up a factory for it and then again
 

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.380
set up a factory for it and then again
kind of use a fragment factory here that

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:24.390
kind of use a fragment factory here that
 

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.150
kind of use a fragment factory here that
again does the same type of thing where

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.160
again does the same type of thing where
 

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.060
again does the same type of thing where
we're passing in our mock view model

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.070
we're passing in our mock view model
 

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.390
we're passing in our mock view model
Factory and then our scenario looks

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400
Factory and then our scenario looks
 

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.240
Factory and then our scenario looks
almost the same we just add it in and

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.250
almost the same we just add it in and
 

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.400
almost the same we just add it in and
add instead of just the arguments also

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:37.410
add instead of just the arguments also
 

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.180
add instead of just the arguments also
the fragment Factory great now we can do

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.190
the fragment Factory great now we can do
 

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.240
the fragment Factory great now we can do
our same thing on view perform the click

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.250
our same thing on view perform the click
 

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.480
our same thing on view perform the click
and then verify that yes are mocked out

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:47.490
and then verify that yes are mocked out
 

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.700
and then verify that yes are mocked out
view model did the SUBSCRIBE call

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:49.710
view model did the SUBSCRIBE call
 

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.200
view model did the SUBSCRIBE call
alright so now we have a testable

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.210
alright so now we have a testable
 

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.750
alright so now we have a testable
fragment a testable view model and we've

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760
fragment a testable view model and we've
 

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.000
fragment a testable view model and we've
injected all of the dependencies into

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.010
injected all of the dependencies into
 

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.250
injected all of the dependencies into
our fragment all right we actually have

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260
our fragment all right we actually have
 

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.220
our fragment all right we actually have
a testable thing now we are looking at

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:01.230
a testable thing now we are looking at
 

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.350
a testable thing now we are looking at
some improvements to this API because

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
some improvements to this API because
 

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.300
some improvements to this API because
you know we don't we want make this even

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.310
you know we don't we want make this even
 

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.870
you know we don't we want make this even
easier so in this case because we know

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880
easier so in this case because we know
 

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.270
easier so in this case because we know
you're constructing a profile fragment

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280
you're constructing a profile fragment
 

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.070
you're constructing a profile fragment
but we want to change this into is

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080
but we want to change this into is
 

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.090
but we want to change this into is
actually something that looks like this

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:16.100
actually something that looks like this
 

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.730
actually something that looks like this
where you can say launch and then give

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740
where you can say launch and then give
 

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.370
where you can say launch and then give
it a method saying oh like you launched

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380
it a method saying oh like you launched
 

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.460
it a method saying oh like you launched
this fragment and specifically give it

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:25.470
this fragment and specifically give it
 

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.100
this fragment and specifically give it
the constructed out instance of your

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.110
the constructed out instance of your
 

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.200
the constructed out instance of your
fragment so you don't have to actually

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.210
fragment so you don't have to actually
 

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.940
fragment so you don't have to actually
know that oh it's using a fragment

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:31.950
know that oh it's using a fragment
 

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.340
know that oh it's using a fragment
factory under the hood you can test just

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.350
factory under the hood you can test just
 

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:39.560
factory under the hood you can test just
one fragment just fine now there are a

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:39.570
one fragment just fine now there are a
 

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.770
one fragment just fine now there are a
few cases where you might think oh man

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:42.780
few cases where you might think oh man
 

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.620
few cases where you might think oh man
maybe I do need multiple activities and

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:47.630
maybe I do need multiple activities and
 

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.880
maybe I do need multiple activities and
there's got to be reasons to use

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:49.890
there's got to be reasons to use
 

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.320
there's got to be reasons to use
multiple activities besides just

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:51.330
multiple activities besides just
 

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.860
multiple activities besides just
momentum right I understand a lot of

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:54.870
momentum right I understand a lot of
 

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.660
momentum right I understand a lot of
apps if you have multiple activities

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:56.670
apps if you have multiple activities
 

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.300
apps if you have multiple activities
right now this isn't actually an easy

00:25:59.300 --> 00:25:59.310
right now this isn't actually an easy
 

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.000
right now this isn't actually an easy
sell right so there are a few cases

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.010
sell right so there are a few cases
 

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.000
sell right so there are a few cases
where even today we do recommend using

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.010
where even today we do recommend using
 

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:10.270
where even today we do recommend using
multiple activities not a lot though so

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:10.280
multiple activities not a lot though so
 

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.010
multiple activities not a lot though so
what I'd like to say is you don't

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020
what I'd like to say is you don't
 

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.100
what I'd like to say is you don't
actually need multiply DVDs what you

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.110
actually need multiply DVDs what you
 

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.960
actually need multiply DVDs what you
need are multiple tasks so what are

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:20.970
need are multiple tasks so what are
 

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.410
need are multiple tasks so what are
tasks tasks are actually the thing that

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:24.420
tasks tasks are actually the thing that
 

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.800
tasks tasks are actually the thing that
users are actually interacting with so a

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:27.810
users are actually interacting with so a
 

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.130
users are actually interacting with so a
task is a stack of activities and each

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140
task is a stack of activities and each
 

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.220
task is a stack of activities and each
task has a back stack so in your

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:34.230
task has a back stack so in your
 

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.710
task has a back stack so in your
overview menu here each one of these

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720
overview menu here each one of these
 

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.910
overview menu here each one of these
entries

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:37.920
entries
 

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.090
entries
isn't just an activity it's actually a

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100
isn't just an activity it's actually a
 

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.360
isn't just an activity it's actually a
whole task stack right so you're only

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:44.370
whole task stack right so you're only
 

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.150
whole task stack right so you're only
just seeing the topmost activity of that

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:47.160
just seeing the topmost activity of that
 

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.660
just seeing the topmost activity of that
stack right so each element here is a

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:50.670
stack right so each element here is a
 

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.410
stack right so each element here is a
stack right when you're doing split

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:54.420
stack right when you're doing split
 

00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:00.110
stack right when you're doing split
screen multi tasks side-by-side right on

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120
screen multi tasks side-by-side right on
 

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.830
screen multi tasks side-by-side right on
Chrome OS devices things that support

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840
Chrome OS devices things that support
 

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.440
Chrome OS devices things that support
floating multi-window each one of these

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:06.450
floating multi-window each one of these
 

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.380
floating multi-window each one of these
tasks is a window it's a one-to-one

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:09.390
tasks is a window it's a one-to-one
 

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.880
tasks is a window it's a one-to-one
between windows and tasks not activities

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:13.890
between windows and tasks not activities
 

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:19.390
between windows and tasks not activities
and windows tasks and windows right so

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:19.400
and windows tasks and windows right so
 

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.880
and windows tasks and windows right so
launching a new task on one of these

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:22.890
launching a new task on one of these
 

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.410
launching a new task on one of these
Chrome OS devices gives you a new window

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:26.420
Chrome OS devices gives you a new window
 

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.090
Chrome OS devices gives you a new window
right so your app maybe it doesn't need

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.100
right so your app maybe it doesn't need
 

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.710
right so your app maybe it doesn't need
multiple activities but maybe it wants

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720
multiple activities but maybe it wants
 

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.260
multiple activities but maybe it wants
multiple windows right so this is the

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:39.270
multiple windows right so this is the
 

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.880
multiple windows right so this is the
case where yes you need to use

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:40.890
case where yes you need to use
 

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.700
case where yes you need to use
activities under the hood each one of

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:43.710
activities under the hood each one of
 

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.100
activities under the hood each one of
these tasks is going to be a separate

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.110
these tasks is going to be a separate
 

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.600
these tasks is going to be a separate
activity but you may not use some of the

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:50.610
activity but you may not use some of the
 

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.390
activity but you may not use some of the
other things such as a stack of

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400
other things such as a stack of
 

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.080
other things such as a stack of
activities in one task so what does this

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.090
activities in one task so what does this
 

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.650
activities in one task so what does this
actually look like a lot of this is that

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:00.660
actually look like a lot of this is that
 

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.090
actually look like a lot of this is that
there are a lot of different ways of

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100
there are a lot of different ways of
 

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.150
there are a lot of different ways of
saying new tasks right has anyone looked

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:05.160
saying new tasks right has anyone looked
 

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.400
saying new tasks right has anyone looked
at all those wonderful launch mode flags

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.410
at all those wonderful launch mode flags
 

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.360
at all those wonderful launch mode flags
and all that fun yeah how many people

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:11.370
and all that fun yeah how many people
 

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:16.250
and all that fun yeah how many people
have you are still saying okay well I'll

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260
have you are still saying okay well I'll
 

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.040
have you are still saying okay well I'll
say that there were a lot of good flags

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.050
say that there were a lot of good flags
 

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.810
say that there were a lot of good flags
out there in Android one they were great

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820
out there in Android one they were great
 

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:29.420
out there in Android one they were great
back in Android one in today in 2018

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:29.430
back in Android one in today in 2018
 

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.120
back in Android one in today in 2018
they're maybe not the best thing to use

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.130
they're maybe not the best thing to use
 

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.170
they're maybe not the best thing to use
what you actually want to use is

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:33.180
what you actually want to use is
 

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.050
what you actually want to use is
document launch mode now document launch

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.060
document launch mode now document launch
 

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.740
document launch mode now document launch
mode was added actually an API 21 so

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:39.750
mode was added actually an API 21 so
 

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.350
mode was added actually an API 21 so
please like if you're thinking about pre

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360
please like if you're thinking about pre
 

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.020
please like if you're thinking about pre
API 21 first what are you doing

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.030
API 21 first what are you doing
 

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.590
API 21 first what are you doing
and second probably try and steer away

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600
and second probably try and steer away
 

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.650
and second probably try and steer away
from hacky solutions maybe it's just not

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:51.660
from hacky solutions maybe it's just not

for those users but try and avoid things

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:56.280
for those users but try and avoid things
 

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.460
for those users but try and avoid things
like launch mode flags and task affinity

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:58.470
like launch mode flags and task affinity
 

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.130
like launch mode flags and task affinity
and those type of things because while

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140
and those type of things because while
 

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.490
and those type of things because while
the framework does honor those maybe

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500
the framework does honor those maybe
 

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.620
the framework does honor those maybe
doesn't honor them in the way you want

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:06.630
doesn't honor them in the way you want
 

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.100
doesn't honor them in the way you want
them to honor there's certainly a very

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.110
them to honor there's certainly a very
 

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.140
them to honor there's certainly a very
different kind of thing so what can you

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.150
different kind of thing so what can you
 

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.210
different kind of thing so what can you
actually do with document launch mode

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220
actually do with document launch mode
 

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.420
actually do with document launch mode
well the biggest thing is multitasking

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:17.430
well the biggest thing is multitasking
 

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.740
well the biggest thing is multitasking
right if you can have multiple tasks

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:20.750
right if you can have multiple tasks
 

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.110
right if you can have multiple tasks
then you can have multiple windows right

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120
then you can have multiple windows right
 

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.030
then you can have multiple windows right
you got multiple entries in your

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:26.040
you got multiple entries in your
 

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.120
you got multiple entries in your
overview screen so the first way of

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.130
overview screen so the first way of
 

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.220
overview screen so the first way of
really doing multitasking is into

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:31.230
really doing multitasking is into
 

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.370
really doing multitasking is into
existing now into existing basically

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380
existing now into existing basically
 

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.330
existing now into existing basically
means whenever I launch this activity

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:37.340
means whenever I launch this activity
 

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:42.020
means whenever I launch this activity
that activity has its own task right

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.030
that activity has its own task right
 

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.790
that activity has its own task right
every time you launch this activity it

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:43.800
every time you launch this activity it
 

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.730
every time you launch this activity it
has its own task but if we already have

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740
has its own task but if we already have
 

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.180
has its own task but if we already have
launched that task don't create a second

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.190
launched that task don't create a second
 

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.070
launched that task don't create a second
and a third copy right so this is really

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080
and a third copy right so this is really
 

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.220
and a third copy right so this is really
useful for things like documents

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.230
useful for things like documents
 

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.720
useful for things like documents
conversations things where someone might

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:56.730
conversations things where someone might
 

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.120
conversations things where someone might
want to side by side compare two

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.130
want to side by side compare two
 

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.500
want to side by side compare two
different documents right if they're

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:00.510
different documents right if they're
 

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.600
different documents right if they're
copy pasting from one document to the

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:02.610
copy pasting from one document to the
 

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:02.870
copy pasting from one document to the
other

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880
other
 

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.150
other
they're not gonna exit out of one dock

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:05.160
they're not gonna exit out of one dock
 

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.150
they're not gonna exit out of one dock
open one copy it and then open the other

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:08.160
open one copy it and then open the other
 

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.980
open one copy it and then open the other
one and then copy it into there right

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:09.990
one and then copy it into there right
 

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.740
one and then copy it into there right
this is kind of taking that multitasking

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:12.750
this is kind of taking that multitasking
 

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.410
this is kind of taking that multitasking
model that is Android that is that

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:15.420
model that is Android that is that
 

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.660
model that is Android that is that
recent screen and making it so that your

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:17.670
recent screen and making it so that your
 

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.660
recent screen and making it so that your
app actually gets to use this now of

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:20.670
app actually gets to use this now of
 

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.030
app actually gets to use this now of
course the into existing assumes you

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:23.040
course the into existing assumes you
 

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.030
course the into existing assumes you
have some notion of uniqueness right so

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.040
have some notion of uniqueness right so
 

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.280
have some notion of uniqueness right so
it does assume that from an intent

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:28.290
it does assume that from an intent
 

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.100
it does assume that from an intent
filter equals kind of point of view like

filter equals kind of point of view like
 

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.590
filter equals kind of point of view like

if you're using the data URI on your
 

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.990
if you're using the data URI on your

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.450
unique ID write a conversation ID a
 

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.350
unique ID write a conversation ID a
document ID something to uniquely define

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360

document ID something to uniquely define
that task in and of itself now one great

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200
that task in and of itself now one great
 

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.960
that task in and of itself now one great
example of this that you can try out on

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:47.970
example of this that you can try out on
 

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.050
example of this that you can try out on
your phones is Google Docs so Google

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.060
your phones is Google Docs so Google
 

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.240
your phones is Google Docs so Google
Docs when you open a doc it actually

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:53.250
Docs when you open a doc it actually
 

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.020
Docs when you open a doc it actually
launches it in another task and if you

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.030
launches it in another task and if you
 

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.850
launches it in another task and if you
have multiple Doc's you can actually

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860
have multiple Doc's you can actually
 

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.870
have multiple Doc's you can actually
load them up side-by-side on a phone two

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880
load them up side-by-side on a phone two
 

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.790
load them up side-by-side on a phone two
different windows on a Chrome OS device

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:04.800
different windows on a Chrome OS device
 

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.580
different windows on a Chrome OS device
and

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:05.590
and
 

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.409
and
just works right even though it's one

00:31:07.409 --> 00:31:07.419
just works right even though it's one
 

00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:10.649
just works right even though it's one
app it can have multiple windows and

00:31:10.649 --> 00:31:10.659
app it can have multiple windows and
 

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:12.840
app it can have multiple windows and
really allow a different level of

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:12.850
really allow a different level of
 

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.890
really allow a different level of
multitasking between different things so

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:16.900
multitasking between different things so
 

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.560
multitasking between different things so
another big one is creating new content

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:19.570
another big one is creating new content
 

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.200
another big one is creating new content
so new contents a little different

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.210
so new contents a little different
 

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.480
so new contents a little different
because there's not really any unique ID

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:24.490
because there's not really any unique ID
 

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.940
because there's not really any unique ID
right but you still want that kind of

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:26.950
right but you still want that kind of
 

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.549
right but you still want that kind of
multitasking behavior where you can

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559
multitasking behavior where you can
 

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:32.490
multitasking behavior where you can
reference existing material while you're

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:32.500
reference existing material while you're
 

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.519
reference existing material while you're
creating something new all right so the

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:35.529
creating something new all right so the
 

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:37.919
creating something new all right so the
always flag is very similar to into

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:37.929
always flag is very similar to into
 

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:40.529
always flag is very similar to into
existing but it just always creates

00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:40.539
existing but it just always creates
 

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:42.539
existing but it just always creates
something new right Wow it's like self

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:42.549
something new right Wow it's like self
 

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:44.930
something new right Wow it's like self
descriptive names we can do this guy's

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940
descriptive names we can do this guy's
 

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.149
descriptive names we can do this guy's
and it allows you to do multiple things

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159
and it allows you to do multiple things
 

00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:50.399
and it allows you to do multiple things
at once right that's great

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:50.409
at once right that's great
 

00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:53.909
at once right that's great
so one example this is Gmail so Gmail

00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919
so one example this is Gmail so Gmail
 

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:56.519
so one example this is Gmail so Gmail
actually uses this kind of mode when you

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:56.529
actually uses this kind of mode when you
 

00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:59.250
actually uses this kind of mode when you
create a new email so this allows you to

00:31:59.250 --> 00:31:59.260
create a new email so this allows you to
 

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.130
create a new email so this allows you to
create a new email and reference your

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.140
create a new email and reference your
 

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.700
create a new email and reference your
existing email at the same time magic

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:05.710
existing email at the same time magic
 

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.610
existing email at the same time magic
write it this is the equivalent on

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:08.620
write it this is the equivalent on
 

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.130
write it this is the equivalent on
mobile of when you do it on the web and

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:11.140
mobile of when you do it on the web and
 

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.200
mobile of when you do it on the web and
it pops up a little Mole that's separate

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.210
it pops up a little Mole that's separate
 

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.580
it pops up a little Mole that's separate
from the other one right you still need

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:14.590
from the other one right you still need
 

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.010
from the other one right you still need
that other material as reference even

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.020
that other material as reference even
 

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.139
that other material as reference even
when you're creating something new of

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:19.149
when you're creating something new of
 

00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:21.210
when you're creating something new of
course on a phone or on a tablet it

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:21.220
course on a phone or on a tablet it
 

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.600
course on a phone or on a tablet it
looks slightly different the other case

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:24.610
looks slightly different the other case
 

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.389
looks slightly different the other case
is picture and picture now a picture and

00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399
is picture and picture now a picture and
 

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:29.669
is picture and picture now a picture and
picture actually has two entirely

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679
picture actually has two entirely
 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:32.250
picture actually has two entirely
separate modes for how you want to

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:32.260
separate modes for how you want to
 

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.980
separate modes for how you want to
approach picture and picture one is

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:34.990
approach picture and picture one is
 

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.380
approach picture and picture one is
using a separate task right this would

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:37.390
using a separate task right this would
 

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.870
using a separate task right this would
be a separate activity just for your

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880
be a separate activity just for your
 

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.299
be a separate activity just for your
playback so this is really common on

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:42.309
playback so this is really common on
 

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:44.639
playback so this is really common on
Android TV devices for example Google

00:32:44.639 --> 00:32:44.649
Android TV devices for example Google
 

00:32:44.649 --> 00:32:48.000
Android TV devices for example Google
Play movies &amp; TV uses this approach so

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.010
Play movies &amp; TV uses this approach so
 

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.100
Play movies &amp; TV uses this approach so
that you can actually put things into

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.110
that you can actually put things into
 

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.230
that you can actually put things into
picture in picture mode and then browse

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240
picture in picture mode and then browse
 

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.029
picture in picture mode and then browse
through other movies so in this mode

00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039
through other movies so in this mode
 

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:59.450
through other movies so in this mode
it's very much that you have a specific

00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460
it's very much that you have a specific
 

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.519
it's very much that you have a specific
picture and picture mode button in your

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:02.529
picture and picture mode button in your
 

00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:06.389
picture and picture mode button in your
UI the other mode is using just a single

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399
UI the other mode is using just a single
 

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:08.760
UI the other mode is using just a single
task one activity right you actually

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:08.770
task one activity right you actually
 

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.830
task one activity right you actually
don't need anything at all here and this

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840
don't need anything at all here and this
 

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.930
don't need anything at all here and this
is the approach the things like duo and

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:12.940
is the approach the things like duo and
 

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.560
is the approach the things like duo and
Google Maps use where your whole task is

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:16.570
Google Maps use where your whole task is
 

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.400
Google Maps use where your whole task is
becoming the picture-in-picture

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:19.410
becoming the picture-in-picture
 

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.190
becoming the picture-in-picture
right so when would you want to choose

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200
right so when would you want to choose
 

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.500
right so when would you want to choose
one or the other and it's really this

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:25.510
one or the other and it's really this
 

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.000
one or the other and it's really this
case where once I'm in

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.010
case where once I'm in
 

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.280
case where once I'm in
picture-in-picture mode if they were to

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:29.290
picture-in-picture mode if they were to
 

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.770
picture-in-picture mode if they were to
click my launcher icon what would happen

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:31.780
click my launcher icon what would happen
 

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.390
click my launcher icon what would happen
because the launcher icon always

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:33.400
because the launcher icon always
 

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.080
because the launcher icon always
launches the default task right of your

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.090
launches the default task right of your
 

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.370
launches the default task right of your
app so in duos case where they only have

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:41.380
app so in duos case where they only have
 

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.760
app so in duos case where they only have
one task when you launch that duo from

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:44.770
one task when you launch that duo from
 

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.640
one task when you launch that duo from
your launcher icon it's just going to

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:47.650
your launcher icon it's just going to
 

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.490
your launcher icon it's just going to
pop open the picture-in-picture you go

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:50.500
pop open the picture-in-picture you go
 

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.680
pop open the picture-in-picture you go
from a little tiny picture picture to

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:52.690
from a little tiny picture picture to
 

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.780
from a little tiny picture picture to
full screen because it doesn't make

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:54.790
full screen because it doesn't make
 

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.790
full screen because it doesn't make
sense to have multiple conversations

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:56.800
sense to have multiple conversations
 

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.130
sense to have multiple conversations
going at the same time you're never

00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.140
going at the same time you're never
 

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.930
going at the same time you're never
going to replace one with the other

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:00.940
going to replace one with the other
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.550
going to replace one with the other
you're never going to continue to

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:02.560
you're never going to continue to
 

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.750
you're never going to continue to
reference something even though

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760
reference something even though
 

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.420
reference something even though
something is already going alright so

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:06.430
something is already going alright so
 

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.190
something is already going alright so
that's kind of the differentiator here

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200
that's kind of the differentiator here
 

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.080
that's kind of the differentiator here
where do you want to be able to browse

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:10.090
where do you want to be able to browse
 

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.540
where do you want to be able to browse
and picture and picture at the same time

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:12.550
and picture and picture at the same time
 

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.530
and picture and picture at the same time
if you do want to browse then yes you're

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:16.540
if you do want to browse then yes you're
 

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.240
if you do want to browse then yes you're
using the android framework and

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:18.250
using the android framework and
 

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.980
using the android framework and
therefore they need to position those

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:19.990
therefore they need to position those
 

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:22.320
therefore they need to position those
separately two separate tests separate

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.330
separately two separate tests separate
 

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:29.370
separately two separate tests separate
activities but that's that's kind it the

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:29.380
activities but that's that's kind it the
 

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.470
activities but that's that's kind it the
one thing I didn't mention are things

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480
one thing I didn't mention are things
 

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.590
one thing I didn't mention are things
like instant apps now in synapse kind of

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:34.600
like instant apps now in synapse kind of
 

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.350
like instant apps now in synapse kind of
works at the activity level right you

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:37.360
works at the activity level right you
 

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.570
works at the activity level right you
call startactivity it downloads your

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:39.580
call startactivity it downloads your
 

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.520
call startactivity it downloads your
instant at module but there's actually

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:41.530
instant at module but there's actually
 

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.590
instant at module but there's actually
some really exciting things that are

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:43.600
some really exciting things that are
 

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.270
some really exciting things that are
being worked on by the Play team I think

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280
being worked on by the Play team I think
 

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.149
being worked on by the Play team I think
there was a talk here at Android dev Sun

00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159
there was a talk here at Android dev Sun
 

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.340
there was a talk here at Android dev Sun
but a lot of it is around the instant

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:50.350
but a lot of it is around the instant
 

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.680
but a lot of it is around the instant
experience for your app bundle making

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:52.690
experience for your app bundle making
 

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.399
experience for your app bundle making
your whole app instant and also dynamic

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:56.409
your whole app instant and also dynamic
 

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.880
your whole app instant and also dynamic
feature modules now these are really

00:34:59.880 --> 00:34:59.890
feature modules now these are really
 

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.510
feature modules now these are really
interesting ways of adding things on to

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520
interesting ways of adding things on to
 

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.150
interesting ways of adding things on to
the thing that don't require a specific

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160
the thing that don't require a specific
 

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.030
the thing that don't require a specific
app architecture to implement right we

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040
app architecture to implement right we
 

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.620
app architecture to implement right we
can't actually do more things with this

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:10.630
can't actually do more things with this
 

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.650
can't actually do more things with this
so for the instant experience it's

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:13.660
so for the instant experience it's
 

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.860
so for the instant experience it's
adding this distribution instant equals

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:16.870
adding this distribution instant equals
 

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.340
adding this distribution instant equals
true and this means that someone can try

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:20.350
true and this means that someone can try
 

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.400
true and this means that someone can try
your entire app write your entire base

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:23.410
your entire app write your entire base
 

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.460
your entire app write your entire base
module all one's totally instant right

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:26.470
module all one's totally instant right
 

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.520
module all one's totally instant right
and this works really well with things

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:29.530
and this works really well with things
 

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.880
and this works really well with things
like app links so those deep links that

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:32.890
like app links so those deep links that
 

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.120
like app links so those deep links that
I

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.130
I
 

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.849
I
said you could add to any destination

00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859
said you could add to any destination
 

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:38.160
said you could add to any destination
you can also make them into app links by

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.170
you can also make them into app links by
 

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.140
you can also make them into app links by
adding the Auto verifiable true and that

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.150
adding the Auto verifiable true and that
 

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.839
adding the Auto verifiable true and that
means you skip the disambiguation and

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:42.849
means you skip the disambiguation and
 

00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.180
means you skip the disambiguation and
when someone launches your a deep link

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:45.190
when someone launches your a deep link
 

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.849
when someone launches your a deep link
on the web they're going to open up your

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:47.859
on the web they're going to open up your
 

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:50.460
on the web they're going to open up your
instant app experience right they're

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:50.470
instant app experience right they're
 

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.960
instant app experience right they're
going to download that whole base module

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:51.970
going to download that whole base module
 

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.569
going to download that whole base module
for you and your whole navigation graph

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:54.579
for you and your whole navigation graph
 

00:35:54.579 --> 00:35:57.390
for you and your whole navigation graph
is already there ready to go

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400
is already there ready to go
 

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.420
is already there ready to go
but this doesn't work if your app is too

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.430
but this doesn't work if your app is too
 

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.269
but this doesn't work if your app is too
large right so you want to dynamically

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:03.279
large right so you want to dynamically
 

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:06.900
large right so you want to dynamically
deliver things that are not used very

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:06.910
deliver things that are not used very
 

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.180
deliver things that are not used very
often or rather big things right that's

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:09.190
often or rather big things right that's
 

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.670
often or rather big things right that's
what dynamic feature modules are all

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680
what dynamic feature modules are all
 

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.880
what dynamic feature modules are all
about about being able to download them

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:14.890
about about being able to download them
 

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.490
about about being able to download them
on demand now the really interesting

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:17.500
on demand now the really interesting
 

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.950
on demand now the really interesting
part about dynamic feature modules is

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960
part about dynamic feature modules is
 

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.519
part about dynamic feature modules is
that you're adding classes right you

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:23.529
that you're adding classes right you
 

00:36:23.529 --> 00:36:25.829
that you're adding classes right you
don't need to add activities you could

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839
don't need to add activities you could
 

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:28.440
don't need to add activities you could
add just destinations just a number of

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.450
add just destinations just a number of
 

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.870
add just destinations just a number of
fragments all right so in this case you

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880
fragments all right so in this case you
 

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.650
fragments all right so in this case you
can add new destinations on demand just

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:34.660
can add new destinations on demand just
 

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.829
can add new destinations on demand just
because you've built out a XML file for

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839
because you've built out a XML file for
 

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:41.190
because you've built out a XML file for
your navigation graph statically each

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200
your navigation graph statically each
 

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.109
your navigation graph statically each
one of these dynamic feature modules can

00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119
one of these dynamic feature modules can
 

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:47.339
one of these dynamic feature modules can
also add their own navigation graph so

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:47.349
also add their own navigation graph so
 

00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:49.859
also add their own navigation graph so
this means that we're not tied to

00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:49.869
this means that we're not tied to
 

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:52.349
this means that we're not tied to
separate activities we can now actually

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359
separate activities we can now actually
 

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:56.400
separate activities we can now actually
still use one activity now there's still

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.410
still use one activity now there's still
 

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.999
still use one activity now there's still
more to be done here both on the play

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:00.009
more to be done here both on the play
 

00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:02.789
more to be done here both on the play
side and on the navigation side but we

00:37:02.789 --> 00:37:02.799
side and on the navigation side but we
 

00:37:02.799 --> 00:37:04.589
side and on the navigation side but we
want to make this really easy for

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599
want to make this really easy for
 

00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:07.650
want to make this really easy for
developers to use so what we want to get

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:07.660
developers to use so what we want to get
 

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.410
developers to use so what we want to get
to is where you can add something to

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:10.420
to is where you can add something to
 

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.240
to is where you can add something to
your navigation graph with just a

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.250
