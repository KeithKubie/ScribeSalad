Congratulations, you've
finished the course.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.020
You've learned the fundamental skills
needed to build a progressive web app.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.250
And you've put those skills to
use by building one of your own.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.230
Progressive web apps are web apps
that took all the right vitamins.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.630
They combine the best of the web and
the best of the apps.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.220
And give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.170
that they've come to expect from native
apps but delivered through the web.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.320
So go, use your new found skills and
build something awesome.
