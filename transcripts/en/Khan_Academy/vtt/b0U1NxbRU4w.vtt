00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's say we have a circle,
and then we have a

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.280
diameter of the circle.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.080
Let me draw my best diameter.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.760
That's pretty good.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.580
This right here is the diameter
of the circle or it's a

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.700
diameter of the circle.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.110
That's a diameter.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.220
Let's say I have a triangle
where the diameter is one side

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.040
of the triangle, and the angle
opposite that side, it's

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.960
vertex, sits some place
on the circumference.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.200
So, let's say, the angle or the
angle opposite of this diameter

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.260
sits on that circumference.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.020
So the triangle
looks like this.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.160
The triangle looks like that.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.170
What I'm going to show you
in this video is that

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.700
this triangle is going
to be a right triangle.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.040
The 90 degree side is going
to be the side that is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.550
opposite this diameter.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.340
I don't want to label it
just yet because that would

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.140
ruin the fun of the proof.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.070
Now let's see what we
can do to show this.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.910
Well, we have in our tool kit
the notion of an inscribed

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.970
angle, it's relation to
a central angle that

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.830
subtends the same arc.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.720
So let's look at that.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.950
So let's say that this is an
inscribed angle right here.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.760
Let's call this theta.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.070
Now let's say that
that's the center of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.370
my circle right there.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.190
Then this angle right here
would be a central angle.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.620
Let me draw another triangle
right here, another

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.460
line right there.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.130
This is a central
angle right here.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.190
This is a radius.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070
This is the same radius
-- actually this

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.230
distance is the same.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.480
But we've learned several
videos ago that look, this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.710
angle, this inscribed angle,
it subtends this arc up here.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.850
The central angle that subtends
that same arc is going

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.400
to be twice this angle.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.040
We proved that
several videos ago.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.150
So this is going to be 2theta.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.260
It's the central angle
subtending the same arc.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.120
Now, this triangle right here,
this one right here, this

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.620
is an isosceles triangle.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.800
I could rotate it and
draw it like this.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.163
If I flipped it over it would
look like that, that, and then

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:25.000
the green side would
be down like that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.980
And both of these sides
are of length r.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.160
This top angle is 2theta.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.530
So all I did is I took it
and I rotated it around to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.060
draw it for you this way.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.050
This side is that
side right there.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.660
Since its two sides are equal,
this is isosceles, so these to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.980
base angles must be the same.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820
That and that must be the same,
or if I were to draw it up

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.150
here, that and that must be
the exact same base angle.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
Now let me see, I already
used theta, maybe I'll

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.800
use x for these angles.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.230
So this has to be x,
and that has to be x.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.000
So what is x going
to be equal to?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.120
Well, x plus x plus 2theta
have to equal 180 degrees.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.970
They're all in the
same triangle.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.770
So let me write that down.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.010
We get x plus x plus 2theta,
all have to be equal to 180

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.880
degrees, or we get 2x plus
2theta is equal to 180 degrees,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.970
or we get 2x is equal
to 180 minus 2theta.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.980
Divide both sides by 2, you get
x is equal to 90 minus theta.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.590
So x is equal to
90 minus theta.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.890
Now let's see what else
we could do with this.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.130
Well we could look at this
triangle right here.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.160
This triangle, this side over
here also has this distance

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.930
right here is also a
radius of the circle.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.080
This distance over here we've
already labeled it, is

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.060
a radius of a circle.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.870
So once again, this is also
an isosceles triangle.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.770
These two sides are equal,
so these two base angles

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.500
have to be equal.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.160
So if this is theta,
this is also going to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.895
be equal to theta.

00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.770
And actually, we use that
information, we use to actually

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.100
show that first result about
inscribed angles and the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.340
relation between them and
central angles subtending

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.980
the same arc.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.670
So if this is theta, that's
theta because this is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.120
an isosceles triangle.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.150
So what is this whole
angle over here?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.850
Well it's going to be theta
plus 90 minus theta.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.650
That angle right there's
going to be theta

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.690
plus 90 minus theta.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.270
Well, the thetas cancel out.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.690
So no matter what, as long as
one side of my triangle is the

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.070
diameter, and then the angle or
the vertex of the angle

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.620
opposite sits opposite of
that side, sits on the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.780
circumference, then this angle
right here is going to be a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.750
right angle, and this is going
to be a right triangle.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.640
So if I just were to draw
something random like this --

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.010
if I were to just take a point
right there, like that, and

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.750
draw it just like that,
this is a right angle.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.220
If I were to draw something
like that and go out like

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.240
that, this is a right angle.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.860
For any of these I could
do this exact same proof.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.090
And in fact, the way I drew it
right here, I kept it very

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.810
general so it would apply
to any of these triangles.
