Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radiolab from [inaudible], w. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. E. R.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Okay. I got to see, I'm suddenly regretting this. I was looking forward to this all day, but now it's, I didn't expect it to be so profoundly dark. You're scared. I was a little tiny bit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26          Ah Dude, you don't need to be doing that at like a moron just turned his lights off. It's a free here. We do that when you're driving out in the book. So that's a producer, Pat Walters and I. This is kind of one is this one right here. This is the rumor crossroads. And I say we are here, so a pad, and I know it's, I know it's you and you're driving in the dark. Yes. It takes me set up. So a little while back, pat and I went down to Clarksdale, Mississippi to this little tiny town out in the sticks, Mississippi Delta drove down this dirt road and this was dark. I mean curtain of black dark till we got to this place where our little road crossed, another little road made kind of an x tape recorder. Should we get out of the car? Yeah. And we got out of the car and we stood there,

Speaker 3:          01:12          Kayla to be completely silent and waiting five minutes to midnight because we were told if we stood in that very spot til midnight, the devil would come and uh, talk to us. What was that over there? Stop it. I'm going to beat you at this. Make Fun. You do that one more time. Why? Why?

Speaker 1:          01:35          I should wait and find out, I guess. No, you should ask. Would you like to know why we were waiting for the devil?

Speaker 3:          01:45          Yes. A bunch of tool bags. We are.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Okay. So I've been interested for years in this story of Robert Johnson and the crossroads. I mean, do you know him? Robert Johnson, one of the Great Blues Musicians of all times, influenced a ton of people. Eric Clapton led Zepplin. He's also the center of this mill. Situate me in time. When did Robert Johnson live? So here's the story. Yeah, 1920s Robert Johnson is a kid in Mississippi. [inaudible] wants to play the blues hanging around blues guys, but he sucks. Other blues guys would laugh at him. So he goes away,

Speaker 2:          02:19          disappears one day shortly after, comes back and he's not just good now. He's incredible. I mean he's making this music that's not just technically good, but it's just got a feeling to it that's so different. And are the other musicians like a Umay were like what happened? And supposedly what he says to them is, well, one night I walked out into the darkness, found a place where two roads cross and I waited there till midnight, waited at a place and they're going to wait to, there's lots of apparently what you do when you want to meet the devil, you walk out of town, find the crossroads at precisely midnight. The devil come up, he'll take your guitar, he'll tune it, hand it back to you, and in that moment you've given the devil your soul and he has given you the ability to play anything

Speaker 3:          03:09          is that story is still told, oh my God, this is like one of the most famous like eh myths in rock and roll. This is a story that's repeated constantly. I mean it's like one of the most enduring stories in music. I was just testing it and for some reason, for the last 12 years or so, I keep thinking about it and I'm always like, one day, one day Radiolab is going to go down to the crossroads. We're going to figure out where this damn story came from. And this is an honest question, but is there something about the myth that is true? Yeah, something like that. We've seen so many stars though. No, this is amazing. It's beautiful. All right, so what do you do?

Speaker 2:          03:49          We didn't see any devil first of all really, but oh my God, a shooting star. We did see a shooting star and so we ended up there. We ended up, started doing a lot of reporting, you know, going around Memphis, visiting Clarksdale, all these different places. And the funny thing, the very first thing that we, that we sort of learned about this whole story and uh, we learned about it from this guy and, uh, Tom Graves who lives in Memphis, who studied the history, very first thing we learned is it actually the myth in a way began here. We didn't even have to go to Memphis. He began right here. Here. What do you mean? In New York City? Yeah. What do you mean starts in New York? Well, it starts on a very particular day in a very particular place and time with a very particular guy. I think we can trace pretty much this whole thing back to John Hammond, you know, at Columbia records. I mean, he's the one that sort of pushed the whole thing into two to everybody. And John Hammond, uh, was an interesting guy. He was, uh, one of the heirs to the Vanderbilt fortune, you know, in New York. He was a thorough New Yorker and it CBS, he was a sort of a talent scout and John Hammond had, this is Elijah Walden historian. He had the best years in show business. Pretty much ever. You discovered so much talent. God, Billie Holiday Count Basey Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Stevie wave von [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          05:24          He discovered Bruce Springsteen. I mean the idea that that the same guy could discover Bruce Springsteen and cow basey. It's crazy here. Any of the moment that we're interested in happened kind of early in John Hammond's career. He was very young. He was in his twenties doing well cause he'd already brought on, I think it was Danny Goodman, who was a huge success. This would be the late thirties Benny Goodman has the first major integrated band and John Hammond. He thought that racial segregation was an abomination. And right around the time the Benny Goodman broke, he decided it's time to make a statement. So yeah, in 1938 John Hammond decided to put together this one concert that would be like the whole history of black music from the old

Speaker 4:          06:08          hey

Speaker 2:          06:09          slave era spirituals up to the hottest swing. And not only was it going to cram the entire history of black music into one concert, you wanted to put it in Carnegie Hall as an

Speaker 4:          06:24          yeah,

Speaker 2:          06:24          that Carnegie Hall, they're good. It's a very high tone place. It's Carnegie Hall. You know, what was it called? It was called from spirituals to swing from spirituals to swing. But here's the problem and this whole chronology, he was putting together, he needed somebody to represent backwoods blues. He didn't have anybody. Uh, so, so he sends one of his guys down to Mississippi to a particularly famous record shop, and the guy comes back with a record from this young guy named Robert Johnson. Was he known at that point? No, he was a nobody. He was a nobody. Well, when he heard this record, John Hammond

Speaker 5:          07:03          thought, wow, this is the best of the Backwood blues guys I've ever heard.

Speaker 2:          07:10          That sort of haunting voice. He knew right away. This was the guy,

Speaker 5:          07:20          I'm gonna pluck him from ops security and I'm gonna put him in Carnegie Hall.

Speaker 2:          07:26          And so he sent word down to Mississippi to, to try to get Robert Johnson and bring him up. Word came back that Robert Johnson had had died, just died very, very recently. Just a few months before he was messing around with a woman and the woman's husband gave him a bottle of poisoned whiskey and that was it. Wow. Well there's a blue thing. His death. Yeah. So He's out of the program. One would think concert rules around December 13th, 1938 here we go.

Speaker 6:          07:57          This was a concert. If you could have been there, you want it to be there. And John Hammond is the MC

Speaker 2:          08:03          tonight. We are glad to have and he, you know, walks the crowd through the chronology, starting with this spiritual

Speaker 6:          08:12          on the Boogie Woogie, Benny Goodman and to count Basey Orchestra and he gets that many tails. Well, the big surprise of the, this is what he said,

Speaker 5:          08:22          although unfortunately this part was not recorded, was to bring you this guy that I discovered recently, Robert Johnson. And we just found out that he died, but I still want you to hearing and we're going to play a couple of his best songs. How did he play it? He played it on a phonograph record and Mike it through the PA system right there on right there on stage drops a needle and he played, one of them was preaching blues, which happens to be maybe my favorite

Speaker 4:          08:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:00          and you can just imagine these spell ballot people in this audience

Speaker 4:          09:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:09          hearing a record being played through the PA

Speaker 4:          09:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:16          it was very obvious. Something different.

Speaker 4:          09:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:23          I mean what a remarkable thing and that was in a sense Robert Johnson's Angus. Not in a sense it was his introduction. It was his debut.

Speaker 3:          09:32          It's so ghostly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:36          What's most obvious is his absence. Now at this point there is no myth about a devil in the crossroads. All you got is music sung by a guy who's not in the room. When the record finishes, did they sit quietly or do they jump up and down and yell or that we have no idea. I mean, it wasn't recorded, but temptation would be to say their minds were blown. But probably what happened was it, they just clapped politely in the concert, kept going. [inaudible] but the seed was planted and that seed would bloom in the weirdest way 22 years later. So let me just fast forward a bit. Okay. See from 1938 to about 1916 threes because before no one,

Speaker 3:          10:18          I really listened to Robert Johnson, not too many of his records were in circulation cause you know, it was the war years and people were really into these like twists and pop kind of happy records. But then as you slide into the 60s, people get kind of tired of that stuff and they started getting into folk music.

Speaker 2:          10:34          Awesome man. I bet it baby Mama Kingston trio and all that. Kingston trio, Pete Seeger, all of these guys are both man. So, um, John Hammond again, John Hammond, he had his finger on the pulse of what was going on. He knew he had just signed Bob Dylan

Speaker 4:          10:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          10:53          my baby's dog. Dylan's first record as you can hear, was kind of Bluesy in place. So Hammond thought, hmm, maybe now is the time to revisit the whole Robert Johnson thing. Maybe put out a Robert Johnson record. So we did. And then people took those records overseas and then guys like Eric Clapton heard it flipped out. Started recording covers

Speaker 7:          11:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:22          mean it just sort of like I went into work drive. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          11:25          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:27          This is the really the song that catapulted Robert Johnson into the world time. It's still, despite the name of the song, there was no sailing of any souls. Crossroads is a metaphor you use in countless blues songs come to the crossroads. Which way are you going to go? Just refers to a decision point that shouldn't surprise anybody. So if you, if you bought the vinyl album and you looked at the album cover, there's no on the back

Speaker 2:          11:53          cover, no, no devil myth yet. But now all the conditions are sort of in place because you've got this whole folk roots movement when people who want to know more about the music and you've got a guy in Robert Johnson who's being covered by huge rock bands, but who nobody knows the first thing about. So you have this void that needed to be filled and into that space. Walks a guy named [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:20          No, his name's not pat. Pat. You take this part. All right, so moment when January we're in Memphis, we went to see this guy who was one of the first people to find out anything about Robert Johnson. In a way. He's actually at the root of the myth about Robert Johnson. So he assaulted the devil, don't we? Didn't mean to be right. His name's Dave David Evans, professor of music at the University of Memphis. He works in the music building. So as you walk in and you're like 60 different instruments playing and you kind of feel like you're losing your mind, but when you step into his office, okay, thanks for having us.

Speaker 2:          12:57          It's Kinda quiet.

Speaker 8:          12:59          She felt weirdly appropriate because we're surrounded by all of these old books and stacks of reel to reel tapes of the people that he's interviewed over the last five decades. And while we were there, he told us about one of those taped interviews, particularly the changed everything. I was a student at UCLA. This is 1966 just getting interested in folk music and blues. Got a guitar or you know, even started gigging around a little bit. I was interested in Tommy Johnson.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Now Tommy Johnson is a pretty famous blues guy, gay, but there's no relation between Tommy Johnson and Robert Johnson. None whatsoever. And musically they're way different. Tommy Johnson yodels AIG gave

Speaker 9:          13:45          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          13:46          Yeah, Robert Johnson doesn't do that. No. So David Evans was into Tommy Johnson.

Speaker 8:          13:52          I hadn't met, uh, I had heard a number of his recordings and admit Babe Stovall, the sidecar blues singer who was on the circuit at 1964. And a babe had known Tommy and he told Dave, well, you know, if you want to find Tommy Tommy's dead, but I can point you to his brother. Ladelle Johnson. Well, he was living in a little house in Jackson, Mississippi and uh, Dave decides to go see him. No, Tommy,

Speaker 1:          14:25          I'm recording the interview. See if you could learn a few things about Tonya. And 1914 dash 40 came back, Ladell was a blues man turn preacher of the visionary. Spry didn't play the blues anymore, but he sang for David A. Little bit.

Speaker 9:          14:38          Hey, why don't you, yeah, my longterm cry. Hey Baby, don't you? Yeah, my lawns and [inaudible] you treat me Mama. [inaudible] you do. When did you first start singing? It's

Speaker 1:          15:01          amazing interview to listen to many case after he sang a little bit David car and he played a bit.

Speaker 10:         15:08          Oh [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:13          and after that Madell tells Davis story about his brother Tommy. And again, this is Tommy Johnson, not Robert Johnson, but Adele tells Davis story that tries to explain how his brother Tommy got so good. And to our knowledge, this tape has never been broadcast before.

Speaker 9:          15:28          You could say again, it kind of tangle up song. You long doing, I bet you he would play. Me and him would praise for some white folks here and he'd just get shut up. And yesterday, Dan farmer ready buck and he could make a song. He could make a song in 10 minutes and I'd ask him, now you have dome we're live in. You did not. She and go. Only that man, my wife day, he said him. The reason he knows so much. He show himself to the devil. I asked him how he said, if you want to learn how to play anything you want or you play at Norlane at a Mitch Song, your Shell that you take your guitar and you go who are room Croson dad or we go across roadie and said get there. Be sure to get there. Yes. The Litter for 12 o'clock that night, Joe, you will know you are beat in and jail. You have, you get door and be playing a piece sitting there by yourself. Say you have to go by yourself and be sitting there playing a piece and jail, big black man will walk up there and take your car and he attuning and then he play a piece and hand it back. Dude said that's the way I learned how to play anything I want. And he could not. He told that didn't bring in anything, don't care what is strong?

Speaker 1:          17:08          No, I mean I was clocking stuff on Tommy Johnson and here was uh, this legend, uh, Dave says he wasn't quite sure what to make of this. I mean, he knew that the idea that the person could sell their soul to the devil in exchange for limitless talent. That is a very old myth. But that was about it. So he goes back to UCLA and one night he's chatting with some friends, you know, Grad students have their bull sessions. You know, we all talked about these things where, and he tells his friends about this thing that Ladelle had said about Tommy. And in the room that day was a fellow Grad student named Pete Welding. Pete was as much of a blues freak as I was. And according to David, as Pete listening to this story, he makes a little mental switcheroo. He thinks to himself, you know, this whole soldier soul to the devil thing would make a hell of a lot more sense if it's about Robert Johnson, not Tommy Johnson, Robert Johnson.

Speaker 8:          18:03          I mean, the fact is Robert Johnson sang a song about going to a crossroads

Speaker 1:          18:12          [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          18:12          Now he doesn't in the song, he doesn't say that he went there to meet the devil, but he also sang another song on the same album, uh, about me. And the devil walking side by side

Speaker 1:          18:26          bed, bathroom, you know, which does suggest

Speaker 8:          18:28          at least in the song, he's in some kind of [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:31          partnership with the [inaudible]. So Pete has this thought that this story sounds a lot more Robert Johnson, he than Tommy downs need. And a few months later he travels to Mississippi and he ends up interviewing this really famous blues man named Sun House. Oh Jim Myron [inaudible] in your fee, Pete asks son about Robert Johnson. Son Tells Pete the usual story about how Robert Johnson was just so bad. Get up on stage. Yes. Just as in the people you know [inaudible] I know Josh [inaudible] boy put them. Give that thing. Not a running us crazy. That's a little bit of Stone House that we found on Youtube. So son tells Pete that story and it unusual way says Robert Johnson disappeared. He came back, he was better than all of us. Nobody knew how I did it.

Speaker 8:          19:22          And then probably what happens is David is in that moment, I think Pete asked a leading question. I wasn't there, but Dave suspects, maybe Pete said something like, is it possible that Robert Johnson got so good because he's sold his soul to the devil and son? Son I think gave a kind of hesitant answer that seemed like it left open that possibility price said something like, yeah, sure it's possible. David says Pete takes that non answer and runs with it. Publishes an article where he says, you wouldn't believe this, but son House told me that Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil. Pete. He was a writer, a stylist, a bit of a liar quotes. He himself even admitted that that article was a bit over the top,

Speaker 1:          20:22          over the top or not. The story exploded, got printed over and over and books and magazines, Compton and others talked about it at concerts and over time it just became part of the cannon. The story that we like to tell about a guy that we really know nothing about.

Speaker 4:          20:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          20:42          been okay. I mean, this was not why we decided to do this story. I mean, the whole thought was that

Speaker 2:          20:48          it's gotta be something more going on here than just a bad game of telephone because the music does seem to suggest that there is more going on. I mean it does feel haunted and midway through our reporting we did learn one thing that suddenly made the myth make a kind of sense, like real sense, not just story sense. Really. Yeah. Tell me that story. Well, we heard it from a guy named Mack McCormick. I'm actually going to play you a, him talking about it in a an old documentary that we found. Okay. And Mac is probably the expert on Robert Johnson and in the 80s he tracked down some of Robert Johnson's family that no one had been able to locate and he came back with a really different story about the guy then, at least I would have ever expected

Speaker 11:         21:32          did. Robert Johnson was married in 1929 but he was quite young.

Speaker 2:          21:38          He was about 18 says Mac and he met a girl named Virginia and he fell in love

Speaker 11:         21:42          when he married. He made one of the important decisions in his life, which was to live a conventional life.

Speaker 2:          21:48          They were going to live on a farm, raise a family.

Speaker 11:         21:51          Up until then he'd been a kind of a casual party musician and his wife, Virginia, became pregnant. She decided to go back to her family to have the child he was going to join her. But right before she was due, Robert went off playing, kind of snuck off to play a few gigs before the baby was born. And when he went to visit her, he found that she died in childbirth

Speaker 4:          22:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         22:17          and he was destroyed. And he was faced with this incredible community, condemnation of what you've done to Virginia because he was in Virginia's childhood community at the time. And they looked upon him as an itinerant evil musician who was singing the devil songs and she killed Virginia. And he gradually became that person that the community saw in mass.

Speaker 2:          22:46          So if Robert Johnson was haunted by anything, maybe it was grief

Speaker 4:          22:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          23:00          oh, Amada.

Speaker 1:          23:03          Hmm. So, so you, so if you had to tell it, you'd say, so no, he didn't go out and meet the devil. He had this tragedy and the tragedy changed him and it changed you into a great musician. That's what I would say.

Speaker 4:          23:31          [inaudible] [inaudible] um, [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          23:39          and that's where our story might have ended. Hello? Hello Mac. Yes. Hi, this is Pat Walker. But that story about Robert Johnson's young wife dying in childbirth was so sad and fascinating that we really wanted to talk to the guy who found it. My name is Mack McCormick. He's the guy we just heard in the documentary. But when we mentioned that story that he told about Robert Johnson twice dying in childbirth, he, uh, he kind of cut us off. No, let's not get into that. Why not? That's, that's not something I've converged confirmed satisfactorily. What does that mean? I have, um, doubts about the things I said years ago specifically. Like what? Uh, well, okay, this is one Mack told us about a weird encounter he'd had in New Orleans in New Orleans. I was told about a man named Robert Johnson who was a blues musician and this was years after, you know, the Robert Johnson had died and I went racing down the street to this address.

Speaker 1:          24:45          What would I got there? This man, so this, they was Robert Johnson. He was a blues singer, had been, but he was not the man who made the records, but he was somebody who at the time had gone around imitating the records and Mechs as it that moment he started to wonder like, is it possible that the stories I've been connecting about Robert Johnson, one particular Robert Johnson, the Robert Johnson, or actually about a collection of different Robert Johnson's, this is what you have to apply our statistics here. Robert's a pretty common first name and Johnson's a pretty common last name. So if you have a state with whatever population, you've got to say, there's this many Robert Johnson's, we don't know how many, but Mac figures, there's certainly more than one and as Max doubt mounted, he started to run into other problems. Have you seen the death certificate? I've seen reprints of it in books.

Speaker 1:          25:40          Have you seen a reprint of the backside of it? No. Okay. The backside says that he had come from Tunica county to play Banjo at a country dance, play Banjo, but Johnson played the guitar and to make matters more confusing, the death certificate said that this Robert Johnson died of syphilis, not whiskey poisoning. This has gotta be a different guy. Mek wasn't entirely convinced until he met this guy who had played with Robert Johnson back in the day. He and Robert Johnson jammed together a little bit when Mac brought up Johnson and the fact that he died in 1938 this guy give him a funny look and said, no, I, I saw him in a Rodeo in 39 I believe it was April or so in 39 a few years later, the same thing happened with another guy Mack was talking to. He said that he'd seen Johnson in Memphis April, 1941 and not too long after that it happened again. So it's things like that that, that give you a hint that you might be wrong and if you're wrong about whether he died or not. How do you know

Speaker 2:          26:44          any of these other things that I believed? Obviously when Mac told us this, we were really disappointed. Kind of kills the story, although we do still have this song, which is incredible. The 28 others, maybe that's enough. And if you think back to that moment in Carnegie Hall where music was drifting out of that audience for the first time, we talked about that earlier as an absence, but it's really, it's not if it's all we got actually it's everything. Okay.

Speaker 12:         27:48          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          27:50          But on the subject of Robert Johnson, there's the book by writer Tom Graves. It's called crossroads the life and afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson. And thanks to Elijah Wald who wrote escaping the delta. I don't know though, the subtitle, DMSO, Robert Johnson, the invention of the blues and Peter Goralnick whose book on Robert Johnson's quote searching for Robert Johnson. There's a lot of people looking for that guy. Yeah. And the truth is, I should also just say that to close this out is the person who put Robert Johnson in my head and his music in my head is a guy named dean ulcer. Sorta, my first mentor in Radio, uh, used to run a great program called the next big thing. Big Heartfelt Bluesy, ulcer. Um, Gentleman Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
