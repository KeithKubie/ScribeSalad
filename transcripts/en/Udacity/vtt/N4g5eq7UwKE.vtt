00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.260
Starting at the simplest combinatorial modeling, this is the simplest form of

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.110
behavioral modeling, and it merely expresses the logic of simple combinatorial

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.900
systems. In these systems, only the inputs and not the history of previous

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.330
states determines subsequent states. We'll look for a second at two equivalent

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.140
forms of combinatorial modeling. Called decision trees and decision tables.
