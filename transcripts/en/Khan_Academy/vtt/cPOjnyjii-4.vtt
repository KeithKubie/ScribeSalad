00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.320
It's late at night,
and some type

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.860
of nocturnal predatory
bird, maybe this is an owl,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.390
is diving for its dinner.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.500
So this right over
here is a mouse.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.360
And it's diving straight
down near a street light.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.720
And let's get some information
about what's going on.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.610
So the street light right
over here is 20 feet high.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.140
So this is a 20 foot
high street lamp.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.710
And right at this
moment, the-- and I

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.360
haven't drawn it
completely to scale--

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.200
the owl is 15 feet
above the mouse.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.540
So this distance right
over here is 15 feet.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.840
And the mouse itself is 10
feet from the base of the lamp.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.640
Let me draw that.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.780
So the mouse is 10 feet
from the base of the lamp.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.850
And we also know-- we
have our little radar

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.500
gun out-- we know that this
owl is diving straight down.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.090
And right now, it is
going 20 feet per second.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.290
So right now, this is going
down at 20 feet per second.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.210
Now what we're curious about
is we have the light over here.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.490
Light is coming from the
street lamp in every direction.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.080
And it creates a
shadow of the owl.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.130
So right now the
shadow is out here.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.440
And as the owl goes
further and further down,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.510
the shadow's going to move
to the left like that.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.040
And so, given everything that
we've set up right over here,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.300
the question is, at what
rate is the shadow moving?

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.770
So let's think about what we
know and what we don't know.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.620
And to do that, let's
set up some variables.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.910
So let me draw the same thing a
little bit more geometrically.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.130
So let's say that this right
over here is the street light.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.350
That is 20 feet tall.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.770
And then this right over
here is the height of the owl

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.780
right at this moment,
so this is 15 feet.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.520
The distance between
the base of the lamp

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.650
and where the owl is going,
where that mouse is right now.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.760
This is 10 feet.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.880
And if I were to think
about where the shadow is,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.970
well, the light's
from right over here.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.790
And so the owl blocks the
light right over there,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.880
so the shadow is going
to be right over there.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.330
So if you just draw a straight
line from the source of light

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.639
through the owl and
you just keep going

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.180
and you hit the
ground, you are going

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.596
to figure out where
the shadow is.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:44.500
So the shadow is going
to be right over here.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.110
It's going to be
right over there.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.140
And we need to figure out
how quickly is that moving.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.190
And it's going to be moving
in the leftward direction.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.110
So let's set up some
variables over here.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.090
So let's say-- so
what's changing?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.410
Well, we know that the height
of the owl is changing.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.000
So let's call that y.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.220
Right at this moment,
it's equal to 15,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.290
but it is actually changing.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.345
And let's call the
distance between the shadow

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:19.790
and the mouse x.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.040
Now given this set
up, can we come up

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.185
with a relationship
between x and y?

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:26.310
And then using that
relationship, what we're really

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.440
trying to come up with is,
what is the rate at which x

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.780
is changing with
respect to time?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.880
We know what y is
right at this moment.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.800
We know what dy/dt is
right at this moment.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.790
Can we come up the
relationship between x and y

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.540
and maybe take the
derivative with respect

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.970
to t so we can
figure out what dx/dt

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990
is at a given moment in time?

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.094
Well, both of these
triangles-- and when

00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:52.510
I say both of these
triangles, let

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.720
me be clear what
I'm talking about.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.590
This triangle right over here,
the smaller triangle in green,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.600
is a similar triangle
to the larger triangle.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.630
This is a similar triangle
to this larger triangle

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.640
that I am tracing in blue.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.770
It's similar to this larger one.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.250
How do I know that?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.430
Well, they both have a right
angle, right over here.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.190
They both share this angle.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.820
So all three-- they
have two angles

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.280
in common-- then all three
angles must be in common.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.780
So they are similar
triangles, which

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.390
means the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.410
must be the same.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.790
So we know that
the ratio of x to y

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.370
must be the ratio of this
entire base, which is x plus 10,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.860
to the height of the
larger triangle, to 20.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.280
And right there, we have a
relationship between x and y.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.150
And if we take the derivative
of both sides with respect to t,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.875
we're probably
doing pretty well.

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:52.750
Now before taking the
derivative with respect

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.660
to t-- I could do
it right over here--

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.400
just to simplify
things a little bit,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.780
let me just cross multiply.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.030
So let me multiply both
sides of this equation by 20

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.190
and y, just so that I
don't have as many things

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.600
in the denominator.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.700
So on the left hand side
it simplifies to 20x.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.570
I don't want to write over it,
well, I'll just write-- 20x.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.580
And on the left
hand side is 20 x.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.200
And then on the
right hand side--

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:26.254
let's see this cancels with
that-- we have xy plus 10y.

00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:27.670
And now let me
take the derivative

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.990
of both sides with
respect to time.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.274
So the derivative of 20 times
something with respect to time

00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:36.940
is going to be the derivative of
20 times something with respect

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.852
to the something,
which is just 20.

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:40.560
That's the derivative
of 20x with respect

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.030
to x, times dx or the derivative
of x with respect to t,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.669
is equal to.

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.460
Now over here we're
going have to break out

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.166
a little bit of
the product rule.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.040
So first we want to
figure out the derivative

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.770
of x with respect to time.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.430
So the derivative of the first
thing times the second thing,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.590
times y.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.720
Plus just the first thing
times the derivative

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.585
of the second thing.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.710
So derivative of y with
respect to t is just dy/dt.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.500
And then finally,
right over here.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.830
The derivative of
10y with respect to t

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.320
is the derivative of 10y with
respect to y, which is just 10,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.247
times the derivative of y with
respect to t, which is dy/dt.

00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:24.460
And there you have it.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.400
You have your relationship
between dx/dt, dy/dt, and x

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.689
and y.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.480
So let's just make sure
we have everything.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.682
This is what we're trying
to solve for, dx/dt.

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:37.640
And let's see here, we
have another dx/dt here.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.300
We're going to try
to solve for that.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.380
We know what y is.
y is equal to 15.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.690
We know what dy/dt is, dy/dt.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.610
If we make the convention
since y is decreasing,

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.340
we can say it's -20.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.840
So we know what this is.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.210
And so if we just know what,
so we know what this is.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.380
So if we just know what x
is we can solve for dx/dt.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.310
So what is x right
at this moment?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.505
Well, we can use
this first equation--

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:08.130
we could actually
use this one up here,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.040
but this one is simplified a
little bit-- to actually solve

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.680
for x.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.346
So let's do that, and then we'll
substitute back into this thing

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:15.870
where we've taken
the derivative.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.400
So we get 20 times x
is equal to x times y.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.055
y is 15.

00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:26.180
And just remember, I could
have used this equation,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.970
but this is just
one step further.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.660
We've already
crossed multiplied.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.240
So it's x times y. y is 15.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.680
So it's x times 15,
plus 10 times y.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.047
Plus 10 times 15.

00:07:39.047 --> 00:07:39.880
Did I do that right?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.490
20x is equal to x times
15 plus 10 times 15.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.080
So let's see if you subtract.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.450
So just this is 20x is
equal to 15x, plus 150.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.020
Subtract 15x from
both sides, you

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.900
get 5x is equal to 30--
sorry, 5x is equal to 150,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.420
my brain is getting ahead.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.330
5x is equal to 150.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.690
Divide both sides by 5.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.560
You get x is equal to 30 feet.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.760
x is equal to 30 feet
right at this moment.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.240
So this distance, just going
back to our original diagram.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.782
This distance right
over here is 30 feet.

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:19.740
So let's substitute all
the values we know back

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.580
into this equation to
actually solve for dx/dt.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.800
So we have-- so let me
do it right over here--

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.860
we have 20 times dx/dt.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.830
I'll do that in orange,
we'll solve for that.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.288
Actually no, I
already used orange.

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:36.260
So let's say dx/dt-- I'll
use this pink-- 20 times

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.860
dx/dt is equal to dx/dt times y.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.400
y right now is 15 feet.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.070
So times 15, times-- I
didn't want to do that color.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:56.220
Times 15 plus x, we
already know that x is 30.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.160
Plus 30, times dy/dt.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.280
What is dy/dt?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.400
dy/dt, we could say is -20 feet
per second. y is decreasing,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.150
the bird is the bird is
diving down to get its dinner.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:16.530
So times negative-- well,
times 20 feet per second.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.090
So that's that right over there.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.640
Plus 10 times dy/dt.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.840
So plus 10 times
-20 feet per second.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.910
And now we just solve for dx/dt.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.160
So let's see, what do we have?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.280
We have 20 times-- let's see,
let me subtract 15 dx/dt from

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.310
both sides of this equation--
and we get 5dx/dt's.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.040
I just subtracted this from
both sides of the equation.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.920
This is 15dx/dt this is 20.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.046
So that we have 5dx/dt's,
is equal to this

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:55.250
is, this part right
over here is -600.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.120
And this part right
over here is -200.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:05.720
So it's equal to -800
feet per second-- or -800,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.350
and actually this will
actually be in feet per second.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.660
And so dx/dt is equal to,
dividing both sides by 5,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.720
5 times 16 is 80.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.640
So this is -160 feet per second.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.390
And we're done.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.760
And we see the shadow is
moving very, very, very, very

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.780
fast to the left.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.869
x is decreasing,
and we see that.

00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:30.660
That's why we have this
negative sign here.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.300
The value of x is decreasing.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.140
It is moving to the left
at quite a nice speed here.
