Why Is It Illegal to Remove Your Mattress
and Pillow Tags?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.590
A question we’re often asked is why is it
illegal to remove pillow and mattress tags.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.170
If you also have found yourself wondering
this, wonder no more.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.190
Unbeknownst to many innocent consumers out
there, the warning that it is unlawful to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.580
remove the tags from a mattress or pillow
is not for them!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.180
It is for pillow and mattress sellers only.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.460
The specific US Code we’re dealing with
here is Title 15 – Commerce and Trade, Chapter

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.090
2, Subchapter V – Textile Fiber Products
Identification, Section 70c – Removal of

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.760
stamp, tag, label, or other identification
Statute (a) Removal or mutilation after shipment

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.890
in commerce.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.750
This states:
“After shipment of a textile fiber product

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.420
in commerce it shall be unlawful, except as
provided in this subchapter, to remove or

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.360
mutilate, or cause or participate in the removal
or mutilation of, prior to the time any textile

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.450
fiber product is sold and delivered to the
ultimate consumer, any stamp, tag, label,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.059
or other identification required by this subchapter
to be affixed to such textile fiber product,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.400
any person violating this section shall be
guilty of an unfair method of competition,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.549
and an unfair or deceptive act or practice,
under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.560
“
This became the law in the early 20th century

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.960
when the US government responded to concerns
that some of the materials used in pillows

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.020
and mattresses easily conducted illnesses
or harbored pests such as lice.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.200
Some manufacturers would stuff their goods
with just about anything including horse hair

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.409
or corn husks, since the customer could not
see them.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.840
As such, with the new law mattress and pillow
manufacturers were required to clearly define

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.799
the contents of their products and to identify
whether or not these contents were new or

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.009
recycled materials by placing tags on them.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.340
This was important as recycled materials could
still contain lice, bedbugs or human excretion.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.710
This information allowed consumers to make
informed decisions about their purchases.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.759
It also meant that based upon their contents,
some mattresses and pillows would not sell.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.689
In order to ensure no pillow and mattress
sellers removed these tags in order to make

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.130
the sale, they were stamped, in bold letters,
with a clear message – “Do not remove

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.850
under penalty of law”.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.140
The words, “except by the consumer” have
since been added but not a lot of consumers

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260
bother to read the tags in detail.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.140
The myth that it is illegal has been passed
down by word of mouth and through popular

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.140
media.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.160
Both the movie PeeWee’s Big Adventure and
an episode of Garfield and Friends feature

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.030
characters who were punished for removing
these labels.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.079
Before the words “except by consumer”
were added to the labels, Fred, a character

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.909
on a popular 1970s show called Sanford and
Son, removed a warning label, tore it up and

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.670
exclaimed, “power to the people!” Johnny
of Johnny Bravo is chased by police in a helicopter

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.760
after removing a label from a stuffed animal
and then saying to himself, “Pfft, what

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.180
are they going to do?”

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.890
Even the mattress company Serta, who are presumably
well aware that it isn’t illegal for consumers

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.620
to remove the tags, created a commercial where
its famous counting sheep were thrown in jail

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.459
for tearing off of the label after the mattress’s
owner said she didn’t need them anymore.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.340
SpongeBob SquarePants also once asked Squidward
to hide him from law enforcement when he panics

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.989
after removing the tag from his mattress.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.030
Although it may not be illegal for consumers
to remove the tags from pillows or mattresses,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.909
it is a good idea if you cut them off to safely
store them with your warranty information.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.980
Many mattress manufacturers, including Sealy,
Serta and Simmons require the tags to be produced

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:34.049
in a warranty claim.
