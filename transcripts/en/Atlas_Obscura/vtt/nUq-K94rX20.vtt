00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Off the coast of Brazil is an island so dangerous 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.166
that the Brazilian Navy has expressly forbidden anyone from landing there

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.967
and you should definitely listen to them 

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.266
Locals love to recount two grisly stories about this island 

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.567
in one a local fisherman wants to pick some bananas 

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.700
gets out onto this island 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.867
and within minutes he is bitten by a snake 

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.166
he runs back and jumps in his boat but its too late 

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.367
as he paddles away, he passes out

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.467
and is found when the boat washes upshore

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:41.000
with him lying in a pool of his own blood 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.333
the second story is about a lighthouse keeper 

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.066
who lived on this island with his  

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:49.066
one night they made the disastrous mistake of leaving the window open 

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.934
and through that window climbed a dozen snakes 

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:54.066
they bit everyone in the family 

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.166
and they died there, inside the lighthouse

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.367
You’ll see a theme in these stories 

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.900
that’s because this island, Ilha de Queimada Grande

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.734
is also known as snake island

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.934
this small island miles off the coast of Brazil

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:16.400
is the highest density of poisonous snakes on the planet

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.166
researchers estimate that there is one deadly snake for every square meter

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:26.000
that means you are never farther than three feet from death

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.266
the snakes are only on this island, they are an endemic species

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.500
it is part of the Lancehead genus which is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.567
responsible for over 90% of the snake bite fatalities in Brazil

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:40.266
and they are notorious for loving to hang out in the trees

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.667
it’s not just that snakes are underfoot they are also overhead

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:47.767
you are in a three dimensional matrix of death by snake

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:51.467
this particular snake, this Golden Lancehead

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.600
is one of the most venomous snakes on the planet

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.967
the way the venom effects you is it

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.567
begins to necrotize and corrupt your flesh from the inside out 

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.433
you basically start to melt.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.333
Should you get bitten 

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.867
you have a maximum, and this is an absolute maximum

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:14.100
to get somewhere and get the antidote 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.467
however it’s just as likely that you’ll be dead in an hour 

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:22.166
so like don’t plan on a six, your like “Ahh it’ll only take me five hours to get to the hospital 

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.433
no, you are in so much trouble

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.033
what are you doing on this island in the first place, actually?

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:29.900
don’t go there! 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.800
unfortunately researcher believe the snake population 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.567
on the island has decreased by as much as 50% 

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.567
originally they were as high as five snakes per square meter 

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:39.667
which is just like, there’s just snakes 

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:41.266
the island is made of snakes 

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.867
and this is in large part due to poachers 

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:45.734
people who are going to the island 

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:49.300
with the express purpose of stealing these snakes

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.166
because they are so unique in the world 

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:54.367
they can fetch anywhere between ten and thirty thousand dollars 

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:57.767
so despite the terror of snake island 

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:02.367
the truth is, with the population of Golden Lancehead's in decline 

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.166
the snakes have a lot more to fear from us

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:06.800
than we do from them 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.200
we can just stay off the island 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.767
which we should

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.800
because it’s full of snakes!
