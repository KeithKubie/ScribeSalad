00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone.
My name is Mark Polleger and welcome to the

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.760
Authors@Google program.
And today we have with us photographer Michael

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360
Clark, who's an action
and sports shooter.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.470
And I came across him first during my days
at Adobe working with some

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.859
of the digital imagining teams there.
And he sort of came to my attention and started

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.070
working with some of
the product teams there, shooting example

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.940
photographs and talking about
sort of the technique and workflow using products.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
And over the years, I sort of kept track of
him.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
And he's been teaching workshops, doing a
lot of advertising shooting

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.750
and some of his own personal work.
And I thought that given the extreme interest

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.430
here at Google in the
photography community, and sort of not only

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.430
the substance of the
pictures but also the interest in how they

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.160
are captured -- particularly
for some of the more challenging shoots like

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.930
Michael does -- that he
would be a great speaker to come here and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.269
talk to us about his work and
his techniques.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.390
So with that, Michael Clark.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.439
MICHAEL CLARK: Thank you for having me.
Yes, my name is Michael Clark.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.930
Thank you to Mark for bringing me out.
And thank you to all of you for coming out

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.760
to see me today give this
talk.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.031
And above and beyond that, thank you for all
the work you guys do here

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:27.060
because you guys get me about half of my work
these days, through my

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.580
website, that I've had several assignments,
some of which I'll show the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.920
work from, that came to me because I had my,
you know, search engine

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.780
optimization done for adventure photography
and people found me on

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.210
Google.
And somehow, luckily I show up in the top

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.270
one or two for adventure
photography in most categories and thank you.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.810
Your work goes far beyond just the stuff you
guys do here.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.829
So that's awesome.
And actually the book that I have also came

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.469
to me through you guys.
The photo editor, or the editor, actually,

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.039
at the publisher was doing
searches on adventure photographers and actually

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.399
seen my work in
climbing magazines years and years ago.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.620
But he basically looked at 30, 40, 50 adventure
photographers and their

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.180
work and trying to figure out who he should
pitch the book to first.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.370
And he looked at my website and found me through
Google.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.599
And because of the number of images that I
had in various different

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.040
sports, chose me as the guy to go through,
and also because of my

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.180
newsletter, which goes out four times a year,
which is basically like a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.690
little PDF magazine.
He decided to pitch it to me first and I accepted

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.800
it.
So that's how the book came to fruition.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.680
I'll talk a little bit more about that as
we get going.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.220
But the book is Digital Masters: Adventure
Photography, Capturing the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.849
World of Outdoor Sports.
And it's been out since, I think, just after

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.470
Thanksgiving.
But again, thanks for having me out here.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.640
It's a beautiful campus you guys have here.
It sounds like a fun place to work.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.950
So about me: I did not study photography.
I studied to be a physicist and worked for

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.989
about a year after I went to
school at UT Austin.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.459
I specialized in solid state physics, so I
actually kind of worked on

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.269
technology for -- for CCD chips before it
really started being used in

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.900
digital cameras en masse.
And then in my -- in grad school, I basically

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.989
started rock climbing.
And while I was taking grad school courses,

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.160
started rock climbing and
that got me into the outdoors and I was totally

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.000
obsessed.
It's kind of like surfing, once you start,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.689
that's all you want to do.
So I schemed my way into a two-year long set

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.989
of travels, quit my job,
and headed off with my camera in tow, just

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.280
because I knew we were going
to be all these crazy cool places.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280
And through that process of those two years,
I decided to try

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.790
photography.
And that's kind of how I got into this.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.069
And I haven't really looked back.
I've been a pro photographer for 14 years

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.989
now, mostly specializing in
adventure sports.

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.760
When I started out, it was mostly rock climbing
 -- and I'll just let

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.290
you know, the colors on that screen are better
than this screen, more

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.770
accurate at least, but we did calibrate the
monitor or the LCD

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.260
projectors.
So I've been all over the world shooting rock

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.600
climbing.
For the first four years or so, that was pretty

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.790
much all I shot was
rock climbing because that was my one main

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.370
passion.
And the other reason being that I could really

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.550
 -- I could make a living
of sorts, not a great living, but just shooting

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.240
rock climbing because
there weren't that many rock climbing photographers

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.910
in the world.
Basically because the skills you need to shoot

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.860
rock climbing, to get
above the climbers, you needed the climbing

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.530
skills and the photography
skills to put it all together.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.730
And there's not that many people in the world,
or at least there

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.260
weren't at that point, that were willing to
work that hard to do that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.960
stuff.
This is shot that's in Mexico at a place called

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.660
Potrero Chico.
And we're 600 feet off the deck, it took about

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.560
five hours to get into
position for this shot.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.940
But it's been used by a bunch of companies
like Black Diamond who makes

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.260
climbing gear and stuff like that.
And after the four years or so -- this is

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.550
actually an article that
Nikon World put up in their magazine about

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.250
me and my work.
It's just showing a usage of that picture.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.840
And this is actually -- well, going back,
this is me at work.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.560
This is that same wall, actually, where that
last picture was taken the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.650
one of the woman here.
I'm photographing her husband on a route just

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.520
next to it.
And it took us all day to get up there.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.930
I'm carrying a lot of camera gear as you can
see.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.350
Way more than I would now because I've got
some huge lens there, 80-

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.090
200 and a bag full of other stuff.
And that's mostly because we were on the wall

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.250
so long.
And I'm hanging from a static line that we

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.771
fixed before he started
climbing, so that I could -- didn't have to

00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.490
climb because I can't
really climb and photograph.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.820
So I'm hanging from these mechanical ascenders
where you slide them up

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.490
and they don't pull down, so I can totally
let go and manipulate the

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.790
camera.
And I just go up the rope with them, and I've

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.880
got these things called
etriers.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.280
They are little webbing ladders so I do this
funky motion and ascend

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.330
the fix line, even if I'm hanging in space
and not even touching the

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.760
wall.
So this is a casual day, out there shooting

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.630
rock climbing.
I wear the knee pads, too, just because the

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.210
knee pads help preserve
clothing.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.330
And I've learned that over the years.
Then you can lean into the wall really close

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.700
and not have to worry
about scraping yourself up.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.750
But -- it's a lot of work shooting rock climbing.
It's definitely an incredible amount of work.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.270
This is an article that came out in Outdoor
Photographer like eight or

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.800
nine years ago, but it's just a good example
of what it's like for some

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.760
of my shoots.
This is also one of the coolest assignments

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.720
I've ever done.
This was an assignment in Majorca, Spain,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.950
for Men's Journal magazine.
This is all just kind of a little background

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.970
for you guys before we
start talking about specifics on the images

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.280
and how I made them.
This is a climber named Chris Sharma, who

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.600
is probably the strongest
climber in the world these days.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.480
Super great guy.
This is a kind of a relatively new sport called

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.150
deep water soloing.
And it started here in Majorca, Spain -- well,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.870
actually it started in
England 30 years ago, but nobody really got

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.470
into it because it was a
little nutty back then in the cold waters

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.190
off England's coast.
But in Spain the water's a little warmer,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.740
we do this in late summer,
early fall, and basically they climb above

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.330
the ocean with no ropes.
And nobody had ever been there.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.880
A friend of mine Toni Lamprecht was one of
the guys who found this

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.970
climbing on Majorca and called me up and said,
"Mike, we got to go do

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.830
something here because it's just crazy and
it's beautiful."

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.660
It's like the Blue Lagoon, the water is crystal
clear, even those it

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:06.850
looks black in this image, that's the film.
On this route, it had been raining for five

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.910
of the ten days we were
there.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.460
And I was kind of freaking out because the
magazine wanted a double

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.580
page spread.
And this is the double page spread that they

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.710
actually used, and I knew
this was the perfect spot.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.810
And so one morning the sun came up and I asked
Chris to go out there.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.800
And we went out and he hung off this hold
for like 30 minutes, 3 times

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.400
in a row.
This is the biggest hold on the climb.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.219
You know -- and he could -- and it's like
wrap your hand over thing.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.280
He could hang off this thing all day if he
had to.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.930
Every other hold on the climb is like super
tiny micro hold.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.740
So we did this little, you know, pose down
and shoot, that ended up

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.961
being in the double page spread.
And there's also -- this is another climb

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:52.660
that we shot there where they
actually fell onto the water.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.580
He's 70 feet above the water.
And there's -- granted there's also like ten-foot

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.030
waves rolling in
underneath him.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.890
So at this point I'm like five feet away from
him.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.610
I'm shouting and he can't even hear me because
it's so deafening with

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:11.390
the waves crashing against the water.
So in this shot, the thing he has to do, he's

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.370
holding on to two these
holds, which he can barely hold on to, and

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.900
this wall also overhangs by
about 30 degrees and he has to jump five feet

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.740
 -- there's a big hold up
at the top there you can see.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.220
It's so foreshortened because I'm straight
above him but it's an

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.470
all-points release, where you basically kick
off, everything goes, and

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.160
you've got to reach for that hold.
He didn't make it.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.180
[LAUGHTER]
He took a 70-footer, and I've got a whole

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.060
series of pictures with his
dreads flying around and his facial expressions

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.430
are priceless,
actually.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.150
[LAUGHTER]
His eyeballs when he -- I saw him up top,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.490
cause you can go around and
use your route and climb back to the top,

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.290
his eyeballs just looked like
he had gotten out of some massive car accident.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.360
And he was kind of freaking out, but it was
beautiful.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.930
And here's Chris Sharma doing the same route.
He fell the first time but he made it the

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.800
second time.
And it's one of those super classic routes

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.740
in that area.
It's an ad for prAna, which is down the way

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.070
here in California they
make climbing clothing and yoga clothing.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:16.110
So rock climbing is definitely in my blood.
Since I started out as a rock climber and

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.220
it's still one of my big
passions.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:24.230
But I needed to expand my horizons a bit and
shoot something besides

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.700
just rock climbing.
So I started shooting mountain biking.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.920
And this is an image I came -- or I shot for
Adobe, actually, when I

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.370
was shooting for Adobe Lightroom when they
came out with that four or

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.710
five years ago.
This is in Moab. And he is jumping off this.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.550
It's like a 35-foot drop, and yes, he does
land here.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.990
And it is rock.
So there's no room for error.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.440
And this is a pretty casual drop for these
guys.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.880
This is not a big deal.
He did it like, I don't know, eight or nine

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.181
times.
We had three riders doing this thing for a

00:10:55.181 --> 00:11:00.310
couple hours.
I photograph this same rider Ryon Reed, great

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.180
guy, doing 50- to 60-foot
drops.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.290
And there's some riders who have done close
to a hundred.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.290
But I don't think anybody has actually landed
a hundred.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.460
I think the biggest one is 60 or 70 if they've
landed.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.750
I also started shooting white water kayaking,
which is a great sport to

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.150
shoot because it's just -- it's crazy.
Everything's moving fast.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.980
It's actually a really good test for cameras'
auto focus because

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.210
everything is random all over the place.
There's no linear lines that these guys are

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.980
taking because they're
being pushed everywhere.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.150
And then I also started shooting surfing,
actually, just a few years

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.710
ago.
This is, uh, Pipeline off the North Shore

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.110
of Oahu.
And interesting story with this is that I

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.320
 -- started shooting surfing
because of this book.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.800
Living -- I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
and I travel six to

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.340
seven months out of the year.
I'm not really traveling for surfing because

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.160
I don't live anywhere near
an ocean.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.080
But for the book, we needed some surfing pictures.
And I ended up calling a guy named Brian Bielmann,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.540
who is the like the
godfather of surf photography, great photographer.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.770
He's been doing it for 25, 30 years on the
North Shore and all over the

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.040
world.
And he invited me out to shoot big wave surfing.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.270
I basically had a tutorial from one of the
best surfing photographers

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.980
in the world and that was -- he's a really
good friend now.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.270
It's a great honor to be able to do that through
the book.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.490
&gt;&gt; Is the picture taken from the shore?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.660
MICHAEL CLARK: This is from shore.
I have yet to swim in the ocean.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.480
There's some -- definitely some other pictures
in this show from just a

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.320
couple months ago.
The Eddie Aikau when they had the biggest

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.800
waves roll through in the
last 40 years, which I'll show those later

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.900
but, using like a 500 or 600
millimeter lens, huge lenses.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:49.580
And I also shoot some lifestyle stuff.
Images that are kind of, you know, the in-between

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.440
moments or less
extreme, one could say.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.100
They sell a lot better, actually, in some
respects.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.970
Backpacking, you know.
A lot of landscape stuff as well.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.310
This is shot just above Santa Fe, it's called
the Tesuque Basin, late

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.691
afternoon one day.
Just getting out of the office, went up there

00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:13.350
and shot some pictures
and ended up being one of the best landscape

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.550
pictures I've ever taken
probably.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:22.570
This is Canyonlands in Utah.
Landscape pictures don't sell so much but

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.190
they're fun to take.
And they definitely fill in the details of

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.790
the moment and where you're
at.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.460
Another lifestyle shot of mountain biking.
This one's on the Wasatch Crest near Salt

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:39.600
Lake City.
Beautiful trail, super, casual.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.430
And then also -- here's another lifestyle
shot with yoga.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.740
Most of my work is commercial or editorial,
so I'm shooting for

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.060
magazines or I'm shooting for corporate clients
like, you know, Nikon

00:13:52.060 --> 00:14:00.060
and Nike, Adobe, whoever else, Patagonia.
And some of my work is stock.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.839
So I shoot for a stock agency like Getty Images
or somebody like that.

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:07.150
And this was shot for stock, though it ended
up being used by

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.110
Patagonia.
Just went out with a yoga instructor to White

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.870
Sands, New Mexico, and
the story behind this image is we got really

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.029
lucky with the weather.
And the clouds, obviously.

00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:22.000
Little did we know -- this was shot the night
we got there.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.570
We showed up late afternoon, shot for two
hours and then we were going

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.970
to sleep and then shoot in the morning at
sunrise was the plan.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.740
Well, little do we know these clouds were
bringing in some massive dust

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.470
storm.
And we didn't sleep a wink that night.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:43.360
It was like a whiteout with white snow.
It was crazy, just, we had sand caked in our

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.310
eyes, everywhere.
And it was -- it was kind of a horrific night.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.560
But -- the models were good to go the next
morning, even though nobody

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.770
slept and it was miserable.
They got up and kept working for us, so that

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.680
was great.
I also do a little bit of portraiture now.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.480
And this is my friend Nico Danan, he's a French
free-diver. And he

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:11.471
had just gotten out of the water at this point,
diving a hundred feet,

00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:15.940
I think, to the bottom of this freshwater
hole, to the very bottom.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.110
And held his breath for about five or six
minutes.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:26.029
And we did these portraits in the men's bathroom
entranceway.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:29.960
For me, I don't really -- I don't have a studio.
So I improvise wherever I go and I take the

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.810
lights with me.
And I took a four-foot white background.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.120
And it was kind of windy that day.
And this is out on this -- this is in New

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.920
Mexico.
And you don't think of there being that much

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.250
water in New Mexico, so
the only place we could find out of the wind

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.420
to set up the background
and the lights was in the entranceway of the

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.899
men's bathroom which was
only like six by ten feet.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:52.960
So we just stacked ourselves in there.
And I told him as soon as they get out, come

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.640
on over and he still had
water dripping off his face.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.740
I do a lot of these black and white on white
portraits these days just

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.420
because they're really intense and interesting.
And also I tend to shoot just my own personal

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.460
work, whatever kind of
grabs me.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.270
This shot was taken at the Albuquerque Balloon
Fiesta, which is the

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.980
world's largest balloon fiesta.
There's like thousands of balloons taking

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.990
off every day.
And I had seen a shot somewhat like this with

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.170
some figures, you know,
on the outside of the balloon.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.520
And I thought that's a cool idea.
I want to see if I could do something with

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.570
that or replicate it.
So I basically looked over the balloon grounds

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.090
because there were six
or seven balloons filling up at that point

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.160
and saw a bright one,
because I knew I wanted really bright colors.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.560
And I just walked over to the guy started,
you know, befriending him

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.500
and then said, "Hey, can I get in your balloon
and just shoot some

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.839
pictures from the inside?"
Hoping that something would happen and I was

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:44.800
just about to ask him if
he could send a some people around, because

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.490
all the people have to do
is stand right next to the balloon.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.640
And before I could even open my mouth, part
of his crew had gone under

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.380
and they were pushing the sides of the balloon
up because it helps it

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.780
fill up with air faster and poof it out and
I saw that I just started

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.880
snapping away and I couldn't believe my luck.
And it's definitely one of my best pictures,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.750
I think, because it speaks
on a lot more levels than just ballooning

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:15.260
or people or whatever.
I'll go more into that here a little bit later.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:20.070
One of the assignments I had recently just
last fall was Red Bull and

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.209
this guy Danny MacAskill, who is one of the
superstars of YouTube.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:30.250
This guy went from working in a bike store
to two weeks later being a

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.370
full-time sponsored athlete with Red Bull
and all kinds of people

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:38.770
getting film for a Volkswagen commercial.
He's this -- he's this Scottish guy.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.940
He's 22, 23.
Um, he's been riding his bike all his life.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.280
And he does these crazy tricks and I'm sure
many of you have seen his

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.460
video riding the fence post and doing all
kinds of wild stuff.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.580
And so Red Bull called me out to shoot him
and we landed in San Diego.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.570
And we went out scouting to find stuff for
him to do and we saw these

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.580
rings by the airport and he was like, "Oh,
yeah I can do a back flip

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.870
off this thing. No problem."
So the next day, this is at the end of the

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.190
day, we went and shot this
and it took him 5 or 6 tries to get it on

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.429
because as you can tell it's
not flat.

00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:12.809
We had to step up a little bag, he has to
hop onto this thing.

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:15.360
Super technical, just to do that.
I was really impressed he could pull that

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.171
off.
And cops rolled by.

00:18:17.171 --> 00:18:19.929
We had been chased by the cops all day on
this shoot.

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:23.340
So a cop rolled by and just smiled at us and
gave us the thumbs up and

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.500
we're like all right.
We were ready to run at that point.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.440
But, anyway.
The point of this picture.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.140
I like this picture a lot.
This is one of my favorite pictures from the

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.440
shoot.
But this is the one that has a lot more impact.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.190
And for you photographers, the note here is
get close.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.450
You know, I think Robert Capa, famous photographer
from D-Day said, "if

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.200
your pictures aren't good enough, then you're
not close enough."

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.570
And definitely one of my mottos is get in
close with the wide angle

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.130
lens.
This is a fisheye lens, and I'm pretty much

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.540
laying on the ground.
I mean the tip of my camera is like right

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.860
here on the ring, pointing
up.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.179
And it sees everything in the plane of the
camera so I don't really

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:04.040
have to worry about focus or anything like
that I just compose the

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.220
image.
And bam.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.220
I just got to wait for the timing.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.700
MICHAEL CLARK: Exactly.
Well, he fell like six or seven times which

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.860
those were pretty good
pictures, too.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.140
MICHAEL CLARK: No.
Because he was going the opposite way, so

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.150
he would come in from this
side, go up, and then come down.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.230
Um, which was great.
I mean, he did it probably ten times for the

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.020
camera.
And at that point, we thought, okay, the light

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.559
is not that bad.
We don't want him to get hurt, so we'll just

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:38.890
move on to the next thing.
Here's another shot from that day, and I was

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.050
telling this story earlier
over lunch, but this is him on an aircraft

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.390
carrier, the USS Midway, in
San Diego Harbor.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.540
And the story behind this is that we'd got
on the ship, we only had an

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.350
hour.
And you know, as soon as we got on the ship

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.110
and told him what we wanted
to do the guy was like, no.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.210
You can't do anything.
So I was like, it would be great if we can

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.900
get him to, you know, do a
back flip off the wings one of the planes

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:10.510
on the aircraft carrier [LAUGHTER] and
that was immediately axed that was just like

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.549
no.
That's going to injure the plane.

00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:17.720
So we doing just ail kinds of, just have him
sit on the deck, nothing

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.990
that exciting down on the deck, and we look
up and he see these two

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.110
boxes up here.
And Danny's like, "Hey, can I just go up there

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.030
and stand on one of those
boxes with my bike?"

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.240
And so the guy from the museums like sure,
okay.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.970
That won't be that big of a deal.
And I'm sitting -- you know, I'm 60 feet below

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.400
on the deck here
shooting up because I wanted a clean background

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.830
with like, I think I
was shooting with like a 70-200 millimeter

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.530
lens.
So he goes up there and the director goes

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.770
up there, the director of
the museum and me and the art director from

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.890
Red Bull are standing down
there.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.600
And he stands up on the box and then, you
know, the guys are like okay

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.271
you're up on the box.
And Danny just pops a wheelie, and this is

00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:03.290
60-foot -- this box is only
like 3 or 4-feet wide and there's a 60-foot

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.500
drop right in front of him.
And Danny's just looking over at the director

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.600
saying, "You know, I'm
more comfortable on my bike than I am on my

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.429
own two feet." And then he
immediately -- he pops to the other box.

00:21:14.429 --> 00:21:17.730
So he started on this one, then popped to
this one.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.952
And then you know just kind of did these little
up and down movements

00:21:19.952 --> 00:21:24.549
and then popped back and then jumped off the
back of the box onto this

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.950
deck.
And the guy was standing right here.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.720
And he didn't really say anything to that.
He's like okay.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.799
And then as soon as the art director from
Red Bull saw this, she's like

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:38.250
oh, he needs a Red Bull T-shirt or something
because we couldn't see

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.730
the branding, which was perfect.
Because it was so complicated to get up here,

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.370
the director had to go
down to help her find her way up.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.880
And in lieu of that, that's when Danny just
went nuts and started doing

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.610
all kinds of tricks off the stuff [LAUGHTER]
that nobody could see

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.910
except for me and him and this is one of the
pictures.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.200
And then the director came back, they put
on a T-shirt and he just did

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.290
some quick little things, then we were quickly
escorted off the ship

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.400
after this.
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.059
But -- and there are so many other exciting
things that I photograph.

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:15.610
This is a shot I did with the Henry Search
and one rescue or -- Henry 1

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.260
Search and Rescue Team up in the Santa Rosa,
California.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.160
These guys are unbelievable.
One of the best search and rescue teams in

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.450
the United States, if not
the world.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:29.360
They do ocean rescues, cliff rescues.
And this is an assignment for Men's Fitness

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.100
magazine, that where
basically for three days, I flew with these

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.340
guys and I hung like a
hundred feet off the helicopter flying over

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.960
the ocean.
I got to, you know, do cliff rescues with

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.480
them where I was hanging
underneath the person they were rescuing.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.200
All kinds of stuff like that.
There's a whole series of pictures on my website

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.590
about this.
So I get to have a lot of fun on some assignments,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.780
some assignments are
quite a bit more miserable than this but we'll

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.110
show those here in a
bit.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.620
Now for photo enthusiasts, we'll just talk
about the gear real quick.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.370
This is a composite shot I did for the book,
that's like a two-page

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.450
spread in the book, and everything's is labelled
so you can tell what

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.020
it is.
This is kind of my complete kit except for

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.470
the fact that there's no
lighting equipment in here except for the

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:19.320
small strobes.
All of this doesn't go anywhere with me.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.950
I don't own a 600.
I rent a 600 when I do surfing photography

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.790
because it's a really
expensive lens I wouldn't use that often.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:33.820
So, you know, I'm using mostly digital cameras
these days.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.280
I have Nikon equipment.
I've been using it for 20 years, so I just

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.300
stick with what I know.
I still shoot with a Hasselblad every once

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.030
in a while.
I still like film.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.840
But everything becomes digital these days
at some point, so it's just

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.390
easier to shoot it digitally and not have
to worry about scanning the

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:54.860
film unless I'm going for a certain look.
This is generally how I carry my gear in a

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.730
big backpack, at least for
the cameras themselves.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.299
I'll have a lighting kit going, which I'll
show you that here in just a

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:04.470
second.
This bag pretty much goes to the point where

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.590
I'm going, and then I end
up breaking it down into smaller bags, where

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.980
I can actually carry them.
So this would be what I would take on a rock

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.700
climbing shoot.
It's like a small top-loader bag that I can

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.540
either wear on my chest or
around my waist and maybe one or two lenses.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:24.410
And for most of my stuff, I carry multiple
cameras, but I've got so

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:30.410
much other stuff like climbing gear or outdoor
gear to keep me safe and

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.350
not freezing to death that I can't carry too
much camera gear.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:40.270
This would be a skiing setup.
I would wear that chest on my pouch -- or

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.330
that pouch on my chest.
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:48.500
That would be hard.
And one or two lenses.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.610
And for like, you know, mountain biking, I
would take this just to have

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.840
different -- I have like a whole plethora
of bags.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.220
I'm the Imelda Marcos of bags.
I have 20 or 30 of these different things

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.900
depending on the sport.
This would be like the backpacking setup.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.600
So just whatever works.
This is my sea kayaking setup because I use

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.140
one of these underwater
housings just to keep my cameras from getting

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.250
destroyed.
And this is my adventure racing setup.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:19.419
And I actually I use the smaller pro cameras
so I can take the grip on

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:23.530
and off, which the grip allows me to have
a faster frame rate and

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.299
longer battery life.
So if I need eight frames a second, then I'll

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:29.350
put the grip on.
If I don't like for adventure racing, I take

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.549
it off and then I have
five frames a second on this camera.

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:36.621
This is just some miscellaneous climbing gear
I would take.

00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:43.250
This is a very light amount of climbing gear.
And if you're shooting surfing from the water,

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.020
this would probably be
the set up you're using.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.820
These are SPL housings.
They're not fully waterproof that far down,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.900
they only go to about 25,
30 feet but you're not really diving with

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.400
these guys.
So it's got to be light so you actually thrust

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.790
it out of the water at
the last second when you're getting nailed

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.150
by a huge wave.
So lighting stuff.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:05.460
I do a lot of artificial lighting with my
images just because I want to set

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.070
myself apart from the rest of the pack out
there shooting these days.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:15.330
And it takes a lot more work, it slows down
the process, and it really

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.690
complicates things massively.
But the results can be spectacular.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.660
So I have battery-powered stuff.
I have Elinchrom Rangers, which this is probably

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.150
a 20-pound setup with
one head and the battery and a few light modifiers.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.250
I also use these little quadras that they
just came out with, where

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:37.350
this a 7- or 8-pound setup 400-watt seconds.
The ranger before, the other slide, this one

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:42.460
is 1100-watt seconds, so this
the more pop if I need more power.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.780
400 here.
And the little strobes that come with your

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.970
camera, they're only like
100-watt seconds.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.350
So these are quite a bit more powerful than
those guys so they're not

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:54.320
and they're a lot heavier as well.
Then I use all kinds of light modifiers with

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.309
them just to soften light
or shape it or mold it how I want it to look.

00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:02.120
The other thing, are cases I have Pelican
cases that I take my stuff

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.669
all over the place because I'm usually standing
on a beach or somewhere

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:09.429
and it might be raining and, you know, just
to protect the equipment,

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:11.620
which when you get on an airplane with three
or four of these things,

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.929
they'll look at you with a little strange
look like, how much? Okay.

00:27:15.929 --> 00:27:19.059
Pull out your wallet.
So but the results can be quite different

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:22.990
than your average shot.
This shot has two strobes going at it with

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.050
grid spots which are like
little honeycomb foil things that go over

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.370
the strobe and direct the light
kind of like -- not like a laser but like

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:35.480
a spotlight to some degree a
diffuse spotlight and this is a cave Crystal

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:43.460
Cave in New Mexico.
It was 98 degrees this day in August and this

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.270
is Timmy Fairfield.
He's a world-class climber, this is a really

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.250
hard climb at 5.13, for
those of you who know climbing nomenclature

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.700
and he could barely even
hold on to the holds but he actually did the

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.530
route.
We're not posing here he's climbing the route.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.520
I just made him climb that part of the lip
three or four times so that

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.940
I could get the shot.
And this shot specifically, I thought about

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.460
this shot, I'd been to the
location.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.880
I'd scouted it.
I knew exactly what I would need.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.400
I knew the route we wanted to get on.
I had it pretty much sketched out in my mind

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.560
before we got there and
then we got there and I hauled 200 pounds

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.260
worth of lighting gear up to
this cave to make it happen.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.200
So this is, you know, and I was going for
this one shot, that was the

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.380
whole day.
It wasn't like just going out there and grabbing

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.130
a few shots.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.270
&gt;&gt; Two hundred pounds of lighting gear?

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.610
MICHAEL CLARK: 200 pounds of lighting gear.
And this is one of those portraits I did for

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.951
that Men's Fitness article
with the Henry 1 guys up in Santa Rosa.

00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:41.620
And this is a different shot than the rock
climbing shot in that we

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.910
basically had 30 minutes to set this up, get
this shot, and get out of

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.809
there because I was working with the sunset
and the background.

00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:52.490
And there was only a space of 25 to 30 minutes
that would be there.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.530
And then those guys, I had been shooting with
them all day and they

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.340
were kind of -- they were done, I could tell.
So I didn't want to like run them into the

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.260
ground here with the last
little portrait shoot.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.000
But I think they were pretty psyched when
they saw the pictures.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.230
So there's a bunch of strobes going off in
this point, in this shot.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.210
There's two strobes laying on the ground with
red gels on them, which

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:15.210
gives that red look to the, you know, canopy
and everything.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.299
There's the HUD display inside, the heads
up display, which has got

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.100
these green lights which is kind of casting
on them, on their jackets

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.150
especially.
And then I had little strobes pointing straight

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.740
at their face.
And at one point, I couldn't really get the

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.750
pilot on the -- on the
left's face to really show up, so I just handed

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.289
him a headlamp and told
him to hold the headlamp at his face.

00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:40.450
So there's a lot of problem solving, you know,
super fast we had to get

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.070
this thing done.
And this is like one of the last shots I got

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.610
before we just stopped and
it worked out pretty well.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:53.710
And sometimes you have no gear.
No lighting equipment and you have a headlamp.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.550
And this was shot in Torres del Paine in Southern
Chile at four in the

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.419
morning.
I didn't have a tripod, so I just put the

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:05.100
camera on a rock.
And we took 50 shots while she stood there

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.760
and walked around.
With really minimal gear, you can get some

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.320
pretty amazing results if
you're just willing to work it.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.350
Here's another shot that, if you first saw
this, you may just think

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:20.100
it's the end of the day sunlight.
And that's what I was trying to mimic here

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.820
just put the light where the
sun would be if the sun was still up, and

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.900
you know blast him from the
side with -- it's got a little orange gel

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.130
on the strobe.
And this is isn't that big of a jump.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:37.020
It's just maybe 12-15 feet, even though it
looks really short from the

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.049
angle I'm at.
And I just had him do it five or six times

00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:42.760
to get the right body
position and the timing had to be key too,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.340
cause you only get one shot
with the strobes, you so can't blast off like

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.559
8 frames second and pick
the one you want.

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:52.690
Here's it's just one shot, so you kind of
have to nail the timing which

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.990
that's why it's great to work with pro athletes
because they can do the

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.630
same thing over and over and over and they
can put their body position

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.591
perfectly in alignment with where they were
before.

00:31:01.591 --> 00:31:07.110
Or you can tell them do this or then they
can change how they're doing

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.471
their trick.
Some things aren't super crazy, you know,

00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:14.510
I do a bunch of those pan
blur stuff as well, where it's slow shutter

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:19.110
speeds on the camera, and
then it's a strobe filling in and you get

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.281
these ghosting features.
And basically, I'm running with the camera

00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:25.070
and have an assistant
running with the strobe, and you just click

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:30.679
off, you know, that's a
shot every few seconds as the strobe recycles.

00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:34.280
And then, I mean, I think I probably shot
a hundred pictures just to

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.080
get this one picture.
And they're all -- you look at all the pictures

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.260
like, oh, this is crazy.
I remember I did this on the Adobe shoot,

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.740
we did a whole bunch of --
there should be a picture here doing that,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.460
and the art director was just sitting there
like what are we doing?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.720
And then I showed him a few of the pictures,
and he was like keep doing

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.280
that.
So it's kind of experimental but fun.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.860
This is another more technically executed
version of that where I just

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.350
the camera is stationary this time and the
flash is too, and you just

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.940
have her ride by and you just catch it at
the right moment.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.770
And you if you look close, she's actually
ghosted just a little bit but

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.150
she's sharp enough because the flash is sharpening
the person, the

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.640
flash is actually stopping the motion not
the camera.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.210
Because the camera's set to a tenth of a second
and the duration of the

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.700
flash is creating a sharp, static image of
her in the frame.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.120
And this is one of those pictures from the
Adobe assignment.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.350
And my assistant was running with the full
strobe set up, it

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:34.070
probably weighed 15 pounds in sandals through
the bushes off the trail.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.630
Luckily, she was okay.
But we did that like 250 times.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.580
Here's another shot with just a headlamp.
I was in Canyonlands.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:49.710
I had one camera, one lens with me.
My D700 and at 24-70, I taped it to a tree.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.750
I didn't have a tripod, which it would have
been nice to have a tripod,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:59.770
but -- and then I just walked out here.
It's like a 30-second exposure and, you know,

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.580
clicked on my headlamp,
shined it into the tent a little bit and then

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.429
kept walking out of the
frame.

00:33:04.429 --> 00:33:06.870
And then the camera was just open to fill
in the stars behind it and

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.510
everything else.
And this is another one I shot for Adobe,

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.710
this is just popping over
like a five-foot ledge.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.500
I'm actually tucked underneath this ledge
as tight as I can because

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.250
he's coming down like three or four inches
away from my face.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.410
And then the strobe is being fired from above
the lip of this little

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.400
cave.
He landed on my feet at one point which was

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.420
not so much fun but worked
out for a good shot.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.870
And here strobes is just kind of, you know,
just to mimic another

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:41.170
climber who is below this person.
I saw this happen where the other climber

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.740
looked up, as she was coiling
her rope on top of this little boulder.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.500
And it lit her up and kind of separated her
from the sky so I mimicked

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.659
that action by just putting a strobe there
to make it brighter because

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:58.950
the strobe wasn't that bright.
So out in the field, you know, you use all

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.230
the tricks you can to get
the pictures to make them look the way it

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.659
feels while you're out there.
Like especially the mountain biking stuff,

00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:09.679
sometimes if you just take a
straight picture, it doesn't feel as big as

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:13.879
that 20- or 30-foot cliff
felt when you look at, the awe of those guys

00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:16.829
doing what they do.
So I use a lot of fisheye effects like this

00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:21.139
image, where this is only 6
or 7 feet tall but just getting underneath

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.979
there and close in is a
great little effect.

00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:28.659
Rock climbing one of the challenges is showing
how steep it looks and

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:33.379
giving that feeling to the person.
Generally that means being above the climber

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:36.030
which really helps out.
It's a lot more work because you have to get

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.869
above the climber but
sometimes you can shoot from the side.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:44.820
Kayaking, it's the auto focus setting of your
camera blasting away as

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.589
much as you can.
Kayaking things are moving so fast it's hard

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:52.560
just to keep the person in
the frame if you're tight, and you want to

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.950
be semi-close.
If you're not that tight, then there's just

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.509
going to be a little dot on
a river.

00:34:56.509 --> 00:35:01.630
So that can be a major challenge.
To overcome that usually what I do with my

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.989
camera -- and I think the
Canon cameras are the same -- they have like

00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:06.099
a whole field of focus
points.

00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:09.470
And I'll choose where I want the person to
be, you know, if I want her

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.200
to be in the lower right or the lower left
or wherever I want them to

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.029
be in the composition, I'll just the put the
point there and I'll plant

00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:19.609
that on their head as they move.
And so that's how you can control the composition

00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:21.519
as they move through
the frame.

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:24.599
And you know, I can see if it's working on
the back of my camera since

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:28.460
we're shooting digitally these days, so that's
kind of nice.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.069
Mountain biking -- we'll do some questions
at the end here.

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:34.979
Mountain biking is kind of a similar thing
as well.

00:35:34.979 --> 00:35:38.729
You just kind of put your points where you
want them to be in focus and

00:35:38.729 --> 00:35:42.170
you know especially this trip, this is like
a little BMX jump which he

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.250
did like 10 or 12 times.
So I can kind of perfect the shot.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:50.059
And every time I keep shooting, I'll get one
frame, okay, that's not

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:53.489
really working.
Let's try this, let's try something different.

00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:56.660
And sometimes mountain biking you just got
show the pure speed with

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.900
like a big dust trail or something like that
this is up in Silverton.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.729
And he's doing like 40, 50 miles an hour coming
down this downhill

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:11.000
track, just flying.
And this is a guy, this is, I can't remember

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.700
his name -- but these guys
hiked to the top of a 13,000-foot cliff across

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.229
from Silverton, no
trails.

00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:23.049
Talus slope, got on their bikes, downhill
bikes rode straight down the

00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:26.779
mountain.
The talus, you can actually see, this is a

00:36:26.779 --> 00:36:30.569
big chunk of rock about the
size of his head coming down after him.

00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:34.259
They rode straight down here, went out into
this grassy valley straight

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:39.789
down this valley out into here.
There were like maybe 12- to 15-foot wide

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:42.630
streams that -- with cliffs next to
them and they just jumped straight off the

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.849
cliff, over the streams,
down.

00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:47.650
No trails anywhere.
These guys are amazing.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.380
This is also the guy who jumped off the 100-foot
cliff and broke his

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.599
back.
And the doctor put two, I think it was fiberglass

00:36:56.599 --> 00:37:02.039
rods, into his back
into his spine, and he -- and the doctor told

00:37:02.039 --> 00:37:04.460
him that his spine was
stronger than it was before.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.019
Bad news.
Because he still does this stuff and he walks

00:37:08.019 --> 00:37:10.329
around with a cane, great
guy.

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:15.549
But they're doing some pretty amazing stuff.
Another great picture or story with this picture,

00:37:15.549 --> 00:37:18.559
he's doing about
90 miles an hour right here.

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:24.190
It's -- this would be much better in video
but still frames, basically,

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:28.009
he dropped into a bowl above this and is arcing
up on this wall.

00:37:28.009 --> 00:37:31.009
And there's a cave underneath him right here
that you can't see in the

00:37:31.009 --> 00:37:37.670
shade and this is the top of the arc.
And he comes down, this little boulder right

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:42.880
here, shows like the foot
and a half place where the transition is smooth.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.640
Everywhere else the transition is kind of
not smooth, so if he hits

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.160
there he's going to fly straight off the front
the bike and die

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.999
probably because he will hit his head impacting.
While -- he's not doing 90 here but he's doing

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:57.380
90 when he gets there
and then he goes up on to that thing and comes

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.410
back.
He found this place and was the first guy

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:06.109
to do this little wall ride.
And one of my other biking friends who I'd

00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:09.230
shot a lot saw this was like
no way I'm not doing that.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.289
That's totally nuts.
So we did this five times.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:15.930
The fifth time he nearly stalled here and
would have fallen 80 feet,

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:20.140
and we stopped.
So a big part of my job is managing risk with

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.809
the athletes as well to
some degree or at least trying to talk them

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:25.779
out of stuff.
Actually did talk that guy out of something

00:38:25.779 --> 00:38:28.460
else that would have been
really crazy.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.950
Here's another one of the pan blur images.
Sometimes the conditions aren't so great.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:38.789
This is in Alaska, up in the Ruth Glacier,
spent a month up there, saw

00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:43.579
the sun maybe three days.
Didn't really do anything but sit in a tent.

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:50.869
Read the Brothers Karamazov, it was good.
And I'm going to skip along through a bunch

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:52.880
of different images here
real quick.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.480
Sometimes the details are the best thing.
[PAUSE]

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:04.089
Also the lifestyle stuff is -- kind of shows
the background, you know.

00:39:04.089 --> 00:39:08.670
This is a shot going into Indian Creek which,
you know, it's not that

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.630
unbelievable a shot.
But it's just driving in at the end of the

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:16.950
day after a long day of
climbing, the Balloon Fiesta again, some of

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.599
the mountain bikers,
surfing.

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:23.390
I'll quickly show some of these images from
the Eddie Aikau.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.150
It's rare in a professional's life or any
photographer's life that

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:32.119
things line up so perfectly.
I planned this trip a month in advance and

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:35.700
had no clue if there would
be waves or not when I got to the North Shore

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.109
of Hawaii.
Two days after I was there, there were warnings

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:42.559
going off that the
biggest waves in 40 years were going to hit

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:44.519
the islands.
And they were warning everybody to evacuate

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:47.569
the coast line because they
thought houses would get ripped off the shore,

00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:51.239
which a few of them were
damaged but nothing got ripped off luckily.

00:39:51.239 --> 00:39:54.130
But as to turned out, they had the biggest
big wave surfing contest

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.619
that's ever been held.
And they had 50- to 60-foot waves.

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:04.380
This is Sunny Gonzalez under a 50-foot wave
at Waimea Bay.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.761
The interesting thing is they were basically
free falling off the top

00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:09.319
of the waves.
So you would -- and this isn't even that big

00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:12.319
of a wave.
This is only 40 feet, for these guys.

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:16.319
So you'd free fall like 15 or 20 feet before
you even touched the wave

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:20.390
face.
And that was pretty amazing, these guys.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:27.210
I mean, this is the who's who of surfing.
You got the Andy Irons, Bruce Irons, Kelly

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.479
Slater.
Everybody's there that's -- the whole crew.

00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:34.239
And this is Greg Long who won it.
He caught like three 50- or 60-foot waves

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:40.579
right at the end of the day.
This is another pan blur from Pipeline, actually,

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:43.059
this is just up the
beach.

00:40:43.059 --> 00:40:46.079
So but -- projects, this project came to me
 -- it's the Wenger

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:50.150
Patagonia Expedition Race, came to me through
Google, through you guys.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.160
They looked for adventure photographers.
They just typed in adventure photographers,

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.809
and my name came up number
two or three.

00:40:55.809 --> 00:40:58.769
And the number one and two guys were there
at the event shooting with

00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.660
me.
They picked the top three.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.769
And it's the one of the longest, hardest races
in the world, up there

00:41:05.769 --> 00:41:08.150
with the Tour de France, I would say, and
the Iditarod and a few of

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.859
those guys.
It is an adventure race.

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:17.259
So basically there's hiking, there's sea kayaking,
there's climbing on

00:41:17.259 --> 00:41:22.359
ropes not like climbing -- rock climbing.
And there's also mountain biking which is

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:24.779
on roads down there because
there no single track.

00:41:24.779 --> 00:41:29.369
And there's also dragging your boats over
islands, too, if you really

00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:34.229
enjoy suffering.
So it's -- it's one of those suffer fest races,

00:41:34.229 --> 00:41:38.250
where I haven't seen
human beings willingly put themselves through

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.700
this much pain ever.
These guys could go climb Everest three times

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.789
back to back and not even
sneeze, I have a feeling.

00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:49.991
They're just -- they're superhuman.
Six hundred miles in ten days, no trails,

00:41:49.991 --> 00:41:53.959
except for the roads for the
mountain biking and no maps.

00:41:53.959 --> 00:41:56.770
In fact, actually, the maps are Google Earth
maps.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:02.029
That's all they had, which were incredibly
detailed, but you know

00:42:02.029 --> 00:42:03.809
that's pretty amazing when you're in the middle
of nowhere.

00:42:03.809 --> 00:42:08.059
I mean, we're talking 300 or 400 miles from
anywhere.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:12.500
And I'll just quickly tell this story, this
is last year, 2009, when I

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.999
was shooting the race.
I was with those guys in the trekking section

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:19.190
and a couple of the
teams, and we ended up on this fishing boat

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:24.099
in the Magellan Straits.
And we got on this boat, me and another photographer

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:27.089
and one of the
riders and we had been backpacking for three

00:42:27.089 --> 00:42:28.749
days.
It had been raining sideways the entire time,

00:42:28.749 --> 00:42:30.549
we were just -- we were
over it.

00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:33.480
We were done.
And we were about to go hypothermic when this

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.009
boat pulled into the bay,
and we asked if we could stay on their boat

00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:40.739
for a couple hours while
the race organizers sent us a boat.

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:42.880
What ended up happening is we were on the
boat for a day and a half

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.289
because the boat never showed up from the
race.

00:42:45.289 --> 00:42:48.839
But it was one of the coolest things that's
ever happened in my career

00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:52.380
because as soon as we got on the boat, we
realized these guys were a

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.690
National Geographic moment.
They were so interesting.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.890
They were fishermen who fished for this stuff
called luga, which is

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:02.959
like red algae on the bottom of the ocean.
So this is the father and he worked with his

00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:05.109
son.
And he would be under the water for 15 hours

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:09.700
every day, breathing
through a garden hose.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.930
Just a garden hose -- not with the end chopped
off; attached to a

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.670
generator on the boat, which would stop every
once in a while.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.640
And for lunch the next day, he asked us if
we wanted fresh king crab

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.839
and sea urchin.
We were like, yeah, for sure.

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:29.250
So he dove over the side, got some sea urchins,
came back with a bag

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:33.249
full of like 50 of them, we cracked them open.
Eating sea urchins on the boat with a little

00:43:33.249 --> 00:43:35.329
lemon juice.
It was phenomenal.

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:40.089
And then he went back over and got this just
giant king crab, which we

00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:42.019
ate.
And it will never get any better than that

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:45.989
for me, so I'll never have
king crab again.

00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:50.229
And this is just one of the portraits I got
of him as he came up and

00:43:50.229 --> 00:43:53.150
then Nikon World did an article on the whole
story.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.950
But then portraits -- I shoot a lot of portraits
just because for

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:01.299
magazines, you need to be able to tell different
parts of the story.

00:44:01.299 --> 00:44:03.930
Most of my portraits have something to do
with the outdoor world in

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:09.799
some respect.
And digital workflow.

00:44:09.799 --> 00:44:13.940
I shot a big deal for Adobe three or four
years ago with Mark and those

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:18.969
guys, the crew there.
And through that, I wrote a book on basically

00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:21.950
my entire digital
workflow which is available on my website.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:26.920
It's not really a published book.
It's a PDF E-book but just shows my entire

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.029
workflow from the camera all
the way through to when I deliver the images

00:44:30.029 --> 00:44:33.749
to the client.
Very interesting little book, a lot of people

00:44:33.749 --> 00:44:36.560
love it.
Check it out on the website, if you want it.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.999
The other thing I have and this is free stuff.
This is the marketing deal I started ten years

00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:46.140
ago or more which gets
me many jobs, including the one I got with

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.880
Mark here at Adobe, and it's
basically a magazine.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.049
It's a PDF document, anywhere from 15 to 20
pages, and in it includes

00:44:56.049 --> 00:44:59.180
gear reviews, it has articles about my latest
assignments.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.039
Here's one about the expedition race last
year.

00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:07.109
It talks about all the gear I use.
It has little digital tips for photo editors.

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:10.289
It's something I send to photo editors and
it's got like 5,000 people,

00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:13.400
I think now, that sign up for it and get it
whenever I get around to

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.609
writing it four times a year.
It includes a lot in that stuff the images,

00:45:17.609 --> 00:45:23.359
special portfolios, and
stuff you can take home for yourself.

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:26.739
So when you guys are out there shooting, what
can you learn from an

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:29.739
adventure photographer?
If you haven't figured it out already, preparation

00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:32.079
and planning.
Like if you're using strobes, you got to really

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:36.369
think about that stuff
and figure out how you're going to integrate

00:45:36.369 --> 00:45:39.469
that into your shoot.
Improvising and problem-solving are always

00:45:39.469 --> 00:45:41.869
good skills, and here at
Google, I'm sure you guys are great at that

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:44.539
stuff.
Transferring it your camera and that stuff

00:45:44.539 --> 00:45:48.969
is just a matter of knowing
your camera.

00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:52.880
Also, don't forget about the details, like,
look for those things that

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.739
aren't apparent at first, like the people's
hands, their feet, their

00:45:56.739 --> 00:45:59.289
expressions.
Look for what they're doing and really get

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.229
in close.
I mean, you're probably shooting your friends

00:46:01.229 --> 00:46:04.759
or they'll soon become
your friends, if you're shooting adventure-type

00:46:04.759 --> 00:46:07.709
stuff.
And try to get in close and just crop things

00:46:07.709 --> 00:46:10.539
out, so you can show
what's going on without showing the entire

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:15.050
scene.
And then also, I'd say master -- I mean, I'm

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.329
guessing you're all
shooting digital for the most part -- master

00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:20.370
your digital workflow
because it's kind of sad to see a great image

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.369
kind of not be worked up
perfectly or not have a color-calibrated monitor,

00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:25.809
this or that or
whatever.

00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:29.140
So it doesn't kind of make it all the way
down the pipe to where it

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:33.559
could be.
Also helps if you're obsessed, and you work

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:37.200
crazy hard, which I'm sure
you guys have no problem with those.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.450
Come early, stay late.
You know, after everybody started leaving

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.420
that's usually when the good
stuff starts happening or before everybody's

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.930
gotten there.
And set yourself up for success is the one

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.572
big thing I would say.
There's a National Geographic photographer

00:46:50.572 --> 00:46:56.170
who used to say, who is Jim
Richardson, "If your images aren't that good,

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.730
put something more
exciting in front of the camera."

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:02.519
So it's pretty, well, you can tell from my
work, I go by that

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:05.119
philosophy.
I just find the craziest thing going on and

00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:07.410
I can take pictures of it.
It's not that hard to get a great picture.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.869
And that will definitely help.
And by setting yourself up for success I mean

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.509
go out when the light is
good.

00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:18.529
Go out, you know, when you've got a good composition
set up because

00:47:18.529 --> 00:47:21.079
you've scouted it out or something like that,
so that you know you can

00:47:21.079 --> 00:47:24.069
get a good picture.
So you're just going out on the hope and a

00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:28.440
prayer, it's going to hard
to get some decent pictures so a little forethought

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.350
and planning.
Anyway, thanks again for having me out.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.959
It's been a pleasure and an honor to be here
with you guys.

00:47:33.959 --> 00:47:34.959
Any questions?

00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:35.959
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:35.959 --> 00:47:43.630
&gt;&gt; So, um, we have -- so if you have any questions,
um -- say, please,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:50.579
we have a mike over here or if you just want
to shout them and we can

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:53.400
repeat them up here with a little bit of time.
Make them good questions.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.400
[PAUSE]

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.400
MICHAEL CLARK: Anyone?

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400
&gt;&gt; So for stuff like for rock climbing where
some of it is just kind of in the moment,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:08.749
how do you balance between actually setting
up a certain shot versus just trying to be

00:48:08.749 --> 00:48:12.599
there and capture what happened?

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:15.910
MICHAEL CLARK: So the question is how do you
set up a rock climbing

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.399
shot and basically --

00:48:18.399 --> 00:48:27.920
&gt;&gt; It's like the balance between setting up
a specific composition versus just capturing

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920
what happened, like how do you balance that?

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920
MICHAEL CLARK: How do you balance specific
action and capturing what

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.069
happens?
Um, it's always a little of both is the answer,

00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:36.410
I guess.
Because you're setting up for one route is

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.029
basically what you're
setting up for, and then whatever -- it's

00:48:39.029 --> 00:48:41.900
not like I'm shooting just
one section of that route, I'm going to shoot

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.219
the entire length of that
climb.

00:48:44.219 --> 00:48:47.709
And I may not even know what the best picture
is that from route if

00:48:47.709 --> 00:48:51.640
I've never seen it climbed before.
So what will happen is I'll usually -- I'll

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.249
just work my way up with
the climber and I'm pulling the rope up behind

00:48:55.249 --> 00:48:58.319
me so that's it's not in
the picture.

00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:01.309
And if I find a section that looks really
interesting from my angle

00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:03.729
which is usually a body position or something
like that, then I'll just

00:49:03.729 --> 00:49:06.900
have them climb that like five or six times
and then we'll move up.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.309
I mean, the sad fact is that most rock climbing
photography is posed

00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:14.079
because there's no other way to do it hardly
unless you're shooting

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:17.940
from the ground or somewhere else.
Or unless you're a phenomenal climber who

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.479
can climb as fast as the
climber is climbing with camera gear.

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:22.959
So does that answer your question?
Okay.

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:23.959
Sir?

00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:26.719
&gt;&gt; What is your working relationship with
your, eh, models?

00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:30.829
With the climbers and such?
Does somebody hire you for a shoot and then

00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:37.549
you hire a climbers or does
somebody else do the whole thing or --

00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:42.859
MICHAEL CLARK: It's a good question.
Mostly with climbing, they're all my friends

00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:47.529
that I've, you know, known
for years, and either like say the North Face

00:49:47.529 --> 00:49:50.160
would call me and they
want me to go out with a certain crew of people

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.359
who I already know or
the climbers are going somewhere, and then

00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:55.220
I pitch the story to a
magazine or somebody.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.440
So it kind of goes back and forth both ways
between the sponsor, the

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.360
climbers, me all talking at the same time
and sometimes I don't know

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.029
the climbers at all.
But I get introduced through other climbers

00:50:05.029 --> 00:50:07.059
who say, oh, you should go
talk to this guy, he's a great climber.

00:50:07.059 --> 00:50:11.589
You'll get some great images of him.
So it's just kind of random all over.

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:12.720
Any other questions?

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.720
[PAUSE]

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.130
&gt;&gt; Have you ever been in a situation, for
example, you're on a boat for a [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:25.160
and you didn't expect to be there, did you
ever run out of batteries or [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.890
MICHAEL CLARK: Um, I've nearly died a few
times --

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:29.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:34.681
I've nearly died a few times.
The question was have I ever, like, been in

00:50:34.681 --> 00:50:38.839
a situation where I ran out
of batteries or something went wrong.

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:41.661
Just the question.
I've never run out of batteries.

00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:46.829
I usually come with way more batteries than
I would ever need but I

00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:51.200
have had some extremely close calls where
my rope nearly got cut.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.279
Well, I was hanging from one strand of the
core out of seven, 300 feet

00:50:56.279 --> 00:51:01.069
above the ground that was pretty exciting.
Yeah, I've had several.

00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:06.200
I've been hit by falling rock.
So stuff has definitely gone wrong.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.869
And I'm very lucky to be here.
Knock on wood.

00:51:08.869 --> 00:51:13.929
But does that answer your question?
Yeah, okay.

00:51:13.929 --> 00:51:19.699
&gt;&gt; Hi, one problem I've had is when trying
to focus on moving things

00:51:19.699 --> 00:51:21.579
with one focus point, a lot of times it falls
through to the

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:24.109
background.
What do you do about that?

00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:28.093
How do you sort of keep that from happening?

00:51:28.093 --> 00:51:30.589
MICHAEL CLARK: Auto focus is tough.
Which cameras are you using?

00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:31.589
&gt;&gt; D300.

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:33.769
MICHAEL CLARK: Okay.
I've got that camera.

00:51:33.769 --> 00:51:37.930
It's a great camera.
Talking specifically to that camera, there's

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.190
dynamic focusing which you
can set up so that you have one point you

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.130
choose and then it uses
however many points you tell it to around

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.650
that to select the focus.
And using that, it usually can hold onto something

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.400
pretty well.
If you're using just one point as a static

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.229
focus, yeah, it definitely
with will go to the background.

00:51:56.229 --> 00:52:00.299
There's a whole bunch of stuff which I talk
about in that little

00:52:00.299 --> 00:52:03.269
digital workflow book on how to set up my
camera.

00:52:03.269 --> 00:52:05.869
And Canon is a little different, I don't know
how the auto focus

00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:09.049
settings are on that camera but there's different
ways to set up the

00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:14.059
auto focus so it will work for certain sports.
And you just got to experiment because one

00:52:14.059 --> 00:52:17.609
doesn't necessarily work for
the other sport but the dynamic focusing option

00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:21.199
definitely works.
And I can talk to you more about that if you

00:52:21.199 --> 00:52:23.039
want afterwards.
Anybody else?

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:26.449
And by the way, if you want to read that story
about the rope getting

00:52:26.449 --> 00:52:31.359
cut, it's on my website.
I was on assignment for Climbing Magazine

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:35.539
and I called the magazine the
day after it happened because I pretty shaken

00:52:35.539 --> 00:52:38.420
up obviously.
And they were like -- we don't need -- we

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.859
don't want a photographer to
die on assignment. It's never happened yet.

00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:45.579
We don't need it to happen yet or now.
So it was pretty gripping.

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:47.549
Any other questions?
Go ahead.

00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:50.480
&gt;&gt; What are your next projects?

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:55.700
MICHAEL CLARK: Next projects?
Well, immediately I'm going down to LA tomorrow

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.619
for some book signings,
but some more shoots for Red Bull, the Red

00:52:59.619 --> 00:53:04.339
Bull Rampage is this fall.
I've got another few shoots for [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:04.339 --> 00:53:08.029
and some other companies
here are coming up and editorial assignments.

00:53:08.029 --> 00:53:11.249
I don't have any major epic adventure coming
up.

00:53:11.249 --> 00:53:14.739
I was at Patagonia twice this year so I'm
kind of taking a little rest

00:53:14.739 --> 00:53:18.949
at the moment but just little stuff here and
there.

00:53:18.949 --> 00:53:20.919
Thanks for having me out guys.
