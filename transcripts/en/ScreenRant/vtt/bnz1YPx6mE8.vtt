00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.530
Whether writing a movie or a TV series, there
is one universal truth: endings are hard.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.580
Many films deliver an intriguing premise,
compelling action, or powerful messages, only

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.010
to fumble in the closing act.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.350
Our list of 10 Good Movies Ruined By Terrible
Endings shows that strong films can succeed

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.990
despite flawed climaxes, but in our opinion,
they would have been even better if their

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.279
conclusions were just as flawless.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.279
A.I.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.439
Artificial Intelligence

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.539
Stanley Kubrick�s A.I.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:40.610
Artificial Intelligence, a futuristic retelling
of Pinocchio, was put on hold with Kubrick�s

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.000
death in 1999, eventually falling into the
hands of Steven Spielberg.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.680
For most of the film, the robotic child�s
quest to find a mystical �Blue Fairy�

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.980
to make him �a real boy� fits Kubrick�s
style.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.260
But when the film reaches its climax, the
plot abruptly sends David millennia into the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.260
future.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.650
The ending can�t decide whether it�s sentimental
or somber; it�s thought-provoking, but more

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.170
straightforward than expected.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.170
The Ninth Gate

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.990
Roman Polanski�s The Ninth Gate follows
rare book dealer Dean Corso (played by Johnny

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.990
Depp) as he works to verify a centuries-old
text designed to conjure Satan.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.149
When a missing page leads to a botched attempt
at summoning the devil, that page literally

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.590
flutters into the story, landing squarely
in Corso�s lap.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.009
The climax brings him to the threshold of
immortality before the screen fades to white.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.700
Ultimately The Ninth Gate falls short by lacking
a real ending (and leaving viewers scratching

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.130
their heads over its message).

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.460
Signs

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.639
Although the climax of The Sixth Sense made
M. Night Shyamalan a house hold name, it didn't

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.960
take long for his flaws to show.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.600
In Signs, a family in rural Pennsylvania bears
witness to an alien invasion of Earth.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.909
The twist ending plants an alien in their
living room and it�s revealed that the family�s

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.850
traumas and failures were fated to save them.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.759
Aliens choosing to invade a planet that is
covered in their only weakness (water) is

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.249
enough of a plot hole, but the fact that human�s
weapons (drinks scattered throughout the house)

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:33.620
could have been anything else, shows how clumsy
the conclusion really is.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.879
The Devil�s Advocate

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:54.890
The Devil�s Advocate packs one heck of a
twist: after young defense attorney Kevin

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.909
Lomax rises to the top of his field, it�s
revealed that his boss, John Milton, is Lucifer

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.610
himself - and that Kevin is his son.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.049
Kevin kills himself to foil Lucifer�s plan
to breed the Antichrist, but then the story

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.120
rewinds and returns Lomax to the film�s
first scenes.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.390
The final shot of a laughing Al Pacino clearly
still set on corrupting his son turns the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.760
movie into a confusing morality tale, instead
of the descent into immorality it had been

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760
to that point.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.950
2001: A Space Odyssey

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.950
The final sequence of Stanley Kubrick�s
2001: A Space Odyssey sends the audience hurtling

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.950
through space, before closing on a shot of
the infamous �Starchild�: a colossal fetus

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.950
floating in space next to Earth.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.950
Critics were just as confused as audiences,
but the message isn�t entirely ambiguous:

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.950
the monolith gave apes the wisdom to use weapons
and tools, and this second evolutionary leap

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.950
turns humans into a newborn with new awareness
of the larger universe.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.950
While 2001 remains a classic for everything
from music to set design, its finale left

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.950
many curious viewers confused and the film�s
message remained lost on many.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.950
The Wolverine

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.950
Hugh Jackman�s Wolverine is one of the most
popular superheroes of modern comic book blockbusters.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.950
So fans were elated when director James Mangold
promised that The Wolverine would take the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.040
character seriously and set the film in Japan.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.049
For most of the movie, the story and themes
fit perfectly, but following Wolverine�s

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.359
journey of introspection, rebirth, and renewal,
he must fight an enormous Adamantium samurai

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.760
and a venomous mutant femme fatale.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.969
While the film succeeds in drama and urban
martial arts action, its final fight descends

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.540
into far-fetched comic book cliche.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.909
High Tension

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.680
Horror filmmakers often rely on twists as
a final thrill, and horror fans have come

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.189
to expect them just as reliably.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.299
Such is the case with French indie slasher
High Tension, which depicts a weekend retreat

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.680
gone horribly wrong.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.109
Unfortunately, the film�s twist � the
depraved killer is a split personality of

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.030
the main character � spoils the experience.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.110
This is nothing new for the genre, but in
High Tension, it simply doesn�t make sense.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.660
After a moment�s thought, entire sequences
seem implausible, if not completely impossible.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.930
I Am Legend

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.080
I Am Legend keeps close to author Richard
Matheson�s original novel, following Robert

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.560
Neville (played by Will Smith) as he attempts
to cure to a disease that has ravaged Earth�s

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
population.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.039
But the movie hints that his view of the afflicted
humans as �mindless animals� isn�t accurate.

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.110
When the story comes to a head, Neville ignores
the evidence altogether, handing a �cure�

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.460
to other survivors before blowing himself
up with a hand grenade.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.100
It�s an odd resolution given the build-up,
but in the alternate ending, Neville realizes

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.759
he has killed countless thinking, feeling
mutants, and returns a test subject to her

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.759
loved ones.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.570
The fact that fans seem to prefer this ending
shows that the studio made the wrong call.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.080
Sunshine

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.070
Few directors have applied their talents across
as many genres as Danny Boyle, from horror

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.289
to survivalist drama.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.052
Sunshine, his foray into science fiction,
was certain to be thought-provoking, and it

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:17.830
delivered � for the most part.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.310
Following a small crew of astronauts charged
with re-starting the Sun to save Earth from

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.340
a solar winter, the film explores the psychology
of space travel, a multicultural future, and

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.070
man�s role in the universe.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.449
But just as it seemed that the film had earned
its place alongside 2001: A Space Odyssey,

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.300
Alien, and Solaris, it takes a hard right
turn and becomes a run-of-the-mill slasher

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.910
movie, leading to an underwhelming final act.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.120
Superman: The Movie

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.620
Richard Donner�s Superman: The Movie is
considered the �best� film version of

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.560
the superhero by many, but its ending is puzzling
nonetheless.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.620
When Lex Luthor�s devious plans come to
fruition, Superman is forced to choose which

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.310
American coast to save, resulting in the death
of Lois Lane.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.740
Enraged, Superman takes to the skies and flies
around the Earth against its rotation.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.449
Suddenly, the catastrophe and destruction
rewinds, revealing the Kryptonian to have

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.139
control over time itself.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:14.120
No matter how you explain it, granting the
hero such power forever changes his mythology.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.009
Superman has traveled through time, but he�s
never reversed it.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.870
As one of the first successful comic book
movies, Superman: The Movie�s ending can

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:35.900
be forgiven, but the filmmakers backed themselves
into a corner by refusing to commit.
