Speaker 1:          00:00          Wow. Do you like roast battle? Do you like a judging that I get, I cringe sometimes cause they're so fucking mean. Yeah. Sometimes people are so mean, you know? Um, uh, but I do like it. I do love the writing aspect of it. I love the fact that it's a joke writer's forum but I don't want to name any names or this one comic that I'm friends with that does really well on roast battle and I said, hey man, how come you, when you roast you have all this good new material but you're doing the same stupid shit when you go on stage all the time. Like you were doing the same set for years. You're not, you're not advancing cause you're not writing a lot but you're writing a lot when you write for roasts and I'm like you should treat like your material.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Like the same way you treat your material when you have to roast. The thing about the roast is like say if a you are going to roast with Tony Hinchcliffe, you guys know each other, you know who you're writing for. I Tony, what does he look like? He looks like, you know, you start fucking around with all I know this about Tony and that about Tony. This is going to be funny. And it forces you to be creative. Whereas I think there's so many guys that they, they develop, um, a framework of a set, and then they just kind of like that. That is their comfort. The comfort is in the fact that they know, even if it's not good, they know that they can go from this to that and that to this, and they know where they're going and they don't, they're not lost. You know? And I think that the beautiful thing about the roast is none of that material you can do in any other place. You can only do it right there. So you have to work on. And so oftentimes you see like what a comics capable of when they're roasting versus what they're doing when they're actually doing the real set, which seems stale.
