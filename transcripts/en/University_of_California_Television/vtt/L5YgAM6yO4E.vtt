00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.096
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.290
- It's great to see so many people here.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.930
I'm so happy that we have a good turnout

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.563
for our distinguished speaker, Talal Asad,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.420
and it's my great pleasure
and distinct honor

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510
to present him to you.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.420
He joins a long list, you
heard some of the names,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.600
of illustrious foster lecturers.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.910
Dr. Assad received his master's degree

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.913
from Edinburgh University
and his doctorate at Oxford.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.670
After seven years
teaching in Great Britain,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.700
he moved to the United States
where he joined faculties,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.930
first at the New School
for Social Research

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
and then at Johns Hopkins University.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.990
For the past decade,
he's occupied a position

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.090
as distinguished professor of anthropology

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.930
at the Graduate Center of the
City University of New York.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.120
Dr. Assad has been a visiting professor

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.050
at universities around the world,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.930
including to our great
benefit and pride, our own,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.930
so this is a revisit
for him to our campus.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.900
Talal Asad is a prolific
writer, the author of six books

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.880
and numerous shorter works.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420
More than four decades
of productive scholarship

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540
have earned him a well-deserved place

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.600
in the canon of required reading

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
for anyone interested in
comparative religious studies.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.640
Among his most celebrated
publications are:

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.640
Anthropology and the Colonial
Encounter, published in 1973,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.510
Genealogies of Religion,
published in 1993,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.650
Formations of the Secular, 2003,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.123
and just last year, On Suicide Bombing.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.200
Dr. Asad's work is essential
for an understanding

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.110
of the relationship between
the sacred and the secular,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.090
the private and the public,
tradition and modernity.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.990
He has made major contributions

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.800
to our knowledge of
Christianity and Islam,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.980
both historically and contemporaneously.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.490
Devoted to translating and demystifying

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.380
spiritual beliefs and
behavior, Dr. Asad's work

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.290
builds an intellectual bridge

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.040
between followers of distinct
religious communities.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.730
Having grown up and studied
in both the Middle East

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.550
and the west, he is in
a privileged position

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.200
to address questions of
religious coexistence

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.530
and conflict past and present.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.320
Dr. Asad's work consistently demonstrates

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.630
an erudite and creative
interweaving of history,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.780
sociology, anthropology, and philosophy.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.010
Above all, he is unfailingly informative,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.810
interesting, and provocative.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.120
Dr. Asad speaks to us today on the topic

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.670
thinking about religion,
belief, and politics.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.287
Please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Dr. Talal Asad.

00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:31.454
(audience applauding)

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.380
- Thinking about religion,
belief, and politics

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.010
and it is really an attempt to think

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.300
rather than to present
any kind of complete

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.630
and determined position.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.360
Since the closing decade
of the millennium,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.000
social friction generated by the presence

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.320
of substantial numbers of
Muslim immigrants in Europe

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.360
and the threat of Muslim
terrorists have given a new impetus

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.370
to the fear of politicized religion.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.680
Violent and intolerant
fundamentalist movements

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.410
have emerged, not only
in the Muslim world,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.970
although these are the most
frightening in the west,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.290
but also in India, Israel,
and the United States.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.900
The secular values of liberal
democracy are under siege

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.230
or so much of the western media tell us.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.150
Academics who teach religious studies

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.050
have responded eagerly
seeing in this an opportunity

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.390
to demonstrate the public
relevance of their expertise.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.100
What is to be done about the dangers

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.123
to liberal democracies
of religious belief?

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.680
But tonight I want to begin
with a prior question,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.160
one which I've addressed before

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.120
and I'll go over some of the points.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.030
What is religion?

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.410
How has it come to be
defined in the ways it has?

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.140
Why is belief so strongly emphasized

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.963
in so many definitions?

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.740
I'll then go on to speculate
about it's connections

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.670
with politics, mainly through a discussion

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.910
of some shifts in perspective

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.663
in the anthropological study
of ritual and religion.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.310
But, I'll also discuss Charles Taylor's

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.540
recent magnum opus, A Secular Age,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.590
that draws strategically,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.490
but very importantly, on anthropology.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.280
On Victorian ideas of the primitive mind,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.723
as well as on recent ideas about ritual.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.120
This is a generous and learned work,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.040
full of insight of the
kind we've come to expect

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.910
from this philosopher, but I
want to try and think beyond it

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.650
and I'll do so by stressing
the body as the site of senses

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.020
and sensibilities in
religion and politics.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.820
And I'll end by drawing
on an ethnographic work

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.760
on religion and politics
that is a counterpoint

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.180
to Taylor's epic, and this
is by an anthropologist

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.330
who is actually a Berkeley anthropologist,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.423
Charles Hirschkind,
The Ethical Soundscape.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.710
Now, skeptics have long written about

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.170
the origin of religion,
however for most of them

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.810
it was not the idea of
religion that was puzzling,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.190
only its emergence was.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.770
At least since the Enlightenment

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.870
one important approach
to understanding religion

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.650
has consisted in what anthropologists call

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.173
the sociology of error.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.010
The main question was what gave rise

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.963
to such patently false
beliefs in the first place?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.550
The testing of belief
propositions in this area,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.480
and thus their falsification,
tends to depend

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.510
on a highly simplified language ideology

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.890
that predicates both the
counterintuitive character

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.820
of religious belief statements

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.133
and the emotional character
of religious conviction.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.870
The sociology of error,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.930
invented by Victorian anthropologists

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.560
for understanding religion,
eventually gave place

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.070
to another approach in
which a different set

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.653
of questions was raised.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.760
Is religion the universal?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.370
What kinds of belief practice
are peculiar to religion?

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.020
Do religious beliefs and
practices give meaning to life,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.630
if so, what kind of meaning?

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.120
Do primitives find psychological comfort

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.640
from religious practices when confronted

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.427
by an unprecedented natural environment?

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:36.410
And do moderns seek
certainty in religious belief

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.160
when they are plunged into bewildering

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.763
political economic change?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.550
Anthropologists and others
sought to explain religion

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.350
by reference to what I
would call externalities,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.170
that is by looking for
it's social function

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.540
or for it's cultural meaning.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.880
The concept of religion and it's history

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.620
remained virtually unexamined

00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.793
in this 20th century approach.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.680
To my knowledge, Wilfred Cantwell Smith's

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.400
The Meaning And End Of Religion in 1962

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.800
was the first book to
present a historical sketch

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.653
of a concept of religion in the west.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.083
The first to suggest that
it was relatively recent.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.900
He also argued perceptibly
against essentialist approaches

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.510
and yet in the end he
didn't quite break free

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.493
of a residual essentialism himself.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.640
Smith sought to substitute
the word faith for religion

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.440
in order to avoid the
dangers of reification.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.320
But what this move led to was an emphasis

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.820
on an ineffable experience
as opposed to relationships

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.610
created through, maintained by,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.590
and expressed in practices
of various kinds.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.570
It's not that there's
anything wrong in my view

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.400
in stressing the
importance of inner states

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.940
when discussing religion,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.950
even when describing
non modern religiosity.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.820
What's questionable I think

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.040
is making a particular language game

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.960
in which an apparently unmediated

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.870
inner life articulates faith.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.600
The basis of a universal
conception of religion

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.817
as when he writes and I quote from him

00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:22.737
"my faith is an act that I
make myself naked before God."

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.960
The reason I think there can't be

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.740
a universal conception of religion

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.560
is not because religious
phenomena are infinitely varied

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.520
and certainly not because
there's no such thing as religion

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.470
as some have suggested, it's that defining

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.470
is a historical act and when
the definition is deployed

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.530
it does different things
in different times

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.600
and circumstances and responds
to different questions,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.860
needs, and pressures.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.110
Although what's marked for
devout practitioners as religion,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.840
it relates to what is essential for them

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.600
at the level of scholarly analysis.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.220
It has no essence I would say, and by this

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.450
I don't mean that things
don't hang together

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.820
in distinctive, even necessary ways

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.690
in particular religious traditions,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.553
but only that these are altered over time.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.570
To define is to repudiate some things

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.420
and to endorse others.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.760
Defining what is religion is not merely

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.140
an abstract intellectual exercise,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.030
it's not just what anthropologists

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.743
or other modern scholars do.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.270
The act of defining religion,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.610
and this is forgotten sometimes

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.480
even by religious scholars,
scholars of religion,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.760
I beg your pardon, not
the same thing at all,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.050
it's not just what religion
or what anthropologists

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.400
and other modern scholars do,
the act of defining religion

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.620
is embedded in passionate
disputes connected with anxieties

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.150
and satisfactions affected
by changing conceptions

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.900
of knowledge and interest

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.630
related to institutional disciplines.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.270
In the past, colonial
administrations used definitions

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.330
of religion to control and regulate

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.600
the practices of their subjects.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.670
Today, liberal democracy
is required to pronounce

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.130
on the legal status of such definitions

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.450
and thus to spell out
immunities and obligations.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.750
Definitions of religion does
have profound implications

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.130
for the organization of social life

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.280
and the possibilities
of personal experience.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.980
And yet, for this very
reason academic expertise

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.890
is often invoked in
the process of arriving

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.203
at legal decisions about religion.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.260
In short, universal
definitions of religion

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.060
divert us from asking questions

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.650
about what the definition
includes and what it excludes,

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.653
Why, by whom, and with what consequences.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.180
Popular debunkers and
defenders of religion

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.610
very often tend to anchor their polemics

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.350
in clear-cut definitions.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.760
They are uninterested in how
diverse religious notions

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.330
do different things in
people's ordinary lives,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.677
in how the human
sensorium, seeing, hearing,

00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:17.060
and so forth, articulates experience

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.920
recognized as religious
or called non-religious.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.990
They don't ask in what historical
context, to what audience

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.480
the act of defining particular
practices as religious

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.973
makes or fails to make good sense.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.200
Liberal critics and defenders of religion

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.680
have nevertheless argued with one another

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.030
over its implications for
modern ethics and politics.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.890
Central to both sides of the debate,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.343
is the notion I think of belief.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.970
Regarded at once as a privilege,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.080
that is the subjects ability
to choose her beliefs

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.663
and a danger, beliefs'
incitement to violence.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.770
A first step towards
understanding this convergence

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.700
between both positions is to review

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.050
the classical Lockean
doctrine of religious freedom

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.360
that set some of the
main ideological terms

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.370
for this argument.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.880
Those of you who are very familiar with it

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.430
will forgive me if I just
go through very briefly

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.440
one or two points here,
which are important

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.730
for what I want to say.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.360
According to the modern
conception of religion

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.000
belief can't be coerced
because it's located

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.880
in a private mental space.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.100
This of course is the core
of John Locke's theory

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.263
of toleration and one part of
the genealogy of secularism.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.340
The theory rests on a
new religious psychology

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.113
that was beginning to emerge
in 17th century Europe.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.220
This allowed Locke to
insist that the princes

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.840
attempt to coerce religious belief,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.700
including belief in the
salvational implications

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.963
of religious practices, was
irrational because impossible.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.070
All that force could secure

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.173
was an insincere profession of
faith and outward conformity.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.890
Therefore, so the argument
went and still goes,

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.230
force employed by civil
government should be directed

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.840
only at securing objective
public interests,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.130
the protection of life, limb, and property

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.840
as the famous phrase has it.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.370
In fact, it's precisely
because the mind is seen

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.220
as the impregnable bastion
of true religious experience

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.920
that the modern argument
regarding the impossibility

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.263
of controlling belief from
outside acquires plausibility.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.270
Some liberal philosophers have countered

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.230
the awkward example of
brainwashing by arguing

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.340
that it merely creates inauthentic belief

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.023
however sincerely that belief may be held.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.840
Authenticity they argue,
consists in the subject's ability

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.163
to choose her beliefs and to act on them.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.270
In this fashion, belief
reinforces the idea

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.043
of an autonomous subject,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.280
but does the insistence
that authentic belief

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.620
is quite different from a sincere
and yet inauthentic belief

00:15:15.618 --> 00:15:20.618
mean that the act of saying
something passionately

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.610
without choosing should
be pronounced inauthentic?

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.430
And I'm not sure that it should.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.550
When somebody takes up a stubborn position

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.180
because as they put it famously

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.160
because there is no moral alternative,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.610
I can do no other, in the
famous phrase of Luther's.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.620
Should we say they are being inauthentic?

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.430
I don't think this strikes,
at least it doesn't strike me

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.970
as being somehow quite right.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.620
External forces can not
only compel subjects

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.490
to do or to refrain from doing things,

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.460
but beliefs too, in my view,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.410
can be imposed by indirect means.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.220
So although the insistence that beliefs

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.930
can not be changed from outside

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.290
appeared to be saying something empirical

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.350
about personal belief,
it's singular, autonomous,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.760
and inaccessible to other location,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.523
it was really part of a political
discourse about privacy,

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.670
a claim to civil immunity.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.564
But the claim tended
by and large to be made

00:16:27.564 --> 00:16:31.530
against the state and
still to some extent does,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.680
not against the market

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.900
where political economic seduction

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.260
is typically transmuted
into internal compulsions.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.570
We don't think of that as being

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.473
somehow an imposition
and that's interesting.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.150
In his acclaimed book A Secular Age,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.530
Charles Taylor has recounted a story

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.700
that seeks to vindicate both
the historical emergence

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.860
of the secular democratic order

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.630
and the promise of liberal religion.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.100
Although there's virtually
nothing in the book itself

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.660
on the liberal democratic state as such,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.940
but there is in his other
some in his other writings.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.570
Contemporary western
christianity as he puts it

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.163
clearly depends on it.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.040
The most important sense of belief

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.240
sought by liberal
religion is private belief

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.403
that is protected by the liberal state.

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.833
Taylor's first chapter opens
with the following statement:

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:32.800
"One way to put the question
I want to answer here

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.380
in this book is this:

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.070
Why was it virtually impossible
not to believe in God

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.140
in say 1500 in our western society,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.290
while in 2000 many of us find this

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.457
not only easy, but inescapable."

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.670
If there is a single condition,
and that's the quote from,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.890
that's the sentence from Taylor.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.720
If there is a single
condition that can be said

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.800
to sum up the modern
character belief for Taylor

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.410
it's that individual
believers are now confronted

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.410
by the distinction between
experience and its construle.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.520
He thinks this is a particularly modern,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.740
don't quite agree with that,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.830
but still that's an important distinction.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.823
This distinction makes
religious belief private,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.540
that is one may entertain
doubt and uncertainty

00:18:25.513 --> 00:18:29.247
as well as optional, one can choose.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.040
So these are the two
aspects that were absent

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.563
according to him in the pre-modern world.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.940
A secular liberal state is necessary

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.250
if these conditions of belief

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.280
are to be defined and protected.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.400
Taylor isn't primarily
concerned with beliefs

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.860
as propositions that
people hold to of course,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.190
his interest is in what he
calls social imaginaries

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.830
or what anthropologists call social myths

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.920
that undergird these beliefs.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.730
His interest is in telling the story

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.877
of how I quote again from him

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:06.160
"the whole context of understanding

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.240
in which our moral, spiritual,
or religious experience

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.737
takes place is gradually changed."

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.800
Spiritual experience according to him

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.170
is a matter of being directly
in touch with transcendence,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.410
that offers itself as a source of meaning

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.150
and gives the individual what
he calls a sense of fullness.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.060
When unbelievers feel
that life lacks meaning

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.410
the result is a characteristically
secular unhappiness

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.723
that Taylor calls a modern malaise.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.610
Yet in modern society, I
would suggest Christians

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.930
and non-christians,
believers and non-believers

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.400
all live more or less the same life

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.973
within the capitalist system.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.934
But if they share, given
class differences of course

00:19:53.934 --> 00:19:58.880
and so on, but if they share
a style of private life

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.100
and a distinctive relation
to public politics,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.313
how does belief distinguish them?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.180
As I understand Taylor,

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.950
it's the modern western
individual's ability

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.950
to interpret experience that
leads to different beliefs.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.450
Taylor recognises the plurality of beliefs

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.740
as an inescapable modern fact

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.450
and affirms the right to
individual interpretation

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.180
as a transcendent liberal value.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.180
And although belief in his
story is not to be equivalent

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.950
in some simple way to a
proposition as I said already,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.800
the centrality of
construle or interpretation

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.850
by what he calls the
buffered self in this account

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.150
which is counter posed to
the pre-modern porous self,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.410
brings it pretty close to something

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.900
that is capable of being
stated I would argue,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.173
if not propositionaly, then
in the form of a narrative.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.170
Taylor's narrative promises
the unhappy conscience

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.200
the possibility of redemption
by religious belief.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.440
A self that seeks to be redeemed

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.530
regards it's life as a narrative,

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.633
a life that takes the
form of a personal quest.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.580
But there's no redemption
for disrupted selves

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.993
in his account.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.160
Taylor's narrative of how a reformed

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.400
and disciplined Christianity got here

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.390
by traversing overlapping
social imaginaries

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.320
is itself an attempt
at narrative coherence

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.290
in which some things are repressed

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.740
and others are emphasized.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.100
One can see why individual belief

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.680
as a choice by right, not
the content of beliefs,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.270
but the fact of belief is
so central to Taylor's story

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.230
about the secularization of religion

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.250
and why the Christian
promise of personal salvation

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.233
finds a place in his optimism
about liberal politics.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.120
Perhaps one might also see why Taylor

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.110
is so scornful of attitudes
that regard modernity

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.750
non-teleologically as having a tragic

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.420
because irresolvable character

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.820
and why he sets aside disruption

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.233
as offering a creative opportunity.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.810
There's no mention in Taylor's
story of the global crises

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.860
that threatened the world today.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.840
Interestingly enough, climate change,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.330
the militarization of
space, economic collapse,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.220
this was written before the
present crisis by the way,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.340
economic collapse, it
wasn't too hard to do that,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.900
nuclear proliferation, war, and terrorism.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.250
And the widening gap
between the wealthy few

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.150
and the many poor.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.070
The word crisis appears in his entire text

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.423
which is of 900 pages long or thereabouts,

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.390
appears in that text only in reference

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.000
to the loss of personal
meaning for believers

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.963
and for felt need for an absent narrative.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.140
But what's this to do
with religion you may ask?

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.470
Well, the answer is
nothing, that is nothing

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.210
if religion is to be defined essentially

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.390
as a matter of belief
in personal salvation.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.940
And yet, one wonders what happens

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.750
to the possibility of narrating the self

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.100
if the world in which
the believing subject

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.103
must live is seriously imperiled,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.860
and there's no discussion
of that unfortunately.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.080
Since the beginning of
western scholarly interest

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.490
in the subject, ethnographic reports

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.060
have played an important part

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.963
in helping to construct the
object of religious studies.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.713
Taylor himself draws
generously on anthropology,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.460
so let me turn to some debates

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.293
on the concept of religious belief.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.760
Among anthropologists,
it was Rodney Needham

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.217
who first critically examined

00:24:02.217 --> 00:24:05.720
how anglophone ethnographers identified

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.310
the religious beliefs of
the people they studied.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.010
What exactly he asked is
being presented to the reader

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.860
when the ethnographer
claims to be writing about

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.323
the interior state of believers.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.310
His answer was a skeptical one

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.700
because these states aren't
necessarily expressed

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.050
socially through language,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.213
there are no inner states
that are universal.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.380
Not everyone found this answer conclusive,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.650
but Needham did point to
something of central importance

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.830
to the whole enterprise
of comparative religion.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.200
And that is translation,
not only from one language

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.000
to another, but also across
two different modalities,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.233
that is the interior and the exterior.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.300
Several anthropologists
who subsequently address

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.990
the question of belief did so with respect

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.940
to the universalism
versus relativism debate

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.270
in which the concern remained cognitive

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.240
and primary intention was paid

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.033
to implicit meanings in ritual.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.900
For example, Malcolm Ruel,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.200
writing on the Christian
creed in a widely read article

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.070
observed and I quote from him

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.110
that "The performance of
the Creed is as complex,

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.880
symbolic, and condensed an act of ritual

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.470
as any other liturgical
act and is consequently

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.160
as much subjected to
the categories developed

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.760
for example by Turner,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.787
for the analysis of ritual symbolism."

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.010
The Christian creed Ruel pointed out

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.403
combines two senses of belief.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.230
Belief in a divine
person, the living Christ

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.140
and belief that a sacred
event had occurred,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.713
the crucifixion and resurrection.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.810
This echoed an important
historical distinction

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.470
between belief as a
relationship of trust, love,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.000
and commitment and belief as a proposition

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.233
held in one's mind as true or falsifiable.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.490
Although Ruel doesn't say
so, it should be clear

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.490
that whereas the second sense
of belief allows for choice,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.193
the first doesn't do so
or at least not so easily.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.950
Following Needham, we might ask

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.680
how we can identify belief

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.710
in medieval Latin Christendom?

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.830
A society in which it said
that it was almost impossible

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.333
not to believe as Taylor famously says.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.860
Recent historical research has shown

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.650
that it is not plausible to
regard the medieval period

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.513
as a monolithic age of faith.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.230
There's ample evidence
that medieval people

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.900
often rejected such orthodox doctrines

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.160
as the immortality of the soul,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.550
I'm sorry for this series,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.950
the resurrection, the incarnation,

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.170
virgin birth, and purgatory.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.430
The difficulty is that
no ready method exists

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.030
for deciding whether such
rejections simply meant

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.840
a total absence of
so-called religious beliefs

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.180
or were prompted by alternative beliefs.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.780
The problem is further complicated

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.340
by the fact that the vocabulary used

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.463
belongs to a very
different semantic field.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.390
Infidelitous was typically
used in secular contexts

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.860
such as charters, laws,
and historical narratives.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.270
It usually meant breaking
a contract or an oath,

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.913
acting in a disloyal manner,
or breaching someone's trust.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.640
Infidelities were not simply
those who fail to hold

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.870
Orthodox convictions, they
were first and foremost

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.140
those who acted disloyally in some way

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.100
or those who through acts
of treason or misfortune

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.430
were no longer a part of the
relation that bound together

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.023
God, Latin Christians, and
their king, one to another.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.780
Credere, the word in Christian latin

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.289
that's translated into
english as to believe

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:17.289
usually as a moral rather
than an epistemological sense

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.840
meaning to trust someone more often

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.933
than to be convinced about
the truth of a proposition.

00:28:26.248 --> 00:28:29.950
As the medievalist Dorothea Weltecke

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.440
cites the case of Aude
Fauré, a young peasant woman

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.030
who was brought before the Inquisition.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.940
She was unable she said to credere indo.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.780
The detailed context makes it quite clear

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.830
that what she meant was
not belief in the sense

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.070
that we would now translate it.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.683
She took the existence
of a God for granted.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.470
It was precisely because
in her desperation

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.210
she couldn't see in the
eucharist anything but bread

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.530
and because she found herself struggling

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.300
with disturbing thoughts about incarnation

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.220
that she had no hope of God's mercy

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.700
and that is what she meant when she said

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.200
she didn't as it were,
what we would translate

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.740
as believe in God.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.950
My point is simply that
the words then in use,

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.830
and this applies to
other cultures as well,

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.380
that we now translate
as belief and unbelief

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.590
should not be regarded as
epistemological concepts

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.600
that define objects of choice,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.360
so important for us in our modern culture.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.790
Both words expressed
emotional dispositions

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.620
embedded in social and
political relationships

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.833
as well as distinctive sensibilities.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.570
What's changed is the
hierarchy of the senses

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.300
I'd suggest, that links human
practices to one another

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.790
and to their natural environment.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.790
A change in what Wittgenstein
called a way of life

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.560
and ways of life don't change as easily

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.083
as ideas in one's head.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.060
I will return to this point later,

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.020
but first I want to say
something about ritual,

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.910
a kind of practice that's
often been seen by critics

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.520
as symbolic activity and by many critics

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.603
as activity with an
anti-democratic implication.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.010
This is just ritual as the saying goes.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.270
Anthropologists studying
religion have been interested

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.271
not only in religious doctrines,

00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:33.271
they have also written
about religious practices.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.171
Like other Victorians,
evolutionary anthropologists

00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:40.716
tended to interpret as
magical ways of coping,

00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:44.800
rites as magical ways of
coping with difficulties

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.890
of the natural environment.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.590
Protestant theologians,
who were also students

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.280
of primitive religion, such
as the famous Robertson Smith,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.920
both an anthropologist and a theologian,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.800
took the view that true
Christianity required

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.143
that he'd be stripped of Catholic magic,

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.423
that is of false science.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.850
But later anthropologists saw all this

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.543
as a methodological mistake.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.950
Rituals they maintained,
were not to be regarded

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.500
as primitive ways of adjusting to nature,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.370
not as evidence of primitive minds.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.993
As actions, rituals had a
social function of their own.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.770
Some anthropologists like Edmund Leach

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.460
proposed the idea that rituals

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.250
weren't instrumental actions at all.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.740
Rituals symbolized something,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.563
communicated cultural meaning.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.320
But for Victorian evolutionists,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.150
as well as for many of their
anthropological successors,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.980
the modern notion of belief

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.870
attributed to what used to
be called primitive peoples

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.623
was essential to their
conception of ritual.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.510
Whether it took the form of a cosmology

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.200
or culturally defined norms,

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.490
whether it was to be
reconstructed from explanations

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.240
offered by practitioners
or read into social actions

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.100
and arrangements by
resort to western theories

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.050
of signification, belief was central

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.313
to the repetitive
activities classed as rites.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.460
Scarcely any anthropologist in my view

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.160
took Needham's worries about
beliefs as an interface

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.203
between inner and outer seriously.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:30.380
However, some anthropologists
who now wrote about ritual

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.930
took the communicative perspective

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.630
in an interesting direction.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.950
Thus, Morris Bloch took
linguistic performance itself

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.880
as the paradigm of symbolic action

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.960
and argued that the very
formality of oratory,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.750
as in a formality of polite manners,

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.210
was a crucial means of social control

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.593
and political domination.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.320
Formal communication
including religious ritual

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.390
and political oratory was to be seen

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.210
as the denial of choice,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.120
one was forced into a
certain form he argued

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:13.400
in this kind of paradigm,
and that therefore it meant

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.483
submission to traditional authority.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.400
And traditional authority in
Max Weber's influential view

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.010
was one of the three modes
of legitimate domination

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.070
as many of you will know.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.600
This approach to ritual
therefore reinforced the idea

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.550
that the autonomous
subject needed to break

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.270
from tradition and the
repetition of the past

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.873
it demanded from him or her.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.410
The claim that ritual had a
repressive social function

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.010
resonated with the view
that liberal religion

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.690
should primarily take the
form of private belief

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.660
with a strong Protestant
rejection of Catholic ritualism.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.800
It reinforced the well-known notion

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.840
that ritual was not only non-rational

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.710
but also anti-political in the sense

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.240
of politics that liberal democracy values,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.290
including the principles of equality,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.830
the freedom to choose,

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.780
and the right to free speech and so on.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.090
However, the notion that
formality is necessarily

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.093
an external form of
coercion is questionable.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.450
It's only when forms become elements

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:27.000
in a goffmaneque strategy that they serve

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.680
as a means of control over others.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.010
Goffman was also another person from here

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.780
I remembered suddenly.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.740
But to the extent that
public forms contribute

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.160
to the making and remaking
of the self in a social world

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.840
to cultivating it where in other words

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.300
external forms are part
of the developing self

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.943
it's effects will be different.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.980
In that context, what the embodied self

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.750
learns to say and do, how it handles

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.800
behavioural and verbal forms
in relationship to others

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.210
at the center of the
selves moral potentialities

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.160
and not merely externally imposed.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.850
In short, if we think of ritual

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.120
not as a mode of denying choice of belief

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.760
by means of imposed formalities,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.100
but as developing aptness
of behavior, sensibility,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.820
and attitude by means of a learned grammar

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:26.450
then I think come to a
more useful understanding.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.410
Thus, contrary to Bloch's thesis

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.000
that the repetition of forms,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.320
that's the condition of formality itself,

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.410
is necessarily repressive, one can see

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:40.340
that formality requires not
only repetition of past models

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.400
but also the creativity
that issues from judgment

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.980
of it's present relevance.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.730
The cultivation of forms is thus necessary

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.923
to the cultivation of ethical virtues.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.270
In my mind it was Marcel Mauss

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.110
who in his famous essay
entitled Body Techniques

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:04.170
offered the most fruitful
insight into the study of ritual.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.210
And he began from the obvious fact

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.650
that the educated body achieved
a range of human objectives

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:15.270
from styles of physical
movement, walking for example,

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.490
through modes of sensibility

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.710
and two kinds of spiritual experience.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.760
Mauss was not interested in the divide

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.210
between religion and secularity.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.580
He had no investment in
constructing a category

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.414
called religion as a component

00:36:31.414 --> 00:36:36.414
of a universal called religion.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:43.050
His interest was in the
formation of attitudes

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.813
both sacred and profane.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.700
Most importantly, he showed a way

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.740
of asking different questions

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.440
than the ones focused on belief.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.849
In the final paragraph to that essay,

00:36:54.849 --> 00:36:59.527
Mauss wrote famously, I
have quoted this before,

00:36:59.527 --> 00:37:01.920
"I believe precisely that there are,

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.720
even at the base of all
our mystical states,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.960
body techniques which
have not been studied,

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.480
but which were fully
studied in China and India

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.090
ever since ancient times.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.040
This socio, psycho, biological study

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.853
should be made, he goes on to say,

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.680
I think there are
necessarily biological means

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.170
of entering into communion with God."

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.823
This is still Mauss, not me.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.683
That biological means of
entering into communion with God.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.840
Now, Mauss isn't saying of
course that that experience

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:43.010
can be explained biologically,
but only that the inability

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:47.040
to enter into what people
have called communion with God

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.290
or the inability to revere
words, things, and persons

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.300
associated with him may be the function

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.853
of inexperienced bodies,

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.010
of bodies for whom certain
kinds of experiences

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.223
have been made difficult,
if not impossible.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.040
For Mauss, belief was not
a matter of construing

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.200
and choosing, but of the
mode in which the human body

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.720
conscious as well as unconscious, exists.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.660
To put this point in less invidious terms,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.910
one might say that the secular
attitude and experience

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.090
like the religious
requires particular social,

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.350
psychological, biological conditions,

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:31.720
I'm using Mauss's phrase,
that the distinctive attitudes

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.220
underlying secularism as
a political arrangement

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.303
presuppose particular
hierarchies of the senses.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.460
Some culturally valorized senses

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.080
are deliberately encouraged

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.680
as objects of disciplinary projects.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.060
Others emerge out of the convergence

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.370
of various political economic developments

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:56.620
and the regulatory strategies
that they give rise to

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:03.350
in modern industries, mass
markets, cosmopolitan cities,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.130
modern transport and communications,

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:10.173
capitalist corporations,
and modern warfare.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.090
Social imaginaries in other words,

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.170
as a set of pre-reflective
assumptions and beliefs

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.420
don't seem to me to be quite explanatory

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.450
of the historical shift from
a so-called believing culture

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.550
imposed and maintained
by traditional authority

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.940
to one that's free and
predominantly unbelieving

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.080
because explanations in
terms of social imaginaries

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.480
subsumes, as Taylor himself has argued,

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.480
subsumes lower order desires
which are raw and corporeal

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.190
within higher order desires

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.870
which are construed, that is
interpreted and evaluated,

00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:00.020
so that those lower order
desires are actually organized

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.070
by the higher order
desires according to him.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.860
And this seems to me to underestimate

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.040
the contingency of bodily senses.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.410
In other words, the
notion of social imaginary

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.390
and the associated notion of construal

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.110
seemed to me to fail to get
at the unpredictable shifts

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.480
and distortions in social
life that are independent

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.370
of the criteria for
interpreting experience

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.513
and of a coherence sort in narrative.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:32.140
To explore connections of
religion belief and politics

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.110
we need to ask a number of
questions about the body

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.910
I think, it's senses and it's attitudes.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.200
For this we need ethnographies
of the human body,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:47.200
its attitudes to pain, physical
damage, decay, and death

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.370
as well as to bodily integrity,
growth, and enjoyment

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.580
to isolation from and
strong connection with

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.120
other persons and things.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.720
Attitude incidentally seems to me

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.490
to be less intellectualist
and more practical

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.203
than our modern overstretched word belief.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:11.500
What architecture of the senses,

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.810
hearing, seeing, smelling,
touching, tasting

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:19.620
do particular attitudes and
sensibilities depend on?

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.730
How do new sensory perceptions take shape

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.290
and make older ways of
engaging with the world,

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:29.390
that's building experiences
and older political forms,

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.483
not merely wrong but irrelevant?

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.150
The work of Walter Ong especially,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.500
and I won't mention them, but anyway,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.810
his work is relevant to these questions

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.392
because he was among the
first to trace shifts

00:41:44.392 --> 00:41:49.392
from the reliance on hearing
to primary emphasis on seeing.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:53.460
Ong has rightly been criticized

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:57.690
for recounting an overly simple
story of historical stages

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.260
in the development of human communication

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.720
from oral culture through
alphabet and print

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.983
to the electronic media.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:09.620
In fact, both in the past and
today, orality and writing

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.850
have been intertwined in complicated ways.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.320
Let me give you one example

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.700
from the Islamic scriptural tradition

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.620
in which the senses of hearing and seeing,

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.603
reading and reciting
are closely intertwined.

00:42:26.522 --> 00:42:28.330
Te Quran, which as many of you know

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:32.250
means literally recitation,
is deeply rooted

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.320
in complex continuities,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.300
quite apart from the major schools

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.450
that have provided it
with it's construles.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.300
The earliest text written in
a primitive seventh century

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.190
Arabic script seems to have been treated

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.970
as a kind of musical score,

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.850
a prompt for the oral rendition

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.053
that depended on memorization
through reiteration.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.470
Sign and sound went together,

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.790
but not in any direct or fixed way.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.720
It was only because the oral
traditions were continuous

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.640
that they were able to
provide an imminent frame

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.950
for the written text

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.543
and thus, for its scholarly
reception over the centuries.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.120
An effort has always been required

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.120
to abstract the Quranic text
as an intellectual object

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.780
consisting of statements
or even narratives

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.800
from the relationship
between the charged sound

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.430
and the attentive body

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.923
with its growing store of memorizations.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:42.090
The historian Alain Corbin
has taken up the question

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.730
of changing perceptions of the world

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.200
appropriated by different human senses,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.570
hearing, seeing, smelling, in detail.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.880
In his fascinating study,
The Foul and the Fragrant,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.140
he traces the densely
interwoven discourses

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.430
on the cramped condition
of the urban masses.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.010
The conditions of contagious disease

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.260
and the practices of individual hygiene

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.883
in 18th and 19th century French society.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.580
One eventual consequence Corbin observes,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.880
was an added emphasis on
the priority of clear sight

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.960
and I quote "there was
increased concern for light

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.180
in private dwellings as in public spaces.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.170
This was the beginning of
the great swing in attitudes

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.460
that was to give supremacy,
he writes, to the visual.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.990
Darkness made nocturnal
animals sad and perfidious.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.140
Uncertain light was a threat to health,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.897
zeal for work, and sexual morality."

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.550
Corbin points out that it was not always

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:50.100
the ideas themselves
that immediately changed,

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.330
but rather that the new form of perception

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.960
made for what he calls

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.473
a new intolerance of
traditional actuality.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.050
Shifts in sensory
perception endow experience

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.700
of other people and things
with complicated emotions,

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.140
anxieties, and pleasures,

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.580
a function not merely of what is sensed,

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.960
but of how it's sensed.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.120
The new hierarchy of the senses

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.470
associated with new patterns of living

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.800
contributed to an aspect
of modern subjectivity

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.243
that we might provisionally
identify as secular.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.377
I quote from him again:

00:45:27.377 --> 00:45:30.640
"Techniques of ventilation
insofar as they acknowledge

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.810
the need for space between
bodies and gave protection

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.970
against other people's
odors brought individuals

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.760
into a new encounter with
their own bodily smells

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.730
and as such, contributed
decisively to the development,

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.917
he writes, of a new narcissism."

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:55.550
Now if Corbin is right,
then this narcissism,

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.732
this disgust at other
people's bodily odors

00:45:58.732 --> 00:46:03.050
and love for oneself in one's own odors

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.890
may have reinforced the
feeling that an unwanted touch

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.433
by a foreign body, an unwanted
touch by a foreign body,

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.460
was a shameful
contamination making a wound

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.900
inflicted by another,
yet more of a defilement,

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:25.900
one calling for a vigorous
cleansing response.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.930
So one might turn this around
and ask what kinds of violence

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.070
whether individual or
collective can be traced

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.380
to this modern narcissism

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.420
if in fact we are willing
to go along with this.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.970
And this may help, I think, explain

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:48.450
why the ambitious narcissist
protects his own boundaries

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.880
religiously if I may put it that way,

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.563
but easily transgresses the
secular boundaries of others.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.660
At any rate, many secular sensibilities

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.580
are the unintended consequences
of new sense perceptions

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.280
that are themselves part of
the changing ways of life.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.130
Of course, attitudes and sense perceptions

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.830
are also deliberately
cultivated in institutions

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.660
and social movements,
but the important point

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.540
is that the senses are
central to the public life

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.470
in which people participate,
to the ways they promote,

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.223
submit to, or resist the
forces of political life.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:30.780
The modern secular state
isn't simply the guardian

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:34.490
of one's personal right
to believe as one chooses,

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.100
it's also and first of
all a collective condition

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:42.810
in which one senses and
feels in specific ways.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.420
And yet, the work of the senses

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.980
has received less attention than it should

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.743
in the study of secular politics.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.870
What has come to be discussed
in increasing detail

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.520
is discipline, and I myself
been very interested in that,

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.290
discipline in the cultivation
and internalization

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.210
of attitudes as well as in the regulation

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:06.210
of individual conduct
by external authorities.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.600
But important though discipline is,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.510
the conscious cultivation
of behavior and belief

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.360
isn't quite the same thing
as the unintended shifts

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.280
in the sensorium described
by anthropologists

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.043
and historians like Corbin.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.380
Thus, in his interesting study of the role

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.870
of Calvinist doctrine

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.970
and practice in the
formation of the early modern

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:32.320
European State, Philip
Gorski has reviewed a range

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.320
of authors who've dealt with
the idea of discipline in ways

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.240
that he regards as useful,
but not quite adequate.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.080
His own thesis is that the intensification

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.260
of religious discipline
in early modern Europe

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.110
helped strengthen the state

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:50.370
in several ways and that
the process of strengthening

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:53.743
was dual in origin, both
from above and below.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.330
Taylor draws in some detail on Gorsky

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.700
because he's interested
in the way discipline

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.370
has contributed to the
formation of what he calls

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:06.223
a buffered self, an objective
self contained self,

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.670
disenchanted and modern,
and able to control

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:15.220
its emotions and feelings, to
separate itself from objects

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.900
by contemplation, reasoning,
and interpretation

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.853
and to choose from available beliefs.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.580
For Taylor and for others
who have taken this view,

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.190
it was the civilizing process

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.420
that produced the buffered self

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.730
out of the primitive porous self

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.630
and thereby gave the world the
gift of individual freedom.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.370
Now this familiar story
about the role of discipline

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.820
in the formation of modernity

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.720
is one I'm not very comfortable with

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.630
because it too often ignores
who is disciplined and how

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.910
and fails to pursue all
the effects of discipline

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.243
whether intended or not.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.400
But assuming that this is the story,

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.880
we encounter an intriguing question

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.730
when we consider so-called fundamentalists

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.050
in the contemporary Middle East

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.360
and I would like to put this to you.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.220
Thus, although in Euro
America the discipline self

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.210
or the model or the ideal
of the discipline self

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.300
is said to be the distinctive
figure of modernity

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.890
and its freedom.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:20.910
The presence of discipline
in Muslim life generally

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.070
and Islamic movements in particular,

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.943
is commonly taken as evidence
of precisely its opposite.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.950
The existence of rules of
conduct of dress, comportment,

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:35.760
daily prayers, etc, and the
cultivation of sensibilities,

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.580
the control of emotion
in speech and behavior,

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.720
and reverence towards the sacred voice,

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.833
are seen as constrained and suppression.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:48.230
This is an example of
precisely what arguments

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.600
for toleration warn against if political

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.880
or religious authority imposes norms

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.960
of conduct and doctrine on the individual

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.880
and if this imposition is accepted

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.650
then this must be a case of
sincere but inauthentic belief

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.980
or what one would call

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.980
an ideologically confused consciousness.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.871
Now, I don't want to present
this as a question of bias,

00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:15.680
I want to make a rather
different point here.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.720
And this is that one might pursue

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.270
a more anthropological question

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.410
that instead of approaching such behavior

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:29.290
in terms of belief, and in this
case of inauthentic belief,

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.860
and this is obviously what differentiates

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.280
these people from us.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.690
Instead of doing that, and because belief

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.680
is my quarry as you know here,

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.700
one should inquire into
what the behavior does

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.760
and how the bodily senses
are cultivated to take shape

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.500
in different circumstances
and hence into what politics

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.673
this cultivation makes
possible or difficult.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.560
Now this leads me finally to a study

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.080
by an anthropologist many of you know

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.040
who has tried to formulate his questions

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.343
in his ethnography in just this way,

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:09.370
the Ethical Soundscape
by Charles Hirschkind.

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:13.240
And I described it
earlier as a counterpoint

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.960
to Taylor's book by which I
meant both that it deals with

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.350
a much shorter historical
timespan and a specific location

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.100
and that it's more dense in its account

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.260
of that time and space.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:31.260
Hirschkind is less interested
in histories of ideas

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.780
than in a way of life.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.730
In this sense he's a better
anthropologist than I am.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.900
More precisely his study asks

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.900
how the enormously popular practice

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.280
of listening to sermons
in contemporary Cairo

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.880
shapes religious sensibilities

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.623
and traces some of its
consequences for politics.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.320
Throughout Islamic history
attending the Friday sermon

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.983
has been an important part
of Muslim subject formation.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:03.490
Hirschkind analyzes the
reception of sermons

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:07.320
as an active process one in
which the faithful listener

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.420
cultivates her ability
to attend and to which

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.600
as in listening to a
piece of demanding music,

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.590
belief and meaning are
of little significance,

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.790
just as we don't really
say what's the meaning

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.410
of this piece of music,
that's one of the points

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.710
that he's he's trying
to make about listening.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.580
Listening to sermons in modern Cairo

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.550
is no longer confined to the friday mosque

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.520
and it's no longer a one-off experience.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.830
Taped sermons are heard numerous times

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:43.730
in many urban contexts, political oratory,

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.830
and media entertainment
have affected sermons styles

00:53:47.756 --> 00:53:50.310
and so made new connections

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.520
with the institutions of national life

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.633
as well as with the
transnational Islamic community.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:54:00.040
This movement has grown in
response to the Egyptian state's

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.870
often violent attempt to
suppress the Muslim Brotherhood

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.550
which is very unpopular
in some quarters here

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.330
which constitutes the most serious

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.063
popular opposition to that state.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.560
Hirschkind's account of the movement

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.420
describes how it promotes
an acoustic sensibility

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.670
opposed to the state's
obsession with spatial order

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.700
as well as to the nouveau
riche who have withdrawn

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.020
increasingly into their clean
orderly gated communities

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:34.750
in Cairo as in so many other cities.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.410
Contained in this opposition is a struggle

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.730
for defining the scope and sensibility

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.240
appropriate to real Islam.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.650
What Hirshkind calls a counterpublic

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:49.760
is thus an Islamic space
of moral distancing

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.803
from the hegemonic religious
secular order of the state.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.240
Thus many Islamists regard the
regime of personal discipline

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:03.460
as helping to develop
sensibilities that might moderate

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.091
if not totally negate the seductions

00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:08.713
of a neoliberal consumer culture.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.040
Since Hirschkind did
his field work in Egypt

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.960
an oppositional movement
has emerged in strength

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.960
known as Keffiyeh, enough,
that's the name of that movement.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.970
Keffiyeh overlaps with the counter public

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:31.870
and it brings together a
variety of social elements,

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:36.620
Muslims and Christians,
Islamists and secular liberals,

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.940
men and women, professionals
and labor unionists

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.930
in a coalition against the
authoritarian neoliberal state.

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.980
It's not that there's now a happy union

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.980
of all these elements, but
that an irreducible plurality

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.203
persists as a foundation
of political sensibility.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:01.200
What gathers secular
liberals and Islamists

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.950
and others together despite
a continuing measure

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:10.950
of mutual unease is
precisely not their belief

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.420
but their oppositional
attitude, their common feeling

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.653
that circumstances in Egypt
have become intolerable.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:21.710
They speak of their opposition

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.950
as something they did not choose

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:26.820
but were compelled to adopt.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.900
However, this situation
isn't merely negative

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.850
it also provides a space
of daily interaction

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:37.710
and negotiation whose future nevertheless

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.423
remains entirely unclear.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.590
Discrete and not so discrete intrusions

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:46.090
by among other things American power,

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.360
as well as the contradictory desires,

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.780
feelings, and sensibilities
within individuals

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.700
and between them make
a political teleology

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.093
virtually impossible.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.570
The religiosity involved
in this movement emerges

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:04.570
as a mode of being that
is inwardly unsettled

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.740
yet outwardly civil.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.350
It's never simply a mode of living

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.390
where belief can be chosen

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.310
together with every other
good in the marketplace.

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:18.380
Instead, there's an attempt
to cultivate a sensibility

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.300
attuned to mutual care
among the community.

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:27.250
To what extent this succeeds
or even what its future holds

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:29.047
are of course entirely different questions

00:57:29.047 --> 00:57:30.613
and I won't venture into that.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.950
So perhaps the crucial
point for understanding

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:38.730
the threat of religion in
the contemporary world,

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:40.770
the thought with which I began,

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.500
isn't the secular
tolerance of pure beliefs,

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.280
as is that this is the only
remedy for religious belief

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.220
that generates violence.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:56.220
It's not that conversion to
liberal model of Christianity

00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:00.150
provides the best way of
demonstrating the authenticity

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:03.050
of belief for the modern
religious subject.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.330
The interesting point in
my view I would suggest

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:09.830
is that different kinds
of practice encourage

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.760
and presuppose particular forms

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.150
of what has been called
religious sensibility

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.850
and that this relates
in unpredictable ways

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:23.420
to emerging political
and moral possibilities.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.793
Thank you.

00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:28.717
(audience applauding)

00:58:28.717 --> 00:58:32.384
(upbeat instrumental music)
