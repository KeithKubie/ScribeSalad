00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.980
It's still going!

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.380
Grant:Hey What's up guys welcome back to the Workshop Nate: Today we're gonna be showing you how to make an Easy DIY

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.060
Air vortex Cannon

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480
Grant: That's right Nate's The One Who's prototype this project he's gonna Walk You through Step by Step on how you can Make One of These

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.879
Air Shooting Bazookas on a Budget Nate: This toy is called an Airzooka and It Shoots Rings of Air over 30 Feet

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.249
To make It Work you Just pull back on the handle and release the Handle on the plastic are attached to a bungee Cord Which

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.779
Gives It Force When you fire it as the air is Forced out the front of the cannon the air in the Middle is moving

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.418
Faster Than The Air on the sides Which Makes It form into a ring The faster moving air in the center of The ring has

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.730
Lower pressure and pulls The ring Together to keep it all Together as It travels the purpose of Today's video is to see if we

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.779
can Replicate This air vortex gun using easily available and Low-cost materials

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.360
The materials you Need for this project are pretty simple and you can find them at Your local hardware store and dollar store i've Got

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.019
Some clear plastic tape some Black Duct tape a Nylon screw and nut

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.689
Two Wood Screws three Number 12

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.899
24 by one-inch machine Screws and Matching machine Nuts a Clear Shower Curtain and a Wooden Stake

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.709
So i got this Bucket at the Dollar store if you can Find a Bucket that Doesn't

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
Have a pour Spout Around the lip iF your bucket has a Handle puller cut it off so It won't get in your Way

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.949
We want to cut a circle Out of the bottom of the bucket Leaving a Rim about an inch and a Half Wide

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.209
All the Way Around this bucket happens to have an indentation Just The right size?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.750
Now we've Got a hole cut in our bucket Let's make a Handle for It next

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.070
Line The Wooden stake Up on the bucket and measure how long you want to support for your handle to be

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.559
Once You've Cut the steak to the right size place it back next

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.619
To the bucket and Mark three points Near the top middle and bottom

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.220
Using a drill bit the same size as your machine screws drill Through the wood and the bucket

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.580
Hold The Wooden Stake Against The piece You've already cut and drilled and Measure how long You want it to be as a Handler

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.170
Clamping The Handle line The Support rail Up so that Your Handle is approximately in the Middle of the first two Holes that You drilled

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.440
Drill Two Pilot Holes Through The Support rail into the Handle

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.809
It's a Good idea to sand your Handle down to make It more comfortable to hold on to and Once You've Got that Finished it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.060
time to find a soda Bottle you can use any size of soda bottle that you have lying Around Because We Really only Need the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.560
Top two Inches using a knife or a Pair of Scissors cut the top off of your soda bar

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.039
We're using a blowtorch to heat Up a small nail. if you don't have a Blowtorch

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.860
Available You can Also Use a lighter or the flame from your stove

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.519
While the Head of the nail is hot melt a small hole near the neck of the bottle

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.820
Keep The nail Head back Up and do the same Thing on the other side?

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.169
By Melting The hole Rather Than Drilling It you Get Added strength from The melted plastic

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.369
Now Let's Mark Two Points on opposite sides of the bucket Almost at the bottom

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.709
Heat Up the nail again and melt Holes in the bucket where we've Marked It the same Way we did with the soda bottle

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.619
With the bucket and the Handle prepped we can Move on to making a Plastic diaphragm to force air out of the cannon on demand

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.950
I'm using a medium weight Shower liner Because it's a Cheap and durable form of plastic That also lets You see through your air bazooka

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.549
As you're Shooting at Your target a

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.328
Cheap Alternative to the Shower Liner is the Mylar cooler Bags That you can often pick up at the dollar store They aren't

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.579
Transparent But They are tough and low-cost

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.409
Spreader Sheet of plastic Out on a flat surface so that With the bucket in the Middle you have at least a Foot of Clearance?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.369
On each Side take Your soda bottle and put It about where the Middle of the bucket Was

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.579
With a Marker Mark Where your soda bottle is on the sheet of plastic

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.929
Remove The cap from your soda bottle top and place The rest of the bottle underneath The sheet of plastic

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.030
Lined Up with the circle you Just Marked

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.450
Push the cap down over the plastic Until it can Screw into place on the soda bottle Beneath you can see that the soda bottle

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.230
Top is now Attached to the plastic

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.170
To make It Easier to work with do a Rough cut of the plastic leaving That one-Foot border Around the bucket

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.608
With Your bucket Right side Up place the soda top and the plastic on top of the bucket with the cap pointing up

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.319
And press the soda top and plastic down into the bucket Until They are about Halfway to the bottom making sure that your soda bottle

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.989
Is centered Within Your bucket Mark on the plastic one point where it meets The edge of the bucket measure the distance from where the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.809
Soda Bottle is attached to the lines that you have Marked on the plastic?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.709
Measuring That Same distance Make Additional Marks All The Way Around the plastic in a circle

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.559
Connect The dotted Lines to get One continuous circle

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.430
If your circle isn't Perfect it Shouldn't be a problem so if your lines Look crooked Here there don't be too concerned about it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.750
The Next step we're gonna do is cover the Whole circle that we've Just Drawn in a Layer of Packaging Tape

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.059
To start off Place One piece of tape right across the center of the circle be sure that the piece You tear off is long

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.100
Enough That The Edges Reach Just Beyond the circle line Up your next piece of tape with the first four that The edges are Just

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.310
Barely Touching

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.660
continue adding strips Until Your Whole circle is covered with a single Layer of Tape

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.460
The Packaging tape is Very strong and It Doesn't stretch so it's a Good reinforcement for your Sheet of plastic

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.660
Once you have a Layer tape covering the Whole circle you want to cut Around the line that you've Drawn?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.540
Now that we Have Attached our tape and cut our circle we're going. To reattach the soda bottle Where it was before

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.109
Now we Just Need to make This Handle a bit easier to grab on to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.940
We're going to be using a Nylon nut and bolt. To attach our Handle metal hardware Would Work

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.969
Too but these don't weigh as much iF your local hardware store Doesn't Carry

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.870
Nylon nuts and Bolts Try checking for Toilet Seat hinge hardware Will also Need a bungee Cord i got These bungee Cords in a pack

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.669
of eight at home Depot For about six bucks cut the bungee Cord to remove the plastic Ball

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.640
Using a drill bit the same size as your Nylon bolt drill a Hole in your soda cap and plastic You'll want the plastic Ball

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.460
From Your bungee Cord to fit over the Nylon bolt if the hole is

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.759
Too small use the same drill that They used on the soda cap to Widen it

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.540
Thread The Nylon bolt Through The plastic Ball and Then Through The hole in the soda cap

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.739
From The Inside of The bottle top Thread the Nylon nut onto the bolt it Doesn't

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.590
Have to be threaded down all the Way but enough That it's not going to let go

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.620
Alright Guys quick update we Have assembled all the different Pieces That we're going to need for our air vortex cannon But first we're going

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.229
to take some Spray paint and decorate it King of Random style

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.070
Alright Guys we've Got everything Painted and Ready Let's assemble it into an air vortex Cannon

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.529
Once We Have Our Bottle top centered Inside the bucket Let's take a piece of Black Duct tape and Attach The edge of our plastic

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.920
Sheet to the edge of the bucket

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.110
After We Tape Down the first Edge The second part that We Tape Should Be Directly across from it

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.810
Once you Have Your first two sides Attached the next two you want

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.360
To do are going to be at a 90 degree angle from those two

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.250
In between the four corners That You taped you're going to want. To do a sort of accordion fold

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.679
To get the plastic to lay Flat Against the bucket

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.929
Go ahead and tape Over any gaps so that The Whole Edge of the plastic is secured to the bucket

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.730
All right we've Got our plastic attach That Moves Backward and Forward Now all We Have to do is Attach Our Handle and make it

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.520
Spring-Loaded

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.270
Drag Your bungee Cord Into one of the Holes in the side of the bucket

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.170
Through Both of the Holes in the soda bottle top and then Out through The other bucket hole

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.950
Now i want to mark the bungee Cord Where it's leaving the bucket but Because my cord is black i can't draw on it very well

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.979
It with a Marker so i'm Just using a small piece of Masking tape to mark it

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.510
By Marking The bungee Cord of tape we Know where to tie the knot to keep the bungee cord in the right Place

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.459
Stretch Your bungee Cord Out and tie an overhand Knot That Overlaps with Where you Just Marked it with tape

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.179
Place the Handle and Support rail Along The bucket where it was when you drill the holes

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.410
on the inside of the bucket Attach the three nuts and then use a screw Driver to tighten everything down

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.200
Remove The Excess bungee Cord And You're ready to go

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.819
Alright Guys There you go your air vortex cannon is Now ready to use

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.609
Let'S figure Out some cool things that you can do with your new toy

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.859
That was great. One of The Things that i want to try is make it so you can Actually See the vortex of air as It leaves

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.410
The gun

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.519
Here i've Got a cup of Warm Water and some Dry Ice i'm gonna

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.149
Drop The Dry Ice in and try and Suck Up some of the cloud and shoot it Out as a Ring

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:46.559
The Dry Ice Doesn't make a Ring as Well as i was hoping it would the Water vapor That Makes Up the Cloud Warms up

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.229
So quickly that It dissipates and you can't really See where the ring Goes

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.919
Don't Worry Guys i have an idea for how we can Make a Ring That Will last a lot Longer?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.349
Not long Ago We Showed you how to make some coloured smoke powder and i'm gonna light some off and see if i can Get

00:08:58.349 --> 00:09:00.340
a colored Smoke Ring to travel a long distance

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.780
Oh That's Great.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Ooh Nailed it!

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.100
It's still going it's still visible

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.080
There you Go some cool things you can do with your air vortex cannon Shooting Over targets

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.609
Launching coloured Rings Up to 30 feet or maybe Just messing with Your Friends family and pets

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.900
One of The Things i thought of While i was playing with this is how much fun It might be if we Built a giant

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.759
Scaled Up version of This or if we Had a small pocket version look for those in an upcoming video

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.379
If you want to buy one That's already assembled for you click the link in the description and you can Get One online

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.840
