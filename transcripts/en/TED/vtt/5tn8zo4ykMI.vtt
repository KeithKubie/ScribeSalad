00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:14.920
A few weeks ago,

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:19.659
somebody tweeted during the midterm
elections in the United States

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.602
that Election Day
should be made a holiday.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.178
And I retweeted, saying,

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:26.798
"Well, you're welcome to come
to my country and vote.

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:30.160
You'll get the whole week off
to allow the military to count it."

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:32.211
I come from Togo, by the way.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.507
It is a beautiful country
located in West Africa.

00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:39.063
There are some cool,
interesting facts about my country.

00:00:39.446 --> 00:00:42.610
Togo has been ruled
by the same family for 51 years,

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:46.125
making us the oldest autocracy in Africa.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.323
That's a record.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.941
We have a second-coolest record:

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.170
we have been ranked three times
as the unhappiest country on earth.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:54.691
You are all invited.

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.462
(Laughter)

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:57.871
So just to let you know,

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:01.259
it's not very cool
to live under an autocracy.

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:05.279
But the interesting thing is that I have
met, throughout the course of my activism,

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:07.246
so many people from different countries,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.048
and when I tell them about Togo,
their reaction is always,

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:14.095
"How can you guys allow the same people
to terrorize you for 51 years?

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.905
You know, like, you Togolese,
you must be very patient."

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.580
That's their diplomatic way
of saying "stupid."

00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:21.238
(Laughter)

00:01:21.262 --> 00:01:24.453
And when you live in a free country,

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:27.876
there's this tendency of assuming
that those who are oppressed

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.989
tolerate their oppression
or are comfortable with it,

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:35.557
and democracy is projected
as a progressive form of governance

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.861
in such a way that those people
who don't live under democratic countries

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:44.036
are seen as people who are not
intellectually or maybe morally

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.712
as advanced as others.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.731
But it's not the case.

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.890
The reason why people have that perception

00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:53.936
has to do with the way stories
are covered about dictatorships.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.352
In the course of my activism,

00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:59.778
I have had to interview
with so many news outlets out there,

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:02.814
and usually it would always start with,
"What got you started?

00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:04.766
What inspired you?"

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.073
And I reply, "I wasn't inspired.
I was triggered."

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.682
And it goes on.
"Well, what triggered you?"

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:16.379
And I go on about how my father
was arrested when I was 13, and tortured,

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.096
all the history ... I don't want
to get into details now,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.604
because you'll start sleeping.

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:24.072
But the thing is, at the end of the day,
what interests them the most is:

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:25.266
How was he tortured?

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.793
For how many days? How many people died?

00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.434
They are interested
in the abuse, in the killing,

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:36.572
because they believe that
will gain attention and sympathy.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:39.928
But in reality, it serves
the purpose of the dictator.

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:43.056
It helps them advertise their cruelty.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.864
In 2011, I cofounded a movement
I call "Faure Must Go,"

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:50.408
because Faure is
the first name of our president.

00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:52.624
Togo is a French-speaking
country, by the way,

00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:56.097
but I chose English because
I had my issues with France as well.

00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:57.401
But then --

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.017
(Laughter)

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.031
But then, when I started Faure Must Go,

00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:05.271
I made a video, and I came on camera,

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:09.176
and I said, "Well, Faure GnassingbÃ©,
I give you 60 days to resign as president,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.479
because if you don't,

00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:13.546
we the youth in Togo will organize
and we will bring you down,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.918
because you have killed
over 500 of our countrymen

00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:18.742
to seize power when your father died.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.031
We have not chosen you.

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:22.508
You are an imposter,
and we will remove you."

00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:24.783
But I was the only known face
of the movement.

00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.103
Why? Because I was the only stupid one.

00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:28.775
(Laughter)

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.455
And the backlashes followed.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.674
My family started receiving threats.

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:36.174
My siblings called me one morning.

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:37.494
They said, "You know what?

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:40.506
When they come here to kill you,
we don't want to die with you,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.699
so move out."

00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:43.623
So yes, I moved out.

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:47.212
And I'm so angry at them,
so I haven't talked to them in five years.

00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:50.109
Anyway, moving forward ...

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:56.263
For the past nine years,
I have been working with countries

00:03:56.287 --> 00:03:58.658
to raise awareness of Togo,

00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:00.847
to help the people of Togo
overcome their fear

00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:03.928
so they, too, can come and say
they want change.

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:07.735
I have received a lot of persecution

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.235
that I cannot disclose,

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.486
a lot of threats, a lot of abuse,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.996
psychologically.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.836
But I don't like talking about them,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.791
because I know that my job
as an activist is to mobilize,

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:20.069
is to organize,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:25.495
is to help every single Togolese citizen
understand that, as citizens,

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.709
we hold the power,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.482
we are the boss and we decide.

00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:33.294
And the punishment that the dictators
are using to intimidate them

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:36.582
must not prevent us
from getting what we want.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:43.069
That is why I said it is very important
to cover the stories of activists

00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:45.528
in the way that it helps mobilize people,

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:48.726
not in the way that it helps
deter their action

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.637
and force even more their subjugation
to the oppressive system.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:56.979
During these years
that I've been an activist,

00:04:57.003 --> 00:05:00.250
there are days that I felt like quitting
because I couldn't take it.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:01.894
Well then, what kept me going?

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:03.952
The one thing that kept me going:

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.848
I remember the story of my grandfather,

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:11.439
and how he used to walk
465 miles from his village to the city,

00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:13.481
just to protest for independence.

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.813
Then I remember
the sacrifice of my father,

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:17.972
who was tortured so many times

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:21.692
for daring to protest against the regime.

00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:24.247
Back in the '70s,
they would write pamphlets

00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:27.068
to raise awareness on the dictatorship,

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.648
and because they couldn't
afford to make copies,

00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:33.424
they would reproduce
the same pamphlet 500 times each

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:34.918
and distribute them.

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:37.835
It got to a point where the military
knew their handwriting,

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.795
so as soon as they stumbled upon one,
they'd go and get them.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.958
But I look at that and I'm like,
you know, today you have a blog.

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:48.035
I don't have to copy
the same thing 500 times.

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.728
I blog and thousands of people read it.

00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:53.664
By the way, in Togo, they like
calling me the WhatsApp girl,

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:56.439
because I am always on WhatsApp
attacking the government.

00:05:56.463 --> 00:05:57.613
(Laughter)

00:05:57.637 --> 00:05:58.813
So it's much easier.

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:02.028
When I'm angry at the government,
I just make an angry note,

00:06:02.052 --> 00:06:05.060
and I send it out
and thousands of people share it.

00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:08.583
I'm rarely this composed.
I'm always angry, by the way.

00:06:08.607 --> 00:06:11.653
(Laughter)

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:16.049
(Applause)

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:24.786
So I was talking about the necessity
to showcase our stories,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.984
because when I think about
the sacrifices that were made for us,

00:06:28.008 --> 00:06:29.655
it helped me keep going.

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.500
One of the very first actions
of our Faure Must Go movement

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:35.911
was to come up with a petition,
asking citizens to sign

00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:40.041
so that we can demand new elections,
as the constitution allows.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.885
People were scared to put their names

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.495
because, they said,
they don't want to get in trouble.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.525
Even in the diaspora, people were scared.

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:48.541
They were like, "We have family at home."

00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:50.955
But there was this woman
who was in her 60s.

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.637
When she heard about it,
she took the petition,

00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:56.526
and she went home,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.140
and by herself she collected
over 1,000 [signatures].

00:07:00.164 --> 00:07:02.738
That inspired me so much, and I was like,

00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:07.225
if a 60-year-old that has
nothing more to gain in this regime

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:09.070
can do this for us, the young ones,

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:10.662
then why should I quit?

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:14.710
It is the stories of resistance,
the stories of defiance,

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.795
the stories of resilience,

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:18.919
that inspire people to get involved,

00:07:18.943 --> 00:07:22.432
not the stories of abuse
and killings and hurt,

00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:25.808
because as humans, it's only natural
for us to be scared.

00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:29.803
I would like to share with you
a few characteristics of dictatorships

00:07:29.827 --> 00:07:32.461
so that you can assess your own country

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.537
and see if you are also
at risk of joining us.

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:37.899
(Laughter and cheers)

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:42.677
(Applause)

00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:45.667
Number one thing to look at:
concentration of power.

00:07:45.691 --> 00:07:49.168
Is the power in your country concentrated
in the hands of a few, an elite?

00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:51.824
It can be a political elite,
ideological elite.

00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:53.410
And you have a strongman,

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:57.027
because we always have one guy
who is presented as the messiah

00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.013
who will save us from the world.

00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:01.514
The second point is propaganda.

00:08:01.538 --> 00:08:03.651
Dictators feed on propaganda.

00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:06.419
They like giving the impression
that they are the saviors,

00:08:06.443 --> 00:08:08.622
and without them,
the country will fall apart.

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:11.801
And they are always fighting
some foreign forces, you know?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.952
The Christians, the Jewish, the Muslims,

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:16.209
the voodoo priests are coming for you.

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:18.860
The Communists, when they get here,
we'll all be broke.

00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:20.069
These kinds of things.

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:23.296
And our president, in particular,
he fights pirates.

00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:24.911
(Laughter)

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:26.108
I am very serious.

00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:29.945
Last year, he bought a boat that's
13 million dollars to fight pirates,

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:32.389
and 60 percent of our people are starving.

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:35.174
So they are always protecting us
from some foreign forces.

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:37.965
And this leads to point three:
militarization.

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:40.929
Dictators survive by instigating fear,

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.833
and they use the military
to suppress dissident voices,

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.891
even though they try
to give the impression

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:47.946
that the military
is to protect the nation.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.374
And they suppress institutions
and destroy them

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:53.068
so that they don't have to be
held accountable.

00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:55.867
So do you have a heavily
militarized country?

00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.424
And this leads to point four,
what I call human cruelty.

00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:01.479
You know when we talk about animals,

00:09:01.503 --> 00:09:04.144
we say animal cruelty
when animals are abused,

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:07.150
because there's no charter
acknowledged by the UN

00:09:07.174 --> 00:09:09.504
saying animal rights charter.

00:09:09.989 --> 00:09:13.313
Point one: all animals are created equal.
So you don't have that.

00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:16.446
So whenever animals are abused,
we say animal cruelty.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.891
But when it comes to humans,
we say human rights abuses,

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:22.381
because we assume
that all humans have rights.

00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:26.022
But some of us are actually still fighting
for our right to have rights.

00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:30.320
So in that condition, I don't talk about
human rights abuse or violation.

00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:33.568
When you live in a country
and you have an issue with the president

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:37.006
and the worst thing that can happen
is he bans you from the presidency,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.181
you are lucky.

00:09:38.205 --> 00:09:41.276
When you come to my country
and have an issue with the president,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.838
you just run, disappear;
you vanish from the universe,

00:09:43.862 --> 00:09:45.910
because they can still find you in Turkey.

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:48.789
So people like myself,
we don't get to live in Togo anymore.

00:09:48.813 --> 00:09:49.969
And people like myself,

00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:52.899
we don't get to live in the same place
for more than a month,

00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:54.608
because we don't want to be traced.

00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:55.910
The way they abuse people,

00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:59.830
the type of cruelty that happens
in all impunity under dictatorships

00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:02.452
are beyond human imagination.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.103
The stories of some
of the activists that were killed,

00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:07.552
their bodies dumped in the sea,

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:09.014
that were tortured

00:10:09.038 --> 00:10:12.313
to the point where they lost
their hearing or their sight --

00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:13.885
those stories still haunt me.

00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:15.913
And sometimes, as an activist,

00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:19.005
I am less concerned about dying
than how it will happen.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:21.687
Sometimes I just sit down
and I imagine all scenarios.

00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:24.709
What are they going to do?
Are they going to cut my ears first?

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:28.115
Or are they going to cut my tongue
because I'm always insulting them?

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.170
It sounds cruel, but it is the reality.

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:32.618
We live in a very cruel world.

00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:35.349
Dictators are cruel monsters,

00:10:35.373 --> 00:10:37.971
and I am not saying it to be nice.

00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:42.477
So yes, that is the final characteristic.

00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:43.806
The list goes on,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.002
but that's the final thing that I want
to share about autocracies,

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.160
so that you look at your country
and see if there are risks there.

00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:54.100
It is important that you acknowledge
the gains of freedom that you have today,

00:10:54.124 --> 00:10:57.120
because some people had
to give their lives for you to have it.

00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:59.005
So don't take this for granted.

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:01.844
But then at the same time,
you also need to know

00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:05.755
that no country is actually
destined to be oppressed,

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:07.157
while at the same time,

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:11.801
no country or no people are immune
to oppression and dictatorship.

00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:13.038
Thank you.

00:11:13.062 --> 00:11:17.489
(Applause)
