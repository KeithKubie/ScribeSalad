Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Bikes with them.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       All right? People were alive on the Youtube and I've got the sage of the alt right without the rain, without the rage. Payroll Age, without the rate of the Ri. Ben Shapiro, welcome back as gun. All right, we've got a lot of things to talk about. I want to cover a ton of new ground. I read your book over the weekend. You have a new Prager u video going up. You're still doing this daily wire thing and a thousand other things. So we got a lot to do here, but let, let's just start with this. All right, nonsense. Um, I hate that we even have to talk about it. It's so freaking stupid, but this happens to be the world that we live in at the moment. So about two weeks ago or about 10 days ago or so, uh, the economists did an interview with you. Uh, I assume that was by the phone probably originally. Yeah. So you did a phone interview with them and they, they're really nice. The interview, by the way, I get a yes, you read the transcript. It's perfectly nice. A little bit adversarial, but that's good. That's fine. They usually are Shapiro. That's how it works. Right? Like the interviews themselves and the thoughts usually stand on their own. Anyway. They, they published this interview and what was the title?

Speaker 3:          00:01:15       It was called the [inaudible] Shapiro. The outright sage without the rage, which is wrong. Then at least a couple of scores.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       Any half the media tries to portray you as if you've got this evil rage within you all the time. But I thought that was funny on it, which is weird cause you met me and him. I'm fairly calm. This is really all the time. This is about as rage as it gets right here. Yeah. So, okay, let's put aside the rage part. The Ot right. Parked and just what the media is constantly doing. So, okay. So after you publicly then shame them forward and everybody jumped on board to, to defend you. Um, and you know, all these things got thousands and thousands of retweets. Eventually they did a printer retraction. They apologized. They apologized and they, you know, they appreciate [inaudible] where basically they just said, oh, he's not part of the alt right, and it's like, well, what just happened here? Right. You guys just said he's the sage of the, all right.

Speaker 3:          00:02:04       There's this thing called the Google machine. Yeah. If they had just typed in my name with all right, they would have seen probably the first result is a piece I wrote for The Washington Post in 2015 talking about how evil the alt right as if they, I mean it was a review of the book. I mean in the book which you have read, I referenced the alt right I think three or four separate times and talk about how terrible their ideas are and how evil their ideology is. No white supremacy is gross.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       The whole point of the book is that you're trying to show people the clean way to think there was sort of right way to think so that you don't fall prey correct to those things.

Speaker 3:          00:02:32       Then Western civilization is not built on race. Western civilization is built on certain immutable principles. That's the basis of the book. It's the basis of conservatism to a more classical liberalism. I mean all of this is built on the same idea, which is that this stuff is not relegated to race. Like I'm a Jew. Okay. The Jews weren't part of that original white people bargain. If there was a white people bargain and you're Jewish too. I mean like come on. I mean this is all, it's all bullshit but it's it. But, and I've done open battle with the alt right for legitimately years. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       I always cite the statutes because it's a useful step, but it's true. I mean I was attacking more than than any other Jewish journalists on the line in 2016 the vast majority of that crap was from the alt right. The alt right still hates my guts. I have to have significant security around me nearly all times because of the number of threats we get from people on the alt right. And I'm being called out right by the economist, which is supposed to be a center right. Magazine in Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       Is that, that I think is the question. It's like everyone gets it. This is what the media does. They don't mind. They lie, they label, they smear, all of those things. Everyone understands that. But what is it? The economist is basically a respectable as you can center right magazine this, these are people who you would think ideologically basically line up with you. So what do you think is truly going on there? Is it purely just the quest for clicks put Shapiro's picture? I put, all right, all hell is going to bring it up.

Speaker 4:          00:03:45       I'm wondering, so what is it I tend to hold by, you know, the Hanlon's razor idea that it's mostly ignorance and not malice and I think for some of these people it is ignorance. I think that for the economist then they apologized within a couple of hours. I think it legitimately was, there was somebody writing and headline who doesn't know what the alt right is. They don't know the difference between the outright and conservatism in the United States and in Europe. The alt right is a lot closer to European right wing populism. Then the alright is to American conservatism and a lot of ways, and so I think they just figure anybody who's anti-left is all right. I mean they've labeled Jordan outright, they've labeled you outright right now, like not the economist, but a lot of people in the media will do this routine. They'll, they'll say that the IDW generally is all right.

Speaker 4:          00:04:26       I believe I'm the only registered Republican as far as I'm aware in the, in the IDW, it's absurd. People that voted for Bernie. Yeah, exactly. The more people who voted for Bernie than voted for Trump among members of the IDW, I think that's fair to say. Correct. I'm pretty sure that's true, right? I mean, I think Brett voted for Bernie. I think that Eric voted for Bernie. Uh, I know that, uh, Sam voted for Hillary like that. There are many more members of the political life voted for Gary Johnson. Right. You voted for Gary Johnson Ford. I didn't vote. I didn't vote at all in the 2016 election at the top of the ticket. So I'm not sure if there was one person who voted for Trump in the IDW, but we become outright because if you're a heterodox thinker or if you're somebody who asks questions and then comes up with with answers that specifically are designed to reject the outright, then you are suddenly a member of the outright just by taking the questions seriously.

Speaker 4:          00:05:09       And this is part of that's really dangerous, right? You see this with Steven Pinker, I think this is the best example that I saw. You remember Steven pinker gave the speech a few years back where he said, you know, the problem with the rise of the alt right is that there are a bunch of people on the left are rejecting the question and then they refused to give an answer to the question. And so people go looking for the answer and the only answer they get is the worst answer. He wasn't defending the Ansi rats the point, the whole point of his speech was no. We need to give the correct answers that people don't fall prey to the stupid crap that's being said about race and Iq, for example. But we can't ignore the questions about race and Iq because otherwise people are still going to look for the answers to these questions.

Speaker 4:          00:05:42       And what he's saying is effectively the same thing that people in the religious community are constantly saying about, you know, you see people who go to Sunday school and then it's like, well, I asked all my questions and the rabbi or the pastor or the priest, they all said, you know, you're not allowed to ask those questions. And so I left the religion. That's what pinker is saying about logic and reason in western civilized ideas that people came in and they ask these questions and instead of the questions being answered, people like, you're not allowed to ask that question. It's a very bad question. And you saw vodkas did this too to Sam Harris, right? When Sam was talking about race and Iq. And when people say that, when people ask about whether Islam has a problem with violence right then, then this is considered an outright perspective.

Speaker 4:          00:06:21       And so they'll band Jordan's book in Christ church from, from with Kohl's briefly based on the idea that Jordan has suggested that Islamophobia is an overused term and is misapplied. Right. That that's, that's also took that picture with the guy in the shirt, the human with the human, and you've done many of these and I've been on tour with Jordan. He said he's been taking pictures with about 30,000 people that, yeah, I would imagine that's a low estimate. Probably been there where he's had lines of hundreds of people course after giving a two hour lecture after doing 10 interviews during the day, after flying into the city that morning. The idea that he's investigating what everyone's wearing or that anyone is paying any attention to that, the, I forget what you think about what it would sell it unless, unless the shirt legitimately as a giant swastika or giant hammer sickle or something like people are milled through every 10 seconds.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       I mean those generally come up, they take the picture, they shake your hand, they leave. I mean, you guys have done tens of thousands of pictures. I've done tens of thousands. I don't remember any of the pictures that I took. I mean legitimately I remember the idea was that he took a picture with this guy. Now we're going to, right now we're going to ban his book because then the Cambridge thing, which is even worse, right? That that that was even worse, but I mean even in the New Zealand thing where the, the notion that you are going to be able to crack down on white supremacy by banning speech generally is so dangerous. And listen, if white supremacy will crack down on, I'd be one of the chief beneficiaries of the crackdowns since, I mean they hate me. Right. We'll set it. I sat on rogue and I'm not going to do it again.

Speaker 4:          00:07:44       I'm being really careful about my f word. Use it. We have one of the, I mean as you know, because we're friends, one of the bizarre things is how little I on camera and how much I crossed off camera. That's a lot of f bombs off a lot of f bombs off camera. But good morning then go fucking mornings and erect. Exactly. But it's, but that mean New Zealand legitimately is now going to prosecute people who downloaded the manifesto for the white supremacist. And I thought to myself, well, I downloaded it because I wanted to read what was in there so that I knew how to rebut it. I mean, the solution to this stuff is not to crack down on speech. It was really scary. All right, so there's so much I want to do here. So just let's go with that for a second.

Speaker 4:          00:08:18       So in a case of what happened in Christ church, do you think actually that reading it does add value? Because I get, you want to understand it a little bit, at least the people that are talking about, right, but in another way, it doesn't adjust, incentivize other people to do crazy things because that it's like, Holy Shit, Ben Shapiro, all these, all these Internet people, they're going to read what I said, even if it's complete insanity. And this thing had conflicting, I openly said, don't mention the guy's name. Don't, don't repeat his, his ideas don't guys never publicly, we don't publish names of shooters. We won't do it. I, and I even instructed our people like only report on the manifesto to the extent necessary to knock down myths about the manifesto. And that was the big problem. The reason that I downloaded it was not because I originally wanted to read what the guy said because you don't want to give that credence.

Speaker 4:          00:09:01       It's because the media started immediately misreporting what the guy had said and effectively doing exactly what he told them to do, which is report on everything that I say. So to so as to divide people and then the division itself will create more polarization in society, which is what I want. I mean he says this in the manifesto and, and the, and the media were like, yeah, let's, let's do that thing, which is, you know, it's interesting which manifestos they choose to report on and which ones become irrelevant nearly as soon as they are released. I mean other show really and how they decide what is relevant. But I will say regardless of what, like I don't think it should be distributed. I don't think people should read it. But if you do pick it up and read it, I don't think that you should be arrested for that.

Speaker 4:          00:09:42       I mean, criminalizing people who downloaded a file seems to me really, really dangerous stuff because you can link virtually anything. I mean they, again, they tried to ban the bestselling book on planet Earth from the biggest bookseller in New Zealand because Jordan was in a picture with a human like, I don't trust, I don't trust anybody to regulate speech that way. Or were they looking to arrest people that shared the video also? Yeah, they're doing that too. And now they're saying they want to hold members of social media hierarchies personally responsible for distribution of bad material. This is one of the things that are pushing in in the UK is that they're trying to regulate social media to the extent that they could haul Zuckerberg in the court. And Jaylen, if certain controversial material is distributed via via Facebook. I mean this is not, it's UNAMERICAN is the easy way to say it, but it's not on European I guess.

Speaker 4:          00:10:29       Do you think that's why he's Zuckerberg? Just in the last week has sort of been hinting off like regulate me please. They actually want regulation now. Well, yeah, I think that what's happening for Zuckerberg will get them off the hook. Right, exactly. It's a couple of things. One is the, he's hoping for regulation from the United States government because he knows he's going to get regulated from the Europeans. And what he is afraid of is being stuck in this catch 22 where the Europeans regulate him on speech. And then for business reasons, he starts using those regulations as the basis for policing stuff in the United States. And then people in the United States say, well, you're policing and policing is not even, and so you're actually an editorial outlet now and you should be treated like an editorial outlet as opposed to like arguments for that or I think they should be, they should do it for, for a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       I think they should be treated like an editorial outlet if they're going to act like an editorial outlet. Um, but he, he stuck sort of between a rock and a hard place. Whenever you see a business that is calling for additional regulation on itself, you can fairly guarantee that this is a corporatist attempt to crowd other people out of the market and to avoid responsibility. And it seems to me that that's mainly what's happening here. All right, so let's back up for a second. So after the Christchurch attack, blue check, Twitter went completely bananas on you. On me, on several other people, Sam Jordan, everybody. Well, it's fun on Sam. Um, none of us have ever called for violence obviously. Of course, single one of us have no problem condemning this. Want these things to be stopped or I can see the glossed over and look in your eyes as I'm saying it, it's, it's, it's securing and

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       boring to have to say it. Um, what do you think our responsibility or our, our duty to respond to some of this is? Because it seems to me it's getting haywire, the people that when someone, when 50 people are killed in a horrific attack halfway across the world, when that happens, and then blue check journalists directly blame you. Let's say, let's just keep this on you for a second. It seems to me they're putting more of a price tag on your head or a more of a direct threat on your head. Then anything that you have ever said.

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       I mean, I think that's true. I think there's not much I can do about it. I mean it there, there's certain material that obviously is libelous and theoretically you could take legal action, but I'm a public figure. That means I'm going to take plenty of slings and arrows and that's fine. I mean, that's, that's part of the debate. I'm the one advocating that we should be able to speak about this stuff as much as you want to. It's one thing for the economist to label me a label that is clearly not true. It's another thing for people to draw the attenuated sort of connection between. I've criticized Islams violent tendencies across the world without saying that every Muslim is violent or, and certainly not saying that any Muslims should be treated with violence. I mean, I've never sent any of that stuff. But if you want

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       Jewish theologians and Catholic theologians, Christian theologians have been arguing about what's in the Bible and what it all means. And all of those things specifically be insane.

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       I specifically say, and I've been saying this for as long as I can remember, I do not analyze the Quran. I do not analyze the religion of Islam because you can go through the religious tax of virtually any religion, including my own, and find stuff that is deeply uncomfortable and ugly. And that's why I believe in a reinterpreted structure. I mean, I talk about that in the book and we'll get to that, I'm sure, but it's, but the, but the fact is that the balance between reason and revelation is very key to my thinking. And so I don't look at the Quran and go looking for versus to take the, I'm not an Islamic scholar. There are many people who are there, they're moderate and reform Muslims. So I've had routinely on my radio show to try and talk about the reinterpretation of Islam. They're much better situated to do that than I am.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       All I can do is point out that by polling data, there are a lot of Muslims across the world who believes some really radical things that if any Christian believed them, the media would immediately say, this person is a radical Christian by any definition. So I point that out and suddenly it's, I'm saying that what now I'm just, I'm calling for violence against people quite don't know. So who do I don't, I don't know what they, not only, I don't know what they think, but they're allowed to think whatever the hell they want. You can think what you want without being subjected to violence. I don't know how they act. I don't know any of that stuff. I mean, it's its absurdity on its face, and yet the attempt is of course, to be, I mean, you and you saw the media do this, they immediately shifted from what happened in Christchurch is the result of people who are critical, particularly of Ilhan.

Speaker 4:          00:14:27       Omar, you actually saw this, right? There's this move to say, well, if you call Ilhan Omar an antisemite, then you're contributing to just the kind of Islamophobia that lead's what happened in Christ. It's like, wait, hold on a second. I defended Ilhan Omar being able to wear he job on the, on the house floor. I think that's a good thing. I wear a funny hat all day long, right? Like that's fine with me. I don't care. I think that's good. I W I came out originally against Trump's originally formulated Muslim ban when he was like, yeah, no Muslims coming in. I said, this is, this is counterproductive and, and it's intolerant, right? I said all of those things because those are true, and then it was, but if you critique the fact that Ohana is clearly antisemitic, then you are leading like this is an attempt to curve out a to it to carve out speech, right? It's an attempt to say you're not allowed to criticize x because we don't like you criticizing acts, and if we can blame this thing over here on you, then that allows us to silence you on this particular issue.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       So what tactic may be or some of us missing to clean some of this up because I agree that basically what's happening here is there, there is these people have been incentivized for anytime anything bad happens, you blame a few people that have some influence. So let's say you blame Peterson and you and a couple of other people because it's like, oh, you guys are helping wake up people to their own thoughts and to how to live their own lives by their own volition and, and all the things that are in this book. So there is every reason to attack you because this is what

Speaker 4:          00:15:41       slept. And it's also, and it's also an easy game because the fact is whoever has been very productive in the public sphere, I'm sure has said things that they don't like. Yeah, I mean, I like this. I keep referring to it because it's true. I have a running list of crap that I've said over the past. I've been doing this since I was 17 years old and now 35 so more than half of my life, I have been doing this. I've written legitimately millions of voters, can't remember everything I wrote. I've written a column a week since I was 17 years old. Right? I've written legitimately thousands of columns at this point and I was writing like eight pieces a day when I was at Breitbart and I was writing for pieces a day for daily wire for years on end. I don't remember everything. I remember I had 140,000 tweets.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       I remember everything that I've tweeted. So if somebody points something out to me, I'm like, yeah, that was bad. Then I'm just, I'm happy to say, yeah, that was bad. [inaudible] you wrote a piece for daily wire, the rest here basic and I update it, I do update it will remind me and they'll be like, yeah, this is a bad too. I'm like, you're right. That was a bad tweet. I did it back in 2008 and it was a dumb thing to do and I'm sorry that that happened. It's like, I don't remember all that stuff, but uh, but it's, it's really a bad faith attempt to take down people who are not like, this is what Tucker Carlson rightly pointed out when people were coming after him. This was not an attempt to make the public space battery. It was not an attempt to wipe out bad speech that was happening in the here and now because we don't have a time machine, right?

Speaker 4:          00:16:47       We can call up stuff from 15 years ago like they're digging up interviews from John Wayne has been dead for 40 years. It's like, well I don't know what you want from John Wayne. Dude's dead right? We can't take up a skeleton and asking for an apology. If I say something now that you don't like, then we can have a debate over that thing. But if you are digging up something I said 15 years ago, all I can do is either say I disagree with me from back then or I agree with, and then we can have a discussion about what I think now. But I can't, like I don't have a time machine. So this is all bad faith, uh, and it's, and it's really pretty hideous. It's one thing to dig up something somebody has said in the past and then say this fits in with their generalized worldview, right.

Speaker 4:          00:17:21       But to take something out of context and then say, ignore all contrary evidence and then just say, well, this is the world view because I want this to be the worldview so I can suggest that they're outside the Overton window and we don't have to deal with them anymore. That's, that's how glean that's, that's what's happening. I mean, even though there's this video that was going around and it got a bunch of heads from some lefty who had taken, legitimately taken, I mean openly taken stuff out of context. Yeah. And put it into video to suggest that I was calling for the murder of Muslims. And it is a lie. It is a full on full stop. Absolute bullshit lie. I mean he took, he took a section from an asteroid that I do for a second amendment group called the u s concealed carry association in which I say that citizens should be law abiding, citizens should be armed and they should have concealed carry permits because if you are going to be victimized by a crime, the government can't stop that so you should be able to defend yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:18:09       He took the part where I say the government can't stop this and connected it to my video about how many radical Muslims that are on earth and then suggested that what I was saying is that you should arm up and go kill Muslims because there are a lot of violent thinking Muslims on earth or extreme Muslims on earth that now I'm suggesting that you should preemptively take action because the government can't protect you. I mean he was legitimately taking too disconnected. Thoughts on two separate topics, cobbling them together and then suggesting that was my position. It was just an open line. Was this a public person? Is this, or, oh yeah, I know this is a public person than actual roof. Is it human? Yeah, this is a human. So what do you do with a case like that? Okay, you can defend yourself on yet we've all done this, but I'm starting to think that that's not enough.

Speaker 4:          00:18:48       And it's an odd place. And I had Robert Barnes here are a couple of weeks for the lawyer and it's like, it's an odd place for the free speech guys to be going. We have to figure out what are the legal protections around speech because it's so not. And I, and I hate it, like in the worst position for me to possibly be. Right. And yet here we are. I mean you just defending herself. Well, the guy's just going to keep doing it. You get him clicks. Congratulations. Right? And that, that is what it is. You know, I'm loathe to either change libel or defamation laws in the United States. I prefer that people say more rather than less. I think most people see through this nonsense. And I if I didn't think that, that we couldn't really have republic is the truth. But it's, but yeah, I mean it's, it's obviously deeply to serving and as a good person, the first thing that happens, you know, if you're trying to be good, like I'm, I don't think, I think I'm a person who trying to be a good person.

Speaker 4:          00:19:35       And I think most people who are trying to be good people, when you are critiqued, the first thing you think is, okay, is that true? And your first instinct is did I do something wrong? And then the more you think about it, like, no, I didn't. This is just bullshit. So I mean other than just calling it out when it occurs, I'm not sure what else people can do. And even giving an air time is a problem because then it just drives them to double down in response and then suggest, no, no, no. Now he's lying. Now he's lying because they, they want to read into what they, what they want to read in. You can't have a good faith discussion this way and it's not meant to be a good faith discussion. How much do you think is just they want to take you out versus just they want to scare everybody else?

Speaker 4:          00:20:09       Like it's pretty clear to me they're not going to take you out out of fear. Right? They're not going, I mean, I think that it's, it's two. It's two things. One, there's always the pipe dream that there'll be able to take somebody like me out, but I think that it's about more than that. It's about making sure that people who are considered inside the Overton window won't even have a conversation with people like me. So Andrew Yang comes on my Sunday special and it's great. I mean, it's a really tolerant civil conversation. I took his ideas seriously. I read his book, I let him speak his piece. It was really nice, very nice guy. I've invited every major democratic candidate and on a judge had suggested that he was going to come out at one point and then he just never has responded yet. I'd love to have them on

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       and ask him some questions and it would be very civil because the Sunday special is a very civil place. Uh, and that's, he got Yang has gotten excoriated by the left for even coming on the show, right? Joe Rogan has me on his show and he gets hit by the left with you're having on that white supremacists, Shapiro, you're going to get hit just for having me on. That's the way this works. Because if they can alienate enough people by saying, okay, well we can't give them, if we can d platform everybody, then it's an easy way of avoiding actually having to regulate. What you do is you just make a deeply uncomfortable and so we sort of, you know, do I really want the flack of having on x, Y or z if that over to the window, I guess I've got to go this way.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       You keep moving it left right to the point that any that everybody is outside of it and the truth is that that's an effective tech specifically because there isn't Overton window. I mean it does exist. There are people I wouldn't have on my Sunday special. There are people who I wouldn't, I wouldn't appear with. Yeah, I mean I've said that before. And so because that's a little murkier of a line, it's easier to manipulate that line. It's easier to say, okay, well since we all accept that there is this Overton window, then we can use that Overton window and shift the line here and there. Now it's interesting that the Overton window is constantly shifting, as you say, left in every direction. Meaning that you can express the wildest, most insane views on the left and still be considered well inside the Overton window. And if you are as Heterodox as Sam Harris, a Hillary Clinton supporter who has said a couple of heterodox things like I like, I want to look at the evidence on Iq and then analyze how much of that is environmental and how much of that is genetic.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       And I want to look at how much that affects disparities overall. Or I'm saying that Islam has a relationship with violence globally speaking. Those heterodox opinions mean they're, I mean they're, they'll rule out Sam before they rule out Maxine waters, right? That's the way that this works. So they'll rule out anybody, Christina Hoff summers is too far right for them. She's, she's a white supremacist now, but they'll keep expanding that all the way to the point where anybody's wild opinion is acceptable. Like the right is routinely throwing people out for expressing opinions that we find unpleasant outside of our norm. Right. When Steve King came, finally said kind of openly, the white nationalists comment to the New York Times, we throw them out. I mean we took away as committee assignments and I donated the Max to his opponent. I raised money for Kevin [inaudible] who's running in his district.

Speaker 3:          00:23:00       Right. And, and the left's response was why was he even a part of you wants took a picture. I took a picture with him right before he said any before he said that stuff that was open. Right, exactly. And so that's what it becomes is well, were you once nice to this person? And it's like, well that was before. And also you guys are roots like Louis Farrakhan is still a person who meets with members of the Democratic Caucus. Like what, what, why is it the, the window only shifts in one direction. I'm not going to listen to people who tell me about who should be inside the Overton window when they legitimately refuse to throw anyone outside the Overton window, no matter how vile they are. Ilhan Omar just got defended by the entire Democratic Congress after saying for three antisemitic things in the course of seven weeks. Right? She was defended by the Democratic Caucus and left with our position on the foreign affairs committee

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       because they're, they're afraid that their own tactics will be used against them. So I would imagine in Biden's getting it now, I mean I've been calling this river and it eventually will happen to Bernie to, it has to happen. That's, that's the nature of the beast. How much of this though do you think is that bike? Cause I see this now cause I get a lot of former former lefties, let's say, uh, even some who've been on this show who publicly, they're like this thing the left is just burned. We get what it is. But publicly they won't say that they've shifted or that they're evolving or that if you're an old school liberal you, you can actually be okay with a lot of conservative ideas are conservative people because there's a protection involved. If you're basically a democrat or on the left, Joe Biden can run around with a gazillion videos of sniffing girl's hair and grabbing people in all of that.

Speaker 4:          00:24:34       And yet the people that were going crazy over cabinet, I have nothing to say about that, that there's just a protection. You get as a lefty that you simply don't get and it's, and it's comfortable not to raise your head above the water line. I mean I like, I like tell the story of that on my birthday. So I have a lot of a lot of friends in the media or people find friendly with, I wouldn't call them friends because of this, not because of the people who I am acquainted. Question is would they consider you a friend? That really is the question because it's my birthday, right? I routinely wish people, I disagree with happy birthday online. It seems like a basic thing of courtesies. It's, it's someone's birthday there on the left, fine, it's your birthday. Happy Birthday. People will text me on the left happy birthday.

Speaker 4:          00:25:11       I can't do this publicly. They will not tweet happy birthday because they are afraid that if they tweet happy birthday, they have then given me the credence of I was born in, therefore I'm a human being and they're going to get hit with how dare you wish this terrible person, this, this orthodox Jewish neo Nazi. How dare you wish that person happy birthday, right? The the, the effect of being duped. Lost is a thing. I mean the d the d plus thing I thought was so telling and it was so, and everybody knew gut level that if you said that a person on the other side is a human being that you got hit. But it's funny, I don't get this from the right, meaning that I say Andrew Yang is a human right. He's running for the 2020 nomination. I treated him really well and things, an intelligent guy.

Speaker 4:          00:25:44       I think he's a nice guy. I've said about buddy checks I've never met. He seems like a nice person. Like I, I, I will say that about the vast majority of people who I disagree with on the left and they're nice people who I disagree with. There's some more badly motivated and those people I tried to avoid, but the vast majority of them are like people you'd want to hang out with and seemed like nice people he can have a conversation with. When is the last time somebody has ever said that about somebody on the right there a nice PR by Joe Biden. You Recall? This actually happened to Biden. So Biden said this about pence, right? He said pence was a nice person. Yeah. And then Biden got hit so hard that he backed off of it and he was like, well, you know what? No one can hold the beliefs that Mike pence can. It has and still be a nice person then. I'm sorry we can't have a politics. If the idea is that we are that you are my enemy, then we are no longer even operating in the same sphere than my politics make me evil. But your politics make you a nice person. How am I supposed to have a conversation with you on that basis? So do you think then that Biden is the last chance for any Democrat to be somewhat centrist or decent for all the disagreements you may have with Biden? I mean, even

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       the last one I think is seen not only with the pen thing, but he had to dealt double down with a whole bunch of something as Politics Hillary yet. But he's on the apology tour. But, but when you see how radical the Democrats have gone, and again, this is like everything I was fighting against for all these years, you know what I mean? Yeah. This was like, guys, this is going to happen if we don't start fixing it right now. I don't even think it's my job to fix anymore. Right. It has to just sort of burn. It's just, it just is. That's a very unfortunate, because I think as Jordan would say, you need a certain tension between the right and the left. It's as equal tension, let's say. Um, but do you think Biden's like the last chance for that, for anything that's sort of,

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       I think the carver school democrats. Yeah. Carving out his soul right now. And so we'll see where he stands by the, I mean they'd taken basically an ice cream scoop and gone through his innards with this. And I just, I don't know how much in Biden is going to be left at the end of this. I think Biden's initial instinct, and I really don't like Joe Biden as a politician. I think he fibbed a lot. I, I don't like his policies, but I think his initial instinct before he gets political is that he can talk with people on the other side of the beltway was friends with McCain cane for so many years in all of this. I think that this is being beat out of him in the primaries. Yeah. Because it's just unacceptable. I was hoping the same thing was true about, about Buddha judge, right.

Speaker 3:          00:27:53       I was, I was hoping the Buddhist said she was going to be that right. He said something like, you know, I don't like the position of Dan Cathy, the head of chick fil a, but they make good chicken, so I'll eat there. And I was like, well that's refreshing. Isn't that a nice thing like radical. I know, but that was the, that was the only moderate thing I've heard in the entire Democratic primary and now booty, Trisha switching. And it's, again, Mike pens hates me, my pencils out to get me because he's a bad guy. And if Mike Pence thinks that I'm a bad person, what he's really doing is he's rejecting God because God made me the way that I am. It's like whatever. Mike Pence, his views on the sinfulness of homosexual activity, Mike pence has treated booty guys really well. I mean there's a bunch of records of him like when Buddhist edge was activated in the military, pence personally called him up to wish him best of luck in all of that. Like he's never said a bad word about Buddhist Asia. As far as I'm aware,

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       our friend Rick Grinnell, who's the ambassador to Germany who's gay, the right has only good things to say about Mike Pence. I'm not saying that everything Mike Pence says or believes would line up with everything. I believe. Of course Trump has also been president for two plus years or they come in for the gays, right? It's a, you bring anyone with

Speaker 3:          00:28:53       beautiful. Then the fact that [inaudible] has to make up a fake Mike Pence. Yeah, right. Where we're pens is now his enemy and out to get him is just, it's really telling about the, the polarization of politics and the attempt to shift political differences into character assassination. This idea that pence disagrees with me about same sex marriage and therefore he actually hates me and it's like, well, you have no evidence whatsoever that that is the case.

Speaker 2:          00:29:15       Like you're allowed to hate other people as long as you don't want laws that are different for them. Right. And will are allowed to hate people. It just is right. I don't have to be me and her until to know.

Speaker 3:          00:29:23       I mean I, I, and, and I think more importantly, you are allowed to dislike the behavior in which others engaged as long as you are not attempting to compel them to either engage or not engage in behavior like this is way I think that there's a fundamental distinction that every religious person understands and a lot of nonreligious people don't. When it comes to issues like homosexual marriage

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       or same sex marriage, which is, I don't like a lot of things that people do. I'm a religious person, right? That means that there are a lot of things that Jews do. Like you don't sell it. You don't take off Shabbat. Right. And actually been trying to a little bit more. Right. Well that's good. That's good. Cause I want to get off my phone, but bottom line is you or anybody, anybody else, lots of Jews don't celebrate Shabbat. That's a sin from where I sit. Right? That doesn't mean that I just like you. Right. And I send all the time, right? I violated Shabbat before, either by accident or a while ago when I was in front of on purpose. Like th I do stuff in my daily life all the time where I think, am I missing the religion? Not a perfect human being. Well, this is it, but this is the religious thing. Religious people understand that nobody is. And so when we look at somebody engaging in a behavior that we deem sinful, it's not like we're sitting there all day going, oh, I'll look at that center. It's like, well, right. That's, that's human beings, right? We all sit and that's what we do. And as long as I'm not trying to compel you not to engage in the sin, what do you even care like? It's, it's

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       confusing to many times. Have I said to your face, I actually don't care what your most personal belief is on gay marriage. I genuinely don't care. I know this will be clipped a zillion ways to sound people. Now your head's get the tolerant left, don't have Reuben's. You know, and it's like, but I, I really mean that. I sit on your shelf. You were out there right now. If you were campaigning for people that wanted to flip gay marriage or, or every day you were doing diatribes about how evil gay people are and then we would have a problem, right? But by you taking the libertarian position, you and your, and maybe from, from your moral center and we'll, we'll get into that shortly. You're not thrilled with it. Okay. I guess what I live in a country with people that I don't agree with,

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       and this has been my perspective. I mean, I said this on on Rogan show, this is like they're legitimately millions of people in this country who believe that I will go to hell because I don't believe in Jesus. And you know what I think about that. I don't care. I don't care. Like it makes no difference to me. Fine, you're not coming after me. That's the best thing that's happened to Jews and thousands of years that people are coming after. So like good. You don't believe what you want as long as you're nice to me and as long as you are and as long as you, I don't even think you have to be nice. Well I know, I mean, but I mean as long as you are at, yes. First of all, you don't have to be right. I mean like you may civil as long as you're correct.

Speaker 4:          00:31:43       I mean, right. And as long as you're not using the government to compel me to do things. And when I say nice to me, I mean if you're not like people, look, if we're talking about if I like somebody or not, if you're overtly mean to me, I'm not going to like you. But when it comes to politics, as long as you're not trying to come help me, I don't even care whether you like me or not or I like you or not. I mean that's a, this is why in my view, libertarianism is maybe the only way we're ever going to be able to be able to survive this stuff. Because if we don't leave each other alone, we're just going to club each other and to submission.

Speaker 2:          00:32:08       I mean that's why I've been ranting and raving about all this. All right, so let's, let's shift to the book a little bit. So I really enjoyed it. And then this morning you put up a or a Prager, you put up a video that basically is in conjunction with the book. So first off, the title, the right side of history, that's what the left always saying, right? When you may not phrase. So let's talk about that for a second. Because that's what they always say. Every time a conservative or any one on the right remotely says anything. They always say you're on the wrong side of history, right?

Speaker 4:          00:32:36       No Mama most famously used that to talk about same sex marriage. Right. If you were anti

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       same sex marriage, then this meant you were in the wrong side of history and this who was the guy that ran against games that, correct. She was on the wrong side of history at that point though. Then it became on the right side of history. The reason that I use the phrase, obviously it was a bit of a poke in the eye to that phrase and it's a play on words, is the end of the conservative side of history, the right side of history. But yeah, there is, but there's also this idea that what I don't like is using history as a club to beat someone with when it hasn't unfolded yet. So people will say, you're on the wrong side. You don't agree with me on tax policy. Well that was because in the future it will be proved that I was right and you're wrong. And you were on the wrong side of history. That's what Obama was saying about same sex marriage was people who were saying that traditional marriage has been x for thousands of years. Those people are on the wrong side of history because history will justify my position and they will have been shown to be non progressive and non decent. Maybe that's right. Maybe that's wrong. You don't know yet. History hasn't progressed yet. Right. But there are certain, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       it would be very scary though if that was true that we would, once things change that you would look back and think that the thousands of years before you, and this is sort of what you're talking about, the book that all of the people that believe different things were we're backwards or evil or on the wrong side of things. I mean it takes it no context of how they live.

Speaker 3:          00:33:45       Right. And, and again, I think there's a difference between looking back saying here's a bunch of good stuff that we have in today's society and here's all the things that we love. Where did that come from? That's what I say, the right side of history. Here's the stuff that we know that is right and where did that come from? Okay, so that's the right side of history as opposed to here's my politics. Today is my political position. I have not a lot of evidence historically that it's going to work or it's not going to work, but it will be proved one day that you are on the wrong side of history. If you oppose me, you're not really talking about history, you're talking about you know, you're, you're basically forecasting into the future something that you can't possibly know. So that that's sort of use of the phrases is highly irritating to me.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       Especially because there are times when their politics in the ascendancy, they're really ugly and unapproved later to be completely wrong. I mean, there was a point where Jews were pretty regular getting murdered in Europe. They were on the wrong side of history at that point. Right? And then it turns out that in the long run, they're not on the wrong side of history. The Nazis are on the wrong side of history. If you'd said the opposite in 1934 people would have thought you were crazy. So you can't really say where history is going. Well you can do is look back and say, here's where history has gone and here's what we like about what history has been and here's where we have broad agreement. And that's really what I'm talking about. Where are the issues where we in Western civilization should have brought agreement? And why is that broad agreement starting to fall apart?

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       Yeah, so you know, the IDW is a great example of this. There's not a lot of agreement on policy in the IDW virtually at all, but there are certain basic principles that we all kind of take for granted. Democracy is better than dictatorship. Free speech is better than limited speech. Personal responsibility is better than shirking personal responsibility. Like these are things that, that everybody seems to basically take in common. And so what I say is, okay, where do these values come from? Because they didn't spring up in a vacuum. And the fact that we have great material, prosperity and free markets and wealth, and all of this great stuff that did not happen either by accident or everyone at once.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       Magic. It's not just some sort of man made magic. So let's talk about that. Let's talk about the two cities then. Let's, let's start. Let's start with Jerusalem

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       to Jerusalem. Okay. So the, so the basic thesis of the book is a very [inaudible] view, that thesis. So Leo Strauss, famous 20th century philosopher, he posited that Western civilization was predicated on these two poles that we're constantly fighting with. One another. One was Jerusalem and was Athens. So Jerusalem is the idea of Judeo Christian values that under girds our social fabric, the vast majority of people who are members of the community or members of the Judeo Christian community in the West, obviously. And there are certain values that are inherent in the Bible that are different from most pagan cultures. So for example, the, the Judeo Christian ethic, and we can discuss where that comes from. You know, Jordan would say that it's rooted in, in human nature and then manifest in the Bible. Uh, people like Sam would say that it's sort of an evolutionary hangover. Um, but you know, we can get to whether the revelation actually occurred or not, but the, but the basic premises of Judaic Christian revelation there, there are several of them.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       One is that there is such a thing as an orderly universe. So this seems perfectly obvious to us now that that we can discover the rules of science, that things are out there that make sense. But for a huge majority of cultures over time that was not true. It was you worshiped various gods because there are arbitrary that are fighting with each other and you tried to appease one at the expense of the other. There are no discoverable rules to the universe. He's weird though, that you have to take a leap of faith to get to a place that it starts with order. Isn't that? Yeah, it's, it's an interesting, it is, and this is, this is one of the points that I make is that people see reason and revelation as intention. But the point that I keep making two Sam whenever we discussed this is that Sam makes a leap of faith to about these principles.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       He and I started at the same principles. It's just that I acknowledged that I'm making a leap of faith to get there and he thinks you can reason your way back using sort of a priori reason to these fundamental principles like the orderliness of being able to discover rules in the universe. I don't think any of that is perfectly obvious to the human mind nor do I think that for the vast majority of human history, people thought that you needed people tended to think that basically your cork bobbing about on the ids of chaos and that there was no real way for you to to discover any logic to the universe. So the, the idea of the Bible is there is a god, the God creates a universe using a mind. That mind is orderly in nature and there are certain logical rules that that mind uses and then we are created in the image of God, which has a couple of separate implications.

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       One is that our mind reflects his to the extent that we can grasp at a certain level what exactly is the order of that universe and then the second is the actual meaning of that we are made in the image of God. It means that each of us has inestimable value. Now that is something that, again, we tend to think of as perfectly obvious that we are all valuable human beings, but all was restricted to the tribe for most of human history and we are reverting back to that now, which is all, you know we are all valuable except for that guy. That guy is not valuable. Screw that guy, right? He's a member of an opposing tribe and so the story of Western civilization is the broadening out of that principle that we are all made in God's image too. All right? That's why when people say, okay, well Western civilization had slavery in Western civilization had racism. It's that all that is true. The question is why Western civilization got rid of those things where it had been trying to fight those things. Whereas other cultures have basically reinforced those things or have decided those things are okay. And the tribalism is, is a, is a good, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       Thanks. So what do we do that again about the people that always want to focus on the bad part? Because one of the things I liked in the Prager u video, you made a point of saying, yeah, a lot of bad things have happened, right? The West has made mistakes along the way, but that the arc has bent so that there is more freedom, there's more wealth, there is more prosperity, all that. But it seems to me that, and I think this is what's happening on the left by and large, is that if they could step back for a moment, they might see that it's a lot better. I mean, every college Gig I go to, I go, I always open it up to the crown. I say, does anyone have it worse? I say this to the hecklers. Yeah. And they never respond. Does anyone in this room have it worse than their grandkids? And nobody ever says yes. It's almost impossible if you live in the United States, if you're not honest with you, until your grandfather could have been an oil barren and then lost it. Right. That's pretty much happy. They'd be happy for that too because they don't want inherited wealth to go through the generations. Right. But the point is, it's very hard to get them to look at that. What do you think, what do you make of the type of mind that always goes to the worst? Is that because of the disconnect with Jerusalem? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:39:33       I mean, yes, because I think that to a, to a certain extent you had, and this is sort of the thesis of the book, is that if you're ungrateful for this society that you've been given, that's because you don't understand the society that you've been given. So we tend to think of all this stuff is natural. It is completely unnatural. There's point the journal Goldberg makes in his book, right? The prosperity, the fact that you have a baby, the baby's will live to 80 in the United States, barring some sort of cataclysmic health event. The fact that you are going to live not only in relative prosperity, but the greatest prosperity that any human being has ever known. You can go on a machine and click a button. Any product that you like will arrive at your door in two days, made in 10 different countries for an affordable price that costs you less than an hour of labor. Right in there. Like

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       thank God those people aren't going to New York, right, with those 25 pounds.

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       Yeah. So the, so I think that one of the great debates of our society right now is that on one side you have a bunch of people who say, okay, well that's where things are awesome. Things are historically awesome. You wouldn't want to be born in any other time in any other places in an amazing place. And all of the problems of history exist. But what that's about is a struggling to maximize the principles that were good in their inception. And then it's a question of is fulfilling those principles. And this is true for the declaration and the Constitution. And yes, slavery was contemplated in the constitution and that was a great evil. And then we find a great civil war. And then there was racism that was implicit in American society than we fought. We fought ourselves using these great universal principles.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       That's always ongoing, right? Of course,

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       there, there is no end point at which all human sin has been alleviated because we're sinful creatures and we tend to revert back into all of these things. Tribalism and racism and, and illogic and all of these, these things. But, but the fundamental principles at the root of the civilization are good. And then you have a bunch of folks who say, right, we have a lot of prosperity, but look, there's still racism, there's still sexism, there's still bigotry. And that's because the actual natural state of man would be the prosperity. It's all this other stuff that western civilization added. And that I think comes from just a complete ignorance of the realities of history in the world, which is that everything bad that has happened in Western civilization, yes, is truly awful and evil and also has existed in virtually every other civilization. The history of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       The question is why is the good stuff happening? Right? The natural state of Man Hobbes is right about this is nasty, brutish and short. The natural state of man is not the Rousseau's noble savage living out there enjoying the fruits and the nuts. I mean, that's not exactly what was going on, right? This is the point that that, that as I say, Goldberg makes is that something happened and suddenly we are all living in paradise. So what was the thing that happened? So the, and this is where on the one hand, I really accept Goldberg and Pinker and the enlightenment argument and [inaudible] argument in Michael Shermer, his argument, I love the enlightenment. It's so funny, people would characterize this book is anti enlightenment. No, it's very anti-friction. Lightman half of the book is actually, I mean that portion of this is correct. It's, it's funny how people sort of see what they want to see.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       So I've gotten letters from religious people saying, I don't think you're taking seriously enough. The contribution of religion. And then I got people from the secular humanist side going, I don't think you've taken seriously enough the contribution of Athens. Like No. The whole point is that these two things are intention and not only are they intention, but that tension is necessary. I described civilization as effectively a suspension bridge and on one end you have certain principles you must take for granted and that are embedded in the Judeo Christian tradition. And on the other hand you have all the reason that must be used in order to not end up in theocracy land. And these two things are pulling against each other and pushing against each other and pulling against. And that's the history of Western civilization. And I think the greatest balance was reached in the American founding and in those principles.

Speaker 3:          00:42:57       And then those promises were expanded outward to a broader and broader group of people. And that's the story of the West as opposed to Western civilization is the marks. His take is that Western civilization is effectively a power hierarchy. All these principles are a lie and that the principles are a simple gloss on, on what is a reversion to a power hierarchy. So for example, there was somebody on the left who got very upset because in this section, the book I say, you know, we used to believe that we are brothers and sisters. We seem to believe that we have these principles in common. And people were like, who's weak? He Hobby? Because a lot of, cause a lot of black folks were not included in that bargain. A 100% true. But if you go back as late as 2006 2007 2008 and look at the poll numbers, people believe that racism was receding in the United States.

Speaker 3:          00:43:39       People believed that effectively. We were trying to get rid of all of this stuff. And the reason that we've been able to curb racism in our society, the reason we've been able to curb sexism is because we were able to use these principles to overcome the natural tribalism and sinfulness inherent in human beings, right? So when I say we used to believe we were all brothers, we did believe that we are all brothers. But then we expanded the definition of brothers. That was the story, right? The reason that Western civilization has been effective is because we have these principles. The principles are good. We were too restrictive in the use of those principles. And then using reason, we broadened out those principles to encompass more and more people. So when I say we used to consider all of each other brothers, that was true in theory and not an action, and then it would was broadened out to action. And that's what's made our world a better place. So is that part of the problem right now is that we're in our eating fruits and nuts stage here in the west. We are in such spectacular wealth and freedom

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       and all of those things in, of course, everybody's not wealthy and we have a homeless problem in all sorts of things. And there's problems, there's mental health problems and everything else, but that we have. So by and large conquered races and we have so by large conquered all of the inequities in society. Not all of them, but we've, we've done a pretty good job and we show it, as you're saying, it's the train is still going right. But that do, that then becomes the weakness that then people, young people, and I mean if you look at the millennials and now everything that was born out of this new progressive lefty thing, it's that it's not perfect. So we must burn it down. So it's almost that that is now, but it's a symptom of the success it's suppose to, it's almost a inevitable symptom. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       well that's right. I mean this is what I talk about in the book when I get to, you know, the sort of the philosophy of the 1960s which was we need to replace the heart of stone within man with a heart of flesh. It was a religious concept. It was from a Marxist idea, which was there is something fundamentally wrong with the western soul. And what we need to do is shift the entire system. This is the Marxist. The actual market is pro pro. Uh, promise is not, you're going to be wealthier and more spectacular and your living standard. Then under capitalism, ver very few marks is actually make this claim. And if they do their ignorance, uh, the, the actual match, his claim is that it will fundamentally change the nature of human beings to live in different relations with each other in a certain economic system.

Speaker 3:          00:45:49       And we will become different in humans. Now the conservative view and the religious view is no, you won't, right? I mean, you're going to be exactly the same human you were before then the system can change. Human beings are always what they are. You can alleviate certain material conditions that make people more likely to be less stressed, for example. But overall, human beings are sinful creatures. We tend toward toward tribalism and anger. We have to train ourselves to be good. Anybody who's had kids, I'm frankly astounded that anyone who has kids buys into the Marxist, he says, because the notion that kids are there, that people are inherently good. It's such absolute utter crap. That doesn't mean we don't have good instincts. We do have a good instinct, but that is balanced for the very selfish instinct as well. I mean, I, I know there's a, there's a new book out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:29       I'm trying number who, who's the author was just reviewed in the Wall Street Journal talking about sort of the natural goodness of, of human beings and I, there, there is some of that, I mean look at as Jordan, let's talk about, if you look at Piaget, people play games with each other and they tend to form common rules and all of that is true. There's also a real selfishness to human beings that naturally comes out and you see it among kids. And if that's not trained, if people aren't cultivated to become better human beings, they just don't become better human beings. And so this is why I say you need to reexamine what it is that's good about your life and then ask, why did it get so good? You didn't build this thing like, I don't want to, I mean, I do want to quote Obama care. Obama says you didn't build it. When I spend my entire life building a business, but you didn't build the system, the system you were born into. Right. You think that free speech is something that just magically exists here and that everybody is entitled to it. Yeah. Welcome to a thing that that only exists for the last couple of hundred years and legitimately millions of people had been killed fighting over.

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       Is this why? What is happening right now with the Democratic candidates is so dangerous. I mean, just in the last couple of weeks, so now they're talking about reparations. They're talking about adding Supreme Court justices. They're talking about, there was a whole slew, I give me a give me [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       electoral college, Electoral College. I went to the Senate, the Senate, because it's not represented my population. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       These things that these are now would be, you know, look, these ideas were man made ideas, but that they think only in their day. If they can just rejigger the entire way we look at everything, it will be better. Where I would argue in almost every, I can't imagine a case where if we flip to any of those things, things would, would be any,

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       yeah, no, I, I really have serious doubts that if you get rid of the Senate that suddenly people in Montana are going to be like totally okay with everything. Right. Or that people like let, let's not pretend that people in California

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       aggressive in the big cities would control everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       Right. And, and by the way, the people in the rural areas, we try to break away. I mean, they would, that's the, the, the, I mean people don't want it. The civil war was about slavery and there was also a massive economic gap between the south and the north, which was reflected in a lot of the tariff fights that existed up until the civil war. That was a rural urban gap. And it's one of the reasons why the north one is because they had so much more urban power than the south. But you know that that was about slavery. You could see a certain situation in the United States where the rurals look at the cities and they say, we don't want you ruling us. You don't live out here. What do you, why should I listen to a bunch of people live in San Francisco when I live in the Central Valley of California?

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       I'm a farmer out here. Why can't you leave me the hell alone and, and you know, I used to at least be able to punch above my weight in terms of you used to have to take my opinion into account. Now you can just ignore me and run rough shot over me. Why should I be part of that system? I don't buy into your majority Terrian system where you are always the majority. That's not something I'm interested in. You know, the, the, the sorta the, the tracks that the founders did not trust peer majority hereon doesn't mean they were right not to trust peer majority Arianism because majority of people have often believed incredibly stupid and dangerous things. That's why they want to checks and balances. We've sort of run rough shot over those over the course of the last century. But yeah, I mean the, the, the fundamental disconnect between conservatives and people on the American left, uh, is summed up by Chesterton in, in his very famous fence analogy that if you're on the left and you're walking through a field and you see a fence in the middle of the field just in the middle of nowhere, you're first instinct is, I don't know why this fence is here.

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       Let's take down the fence. This fence, it does not belong here. It's just dumb. There's no reason for the funds to be hurt. Get rid of the fence. If you're on the right, your first instinct is to say, I'm not going to remove the fence until I know why it was here in the first place. Once I figure out why I was here, then we can talk about removing the fence. And that is true right now in politics, the, the left teams to be saying, I don't know why any of this stuff is here. They even ascribe bad history to these things, right? They'll say that the electoral college has put in place to protect slavery or some such nonsense, which is just not true. And then the end and then it's like, well, we created this false history. Let's get rid of the thing. I don't know why it's there in the first place. No reason. Dump it. And people on the right. Whoa, maybe we should like, think about what the actual possible down sides here are because virtually every action that we take has some unintended consequences. And maybe we overstate the unintended consequences. Like I think that has probably happened for example with gay marriage, right on. I used to be anti same sex marriage on the legal level. I used to say like,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I think that if the government legalizing same sex marriage that it's going to have some pretty dramatic impact on how people interact with one another. Um, and then I was, and then before Obers fell, I said we should get out of the business specifically because I don't want anybody imposing their views on anybody else. We can all live how we want and just leave each other alone. And I think the the right overestimated kind of pushback. Did you get from religious people on that? I don't know that we've ever actually specifically talked about. I don't know that I got significantly heavy pushback specifically because I wasn't making the case that you have to overrule your own vision of what's in constitutes. I'm just saying you can't impose that on anybody else. Meaning that if you want to protect yourself from the other side using government for its argument, then you need to stop using government for your argument.

Speaker 4:          00:51:09       I was making the anti institutional argument, right? I wasn't making the case that everybody who's religious has to re shift away from their religious orientation. I wasn't doing the Hillary Clinton thing where it's like a certain amount of religious people. I get that. Yeah. That I make obviously, but I would imagine a certain amount of religious people if they're viewing this as sort of a foundational societal belief, right? If you change this institution, I'll tell you, I didn't get a ton of pushback specifically because I wasn't coming out against the institution. I think a lot of the pushback that surrounded same sex marriage was a twofold idea from the religious community. One was you must personally in your own life, except that same sex marriage is morally equivalent to a heterosexual marriage. And if you don't, you're a bigot. And that offended a lot of religious people.

Speaker 4:          00:51:48       People were like, I don't that, that's not an argument I'm willing to listen to because you're, you're immediately labeling me a bigot based on both my religious views and a view of natural law, which is fairly common to most religions and I'm not going to hear that. I think that if the, if the left had approached it as you don't get to use power, we don't get to use power, nobody gets used power the right is much more receptive. That's been my argument all along. So I think libertarianism has a lot more draw than social leftism two to the right. I think you can make, can solve most of those problems by having the government just not be involved. This has been my contention, right? I could cause what I'll say to religious people as I may even agree with you on the nature of sinfulness, a particular activity, but it's none of my business.

Speaker 4:          00:52:27       And not only that, I think that if you make it the government's business, you know you're all happy to use the government right now for your particular ends, but there's gonna be a time when you're not running the government anymore and they're going to come for you and you're not gonna be real happy. Right. They don't seem to like this Trump guy. Right. They get their answer is more government. Exactly. So that's why I didn't, I didn't get a lot of pushback when I suggested that because it wasn't coming from a place of me trying to castigate people for their own personal moral views. And I think that for, for a lot of the gay rights movement, it was about that. It was about, it was about, I'm trying to castigate people. If you believe that what I do is I send, that's because you're a non meritorious intolerant bigot.

Speaker 4:          00:52:57       Does that also show you the, the, unfortunately religious people have been tarred with this idea of intolerance when it isn't true. I mean, is that like a really good succinct, I mean I think that's a good example because the fact is that listen, has there been religious intolerance toward people? 100%. I mean, come on, I can't pretend that that doesn't exist in the Jewish community, exists in the Christian community, exist in the Muslim community. It's true that there's been intolerance. I quite like, I don't want to portray religious people is all completely innocent in this cause obviously that's, there are people who have been

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       excised and treated badly by religious communities. Of course that's true. But this is what I was talking about earlier with, with, with Buddha judge his treatment of pens, the track, the attribution of motive depends as the pence is sitting there like day in and day out thinking, oh, that people put a judge in his, in his sexual proclivities. Like that's, mm. I don't know anybody who thinks that way. If they do think that way, there's something wrong with them, frankly. Yeah. Um, and it's, and so that's, and also we did,

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       it came out of a of a year of me to where it was like right before all that happened. What was everyone making fun of pence over that he doesn't go into rooms with other women and yeah, that may sound odd to me or you know, all right. That's what he's decided to do. And guess what has been not accused of doing, some of them are frankly, listen, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       Spending Jewish religious law for a very long time. You're not supposed to be alone with a, with a woman who is not your wife with the door closed. This is like legitimately part of Jewish law and it has been for several thousand years. It's called the acid. You're not actually supposed to do it. So like Mike Pence said that, I was like, oh, well welcome to the club dude. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:22       What do you do in a situation like that then? So if you're in your office and a, and a female,

Speaker 3:          00:54:25       cool. I mean we've got glass doors, so it's not as much of an issue, right. Meaning like, you know, I don't really thought it all through [inaudible] like I never want to be in a position where I can be accused of acting with impropriety. And by the way, this is true for doctors too. Like I'm, I'm shocked that people took pens that way. I, my wife, who is a doctor when she goes into, she is, it turns out I can't believe when she, when she goes in and she examines a patient when a, when a male doctor examines a female patient, the new rule basically is there must be some third party in the room to ensure that there is no claim made against the doctor. It seems to me if you're a prominent person then you should be considering exactly the same thing. Like this doesn't seem illogical to me. This just seems like for the same reason that I like body cameras on cops as a general matter, I like evidence and I like people who are there to debunk or enforce the, the, the actual account that happened.

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       So is this another one of those things where they, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Where the idea of course is, you know, we're gonna put everybody in situations where the you, I wouldn't care. I don't care if the person that I hire, I don't look at their, I mean, when we did our last job posting, I made a point of saying, I don't care about your gender. I don't care about your sexuality. I don't care about your skin color, et Cetera, et cetera. But in reality, because the world is so out of whack right now, the truth, the real truth is, I don't know that I've ever said this publicly. When we were looking at resumes, I was less inclined to hire a gay man because I thought, well, I could be in a room with this person and then they could just announce that, listen, they're writing. How insane is that? So now you've created a scene because you create the system of incentives that it doesn't help anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       Right. [inaudible] you've seen actually this, this sort of thing materially speaking in terms of, for example, policies that say that you're not allowed to do criminal background checks on potential employees because there are too many black folks who have criminal backgrounds and so we want to make sure more black people are employed. You actually end up with a reverse what you end up with his employers who look at resumes and in many cases cannot check the criminal background of people and so they say, okay, statistically it's more likely that a black person went to prison than a white person went to prison is not a racial statement. That's a statistical statement of fact and so I'm just not going to hire this black person. Well, who gets hurt by that? That black guy who didn't commit a crime, right? Yeah. This is, this is the sort of thing that like there are dangerous unintended consequences to public policies that are, that are well intentioned.

Speaker 3:          00:56:41       Again, I think it's a well intentioned public policy, but I think that it's a, a bad public policy. And to pretend that people aren't people as stupid people are going to use whatever information they have at hand to make judgments and to protect themselves. And this is, this is true if, if this is true with regards to employers and women taking time off from the workforce, this is true with regard to sexual harassment allegations. Like, listen, when I was growing up, my mom always said to me, right, and my mom ran businesses. I mean she, she was a higher up at the company that did hell's kitchen and she did like major reality TV shows. So she was a high powered when my mom worked, my dad stayed at home and my mom said to me, if you ever get a secretary, get a 70 year old woman, right? Because you're never going to be accused of anything cause she 70 Riley. And that was my mom saying that to me.

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       Some people have that fetish, but

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       it as a general rule like this, but, and that's not entirely like human nature is human nature. In this, there's been this willful attempt to blind ourselves to human nature that I find alternatively hilarious and ridiculous and scary. It's like what we're supposed to pretend that reality doesn't exist because we wish reality. We're not what it was. And the truth is the, the unhappiest people on Earth are the people who are constantly fighting reality. Whether you're talking about in your dating life where it's like, I want to look just exactly as I feel like looking at everybody else who won't date me. It's their problem. You can't get a date. And I said, well, maybe it's because you haven't worked out in 10 years. Right. Stink, right? Or Yeah. Or, or maybe a or whether it's in the job market where it's like, well, I wish that I could get this job and I deserve to get this job and I'm not going to do what I need resume wise to get the job or I'm going to rely on such and such to get the job that I don't get your order or I'm going to sit in this dying town.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       I'm never going to leave this dying town because I deserved to have a job in this tiny town. The nice thing about politics is you can pander to everybody by lying to them about these realities. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       Did you, did you happen to see last night, I think it was on 60 minutes, there's a clip going around of this young, you saw this, this student? Yeah, or they, they interviewed several students and the thrust of it, I didn't see the full thing. I just wrote what they tweeted out, the videos that they tweet it out, but the rest of it with all these young people, but there's this particular young man saying, you know, if college was free in medical school was free and that I wouldn't have to work. And then because of that, I could study more. Thus I could be a better dot. Right? And it's like, hey, there's no proof that that's actually true and you might learn a lot of things by working and all that. Now the idea that med school maybe is too much money in college is completely out of whack. That's a perfectly legit conversation to have. Right? And we can't have that conversation, but I just thought the way it was spun by the Twitter account was like, see, it's obvious you shouldn't have to work if you're going to be a doctor. Right? And it's like, no, no.

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       Right. We're missing something here. That's the, so what was funny about that story is CBS news covered it as, isn't this a great example of why we should make medical school for free? Right. And what actually happened is there was a donor

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       I believe is Bernie Marcus from, from home depot who went to Nyu and he donated several, I believe it's like a hundred million dollars to Nyu to pay for the medical education of the kids who went to Nyu. So as a private donor doing something good for these kids and they're like, what if we just made a government policy? Well then you completely skewed the incentive structures. What would happen, because I'll tell you what would be the next thing that happened. The next thing that happened is that doctors would be, would be granted free tuition presumably. And the next thing that would happen is they would say, okay, well now you have to be regulated so you need to work for 60 grand a year, at which point the registration rates would dramatically drop it. And you get a completely different crop of people who are going into medicine in the first place because you know that you're going to get free education, but you're only gonna make 60 grand, 70 grand on the other end.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       All those people who right now are paying $200,000 to go to medical school so they can make $400,000 a year coming out. All those people decided to go work at Mckinsey instead. That's all that happens because people are profit seeking and want to live a certain lifestyle and guess what? After 11 years of this shit like my wife deserves to be able to earn whatever she can earn. I mean, I've been doing this thing, okay, I've been women, like I cannot tell you how many, how many things we've had to forego and I've paid for her medical education, right? I mean, I've gone out of pocket for all of it. I've paid for every iota of her medical education and it's cost us a lot, but she's working for below minimum wage right now because doctors and residency effectively worked for below minimum wage. They're making 40 50 grand a year and then working 80 hours a week and that's what they go through.

Speaker 4:          01:00:41       And you know what? That's because they should make money on the other end. The market does have a value in determining what the value of these things are. The two solutions to that are either the market or private people like the home depot guy come in and that that frankly I think that it's just, it's not perfect, but frankly I don't think that nobody's forced. I don't think that there is a serious, yeah. Okay. So there are a couple of things you can do to bring down medical school tuition. One, you could stop with the licensure requirements for things that nurse practitioners could do. Right? Because that way you have bunch of people who are going to nursing school or PA school and they can do a lot of this stuff and then you don't have to create this cartel and the cartel charges a lot of money too for you to get into it that that'd be one thing.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       But number two, so what, so you take out a bunch of loans to go to medical school and they make a bunch of money coming out, which you should make because you have spent a lot of money going in. Like if you want, the question is do you want your doctors to be people who make a lot of money? Do you think doctrine is an important thing as a society such that you want the smartest people going into it? If you want the smartest people going into any industry, you have to make sure that the pay grade is high enough and I'm at, my problem here is not free medical school. My problem is that it will be used as an incentive to to force doctors to take less of a cost for Medicare for example, and then you will get a lesser group of people intellectually than you otherwise would.

Speaker 4:          01:01:50       There's an unintended consequence to this sort of stuff. So he's this just the fundamental flaw with almost every argument that comes out of the progressive these days that if you give free college that this will somehow ultimately do good. Even though we know that there are more jobs disappearing that you wouldn't need college, but that will be the free, you can go to trade school or or any of these things where it's like we can or Medicare and then the free college education. The, the free college education argument is one of the worst arguments I've ever heard. It's legitimately a terrible argument. I mean the idea that look, everybody in college is earning more than people who didn't go to college. Therefore if everyone went to college they would all earn more than that. No, I'm sorry. The reason people earn more from going to college is because it is a sorting mechanism.

Speaker 4:          01:02:29       If you get rid of the sorting mechanism, you know what will happen. There'll be another sorting mechanism, which is exactly what's happened with Grad schools. The vast, a huge number of it. Like as you sort, the incomes go up and as you get rid of the sorting mechanism that our new sorting mechanisms that are added to the job market and to the educational market while you're actually getting, unless you're actually, you know, going there for math or science or something, but as I said, if you go to college and I went to Ucla and then Harvard law school, so I have plenty of experience with, with going and majoring in useless things and major university, you were Ali's, I mean I was a poly sci major at Ucla, which is a useless thing in a major university. The all that these things are are twofold.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       A sorting mechanism, because I went to Ucla and Nazi son and that means that presumably I'm smarter because it's a higher sat score to get into Ucla than it is to get into Csun and second, a an Ersatz social fabric where you meet a bunch of people who then you can later on call on his friends. Right. This is what JD man's talks about and hillbilly elegy coming from Appalachian, going to Yale law school. Suddenly he has a group of people he can call on and he's part of the social fabric and he's operating in different social circles. Neither of those two things are going to be cured by universal college because the social fabric goes away because it's not selective anymore and the sorting mechanism goes away because it's not selective anymore. Right. So so do you get free college no matter what your major is?

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       Well, this is the other thing, lesbian dance theory, that Free College, right? What did we give to society when you're not qualified to do anything? By the way, Buddhist judge has exactly right about this. This, he was correct on and he says, why are we having middleclass people subsidizing people who are upperclassmen. Totally correct. Totally correct. The people who are going to end up in college enabled to get into college. You're going to be the people who would have been able to go to college anyway. We don't need more people going to college. When you have fewer people going to college, we need less useless majors. We need people being able to apprentice directly into law school. We needed it. Like why is it that you have to be 23 and you've gone through seven years of education to go to law school? Why? It makes no sense.

Speaker 4:          01:04:15       Why couldn't you just, when you're hiring right now because daily wires killing it. You guys are growing fast. You're, you're doing all sorts of stuff over at the office. Uh, when you look at resume, I don't know how involved, yeah, yeah. My best partner, Jeremy is much more involved but yeah. Do you even care that much work experience matters more than where you went to college? For sure. I mean, Jeremy is a perfect example is my business partner didn't finish college. He went to a music school and dropped out after two years and people used to look down their noses in it. And I remember there was a very prominent person whose name everyone would recognize who one's called up, Jeremy Cursing at him because he had not gone to college. And Jeremy was like, why? Like Jared and Jeremy now runs a company that, that, you know, we have close to 100 employees. We clear a lot of money every year. We grossed a lot of money and the, he knew some of the smartest people I know never went to college or finish college. Like it's, it's good for what it's good for and it's bad for what it's bad for. It's good for premed. It's good for math. It's good. It would be. I got a lot of flack for saying this about, about kind of the, what we call the north campus majors at Ucla. Uh, the, the, uh, po, the poly psy

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       English history majors. And I said like, basically this is effectively useless and you should, you know, unless you're majoring in a hard science, you should think about going elsewhere. Like, well, your whole book is about Western civilized philosophy look, right? We don't learn any of that crap. Go to college anymore. Well, that's the reason I wrote the book is because none of these people learn any of this stuff. Nobody's ever heard of. A client is when you go like when's the last time they taught Aquinas at a, at a major university other than in sort of religious studies classes. They don't even mandate western Civ anymore at these classes nor I mean like the stuff should be imbibed with your mother's milk. I mean they should be, they should be part of just the generalized educational curriculum.

Speaker 2:          01:05:52       If we want to go down in the conspiracy road a little bit. Is that part of it too is that if you really wanted to keep indoctrinating people with lefty ideas and socialist ideas and big government ideas and all of those things in collectivist ideas, we'll give them free college and then just teach them those ideas for four years and then you've really whacked them at the knees before they,

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       I mean I think there is

Speaker 2:          01:06:12       there. To me it would make sense. Bernie say go, everyone's getting free college and what are we going to do to you at college? Teach you postmodern.

Speaker 3:          01:06:19       I think. I think it's less conspiratorial than that, but I do think that there are a bunch of people on the left who certainly are not upset about the fact that colleges are dominated by the left and who are very angry every time somebody tries to break that domination. I mean, this is why I get banned from colleges speaking about stuff like this. So it's, you know, again, it's, it's a pretty hardy policy. How do you,

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       how do you take the ideas between Jerusalem and Athens and how do you then just beat the easy ideas of the day? Because that's, to me, that is where we're at. So now we're just at a place, a easy answer. Everyone that I disagree with is a racist, bigot. Homophobe I know how to do everything. Everyone before me was evil. All of those things, let's change everything. The current laws in electoral college and everything else. Let's do all of those things because we're so good and everyone else so stupid. Well, how do you actually beat that? I mean, that's what

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       right, trying to do, right? I mean, I think that the first thing to do is to, is to, you know, get people involved in reeducating themselves. And I think you're taking tremendous hunger for that. Obviously. I mean this is a book on Western philosophy and in the first two weeks we sold well over a hundred thousand copies. It's a book on Western philosophy, right? And that is not exactly pop reading. I mean that's not right. It's not happy dappy do kind of stuff. So it's ignored and told people how to clean their room. And so 5 million exactly. It. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. I mean like there's a market for, for hard stuff right now because people are looking for something that means something and we haven't created a much better world with, with the Twitter woke police out there. I don't think that people are feeling happy or secure because of all that.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       So do you think it's fundamentally a crisis of meaning? That's really what I took away from your book yesterday and I really, I was thinking about it over the weekend. It's like nut. We listen, you know, we fight on Twitter all day long. We all siphon off into our own little places and now between fake news and everything else, it's like nobody really knows in the secular world lit. Yeah. Nobody really knew has this, and this is the sadness of liberalism right now. For me, it's like maybe liberalism didn't give enough through a secular lens and PR and I think maybe you'd argue that's because he got disconnected from, uh, from Jerusalem.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Uh, people not bet that we're in a crisis. We're in a crisis of belief. I think they are crisis of reality. Here's what, here's night real argument with sort of the secular version of the enlightenment, the French German version of the enlightenment, which is that by disconnecting the connection to Judeo Christian values, the idea was that we were going to untether ourselves to be able to fly to the stars, but can make our own meaning. And I think people suck in making their own meaning. Frankly. I think that generally when people make their own meaning, they tend to fall into hedonism or nihilism. I think that there are, some people can do it, right? Yeah, for sure. Some people can do it, some people can do it. Some people can live with this. I mean I think that Sam, it seems like a fulfilled guy. Michael Shermer is a fulfilled guy, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       I think there are, there are people who can, who can live with this and make their own meaning, but for the vast majority of people, the answer is absolutely not. You cannot make your own meaning because if you make your own meaning you tend toward either selfishness or meaninglessness. You need to be told that your life has value and that you're in control of your own life and there needs to be rooted, rooted philosophy to support that. And that begins with teaching these very simple stories. I mean I it fundamentally, I think that religious education begins with the stuff that is harder to believe because that's the most simplest to understand. Its hardest to believe in, simplest to understand, right? The stories in genesis are the hardest to believe on their face, but they're also the simplest to understand like you get from the idea of Adam and eve, that you are not the creator of your own meeting, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       That, that the knowledge of good and evil, your knowledge of good and evil is not the same as God's knowledge of good and evil. And that by attempting to create your own meaning, it's a, you're actually egotistically sending against God. That's, that's the message for the Adam and Eve story or the Canine and Cain and Abel story, which is that ceaseless jealousy and a belief in your incapacity to take control of your life that that result in violence and cruelty, right? That's the basic issue of can enable which has god says to Cain, you know, Tim Shell, you can do this. And then kids like, nope, I'm going call my brother. And that's it. And you see that down and it's an aspect of human nature. You teach these very simple stories to people, David versus Goliath, right? All of this can be the big guy right here, right there.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       There are plenty of great stories that, that embed fundamental values. Cause this is how you teach kids. Everybody teaches kids secular and religious. You teach kids stories. Like when I read in my daughter at night, I'm not reading her from, from Sam's book, she wouldn't understand it, right? Or I'm not going to read her enlightenment now or, or how the mind works by pinker like, Oh, you have to start with certain fundamental values that the fundamental values are generally rooted in story. This is where Jordan is totally correct and those are deeply embedded in the human psyche. And so there's an immediate resonance to a lot of the biblical stories, which is why the Bible has staying in selling power. Uh, and then you use those stories in coordination with reason to expand those stories outward and to develop. Right. But you have to always stay tethered.

Speaker 3:          01:10:55       I mean it's, you can lengthen the chain, but at a certain point the chain breaks and then then you're off and running and then you got a problem that the point that I'm making here is that I think the West has, has undercut its own allegiance to fundamental principle and they thought that this would allow the rise of reason to dominate and what it's instead allowed for is in the worst cases, some really horrible things. And in the best cases, yes, it continuation material prosperity, but also in a crisis of purpose and meaning that's happening to people where they're looking around, okay, okay, I'm a, I'm a ball of meat wandering through the universe, purposeless. I don't have free will. I don't have the capacity to, to control my own life. What am I supposed to do now? So I think basically what you're saying is you think it could work for awhile that Athens alone could work for a certain amount of, as long as it's living off the fumes of the Judaeo Christian ethic.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       And this is the point that I made to Sam when we debated in San Francisco was I said, Sam, why is it that we hold the same values? Because we do, we have on a fundamental level, we have basically the same value. So why? And he said, well, I've studied this and I've studied this. I've studied eastern philosophy. This is where I get my value. So that's great, but why are ours the same? Right? Because I haven't studied any of those things. So why are those the same? And I don't think it's because I've studied deeply in the Bible in Sam hasn't. I think it's because we both grew up on the fumes of this culture, right? I mean we grew up 10 miles from each other in Los Angeles. That seems to me a better kind of historical explanation of why we believe fundamentally the same things.

Speaker 3:          01:12:12       Then that he studied one philosophy and I studied another philosophy. So do you think we're in the fumes stage now? Yeah, I think the theme is running out. I think that Jerusalem, the Jerusalem fumes, and I think that as the Jerusalem fumes run out, so do the soda, the great hopes that were behind the reason based enlightenment. Meaning that one of the points that I make is that the, the enlightenment makes fundamental assumptions that are unsustainable on the grounds of the enlightenment, meaning the enlightenment argue the secular enlightenment and that non American Anglo Enlightenment makes the argument that basically we are Spinosa this stone where bald meet wandering through the universe. No, we'll have our own no free will. I mean Sam wrote an entire book about there not being free. Well, um, and that we don't have the capacity to choose. And when Sam talks about reason, as I asked him before, like, so according to evolutionary biology reason is just a beneficial firing of the neurons.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       But you make a moral argument in favor of reason. So my question is on what basis, what if there was a more evolutionarily beneficial firing of the neurons? Say genocide, genocide. This is Hitler's rationale. Effectively just apply Darwinism to the social sphere and we can effectively wipe out everybody who we don't like. And that will better humanity by getting rid of the weaklings and they can move on. I have also correct, Dan has had, Thanos is on board with this by the way. Dennis has an infinity songwriters and you just create more resources anyway. Um, if you met a genie with the first thing you wish for more wishes, but in any case, the, the fundamentals of the enlightenment, which are reason freewill, the capacity to make your own decisions are actually robbed by scientific materials. And if you're a scientific materialist, I don't know how you sustain the bay.

Speaker 3:          01:13:48       Like Sam says he believes in objective truth. I agree with Sam. There's objective truth. It's fascinating. Jordan doesn't believe in objective truth in the same way, right? Jordan believes in a sort of Charles Pierce, Charles Purse, um, pragmatism with regard to truth. That truth is whatever works. And so there's certain things that have been proved to work in those are true, which is attractively useful for evolutionary biology. Sam believes and objective truth. Like there's an truth out there to be discovered. There are things that are true and there are things that are false. I totally agree with him. You believe that, but not for the same. Well, I don't know. Well, as I asked him, I don't know what his reason is. Meaning Sam says that stuff, and I don't mean to rip on somebody, but I mean, I talk about all this in the book and I'm sure he can write a really cogent response cause he has a bright guy.

Speaker 3:          01:14:26       And I really like his stuff. I hate doing this when he's not here. Yeah, no, I know. You know, we should do it when Sam's here so we can discuss it, but it, but the, the fundamental point that I make is if you are going to argue in favor of reason, if you're gonna argue in favor of will, if you're going to argue in favor of all of these things, you need to make some fundamental assumptions that are simply not objective. Truth. W evolutionary biology doesn't speak to objective truth and speaks to what is useful to a species that allows it to survive and thrive. But it doesn't speak to what's true if the species didn't exist with two plus two equals four be true. Sam would say yes. And I would say, why? Because the species doesn't exist to use it. So what, what does that even mean? There's the Judeo Christian ethics and this is where Greek teleology in Judeo Christian ethics made, you know, the Greeks, Aristotle, Plato, they believed there was such a thing as an objective truth. They believed that there was such a thing as a universe that a cosmos that is understandable, they believed in the idea of free will, that you could make a difference in a cosmos

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       leaving in it, you would say is just not enough. Right, right. Just believing in the, in the rational mind is still not enough.

Speaker 3:          01:15:31       Right. And the, and when they do get as a type of belief, right. And I think that they attempt to, they, they attempt to prove back to, you know, the unmoved mover. And that's a good starting point. This is why Aquinas is so reliant on Aristotelian theology at the same thing is true for my monities. They both, uh, like the, the, the greatest, I think, attempt historically to merge the religious philosophy of Judeo Christianity and the, and the Greek philosophy of Aristotle and Plato is simultaneously done in the Islamic world and the Christian world and the Judaic world actually, uh, it's done by Alpha Robbie in the, in the Islamic world and it's done by my monities and the Judaic world. And it's done by, by Aquinas in the, in the Christian world. And it's an attempt to merge. But in the merger you, you sort of lose the tension that's necessary I think because when you completely merge than it, then you end up in the same place as the, as the theocrat, which is okay, so natural law and theology are exactly the same. So let's just follow the theology. My bottom bothering with this reasoning it out thing. There is no reason to do that. I think the tension exists for a reason.

Speaker 2:          01:16:29       So then getting us back. Then how do we get out of this thing, this, this polarization that we seem to be in? Which I do think, I think you got it right here is the tension between these two cities right now. So how do we break this? Because we're all sort of caught in it and I've also been thinking about something that we've talked about a bunch before that we're running out of communal spaces or communal events to have anything left to bring us together. Nobody really watches the nightly news anymore. We're after game of Thrones goes off after this. Yeah. We're basically out of time

Speaker 3:          01:16:59       and, and we're, and we're stuck with it and we're still with cultural events, not actual meaning based event.

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       Right. We don't have a go into the, we don't have a moon landing coming up. You know, we're really running short on,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       I mean July 4th parade are controversial.

Speaker 2:          01:17:12       Yeah. Now when you upgrade to it, yeah. You're parading genocide or something. I mean it's all nuns. It's, but as this tension ramps up, the fact that we're now have no spaces to let the vents off. That seems to me to be the biggest thing. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:17:27       I totally agree. And this is not just, you know, people in the right thing. There's people on the left are recognizing this and Robert Putnam's, a sociologist at Harvard, he writes with the scraper called bowling alone and in it he talks about the, the sort of meme diversity is our strength. And he says, yeah, I used to believe this. Diversity is our strength stuff. And then I looked at the social science and what I found is that as ethnic diversity in a place increases, the only two things that increase our protest marches and television watching. Unless unless there's a common purpose, there's a common purpose, then diversity is your strength. So in other words, if you go to a church and you'll get the church, a bunch of diverse faces, people have different experiences, but they're all there to have a common purpose, worship God and take care of each other.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       Then diversity is great. All the experiences, you can tell each other about it. You have the same goal. That's all fantastic. He said the same thing about the army. You go to the army and you see an incredibly diverse group of people. I mean, we know, we both know a lot of people who serve in the military and the, the amount of cross racial friendship in the military is amazing, right? For people who just grew up in a secular society and where it's like, yeah, I have my black friend and but that's not true in the military and the military and people legitimately bond across races because they're forced into proximity where they are like sports, nobody cares. Corrected sports is another great example, right? They have the same common goal. Well, so the question becomes for our society, what is our common goal? And it seems like that common goal is receding because some of the fundamental things I think that we are all supposed to agree on, right?

Speaker 3:          01:18:43       The free speech democracy, the use of freewill, the use of responsibility, even things as fundamental as that are dissipating in, in response to people saying, you know what? All this is a lie. The only way to attain power and protection for my group is returned to tribalism, which is intersectionality on the one hand and, and white supremacy on the other. Uh, or we are going to get rid of, of all of this stuff in the name of the collective because the individual no longer matters like the, I talk in the, in the book about this could a fourfold matrix for human happiness that we all exist as human beings on a couple of levels as members of uh, as individuals and then as members of community and we are all these things, right? I mean people will say the communist will say you're just a member of the community basically.

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       And then libertarians will say you're only in individual. And the truth is neither of those things. You are a member of a community and you're an individual and they are simultaneous and inextricable. And so you need to, so the human happiness in individual exists when you have the following, four things in, in a society can exist when you have the following four things, individual, individual purpose. So you get up in the morning, you're on a desert island, what do you do today or you nihilistic. Do you have something to do? What makes, what gives you meaning? Communal purpose meaning what can we all get together to do and what's our goal together as America? Are we here to spread liberty? Are we here to preserve liberty? Are we here to create economic equality? What is our goal as a community and how do we not quash individual purpose in that there has to be a balance, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       Cause if communal purpose is too strong, you quashed the individual and then there's individual capacity. You have to feel like you as a person are in control of your own life, capable of forging forth into the kind of adventure and wilderness which is the American mentality and you have to have a communal capacity, a system that allows me to, as an individual thrive while allowing us as a community to mobilize when need be. If you have these four things, then you can be a happy individual and you can be have a happy society. Now, the way I think this is the best balance in terms of government is that government is weak enough not to attack you as an individual, but is strong enough to mobilize when we really need to mobilize to protect those individual rights and to protect the, the system at large.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       That's, that's where I think the founders got it. Exactly right. It's why I think that I rely to a very heavy extent on the social fabric as opposed to the government to create a fake social fabric. I think the left relies on the government to create a sense of community. I don't feel a sense of community in government. I don't care about the people in government. I don't think they care about me. Uh, I think that the people who care about me or in my family and my community, I think the broader, the more broadly we share values, the more I care about people in the broader community. Um, but there's a sense on the left that the way that we created social fabric is by having a very powerful government. In 2012 was at the DNC when they flashed on the overhead screen that the government is the only thing that we all, the only the government is the only thing we all share.

Speaker 3:          01:21:25       And I thought to myself, well that's a big budget lash that on this. Yay. I was like 1984 right. It was very, it was, it was really late. I saw it. I was like, I can't believe that this is a thing that's up on the screen. The only thing we all share really like that's, that's where we were all participating together. Cause it seems to me that we all, we all share in a bunch of different things and the fewer things we engage in, the more we're going to need to rebuild that capacity from outside in. I don't like outside in.

Speaker 2:          01:21:47       So what do we do then about the nationwide or navy? It's not even nationwide. It's worldwide now. I mean the things that we're after this last year of being on tour, the same things that we're talking about here all the time within an American context or happening in virtually every western society at some level. So what do we do to rebuild some of those, those common public spaces? Like what? What is it we should be doing?

Speaker 3:          01:22:08       So I think that the help, so there, there are a couple things. One, the government really needs to stop tearing down religious institutions because historically speaking, religious institutions have been the bulwark of of the social networks that most people rely on. And we living in big cities don't tend to rely on it as much, but out in the sticks, people really rely on this stuff

Speaker 2:          01:22:26       push for, for my atheist viewers and my left is shores that may remain or the progressive's. Can you give them one more push on why they should fear that?

Speaker 3:          01:22:34       Okay. You shouldn't fear that because so long as there is not government compulsion from religious people in religious communities towards others, the fact that people are belonging to churches is a wonderful thing. They're supporting each other. They're giving charity do each other. They're there making sure that you don't have to pay for them. They're the ones who are making sure that there is a social fabric people can rely upon. You want less opioid overdoses. You want, you want less people who are unemployed and unemployable. You want less people who are following and falling into deaths of despair. They need a social fabric. You're not creating it and don't pretend y'all are. You're sitting in the city far away from these people and when you rip on their church, when you suggest that their church is the obstacle, you're taking away. The one connection to social fabric that people have.

Speaker 3:          01:23:09       Tim Carney has a new book called alienated America in which he looks at various communities when he finds is that it's not even an economic thing. People on the left and the right populous are like, well, we can fix all this with the economy economics. We just put some tariffs here but put some subsidies here. We grant universal basic income that's going to fill this gap for these people. The question is not lack of benefits, their unemployment benefits, and there's welfare and food stamps. There's plenty of benefits available for a lot of people. That's not the question. The question is where do you find connection with other human beings? And while you can sit in a place where you feel like you have connection, and especially if you're a college graduate, who's watching this show in a big city, you do have an Ersatz social connection.

Speaker 3:          01:23:43       I look at different kinds of their senses and write a different kind of social connection with people you went to college with and people you hang out with that doesn't exist in huge swaths of the country and the for the first place people go to get connection is their church. When those churches disappear, the communities die and then people there are left without even the motivation to move. So that's one thing that then secular. But again, this is not restricted to religious people like me in court saying this there. Robert Putnam is a secular guy. He says, you get rid of the church, you've got a real problem on your hands. There are plenty of sociologists who are looking at the death of churches and saying, what's going to fill this gap?

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       Well, I see it now. I mean, I don't come from that default position necessarily, but I do see it now. I mean, after being with Jordan on this, toward the, when he would talk about the importance of the stories, a religion, I could see people there. There's, it's not a coincidence that people could start thinking about these stories, the messages in these stories. And then suddenly there were thousands of people that I was meeting that were, they stopped doing drugs and they stopped drinking and right amends with their children. Or, I mean, every day I saw this, right?

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       This is it. Right? And this is, I can't be a coincidence. And this is the other element of, of that, that we really need to reinstall Kate. And that is that the smart people don't have all the solutions. But the one thing that you can do is solve your own problems. And this is, this is a mindset thing. So notice that everything that I'm saying has nothing to do with governmental compulsion. It's the opposite. I want the government out of everything because I don't think the compulsion is going to fix any of those. The the biggest thing that needs to change is people need to re embrace the spirit of adventure in their own lives. And this is something that I really believe that this is the thing that makes Jordan most popular, is that this is what Jordan says, life is a struggle. Life is chaotic.

Speaker 3:          01:25:19       Life is difficult. Go and forge forth in spite of those things. And this is what makes you a man, right? This is what makes you, uh, a woman. This is what makes you a person worthy of having freedom. I think that's true. I think it's fundamentally a religious message in nature and it's certainly an inspirational one. And we have a society where basically said to people, no, you know what? You've got a problem. I can solve it for you. The smart people will solve it for you. We'll solve it through. Ubi will solve it through tariffs, will solve it through, through going after China and Mexico. You never going to have to leave your hometown. It was, I had this conversation with Tucker Carlson and Tucker's really interesting dude, and we were talking about specifically his sort of anti-tech takes. So He's, he's very concerned about self driving trucks, destroying millions of jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:25:59       I'm a little bit more sanguine about that. I don't think it's going to happen overnight. I think that you need drivers behind the wheels. But in any case he was, there's one point during the conversation where Tucker said something to the effect of, yeah, so you're going to say to a bunch of people who are living in the town where their grandparents are buried that they need to pick up and move. And what I'm saying is they should be able to stay there and have jobs. And I said, right, like this is the, you said you, you want them to leave the town where their, where their parents are and where their grandparents died. And I said, right, or biblically speaking, leave the land of your fathers and go to a land that you know, not right. I mean, this is the spirit of the individual forging.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       Fourth is what made the country fantastic. One statistic that is just utterly astonishing is that in an era where we have this rising underclass of folks who have sort of been left behind, we have less mobility in the United States than any time in modern American history. People are leaving home less often than they didn't. People are saying, well, it's because they're living with their parents. Fine. Why aren't they moving where the jobs are? I mean, this was literally what every one of our parents did, right? I mean, I don't know where your parents grew up. My parents grew up in Chicago and they moved to Boston and they moved to La, Brooklyn. Right, exactly. Like everyone in California's original story was that no one was born in California. Right? Like very like I was born in La. I'm one of the only people I knew who was born in La, right? This is, and that, that sort of movement, this, this hunger to go out there and adventure and take control of your own life. That needs to be reincarnated and that comes, we have to try it against.

Speaker 2:          01:27:23       Did you move him on that at all? Because I know that I'm on Tucker tonight. Yay. I went on all the time and I have these discussions with him and um, uh, did you move him on that?

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       I'm not sure. I,

Speaker 2:          01:27:33       I don't really think so. Right. I mean, this is the fact that you don't care about your feelings. Think what he's saying there. It does feel right. Like if your whole family, if your family lived in a town mining town for 100 years, it doesn't feel right. I mean, this is what I would say about the baker and the, and the gay wedding cake. It's like, it doesn't feel right that you can't get the kid there, but that doesn't mean that the government should fix the problem or can fix it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:55       Right. And this is, and again, I think that there's a mentality shift that's happened. I think it's true of immigration too. I think it has real policy ramifications. This idea that you were born in America, therefore you're owed a bunch of stuff. And I just don't think that that's, frankly, I don't think it's a good perspective. I think on a religious level to not a religious perspective, and my perspective is that you're effectively owed nothing, right? You're old, you're owed the adventure, you're owed the freedom to be able to do what it is that you want to do. And then the reason you need the social fabric is to help the people who can't do it without the the hand up. And it's funny you talk to people who live in religious communities and because they've had the social fabric, they instinctively feel like the government has filled a lot of the social fabric in a lot of big cities.

Speaker 3:          01:28:33       But you talk to people who live in religious communities and everyone has a story that's like this where it's like there was somebody in the community who's struggling. So the rabbi got together a bunch of people and they give them some money and like I knew where the money came from and he went out and he made a plan and he fixed it. And, and that was the way that things got fixed. Now is that going to fill every single gap? No. I mean you do need local government. Sometimes to fill these gaps. Local is better than national because you have more sympathy with people who live close to you and you see the impact of the problem where you live. But the, the idea you need a social fabric,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       it, it's why I don't consider myself libertarian even though I'm libertarian on social, on government policy. Because I think the mistake that some libertarians make is to suggest that libertarianism applies on a social level to limited government in and of itself is enough to keep everything going. Right. And I don't think that's, I don't think that's correct. I mean I think that rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. And as Washington suggested that, you know, you need a moral people to sustain liberty. So this is a bit of a non sequitur sort of. Well maybe not. Um, so do you think this is why the left is going so bananas with the Jews at the moment that there's some connection there because Jews did get up and when, I mean, when you want me to slugging that conversation, we're talking, I was thinking that's the end of the fiddler on the roof.

Speaker 4:          01:29:47       Right? They don't want to leave when a buy to a Lazar Wolf. They don't want to leave. I'm going to Chicago. You're going wherever. But it's like we have to go now. We have to forge something new. And Jews have kind of been doing that forever. And that is the antithesis of what the left is offering now. So I think there is truth to that and I don't think it's restricted to Jews. I think that you've seen the intersectional hierarchy changed radically based on which minority groups are perceived to be more successful. So what you see is the, is the left suggesting that Asians are no longer minorities in the United States can't get into heart rate. You can't get into Harvard. You're not, you're not truly on the intersectional scale because you're, and now they're doing it with gay folks. Right. Gave Asians everything when they came here.

Speaker 4:          01:30:26       Exactly. The Asians and Indians just get everything. They were just, you know, work in these hard jobs and, and wrote a little hot dog stands at seven 11 it's just because that was, you know why not. Exactly. Exactly. And then you worked hard and you see this as happening on the fringe left already with, with gay folks. Right. So the idea that you saw that article at slate where they did this with boot with Buddha judge, where they were like, well it's intersectional enough cause he grew up white and he grew up privileged and he went to good schools. But also he's gay. So he's a little intersection. He's not like intersectional to suppress [inaudible] rectus accounts as a gay guy. Legitimately. Did he come in as a gay guy? I think was, that was sort of the headline was like he's not fully like, I don't understand.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       Well he's married to a man. So last I checked. Yeah. I mean like, well first of all, I'm not even sure what they're going for their, except for he doesn't rate high enough on the, in the, uh, oppression scale. Well, the craziest one of those that I ever saw was a couple of years ago, I think it was, it was either out magazine or advocate. I can't remember which one, when they said that Peter Teal is no longer gay because his politics don't line up with gate. So what would really make you gay? The physical part? No, no, that doesn't fact. It doesn't matter. What matters is how we feel. And you're going to have, by the way, they'll come after Camilla Harris on the same grounds. Her, her born parents is Jamaican. One parent is Indian. I mean, that's, that's not traditional. Grew up in the inner city. I mean, her, her dad, I think it was a professor at Stanford or something like they'll, they'll come for, for anybody who doesn't like, we'll, we'll pretend intersectionality applies until it no longer apply. Does that make you very hopeful then? Because I think we're seeing minority groups crack. We're seeing Asians go, whoa, whoa, Whoa, we don't want to be on the reverse side of Jews are finally

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       going, wait, we don't have to vote 80% democrat black people. I mean, just the fact that now reparations is becoming, uh, virtually every Democratic candidates are talking about reparations to me, regardless. I know you have a little bit of a love hate thing with Canada's Owens, but it's like she did. And just like Hannah said, no, no, no, no. I don't need this. Like, but I mean, you guys, you guys go at it and that, that's fine. Uh, I think more, it's like, I just sit here and sometimes she doesn't baby. I was with them. They were a couple of days ago. She likes you. I meant more that you don't, you just don't agree on everything. That's correct. Yeah. Point being, when I see all these Democrats suddenly going, oh, we should have a commission to figure out reparations. It's like, Whoa, they, Candice really must've done something here within the black community because now all they're going is all we got left is cash.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       Well, I think that they're, you know, I, I hope that that's true. You know, I, I don't know the data bear it out, but I certainly hope that there is that cracking that that is taking place. But the left has a couple of very powerful forces in one of them is as we discussed, the attempt to make it uncomfortable, to have different thoughts or to engage with people who have different thoughts that you are no longer welcome in the circle of the, of the woke. If you have a conversation with somebody on theirs, I mean legitimately have a conversation or watch a video. I mean there was a story that was out of anything was Michigan state two weeks ago where a student at Michigan State College fix reported. This was watching one of my videos on youtube and the roommate made and it made a rights violation complaint to the administration at Michigan State for the student watching my video.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       And the administration was like, fine, we'll move you. I mean like, yeah, like W it's come to the point where if you mentioned names like people who legitimately don't know anything about you don't know anything about cannabis, don't know anything about me. You don't know anything about Jordan. They'll make claims about people they legitimately cannot back up cause they never engaged with their content. But the very fact that they haven't engaged with the content, is there a credibility on speaking on the content? Because if they ever engaged on the content, then they wouldn't believe all these things but they don't engage and therefore they are good. Lack of engagement is good. Right? It's not that you engaged in, now you're better because you've had a better conversation if you didn't engage or better. So those are the, the in, that's the countervailing intimidation factor that's, that's taking place in that I think is still quite powerful.

Speaker 3:          01:34:10       It's why every single democratic hands in it. I mean it really is incredibly powerful. Every single democratic candidate effectively skipped Apac this year. Yeah. Because Ilhan Omar has impact and because folks on the end, because folks on the hard left hate Israel and, and that has impact and then they all showed up for Al Sharpton who's legitimately one of the worst people in modern American politics, like in modern American history speed or he, he ran a Jessie Smollett a hoax and accused and actual human being of committing a rape against a black girl who was not raped. He accused even Ponas of raping a black girl and then scrawling racial slurs on her body in shit. And he is, it was not, it was all false. Yeah. And he, he was, he called Jews, diamond merchants. He, he suggested white interloper is we're taking over Freddy's fashion Martin there and then somebody wouldn't burn

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       down the place. Like he's the worst guy I'll sharpen. And every Democrat showed up at the national action network because to be welcome means to be in the club like we don't, here's the thing about those of us in the Idw, people think that we have a club. It's not a club, it's just people who like to talk about things and anybody is welcome to the club, which is why you see like these weird videos where people who we've never talked to her had conversations with our suddenly quote unquote members of the IDW. Like we talk with each other and there's like a core group. I think of us who every so often like really every so often go out and get drinks or have dinner. But that's like, that's not a, that's not the same thing as this. You're unwelcome in the club if you don't, if you don't do acts, like that's, that's not a weird thing that if the, if this way, if the Idw, let's say whatever it is at the moment, you're right.

Speaker 4:          01:35:38       It's not a co, we're not walking around with a card. We don't have a clubhouse. But like if this collection, and then of course it's way wider than just us, but if this middle collection, which seemingly, it's pretty small and it's kind of getting smaller because it's, it's just getting tougher to have centrist opinions. Right. And also this thing doesn't hold. Yeah. I mean that's right after and when you can see and you can see out viciously left is trying to carve it apart by, what they'll do is they'll come after me and then they'll ask you for comment or they'll come after Sam and then they'll ask me for comment or they'll come after Jordan and they'll go after it. But that's why I think it's important. I know, you know, people attack me. Oh he's always, he's always shitting on the left. But it's like this is the perfect example of what's going on here on the right.

Speaker 4:          01:36:16       Does anyone on the right relentlessly, viciously and dishonestly attack the Weinstein brothers or, or, or, or Sam even or anyone that's on the left. They don't, I mean they agree to disagree. If you read that really is as simple as that. I mean it's amazing. If you read the comments on the, I take Yang as an example cause it just happened. But if you read the comments on the Sunday special that I did with Yang, there is nothing like, legitimately, I never read the comments, but I was curious. There is nothing but appreciation that Yang would even come on the show. That's the entire thing. It's like, oh look, a cordial conversation between people who disagree. That's so nice. Like how pathetic is it that that is considered like the big win here? There was, there wasn't a single comment about like, Oh Shapiro destroyed gang there cause that wasn't the purpose of it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       Everybody got what it was supposed to be. It's a conversation and that's great. Did he move you on anything like a UBI situation? Let me, I'd read this book. I had read his book and I, and I didn't find it utterly convincing on a ubi. I think that as I've said before, when it comes to ubi, if we reached the point of absolute crisis where nothing else like it, let's put it this way, ubi as a negative income tax in lieu of all of the welfare systems we currently have, I would sign onto it in a heartbeat, right? The idea of we get rid of, we get rid of real repeal and replace, right? If your appeal, all the welfare programs and you replace it with a single check that is signed then, but I think the promises of Upr a little bit too big for his Britches.

Speaker 4:          01:37:31       So people are saying, well it'll solve the opioid epidemic or it'll solve the, as I say in the book, I think it's a crisis of meaning not a crisis of money. And so I don't think that's going to solve it. Uh, if the idea is that people are going to be liberated, as Andrew says in his book to go and do art and volunteering and charity, I don't see any evidence of that. The part, I don't write that, that's the part where I was like, um, no, even even if you could get me on the robots are replacing all our regular job. So let's say you could get me on that. And the other part is just that it takes away something about fundamental human nature about what you're talking about before about the individual going out there and getting theirs. Right. You would just end up having this class of people that would be given just enough.

Speaker 4:          01:38:08       I mean I have a new welfare. Right, right, exactly. And when he said was, well, it's not enough to actually live on, it's just enough to actually supplement and what I said, so what's the limiting principle? Like is it just the 1000 or is it politician going gonna come around next week and say it to be 3000 and then you hit, what did he say that, cause I haven't, he didn't, he didn't really, I don't even really firmly addressed it because that's the key question, right? It's like, well, okay, we can also in bucks and we're good at, correct. Literally the next week there will be somebody who says 1,001 bucks [inaudible] gonna say about the lefties who won a thousand, they'll call them racist or, that's exactly right. No, I mean there are some problems and implementation of, of Ubi that exists with the welfare state. Also, a lot of the studies that suggest that there's the same level of employment, those are temporary ubi attempts.

Speaker 4:          01:38:51       Right. If they were a permanent ubi, uh, I think that you would see a decline in employment. But also, as I said to him, there's a conflict between what ubi says it's trying to do and what it actually would do. So I think it would do the same thing as the welfare state. And that's why I say like as a replacement for the welfare state, I'm kind of warm to it, but it's like, let's give it a shot. Basically saying that's failing, let's, right. And also because I'd rather have the government sign and understandable check rather than you have to go through it. You have to de de incentivize work or deincentivize fatherhood, or do you know all of these incentive based structures? I'm not a fan and they've been rather ineffective, but it, but as a general principle, the idea that it's going to solve the work of crisis, what he talks about in his book is the crisis of people who don't have jobs and that crisis is the not having of the job, not merely the not having of the money, signing people up, check in lieu of a job.

Speaker 4:          01:39:38       It doesn't actually, like he points out in the book, number of people on disabilities been rising dramatically. Right? They're all getting a check and are they happy? Are they spending their time volunteering? Are they spending their time down at the local waystation helping people or are they, you know, will taken drugs. It all sounds good. Medicare for all it sounds good. We will have the same thing that we know that that's not going to be the case because of course, well now they're talking about getting rid of private insurance, which is insane. I mean that's fully what they have to do it because otherwise doctors just will not accept Medicare reimbursement rights. I mean, that's the reality. Again, you know, as somebody who works closely with people in the medical industry and in fact sleeps with a person in the medical industry, you know that, you know, the, the idea that doctors are going to just accept 60% on the dollar of what they're making right now is absolute sheer nonsense.

Speaker 4:          01:40:23       But also it's such a disconnect of what, of what I think they view. I mean, I get it that they think government is something that I don't think it should be, but it's like, what right. Would the government have to tell a doctor he can't be in the private business that he wants to be in. Right. And they actually think that's okay. I mean quite literally Tamala and I think uh, Cory booker and nothing and said they think it's good private insurance. I mean this is another, this is another thing that I asked Yang about cause he said he was from Medicare for all and there's a section in his book where he says, so how are we going to deal with the fact that doctors are going to just stop going to medical school? Cause that's a real thing that will happen. I mean already

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       if you want to see how perverse incentives work in the medical industry, look how many people come out of medical school and going into what are called the road. And the the, the road fields is radiology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology and dermatology. Why? Those are the least regulated fields. There's the least Medicare there. Nobody's taking reimbursement rates. Those are all areas where people basically show up with an insurance company or cash in hand. Yup. That's where everybody's going. It's where all the money is. So that's how per first incentives work. He says in the book, what we're going to have to convince doctors that basically they need to rethink about what the lifestyle of a doctor is going to be. That they're not going to live high on the hog anymore, that they're going to, you know, be putting out more for the public service. And I've had, well you can do that, but it's not gonna be the same people.

Speaker 3:          01:41:32       Do you think they how to do that? No, I mean he, he sort of says that we should, that we should just, people will, will have to be informed that the incentive structure is different. And here's the thing, if you have a different incentive structure, you are going to get a different thing. My wife would not have gone to medical school if you were assured of comp for 11 years, if you were assured of coming out making $65,000 or $100,000, right? The, the reality is that you wanted a certain lifestyle. It's why she went to medical school. You change those incentives. You think all these guys were going into, the surgeons are going to spend years on end doing this so that they can then work for years on end working for Medicare. Does that sound the awesome to anyone like this is the reason that smart people become doctors is because smart people would like to make money and be paid for their work. This is why smart we'd like, yes, there is a self sacrificial component to all of this. It's there easier ways to make money than being a doctor. But to eliminate the money factor is to eliminate half the reason that people become doctors in the first place. You want a lot more people called a lawyers in Mckinsey associates. This is the way to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       I have a good friend. What pro two or three best friends from childhood since second grade who was like my chief sparring political partner, our our whole lives. Uh, and he's now become a huge Trump supporter. And why? Because he was a doctor, went to medical school, raised all the debt, realize he could never live in New York where he grew up. He's now in Texas and he's often doing things that have not to make money now because it's so hard. And then he became a Trump supporter because of Obamacare, because he was crushed with paperwork and bureaucracy and nonsense and now to make money because it's so much harder than just doing the procedures. He's basically doing like, like medical real estate things. Yeah, and it just shows you how the whole system I, but that's just one guy, but it's like, yeah, the whole system is out of

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       factors are going into concierge care specifically because of this. Yeah, I mean they're very full apps that exist where you're paying like 99 bucks a month and then a doctor will show up at your door. Like there's so many ways that we could make medical care so many online should be such an asset for medical care. Right? We should, there's so many weeds. Getting rid of licensing requirements, as I suggested it would be a great thing. Like there, there are things that we can actively do to do this and the truth is for healthy people and for people who have private healthcare insurance. There really isn't a problem. Like we like to talk about how it's too expensive. Why do you think we have millions and millions of jobs in the healthcare industry? Like what do they think happens when they nationalized this thing? All those jobs just transfer over to government or are a lot of those jobs lost because those people don't work for anybody anymore?

Speaker 3:          01:43:50       Why is it that the people ignore the upsides of Robo? Do they think? Does anyone answer that question? What are you going to do with all those people and not the private? No, they can all be hired by the government to do nothing. Right? And then do they, and nobody seems to understand that the, the reason that the majority of new drugs and procedures are discovered in the United States is because we are paying those outsides prices. So when Trump says that we are paying for everybody else, that is true, we are paying for everybody else. But if we stopped paying for everybody else, they just will stop producing those drugs here because why else would they produce the drugs here? Like this is, our system is not good. But to pretend that our system is like the worst system on planet earth or the people are dying.

Speaker 3:          01:44:27       I mean quick statistic then nobody likes to site. But it's true if you get rid of, of shooting of homicides and car accident death where people die. Like at the scene from the American death rates, America is the number one life expectancy in the industrialized world. Those are not medical issues. Those are issues of people shooting each other and people get in car wrecks a lot here in the United States. So you know, that's as far as I spending per capita, like insane amounts of money. Can we spend more than other countries? It is relatively in line with the OACD income. So for, for on a per capita income basis, we spend a lot of money. We also make a lot of money here in the United States and the medical industry here is a huge part of the American economy. All of Pittsburgh is basically the medical industry now as opposed to the steel industry.

Speaker 3:          01:45:07       And that is a very good thing for Pittsburgh. So the answer to a lot of this is deregulation. Not reregulation, but again, those are conversations I think that can be had, but I think that people are not being realistic about what they expect from the system. And they're not realistic about the downsides of, of systems that are, that are completely nationalized. I mean, in my opinion, if you're actually gonna get the government's equally involved, we've got to have a Swiss system where basically people are paying a percentage of their salary into private insurance and then they are, and then they are expected to do that, right? Like the individual mandate, if you're gonna get the government involved is not the world's worst idea. It's just that it's now stacked with enormous amounts of regulation, uh, and inefficiency and bureaucratic and efficiency and that. But I think again, that a free market is better than any of that stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:45:50       But I also think that you ought to take responsibility if you are on it. If you don't buy insurance and then you get hit by a car, I'm sorry that that would be a you problem. Like th th th that's why we need a social fabric where I care about you. But on a governmental level, this idea that you're not going to increase the rates of use with government care is just a lie. People are going to pay for those people no matter what, right? I mean, right. It's against the turn them around, right? It's, you are going to pay for it. Right. But it getting, getting hit by the car is usually not the real issue. Usually the real issue is how do you pay for the person who didn't buy health insurance for years and then gets, uh, it gets hard condition that requires, you know, here's lawn care. Like the person who was in the yard is going to get paid for that. We all end up paying for it with an elevated insurance rates and all the rest of it. But um, yeah, the, the problem of the chronically unhealthy, which is a very small percentage of the population, but the most expensive percentage, that is not really a rationale for overturning healthcare that 90% of people seem to enjoy. Like it also is gonna make you hate people for

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       no reason. You're going to go to in and out or Mcdonald's and see a table of four obese people stuffing their faces, drinking hi from social and Syrup and everything else, and you're going to go, wait a minute. These people are all, they're living [inaudible] there. This is horrible. I mean, this goes to the community. It's no one wants to look at that and think, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:47:08       well this is, this is, this is why, you know, I've said people who try to compare, for example, the Nordics, the Nordic health care model, to the US health care model. You're not comparing equivalent populations. People eat healthy things in Norway. People in the United States eating nothing but crap all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       I was just in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark. These people look good. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:47:25       right. I mean, this is, it's a, it's a much healthier population and this is why, if you actually want to compare the efficacy of healthcare systems, you don't look at the generalized population of the United States and the generalized population of Norway, certainly tiny country with 5 million people. I mean the La County is 11 million people or something. Right? Well, what you do is you compare people who are Norwegian in America to people who are Norwegian in Norway, and what you find is that people in who are Norwegian and America outperform on nearly every aspect. People who are Norwegian in Norway, then you're comparing apples to apples. Like we compare apples to oranges and then we're like, well, why doesn't this work over here? Because they're not the same thing. That's why it doesn't work over here.

Speaker 2:          01:48:00       All right, Shapiro, let's go dystopian. You're ready? Okay. Let's say everything that you've written about here, everything that we're trying to do, all these conversations, we will having it all, it all just explodes. It does not work. We, the ideas that we're fighting for fail in the face of postmodernism of what's being taught at this college is of what the media is throwing at everybody and we get more and more of these people in government and all of these things. I think about this sometimes that what will happen to the outlier people like us in the future. Do you ever, do you ever think about that? But I think that right now, for example, for all these people that think Trump is Hitler and all this stuff, Trump tweets anything and then a hundred blue check journalists talent to go fuck himself and you're going to be in jail and a zillion things and Trump does nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:48:41       That's not even a defensive anything. Trump says that's just reality, but now let's do it the other way. Imagine now we've got one of these far lefties. Yeah. Bernie's Bernie friends who believe that government is the end all be all to everything and now the outliers who have all been called Nazis. All right. The Ben Shapiro's and everybody else that had been called the worst things that, well now, now government and tech is against us and now we're doing the same exact things that the left these up today are doing. Yeah. How do you think that's going to go?

Speaker 4:          01:49:11       Well, I mean this is why at daily wire, and I know you've been looking into this to alternative means of distribution or the entire ballgame. I mean that, that we understand that when it comes to the left, you cannot live on their large ass and like forgot taking the beginning of the year. They came after me and tried to boycott me over making most anidine point on abortion I think I've ever made in my life. Right. They, they, they tried to, they legitimately tried to knock my sponsor's off my show. Yeah. For suggesting that pro lifers don't want to kill any baby no matter what that baby would turn on to be because we don't believe that you can kill babies for any rationale based on a minority report reasoning, and I mentioned baby Hitler in this context because they'd been a thought experiment that was by people up to an including

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       Tom Hanks or legitimately years and they tried to boycott my show based on that. I mean it was insane the, so we're not focusing on living on large ass of the left when it comes to this sort of stuff. We're building a subscription system at daily wire. This is why we encourage people to subscribe because then you can get our content no matter what you do. Cause we, it's all vertically integrated. I know that you're looking at stuff like that as well. Um, you know, on, on a tech level we're building alternatives and that's what we ought to be doing. A, on a generalized level, I think what we're watching and it's really pretty sad, is that people like us are going to end up in places with people who agree with people like us. Meaning that I live in a Jewish community where I'm pretty popular because it's an orthodox community. I'm more,

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       I went to lunch with you at a kosher place and if I had to take one more picture of you, I was gonna.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       Yeah, exactly. I mean that's, that's the, those are my folks, but I've spent my entire life living in Los Angeles, a place where the vast majority people disagree with me or in Cambridge where everyone disagrees with me. And that's, and I like that. I think it's nice. I think like I think it's good that there are conversations happening across the aisle as the left seeks to basically censor or destroy anyone who even engages in those conversations where Joe Rogan becomes an outright, cause he has a conversation with me because I once had a conversation with you and you once had a conversation with Alex Jones, right? Like this is the way that it works.

Speaker 2:          01:51:00       Clearly we've all pushed people to the next,

Speaker 3:          01:51:04       right? I mean, but the, the, and this is, and so once that happens, all it's going to happen is it's going to make places like this on livable for people like us. And I mean even people who just want to have conversations and then you do end up with a real gap in the country that is almost unbridgeable where it's like everyone agrees in one place and nobody agrees in another place. And that's where the, if the, that's why honestly, the checks and balances system is so vital. We mentioned before because of people in Texas feel like they're running being run roughshod over by people in California and the national government or the other way around. That's not going to last. That's not, that's not sustainable.

Speaker 2:          01:51:35       Right? So that's why it's like I don't really, I like doing this as a thought experiment more than like what could potentially happen. But it seems to me that if we have been no code spaces that we were talking about before and we all do have to get siphoned off into our own thing just because that's the way the tech landscape is going to work. That it's like, yeah, we got the checks and balances in our system is, is pretty damn good. I would say probably, I would say it's the best man made thing set of ideas probably in the history of, of all time. Um, but how can it survive in an information war? You know what I mean? How can it survive in a time when for all we know, the next w whoever runs for president isn't going to accept the results of the election. Stacey Abrams still not accepting the results. Like they're, they're underminded, they claim Trump wasn't going to accept the results of the election and now it's like that's what they're doing. They're trying to undermine everything. And if we don't have enough coast spaces to work it out, this is is why

Speaker 3:          01:52:28       we have a very short window right now to pour resources into grabbing as many eyeballs as possible and ensuring that as many people see countervailing material as possible because you just don't know when that window is going to slam shot. Yeah. I mean that really was, you have to grab as many people as possible and let them know that there are alternative places where they can get your stuff. Because you know, here's what I'm concerned about mostly when I'm concerned about is that you're going to see a move by Democrats in Congress and from the presidency to do exactly what Mark Zuckerberg wants. Right. Where are the FCC is suddenly regulating speech on Facebook and to relieve the obligations of Facebook to do it themselves and suddenly if you are labeled, not outright, but outright adjacent. Yeah. Based on the fact that you want to interview the person who wants, interviewed a person who wants stood next to a person who was once wearing a shirt, then you know, then you're screwed. So that, that, that's where I, I don't think that the, the, this is why, you know, you and I make the same distinction. I've made a distinction for years and years between the Liberals and the left. If the left continues to conquer the liberals, I think that it's gonna be a rough time ahead and we better have these alternative methods of distribution are we're screwed at that point.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       All right, so let's finish with this then. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       when I was on canvas and show a week or two ago, I said to her, you know, I see something, it's so obvious to me that if you care about ideas, if you want to live in a tolerant, pluralistic society, all of those things, it's very obvious. The center, right basically is where is where that's at. It, it just is. Do you think there is room for Pete for the center writes a conservatives tab a little more openness when it comes to like, you know, we've had the abortion discussion tied to I'm, I mean I'm really struggling with it and the further that the left goes on, eight month abortions and and all of that and post life abortions and cool post life abortion, then this crazy stuff. It's making my position incredibly difficult and I think a lot of, I think a lot of decent liberals are struggling with this. How, what do you think the right should do? If you guys want to be a little more opening, a little more welcoming, let's say for people that are, or seeing where tolerance actually lives right now, what do you think you can do on, on issues like that? Cause I'm not saying that the right has to be told, the only choice partier or a pro choice set of ideas or anything like that. But what, what do you think is, is your job?

Speaker 3:          01:54:41       Well, I mean one of the, that is one, maybe the only issue that I can think of where the right generally and I think correctly believes in government compulsion, meaning that the, the basic thesis of the right is that when a life is threatened than the government has a right to step in. And this is a life that is threatened, the government has rights to step in. And so this I'm not sure as a bridgeable gap, what I mean by that is that the, the right can continue to make the case, uh, the right to continue to make the case. I'm going to case I agree with. Um, but I, I can't, I'm not libertarian on this issue because I don't think it's a libertarian issue. So here there's a national

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       seen that the right has to modify its position. I actually don't mean that. What I mean is just that for the things that might be the differences if you were, if you were just looking to collect x lefties right now, right. But here's the toddler group like w how do you welcome,

Speaker 3:          01:55:24       well, I mean here's, here's where I was

Speaker 2:          01:55:26       cause I think they're afraid. I think that I think most of them have PTSD. I realize this is what I really did.

Speaker 3:          01:55:30       I mean the, the first place to start is why don't we start with the stuff where we agree because the truth is that the checks and balances of the system, just on a practical level, the checks and balances of the system are not going to allow for full protection of life anytime soon.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       The, the sort of attempts that have been made on the right to move in a more pro life direction have been incremental at best. And so if it, listen, if that's the issue that's going to, you know, bar you from joining the right than the CSU should, it's going to borrow from joining the writers. Not much I can do about that. But you know, we're w I'm happy to welcome anybody to the conversation and you don't have to agree with me on abortion to be part of the conversation. Like, I, we, you and I don't agree on this and we, we have this conversation on a pretty routine basis. I do it all the time. So, you know, I, I don't think that there's in it, as I say, there are certain issues where the right is not going to move. And frankly I don't think the right should move.

Speaker 4:          01:56:20       This is one of those the only issues. Um, but can I make a bold prediction? Sure. 30 years from now we're going to be sitting here doing this, hopefully in that bigger girl in Texas probably may well have moved me on the, uh, on the abortion issue and I think I may have moved you oncoming to an anniversary party. W what do you think about that? I think there's possibility. I mean, I, I'd have to, I'd have to think about that again. The, the issue as you know, you know, not to get back. Well Trod territory. Uh, you know, I think it would be unlikely that you'd moved me, but I, I can never rule out the possibility being moved on anything. Obviously. Um, and again, this is, this comes back down to, you know, the difference between approving of activity and approving of, of human beings.

Speaker 4:          01:57:08       And they, yeah, I wouldn't, if you invited me to a party on Friday night, I also wouldn't go right. I mean like definitely not a Shabbat. A I Shabaka anniversary I think probably is. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Sunday afternoon, a Sunday afternoon gayish anniversary. Like, or, or maybe just, it's not about, you sound like a fricking barbecue dude. Like does everything have to be going with the party's not going to be gay. It's just, yeah, we'll have a barbecue. Okay. Just be gay is going to happen there when I wasn't where he was going to turn into an orgy back there or something like that. So I wasn't worried you're going to bring out the village people or something like that. We'll have parties just to say, well wait, why, what does that, that's crazy. Yeah, no, I was, I was pretty well aware of that, in fact.

Speaker 4:          01:57:47       And in fact, as I've said a thousand times, you happy to go out to dinner? My wife, your husband, happy to go out to dinner and do any of that stuff. As long as it's not like, you know, Rah Rah, here's the thing you think is in full, join me in celebrating it. But again, that appeals, that applies to a wide variety of settings that it, I mean, listen, it's harder on it. It's harder on members of my family than anybody else. Like I've said before, I wouldn't attended intermarriage Ratika jewelries and Andrea, I want to tend intermarriage. Yeah. So this is exactly the same issue. Shapiro, they're giving me the signal that you [inaudible] out. I feel like we just had a radio show doing like five minutes. Yeah, exactly. All right. That's Ben Shapiro daily wire at Ben Shapiro on Twitter. The book is the right side of history. Is it number one on Amazon right now? Uh, well it was, it was number one on the New York Times list in his first week. Nice. And so we knocked off Michelle Obama for all week and then she took revenge and, and knock us back to number three. But, but for a week, for a week. That's the battle of the left and the right. That's data right there. All right. That's it. Thanks everybody.
