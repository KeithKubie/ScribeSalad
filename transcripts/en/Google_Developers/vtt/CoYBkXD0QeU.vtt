00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.010
&gt;&gt; So for both of you two, thanks for coming
by. So you guys have built a really cool application

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.670
[INDISTINCT] with technology. First, could
you introduce yourselves a bit, tell us a

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.519
bit about your organization, what you have
been building.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.660
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Sure. I'm Steve Soliven; I manage
a web team for Intercontinental Hotels Group.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.080
And...
&gt;&gt; STUCKER: I'm Bob Stucker, I was part of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.599
the newly rebranded ine.com website that we're
here that uses GWT.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.780
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool. So what did you guys build?
What did you do exactly in your product?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.659
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: So most of the website is built
with GWT. Everything, but the header is all

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.449
AJAX and entire GWT application.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, cool.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.540
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: All the way from the home page
through confirmation.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.440
&gt;&gt; So as you guys decided on which toolkit,
which technology to use to build your application,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.790
how did you guys arrive to settling with GWT?
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: It really was on past experience

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.980
and the difficulty of dealing with JavaScript
and maintaining JavaScripts through other

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.050
websites that we have maintained. It just
became obvious that there needed to be a better

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:32.560
structure and better framework for JavaScript.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So some of the features that you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.000
had used, GWT 1.5 for example, you know, it
was quite a few years [INDISTINCT] from 1.4

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.320
to 1.5 in Java. Today, in I/O, we talk a little
of which I/O features, there's a lot of cool

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.720
stuff coming there. What do you guys most
excited about in using in your own application?

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.070
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: You want that one?
&gt;&gt; STUCKER: Well, the biggest ones I think

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.580
for us is the run async, which is lazy loading
parts of our application, primarily because

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.880
at the moment our home page, performance wise,
we'd like to step it up a bit and we'd like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.989
for us to be able to divide our applications
some more so that we can have that first load

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.890
be really fast and load the rest of our application,
you know, momentarily as the user is interacting

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.840
with the first page. So that's one of the
main things.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.280
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: That's my big one too. I've been
thinking about that one all day.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.890
&gt;&gt; For an async?
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Yeah.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, there are other cool
things like client window, image window, I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.213
don't know if you guys were to have one, but
image window [INDISTINCT] client, assuming

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.650
that, they have a lot more function than the
other stuff.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.650
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Right.
&gt;&gt; They got a lot of new stuff that they're

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.790
doing.
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Yeah.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.870
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: I think we're really benefiting

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.730
from the fact that Wave was built using GWT.
So a lot of focus was put on performance,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.890
and now we get to benefit from that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.756
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; STUCKER: That's a good endorsement for

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.870
our effort with the GWT, somewhere in that
direction.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah. In fact, for a [INDISTINCT] feature
that's going to be in GWT 2.0 which is still

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.599
not released yet; it will be released in maybe
Q3 or later. But the [INDISTINCT], you can

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.880
already get that and Wave was built using
that.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.030
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: We're going to do that as soon
as we get back.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.540
&gt;&gt; Yup, cool. And, finally, for other developers
who are building some other types of applications,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.430
some other types, would you recommend them
to use GWT or, you know, when would you say

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.950
that it's a good time to use it.
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: I would say if you're a Java development

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.379
shop, it definitely makes sense. You have
the right skill sets, the benefits you get

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.980
from using a Java IDE. Would you add anything
to that?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:43.430
&gt;&gt; STUCKER: Yeah, I mean, GWT does provide
a new paradigm in terms of client-side application

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.580
development. So there's a certain learning
curve. And like Steve said, if you're, if

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.810
you're good with Java, then, you know, you're
good with GWT.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.760
&gt;&gt; Right. All right guys, thanks for coming
by.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.249
&gt;&gt; SOLIVEN: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; STUCKER: Thank you.
