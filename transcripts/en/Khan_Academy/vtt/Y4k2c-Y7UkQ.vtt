00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
- [Man] The history of the Saudi
state and the Saudi dynasty

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.459
really becomes interesting in
1744, in the town of Diriyah,

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.408
which is very close to
the modern city of Riyadh.

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:14.874
In the region of the Arabian
peninsula known as the Nejd,

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:17.232
and the Nejd is an important term to know

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:20.414
if you're studying Saudi Arabia
because this central region

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:22.647
of the Arabian peninsula
is really the stronghold

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.397
of the House of Saud.

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:29.713
But Diriyah was a successful
town in the early 18th century,

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.360
but the Emir of Diriyah,
Muhammad bin Saud,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.909
forges an alliance with
a religious leader,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.080
Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.743
and that alliance is a very strong one.

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:43.998
Muhammad bin Saud's son marries
Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab's

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:46.715
daughter to really seal that alliance.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:50.344
And the Wahhabis could be
viewed as a fundamentalist sect

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.057
of Sunni Islam.

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:54.226
And with that purist religious fervor,

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:56.798
this alliance is very successful.

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:59.619
Over the next several decades, you have

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.893
the Emirate of Diriyah continuing to grow,

00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:06.969
first conquering much of
the Nejd and Eastern Arabia,

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.324
and then as we go into
the early 19th centuries,

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:14.271
we go into the early 1800's,
conquers Western Saudi Arabia

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:16.748
and much of the territory
you would now associate

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:18.549
with the modern Saudi state.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.579
Now of note, is that they
conquered the Western portion

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.173
of the Arabian peninsula,
known as the Hejaz.

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:27.514
And the reason why this is significant,

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:28.899
you have to remember the context.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.454
At this time, the Ottoman Empire,

00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:34.612
with Constantinople as
its capital, was nominally

00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:37.363
in control of most of the
Middle East, including Egypt

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.290
and the Arabian peninsula.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.903
But all of a sudden, you have this emirate

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:44.717
that starts off in Diriyah,
and now is able to conquer

00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:46.977
a big chunk of the Arabian peninsula,

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.099
including two of the holiest
places in all of Islam.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.756
On top of that, the Emir of Diriyah

00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:55.467
and the Wahhabi religious leaders say that

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:58.655
the ruler of the Ottoman
Empire, the Sultan,

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:02.027
Mustafa the Fourth, is not
the valid leader of Islam,

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:04.977
that he is not the true caliph of Islam.

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:08.822
On top of that, in 1802 an
estimated 12,000 Wahhabis

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.592
go to Karbala and sack the city.

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:15.494
They destroy the shrine of
Husayn, who's a revered figure

00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:18.704
amongst Shia muslims, and
they kill an estimated

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.984
up to four or five thousand people,

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:24.864
and Karbala is also under Ottoman control,

00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:27.323
so the Ottomans are not happy about this.

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:30.552
You have a fundamentalist
sect of Islam in the Wahhabis

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:33.468
controlling most of the
Arabian peninsula, including

00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:35.747
the holiest sites in all of Islam.

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:39.169
They're saying that the
Ottoman rulers, the Sultan,

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.028
is not the true caliph of
Islam, and on top of that,

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.822
they're causing internal strife
within the Ottoman Empire

00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:47.284
with the Shias by sacking Karbala.

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:50.493
To make things even more
complicated for the Ottomans,

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:53.773
in Egypt, you have another
leader who's trying to exercise

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.190
his autonomy in Muhammad Ali.

00:02:57.463 --> 00:02:58.713
And so, the

00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:00.389
Ottomans have a plan.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.016
Why don't we get Muhammad Ali
to send some of his troops

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.839
to focus on the Emirate of Diriyah?

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.051
And so they order Muhammad Ali to take on

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.772
the Emirate of Diriyah
and this is what becomes

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:14.154
the Ottoman-Wahhabi War.

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:16.997
Now by the time the war is in full swing,

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:21.101
the Sultan in Constantinople
is Mahmud the Second.

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.114
Muhammad Ali sends his sons,
who are eventually successful,

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:27.178
in taking back Mecca and
Medina, and then they lay siege

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:30.256
to the town of Diriyah, and
they are eventually able

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:31.839
to take it in 1818.

00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:35.840
They send the leaders of the
House of Saud, and the Wahhabis

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.580
to Constantinople, including
the current emir at the time,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.187
Abdullah bin Saud, and
just to get a sense of

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:47.342
the family tree up to this
point, this is Abdullah,

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:50.425
who is the last emir of
the Emirate of Diriyah,

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:52.074
who gets captured by the Egyptian forces

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:53.647
on behalf of the Ottomans.

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:57.798
You can see he's the great
grandson of Muhammad bin Saud.

00:03:57.798 --> 00:04:01.832
Bin Saud means Muhammad, son
of Saud, so the whole dynasty

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:05.173
is named after Saud, who is
the previous Emir of Diriyah,

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:07.826
but Muhammad bin Saud is
the one who really formed

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:10.484
that alliance with the
Wahhabis, which enabled

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.296
the Emerate of Diriyah
to become a major power

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:16.481
in the Arabian peninsula,
eventually taking over most

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.618
of the peninsula.

00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:20.280
Abdullah was sentenced to
death in Constantinople

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.728
but before he was beheaded,
he was forced to listen

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:26.688
to lute music, because
according to the Wahhabis,

00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:29.597
that was considered sacrilege,
while the Ottomans had

00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:32.893
no problem with it, so they
were really trying to rub it in.

00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:35.523
That before you die, you're
going to have to do something

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:38.124
that you, the Wahhabis view as sacrilege.

00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:40.702
But I will leave you
there, as we will see,

00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:44.219
the Emirate of Diriyah is
the first of three major

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.472
Saudi states that will each control

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:48.939
most of the Arabian peninsula.

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.886
In the next video, we're
going to see the Saudi state

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:55.200
come back with the Emirate
of Nejd, and in blue here,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.570
you see the rulers of the Emirate of Nejd.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.944
And then, after that, we will talk about

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:02.771
the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.186
whose rulers you see here in green,

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:07.321
and we'll go into a lot
more depth than that.

00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.163
But you can see, that
they all are descendant

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:12.080
from Muhammad bin Saud.
