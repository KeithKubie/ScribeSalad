00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.390
- I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.223
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:06.090
I'm in Mexico City.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.970
We're in a taxi now,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.180
we're on our way to a restaurant

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.850
that's called Los Sifones.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.798
The reason I'm so excited to go there,

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:14.680
and why I'm gonna share
it with you is because

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.838
they specialize in a
couple of unique dishes

00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:20.380
that look absolutely incredible.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.380
Oh I can't wait to share lunch with you.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.703
(upbeat latin music)

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:41.760
(speaks in foreign language)

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.100
Hey that was about a 30 minute drive

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.750
from the center of Mexico City.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.578
It's a pretty nice neighborhood

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:48.886
and we got dropped off
right at the restaurant.

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.636
(speaks in foreign language)

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:54.314
Yes.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.298
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:07.298 --> 00:01:08.450
Yeah it's a family kind
of sit down restaurant,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.230
but it has a really friendly feel to it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.367
and most of the restaurant
is almost full now

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.400
except for this section
that we're sitting in.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.122
And it is almost all families
that are eating here.

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:21.390
The food smells amazing.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.766
This is a cool kind of like,

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.050
almost like diner-style restaurant.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.150
Okay so this is the menu,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.700
but you also get a whole paper checklist

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.840
that you can just check the
things that you like as well.

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.776
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:42.693
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.445
(upbeat latin music)

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.570
- And so what this restaurant
is most famous for,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.710
and why I was so excited to come here

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.130
is for their Molcajetes

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.770
which is a stone bowl mortar.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.200
And what they do is they take one of them,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.120
they put it on the hot grill,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.670
then they put all the ingredients inside

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.080
then they foil it until
it's sizzling away,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.580
and then they serve it to you.

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:24.981
(food sizzling)

00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:29.398
(cooks speaking in foreign language)

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:50.971
(upbeat latin music)

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.960
That only took like five minutes to arrive

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.590
and you can walk up there and watch them

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.970
as they make the whole thing.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.030
They added in,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.863
what did they add in first?

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:09.820
Oh they first added in the
nopal which is the cactus.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.570
Then they added in all the
bistec which is the steak.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.670
Sliced it all up.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.416
And what did they add?

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:18.490
Oh they added on some green onions.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.860
They added on avocado
which is an awesome touch.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.425
And then they added in,

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:28.040
oh we got both green and red salsa.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.590
And then they added on some cheese on top.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.050
And this is just bubbling, sizzling away.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.610
It smells incredible.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.950
It looks delicious.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.550
While it's still bubbling hot,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.070
I gotta take a bite.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.640
Oh avocado with all that salsa

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.341
and some of that beef.

00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:43.530
Oh it's just burning hot.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.910
Oh that is just like steaming hot,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.990
almost like liquified
avocado with beef steak.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.320
And that's just like lava hot salsa.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.310
Yeah I'm gonna need to blow on that.

00:04:07.574 --> 00:04:08.990
Oh that avocado.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.437
It's just like that's liquid avocado.

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:13.810
Oh it's so good.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.240
That's truly world class.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.330
I love the taste.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.530
You can taste those salsas in there.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.950
Both the roja and the verde,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.135
which is the red and green salsa.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:23.370
It has a dry chili flavor.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.180
It has a nice sour taste to it.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.240
It's so awesome because it's kept so hot.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.150
It's just burning

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.680
and you can feel the heat just
radiating off of this stone.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.670
Next I will open up the box of tortillas.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.828
And they have the unique
square shape tortillas here.

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:41.350
I'm gonna try and get a
little bit of everything

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.210
into my tortilla for this bite.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.520
Get some of that.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.600
Scooping it up,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.580
the bottom of that beef down there

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.160
with the avocado.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.150
Stick this into the tortilla.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.870
And then I got to go in
for some of that cheese.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.120
It almost looks like tofu

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:58.298
but it's cheese I'm pretty sure.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.330
Some cheese and some of that salsa.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.720
Next and then also some of that nopal.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.950
Yeah I just love how this piece of cactus,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.319
it's just kind of draped
over the side of this stone

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.150
like a drying towel.

00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.111
Some extra green salsa.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.690
Also some of the pico de gallo.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.310
And then finally just a squeeze of lime.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.090
Okay perfecto.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.160
Oh wow that's juicy.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.310
I like it with that extra
tomatoes and cilantro,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.170
that pico de gallo that gives it

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.282
an extra refreshing edge

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:50.110
along with a squeeze of lime.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.540
You got the cheese in there.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.770
You got the beef.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.870
All of that wonderful just hot salsa.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.860
Oh that liquid avocado is amazing.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.230
That just dissolves in your mouth.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.500
I also could not resist
ordering some tacos here.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.000
And they also serve them
on the square tortillas

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.450
which I've never seen before.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.470
And what's amazing about this place,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.300
is that they mix the meat
with a bunch of avocado.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.890
So yeah I'm a huge lover of avocado.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.230
Avocado is one of my favorite fruits.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.700
And for this one I got the arrachera,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.030
which I think is skirt steak.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.870
So they cook the arrachera.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.000
They chop it into small pieces.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.770
It looks like beef guacamole.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.336
For this one I'll try the red salsa

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:36.110
to contrast that green.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.250
And then of course you
gotta squeeze on some lime.

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:51.572
(upbeat latin music)

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.990
That just squishes with avocado.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.426
Oh that's just like straight up beef,

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.110
but really tenderful, flavorful beef

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.126
mixed with so much pure avocado.

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:13.070
Like so pure,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.970
it's such a good combination.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.800
It's so rich from that avocado.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.870
And that arrachera, wow.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.600
Because we got the
Molcajete with the bistec.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.890
But the arrachera is
definitely more tender.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.120
They're both good though.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.490
Next time I would probably opt

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.447
for the Molcajete with the arrachera.

00:07:31.447 --> 00:07:33.540
Oh man that beef is awesome.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.110
I love the avocado in here.

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.482
(upbeat latin music)

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.282
The volcanic bubbling has now stopped,

00:07:58.282 --> 00:07:59.770
but it's still really hot.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.780
You can still see the
steam coming off of it.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.970
I'm gonna try one of the onions.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.300
I just cannot get enough
of onions in Mexico.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.800
They're so good in every
different form and shape.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.970
Oh that flavor.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.270
That just sort of popped with this

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.225
crunchy onion texture to it.

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.440
It's a little bit chewy.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.600
Like the outer edges of the onion.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.720
The outer layers of that
onion are a little bit chewy,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.200
but then it gets like soft.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.470
It's sweet.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.640
Oh man that's delicious.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.620
It has a roasted charred flavor to it.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.453
I love it.

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.579
(upbeat latin music)

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.280
Such an incredible dish.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.090
That stone mortar,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:58.923
it stayed hot.

00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:00.950
I mean it didn't bubble the entire time,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.110
but even after finishing,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.600
after clearing out all the contents of it,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.230
you can still see the steam rising off

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.063
of that hot stone.

00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:10.210
So it stays hot throughout
your entire meal.

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:21.179
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:22.012
- When you're done with your main meal,

00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:23.852
they come around with a cart full

00:09:23.852 --> 00:09:25.130
of really colorful desserts.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.390
And so we decided to try a chocolate cake.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.473
(upbeat latin music)

00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:39.400
It's got like a,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.730
not the fluffy kind of cake,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.330
but it's really like kind of dense,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.060
but really rich.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.077
Really chocolatey.

00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:46.160
That's a good way to end this meal.

00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:49.190
I think it says 508 pesos.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.640
And we had all of the food I showed

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.800
plus an extra quesadilla.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.070
We had drinks and then
we had that dessert.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.730
A full, complete meal.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.599
That was such a fantastic meal.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.080
The food was excellent,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.360
service was great.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.110
I like how it's still a
sit down family restaurant,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.650
but you can watch them
as they cook your food

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.780
right in front of you,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.960
and then they serve it
directly to your table

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.240
hot and fresh.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.330
It has a very friendly feel to it as well.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.850
Fully enjoyed that lunch

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.230
and if you have a chance to make it here

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.210
when you're in Mexico City,

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.300
I would highly recommend it.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.290
Everything was good, yeah.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.890
Everything was good actually.
