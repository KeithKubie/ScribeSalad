00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.010
Understanding which alleles influence certain drug reactions has

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.520
implications far bigger than just alcohol metabolism. We're at

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.330
the edge of a revolution that's about to change

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.860
medicine and make it more personalized than it's ever

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.690
been before. Imagine taking drugs whose structure and dosing

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.360
is tailored specifically to your genotype. Now in this

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.230
world of designer drugs there are two main criteria

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.720
we need to consider with regards to the pharmacokinetic

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.810
an pharmacodynamic properties. The first is efficacy,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.650
or the drugs ability to achieve a desired

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.680
effect. The second, is toxicity, or the degree to which a drug causes a toxic

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.440
or unwanted side effect. So if we focus carefully and we consider both of these

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.550
factors we should be able to tailor

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.820
a drug to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.
