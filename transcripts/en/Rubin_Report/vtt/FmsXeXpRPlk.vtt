00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.330
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 1>Joining me today is an author,</v>

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.200
the editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research as well

4
00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.670
as a senior fellow at the Austrian economic center.
Jeffrey Tucker.

5
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.520
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.
Good to be here.

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.820
I almost wore the same bow tie,
my friend Healy.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.760
I should've brought one extra right there for you.
That would have been
all right.

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.070
There's a ton I want to talk to you about your,
your sort of a,

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.640
one of these people that are right around all of the topics that I'm talking

10
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:38.230
about from the freedom and liberty and free speech and the battle between the

11
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:39.400
left and the right and all that,

12
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.490
but your new book and I want to get the title absolutely correct.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.090
Right wing collectivism,
the other threat to liberty.

14
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:50.110
I thought that would be the spot for us to kick this off because most of the

15
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:54.190
people watching this show know that I've mostly focused on the left.
Sure,
sure.

16
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.270
Was My home or it was it progressive.
I've woken up to what I should.

17
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.470
Real liberalism is obviously,
and that has nothing to do with the modern left.

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.650
But sometimes people say,
Dave,
you don't critique the right enough.

19
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.360
So let's dive in.

20
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.870
What's interesting about talk about anyway is that so often the left and the

21
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:15.340
right are not as distinguishable as they seem to be for,

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.330
for example,
uh,
the,
this,
this trade stuff.
You know,

23
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:23.560
Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump basically agree.
How do you account for that?

24
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.670
And,
and now we,
you see all the celebration of the working classes,
you know,

25
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.010
you're going to get again,
uh,

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.420
the Trump Ian bride agreeing with the Bernie Sanders on,
on that,

27
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.500
uh,

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.270
the left is ever more trending nationalist and its immigration policies,

29
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:44.320
for example,
that didn't use to be the case.
So how was the left?
Well,

30
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.480
shouldn't listen to him.
Well,

31
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.500
like Bernie Sanders complained that free free immigration is,

32
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:54.460
is a coke or coke industries plot basically to provide the capitalist class

33
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:56.050
cheaper workers,
for example.

34
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.220
Now that you would've never found anybody on the left 20 years ago saying that,

35
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.530
but,
but now you know what's happening.
You know the,
the,
the,
the,

36
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.450
the hatred of the,
of,
of commerce and,

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.510
and the merchant class is so intense now that if a luxury resort and um,

38
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
in Florida wants to hire some,
some immigrants to work for them,

39
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.480
then the left is saying,
oh no,
this is,

40
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.150
this is terrible cause this capitalist capitalism at work.

41
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.520
So he was trying to see this strange blending.

42
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.550
The left and the right have different cultural pitches,

43
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.580
a different appeals to different constituencies,

44
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.450
but they both have this agenda that's,
that boils down to the,

45
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.590
to the use of power.

46
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.100
Is this a little bit of just what people refer to as the horseshoe theory that

47
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:41.470
the more that the sides had become sort of extreme,

48
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:45.300
that they're oddly [inaudible] I've heard this,
this horseshoe there.

49
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.110
I tend to think that's a little bit superficial.
I mean,

50
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.440
I look at it a little bit more historically and you see,

51
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.340
since since liberalism is born in the world and the 18th century,

52
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.570
really high middle ages,

53
00:02:55.571 --> 00:03:00.520
but when the revolt against liberalism began the early 19th century,

54
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.290
right,
too much change,
too much wealth,
the wrong people are getting rich,

55
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.560
then there's not enough control.
What are we going to do about our religion,

56
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.150
our language,
our rates.
You know,
the,

57
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.060
the revolt began to grow from about the 18th,
20th,

58
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.590
and intensified and spread,
uh,
to the United States.

59
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.400
Britain really began to take root and continental Europe.

60
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.210
There they took two forms.
So there was a left form and a right form.

61
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.890
And in each country they took,

62
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.860
they took on different iterations of different names,
you know,
so,

63
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.030
so in Britain you had the Tories,
then you had to lay a Labour party.

64
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.520
They both wanted to use the state for their own purposes.

65
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.450
Then you always had the opposition party,
which was the liberals and you know,

66
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.500
and,
and that's the way it's fleshed out itself.
In country after country.

67
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.680
The Liberal Party has always been,
the people said,

68
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.310
why don't we just let society be,
let people live their lives,

69
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.070
let them choose a religion of their own,
of their own choice.

70
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.010
If they'd all hurting anybody,
that's not a problem.
Let's have free speech.

71
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.160
This have a universal rights.
I have rights for this.

72
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.220
This get rid of slavery.
Let's have rights.

73
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.440
Acknowledging the existence of women's rights.
Uh,

74
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
equality of freedom for everybody.
Leave everybody alone.

75
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.880
That's the liberal position.
That's a pretty good position.
It's,
it's a,

76
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.800
it's a beautiful position and it's,
and it's what I favorites,

77
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:20.860
but I think it's what built civilization coming out of the religious wars or the

78
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.120
high middle ages,
we discovered this idea of freedom.
We tried it,

79
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.650
it worked.
But there's,
but there's,
uh,

80
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.230
there's always been a revolt brewing against it.
A resentment,
uh,

81
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:35.170
resentment against it and get resentment against the commercial class.

82
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.930
Too much change,
too much wealth,
wrong.
People getting wealthy.

83
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.000
We're not controlling demographics well enough.

84
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.400
There's not enough to quality whatever the thing is.

85
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.310
It takes different forms in different countries and in different times in

86
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:47.290
different places.

87
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.620
But ultimately the right and the left are ideologies of control and power and

88
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:57.370
liberalism has always been the alternative to that.
So,

89
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.600
so we keep having to rediscover this again and again and every generation.
Yep.

90
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.610
<v 2>Well that's why now I'm so happy that there is,</v>

91
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:09.020
as you said to me right before we started the phrase classical liberalism is

92
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:12.530
coming back.
You know what I mean?
You hear it on TV every now and again.

93
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:16.070
I like to think that maybe I had a little something to do with it.
You know,

94
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.310
and I mean to me it is the only current antidote to the problems that we have,

95
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:28.280
either the more state power that the democratic socialist want as they've sort

96
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:32.210
of ransacked their own party and purged all of the Liberals.

97
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.790
And it's also the antidote for all of the people.

98
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:38.060
If you think Trump is all of the horrible things that people say about him all

99
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:41.000
the time,
what's the antidote?
The antidote isn't to get somebody else.

100
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:42.260
And then more power to power.

101
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.450
The antidote obviously is to take power away from that.
That's what liberalism

102
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.170
<v 1>I hope is that,</v>

103
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:52.090
that there are the good people left the center of the left that are looking at

104
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.920
the emergence of the Trump problem.
Uh,
we'll reconsider,

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.830
uh,
the uses of power and the executive state.

106
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.210
And why did we build this gigantic machinery of the total state if it's so

107
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:09.130
vulnerable to being captured by our enemies.
Right,
right.
That's what we,

108
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:11.420
that's the real question that we're at right now.

109
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.750
If you believe this thing has been captured by the Russians or whatever it is,

110
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.860
it's like,
well,
okay,
you're kind of answering your own questions.

111
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.000
So I hope that we can,

112
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.530
we can rekindle a kind of a new resurgence or I do have to credit you and Jordan

113
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.180
Peterson for this.
I mean,

114
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:31.181
I've been working at it for about 10 years to try to bring back to the,

115
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.660
not just the term liberal,
but the concept of liberalism,

116
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.270
um,
to,
to public life.
And,
uh,
but it's been difficult because,

117
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.133
because,

118
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.000
because we do have the state that creates a kind of moral and intellectual and

119
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:51.570
ideological hazard.
Somebodies got to control it.
And now that we,

120
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.000
we built it over the last hundred years,
this,
this,

121
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.970
this total state of massive taxes,
regulations,
interventions,

122
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.100
uh,
running people's lives.

123
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.540
Everybody's trying to get hold of it and grab it and beat up their enemies.

124
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.870
And it's a problem.
It's a serious problem.
So when people say to me,

125
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.110
and we've discussed this on the show a bunch of times before,
and I've dressed,

126
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.520
addressed this and several forums,
when people say to me,
wait a minute,

127
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:15.200
when you're,
when you say you're a classical liberal,

128
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.720
and you talked about laissez faire economics and getting the government out of

129
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:22.220
the way and all those things,
really,
this is just a repackaged libertarianism,

130
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:25.670
or you're just afraid to say that you're a conservative because it's still not

131
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:29.780
cool,
or something like that.
Is it,
how would you define the difference between,

132
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:34.130
say,
a classical liberal and a libertarian?
And let's talk about that because,
uh,

133
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.620
because after World War Two,
uh,
these neoliberalism logistics,

134
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.380
these new terms came along,
uh,
one was conservatism.

135
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:47.210
It wasn't really used before the early 1950s,
Russell Kirk's book called,
um,

136
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.770
uh,
the mindset of a conservative simply like the conservative mind.

137
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.690
I think it was what it was called.
And Libertarianism was again,
uh,

138
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.040
first used in about 1957,
um,

139
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.820
by the translator of the works of Boston had,

140
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.360
the problem was the term liberal had been captured by the new dealers as early

141
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:12.740
as 1933.

142
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.510
Once they acquiesced to the idea of the corporate of estate and we're blaming

143
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:20.450
the great depression on capitalism,
um,

144
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.560
that became a problem for liberalism that kept the term liberalism,

145
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.790
but they were no longer liberal cause they were suddenly for big government,

146
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:31.790
there were four big government and even worse,
the corporate state.

147
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.470
And actually we can just be more blunt about it and say that back in the 1930

148
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:41.360
[inaudible] this,
this ideology had a name.
The name was fascist.

149
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.840
Okay.
So,
so they caved,
right?

150
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.620
I mean in the New York Times in 1933 the New York Times magazine was celebrating

151
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:50.270
the great prep professor,
Mussolini,

152
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.710
and how he and FDR shared a vision for the planned economy.

153
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.810
So that's the world we were living in back then.
So we,

154
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.510
we lost the term liberal after World War Two.
There was an attempt to,

155
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.750
to just speak a language and to,
and to,
to describe who we are.

156
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.280
And on one hand you had this new thing called conservatism and they,
they,

157
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.050
they kind of sampled some of this Tori,
Tori likeness Ostalgie for the past,

158
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.830
a little bit of revanchist them,
you know,
let's recapture what we've lost.

159
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.210
Then on the other hand,

160
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:26.211
you had the genuine liberals and they coined the term libertarianism,

161
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.700
which had been sitting on the shelf since the late 19th century.

162
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.060
Now most of the people who call themselves libertarians in the late 19th century

163
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:35.880
America and England were anarchists,
socialists,

164
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.630
but nobody had bothered with the term for decades and decades.

165
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.260
So Dean Russell's said,
well,
nobody's using that word.
Why don't we use it?

166
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.670
And that was closer to the truth of what they were in effect.
Well,

167
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.940
what was interesting about that is as Dean Russell described it in his 1957

168
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:57.390
article,
it was a synonym for what was once called liberal.

169
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.630
He didn't think it was a tweak or an improvement or a distillation or refinement

170
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.270
or a new dogmatic way of describing the bulls and he thought it was liberalism.

171
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.930
So I need to read that because I mean that's how I feel.

172
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.810
I don't know if someone sends me,
Dave,
you're a libertarian.
I don't mind that.

173
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.510
If we need labels,
I don't mind that late,
but I don't mind the,

174
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:22.050
I believe we can split the difference on how much government sure she'd be.

175
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.250
The problem.
I think libertarianism as a number,
as a term has number of problems.

176
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.580
One is it's a little clinical sounding and it has too many syllables and it

177
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:34.581
makes you sound a little bit awkward and it sounds maybe a little too canonical.

178
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.390
You know,
like we,
we have a list of things you have to believe,
you know,

179
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.760
like this,
this,
this,
it's all rooted in this kind of reductionist,
uh,

180
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.790
more commonly these days.
It's rooted in this kind of reduction.

181
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.520
That's nonaggression principle,
which is a fine principles or rule of thumb,

182
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:54.270
but it's not a good,
it doesn't describe the whole of life.
So,
uh,

183
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.600
the other problem is that libertarianism is,

184
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:00.330
is a new term so it doesn't have a deep history.

185
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.050
So we can't look back and say,
oh,
look,

186
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.400
the libertarians freed the slaves,
the Libertarians,
uh,

187
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.750
acknowledged to the rights of women.

188
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.250
The Libertarians gave us the commercial society that built the middle class and

189
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:18.480
brought dignity to the average person.
You know,
if they had existed as a party,

190
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.130
they would have done those,
they would have done this.

191
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.840
But it means the liberals who did that,

192
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.340
but it's deliberate when we changed our name,

193
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:28.341
so now we can like feel a sense of pride in our path so it doesn't have a past.

194
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.450
Hmm.
So that's a problem.
So we're,

195
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.800
libertarians tend to be detached from their own history for that reason.

196
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.810
And I think it's a problem.
It's a word problem.

197
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.670
The second problem is that libertarianism doesn't have a universal of usage.

198
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.800
Like where's liberalism does,

199
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.010
you can go to Spain described herself and liberal Brazil.
There's,

200
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.680
there's liberals in Germany,
there's liberals,
every,

201
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.070
there's a word for liberalism and every language and it more,

202
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.940
less means the same thing except in the United States.
Right?
So,
uh,
so,

203
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.241
uh,

204
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:02.410
if we acquiesce to this term libertarian and just wipe out our liberal history,

205
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.310
we're cutting off cells off both from the world and from our own history.

206
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.880
It's so funny because you've just said it in a far better way than I think I've

207
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:12.460
ever really laid it out.
But people will say to me,
Dave,

208
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:16.490
stop saying you're a liberal and I don't want to stop saying I'm going to,

209
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.230
I get that.
I'm fighting an uphill battle right now,
right?
I'm a,

210
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:22.600
I'm a salmon swimming upstream.
This is going to be tough,

211
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.800
but I don't want to deny what is the truth just because,

212
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.610
because it's tough.
It's who you are and you want to,

213
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.460
you want to have an ancestry,
you know,
you want to look back and,

214
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.400
and see,
uh,
the,

215
00:12:37.401 --> 00:12:42.401
the champions are the Meta cheese and 15th century Florence and say,

216
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.290
I know those people.
Those are my people.
You know,

217
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.430
the people who long for a world without slavery.
You know,

218
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:51.820
in the early 19th century that people who want free trade,

219
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.380
him fought hard for it.
Those are our people.
That's our history.
I mean we were,

220
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.410
we were born as part of a long stream of emancipation that's been taking place

221
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.370
for 500 years.
That's our movement,
our people,
our history.

222
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.150
Let's embrace it.
I'm with your brother.
Yeah.
All right.

223
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:14.980
So are there any of those liberals uh,

224
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.490
part of the Democratic Party anymore?
Dude,
those people exist.

225
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.090
Strange things are happening on the left.
Very strange thing.

226
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.630
<v 2>So now I'm not sure I should pause you for one sec.</v>

227
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.370
My original question here was I wanted to do the deep dive on their right.

228
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.460
So we're going to get know we will get,
no,

229
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:32.130
I promise you we're going to get today on our topic.
I mean,

230
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.210
the deep dive of the far right gets us into a very dark place.
Yeah.
All right,

231
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:38.760
well maybe that.
All right,
so maybe the whole second half will be on that.

232
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.120
Let me just put that out there right now.
That's what we'll do for the second.

233
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.980
He's not getting out of my depression having done my book.
It was terrible.

234
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.211
All right,

235
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:47.820
so our whole second half is going to be what my first question was about,

236
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:50.610
but let's just keep going.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
For now.
So,

237
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.620
so strange things have happened to the left.

238
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.200
<v 1>Um,
let's just mention that the,</v>

239
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.290
the phrase cultural appropriation for example.
Now when,
when did that,

240
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.160
the approbation of this idea of cultural appropriation?
Kellogg,
what,
two,

241
00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:07.770
three years ago?
Three,
four,
five.
I Dunno,
I could me as weird.

242
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.100
It may have been brewing for 10 years,
but when I first heard about it,

243
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:15.360
I thought that is the craziest bunch of nonsense I've ever heard.

244
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.220
I mean,
civilization is nothing but cultural appropriation of,

245
00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:25.080
we've been doing this since,
since the ninth century.
You know,

246
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:27.430
at the,
at the height of,
of the Cup of Vinci.
I'm,

247
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.440
it's in Spain where Judaism and Islam and Christianity came together in this

248
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.950
beautiful melting pot where we all learn from each other in the cultures began

249
00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:40.540
to blend in.
Our religions began to change and our,

250
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.890
our outlook on life began because we learned from each other.

251
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:47.960
If we stay isolated on our little tribes,
we're never going to progress.
And,

252
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.550
and the idea that,
and I don't know if it was or what happened,

253
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.740
we can talk about this,
but when,

254
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.780
when suddenly you're told you cannot have affection for another culture and take

255
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:05.120
what you find valuable and learn,
learn for yourself and live a better life,

256
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.380
that is very strange.
They seem to think it's cultural and annihilation,

257
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.510
not cultural appropriation,
right?

258
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:15.050
Like they seem to think that this is something that will lead to the destruction

259
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.190
of that culture,

260
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:21.150
when in fact it actually spreads the ideas of culture,
the foods,

261
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.850
the thing,
the,
the,

262
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:27.140
the ideas that just they're creating culture as a scarce.
Good luck.

263
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:30.350
It's a property,
but it's not the magic of culture,

264
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.470
which is the same magic of ideas is resides in its infinite reproducibility and

265
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.510
its malleability.

266
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.470
This is something that the world of ideas can do that the physical world cannot

267
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:46.280
do.
And if we don't make that distinction,
we're going to get very confused.

268
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.740
Do you see what I mean?
Cultures spread their infinite,

269
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.140
uh,
and they can constantly change.

270
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:58.650
And that's the magic and beauty of,
of culture.
We,

271
00:15:58.651 --> 00:16:02.100
we can't get that out of this class of water,
this table right there.

272
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.990
They're bound by the constraints of scarcity.
But the world of ideas is,

273
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.730
is magical.
It's like a constant,
constant,
infinite sandstorm,
you know,

274
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.350
unpredictable.
And I'm constantly changing and we can,

275
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.520
we can take

276
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.700
a culture for ourselves without taking it from somebody else.
Right.
It's just,

277
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:26.090
it's,
it's,
it's reproduction,
reproduction.
It's infinite reproduction.

278
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:28.850
So loaves and the fishes isn't,
isn't the beauty to that.

279
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:32.480
America has done this better than anyone,

280
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.100
perhaps in the history of the world.

281
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.170
You just referenced some other points in time,

282
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:41.150
but that we have taken in more cultures.
And you said the phrase melting pot.

283
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.510
I mean that,
that's what we designed and set up here,

284
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.850
the most beautiful melting pot ever.

285
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:50.450
I lived in New York City for most of my life,
most of my adult life at least,

286
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.160
and would be on subway cars.

287
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:56.270
And you are on that car with absolutely everyone with,

288
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.920
I have white guys with dreadlocks and the whole thing.
And guess what?

289
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:04.130
You may not like everybody and you may not like the way this guy smells and that

290
00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:08.080
person may be doing this,
but we're all there.
But a man living together,

291
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.800
it's magic.
You know?
It's,
it's,
it really,
it's commerce.

292
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:17.801
It's because this country elevated the commercial ethos to be the highest thing

293
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:22.250
that great and noblemen factor of,
of,
of,
of human life.

294
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.760
And it's commerce that brings people together.
And we experienced that every day.

295
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.900
You know,
you can,
in a,
in a commercial setting,
people aren't fighting each other.

296
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.200
They're,
they're getting along.
I mean,
I find I'm with you.
I go to,

297
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:37.850
I go to a restaurant and I get served by some guy from,
from,
uh,
Pakistan.

298
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.910
It's,
it's a chance to meet somebody new.

299
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.540
It's a chance to engage somebody and I have a personal relationship with

300
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:49.070
somebody who's serving you and you're serving them and you experienced this

301
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.420
magic of exchange.
Uh,

302
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.010
Benjamin consultant used to talk about this and the 1830s,
how,
how,

303
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.130
how commerce brought to the world and new understanding of freedom and a new

304
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:06.090
opportunity for us to find value in each other,

305
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.650
in service of each other and Co and America just flourished and commerce.

306
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:14.960
And that's why,
that's why we have the diversity and the,

307
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.320
and this melting pot as you call it.
And this rich cultural life.

308
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.390
<v 2>You know,
it's so funny because I'm so keenly aware of it right now.</v>

309
00:18:22.391 --> 00:18:25.030
Not only because of the conversations I'm having and because people are

310
00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:27.430
screaming about this stuff all the time.
But you know,

311
00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:30.790
I'm on this tour with Jordan Peterson and when I go to every airport that I go

312
00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:34.090
do I,
90% of the time,
unless someone's had a car for me,

313
00:18:34.091 --> 00:18:38.160
I take an Uber and I just hop in whatever Uber shows up.
And there is there,

314
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.340
there is every single type of person that looks every which way.

315
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.650
And as Chlorella,
every sexuality.
And usually I talk a little bit to,

316
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.470
to them it's,
you know,
and it's like,
man,
these are just people.

317
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.340
I maybe feel the same way.
You know,
I live in Atlanta,

318
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.790
which is just a gigantically diverse society,
you know,
and everywhere you go,

319
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:59.870
you're bumping into people who are different from you and,

320
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.860
and hang around in crypto circles in Atlanta.

321
00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:06.430
I want to talk to you and that you're talking about a melting pot.
I mean,

322
00:19:06.431 --> 00:19:10.240
we're all together and we all consider each other are people,
you know,

323
00:19:10.241 --> 00:19:14.560
just because we all love crypto and it has nothing to do with,
with race.

324
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:15.840
You can appreciate racial groups

325
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.080
<v 1>Francis with,
but also see value in everybody and,</v>

326
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.350
and hope they can see value in you.
You can come together.

327
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.330
It doesn't mean that we have to be egalitarian or,
or denied differences.

328
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.190
It means that we find strength and our heterogeneity.
And,

329
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:36.790
and that's,
that makes for a beautiful unexciting life.

330
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.150
One of the strangest thing that's happening now,
you know,

331
00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:44.830
with the rise of the alt right in response to the failures and,
and strange.

332
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:49.360
And so the left is this new celebration of homogeneity as if,
oh,

333
00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:51.790
we need to live in a unitary racial state,

334
00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.810
you know where we all speak the same language are all have the same religion.

335
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.620
So that's tracks me as aesthetically very boring and I don't,

336
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.920
I don't even recognize what that world would look like and feel like.

337
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:06.050
And it doesn't appeal to me in the slightest bit.
Yeah.
[inaudible]

338
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.420
was built out of the,

339
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.350
I don't have the diversity that grows out of commerce and the commerce is the

340
00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:15.600
key because that's what helps us invest in each other.
You know,

341
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.280
Adam Smith said this about the division of Labor,
right?

342
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.870
It's like what causes wealth?
The division of Labor,
how big can that be?

343
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:26.230
It should be as big as possible.
The wider the division of Labor,

344
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:29.840
the more people you include in the great project of,

345
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.980
of building commercial life and production,

346
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.990
the wealthier we're all going to be together.
And I just,
I love that vision.

347
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.213
So when

348
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.290
<v 2>we talk about capitalism on the show,</v>

349
00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:44.250
I'll every now and again I'd jump in the comment section or I see what people

350
00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:45.750
say on Twitter.
If I have,
you know,

351
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.980
some of the ion ran people on or just some of the people

352
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.350
<v 1>that are not for regulation at all.</v>

353
00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:52.150
And just let the economy go and see what happens.

354
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.310
There's always a certain amount of people that say,
okay,

355
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.480
that all sounds well and good,

356
00:20:55.481 --> 00:21:00.190
but then the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer and Jeff

357
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.660
Bezos shouldn't have,
you know,

358
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:05.800
$20 trillion or whatever he has right now or the rest of it.
What,
what's the,

359
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.590
what's the boiler plate answer to?

360
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:13.080
Why with those kinds of cliches because they've been around for 150 years and

361
00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:13.914
they've never been true.

362
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.380
I mean that they weren't true and Marxists time and everybody got quickly

363
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:21.820
recognize that you're going to,
by the late 19th century,
uh,
in America we had,

364
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.930
we had built the most prosperous economy in the world by far,
by far,

365
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:30.430
by far growing incomes,
longer lives,
healthier people,

366
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:33.580
more opportunities for everybody.
People are moving to the cities.

367
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.770
Everybody's benefiting from capitalism.

368
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:39.640
That's been going on for such a long time and yet here we are in 2018 and we're

369
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.260
still recycling these,

370
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.550
these Victorian era cliches about capitalism.
I don't understand it.

371
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.200
What do you think capitalism then screwed up if if only just a marketing piece

372
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:55.201
of it or something where right now you sent and I believe that it will not win

373
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.590
but it somehow doesn't seem cool to be for capitalism,

374
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.140
at least with the Beatles seemed to be the change.

375
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.120
Maybe it's in the name and I don't,

376
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.050
I don't even have a problem not using the word capitalism.

377
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.540
I mean we would probably have the same view towards this.

378
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:12.010
I will speak the language that,

379
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.840
that you can understand and if I want to rebrand capitalism as liberalism,

380
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.590
which it probably should be actually liberal liberalism,
then I'm,

381
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.540
I'm glad to talk about that.
Uh,
same time,
I kind of liked the term capitalism.

382
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.160
I have no problem with you because,
because it,

383
00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:31.810
it really does underscore really important point that without private property

384
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:34.540
and the in the,
and ownership of the means of production,

385
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.170
you can't have a complex,
uh,

386
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.020
production structures and you can't hire more people.
You can't,

387
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.630
you can't build great things.
You can have great cities,

388
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:45.040
you can't improve people's lives.

389
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.710
So what are the things that you think government should do?

390
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.280
Well,
I think of lots of kinds of rules that we should have.

391
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.570
Um,
but I'm not a fan of governments in general.

392
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.220
If there was some way that you could have,
you know,

393
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:06.360
an old fashioned liberal state,
you know,
that was really minded,

394
00:23:06.361 --> 00:23:08.790
his own business and,
um,

395
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.320
kept kept civil war from happening,
for example,
you know,
kept conflict,

396
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:18.760
that kind of mass conflict,
um,
then that would be a probably a good,
a good thing.

397
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.890
Um,
state is not very good at that.
So,
um,
I,

398
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.360
I think,
I mean,
I've got,
I've got the mind of an anarchist essentially.

399
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:32.460
I trust,
you know,
I trust the chaos of,

400
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.850
of spontaneous human action much more than any kind of,

401
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.060
of of imposition.
Yeah,
but I,
but I am at same time.

402
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:42.410
I do like the writings of the old liberals,
you know,
they,

403
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.420
they imagined that the state should do something to keep something like order in

404
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:51.560
life.
It keeps civil war from happening to keep people from killing each other.

405
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.040
Terrible things like that.
But beyond that stage should just,

406
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.560
it should be a laissez faire.

407
00:23:56.561 --> 00:24:01.160
It should just allow commerce to flourish and Lau Lau problems to work

408
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.610
themselves out.
I am.
People don't have confidence in that anymore,

409
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.600
but not because of any failure.
But it's almost like the,

410
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.830
the ideology of power has become a kind of a modern cancer that affects a flicks

411
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:17.160
everyone.
And I think we need to do something about it.
Wait,

412
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.860
can you explain that a little further?
Well,

413
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:23.861
it's just that once you believe that you can control the path of history and you

414
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.480
have an end point in mind,

415
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.180
society should look like this,

416
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.320
then you want to use every kind of tool to hammer it in place.
And this is,

417
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.420
this is what I call right and left wing Regalian Isam essentially.
And it's a,

418
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.780
it's a grave temptation.
And so we built this,
like we said,
at the outside,

419
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.360
and we built this gigantic machinery we call the state,

420
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.540
this total state and a controls.

421
00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:50.780
So much wealth and so much power and so much rests with,

422
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.030
with getting,
you know,

423
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:57.560
gaining access to it that it just a kind of a constant moral hazard for

424
00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:01.400
everybody.
Like give,
give me that state and I'll make it do the right things.

425
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.830
Right?
So for the people that on either side of this,

426
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:05.320
whether you're on the left and,

427
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.830
and you want to help those that you deem oppressed more people with less,

428
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.510
when I believe their intentions to be good,

429
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:14.060
even if their methodology I think generally is not good.

430
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.880
Or your people on the right that was less than a state,
but you know,

431
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:18.410
you're just on either side of this thing.

432
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.890
How much do you think the system itself can move without breaking?

433
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.040
Because what I think I'm noticing now is that there's a certain amount of people

434
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:30.980
that really just want to trash the whole thing.

435
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.920
And I do see this certainly more on the left right now because they're not

436
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:36.410
empower that there's this growing thing,
uh,

437
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.620
and this is why they're so into Marxism and all this stuff now.
It's like,

438
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:43.160
let's just trash the whole freaking thing and forget all the goodness that this

439
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:45.500
is done.
And they're doing it from their iPhones.
And you know,

440
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.540
there's that sense of irony is not great,
but is there,
is there has to a system,

441
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.360
you mean,

442
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.360
is there just a certain amount that a system that's basically good can move

443
00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:00.510
before it snaps?
And I would suspect that that's not much either way really.
Uh,

444
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.490
you mean the commercial structure right now or a comma or the lives are

445
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.760
capitalist structures.
I mean the state,
um,
you know,

446
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:11.240
what I see actually happening is the innovation is taking place so quickly.

447
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.840
It's actually out running the,
uh,
the capacity of government to control it.

448
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.330
And I think that's,
that's really exciting.

449
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:22.331
If I was going to look at one point of hope in the world is that the market and

450
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:26.360
the entrepreneurial innovative sectors of life from the APP economy to the Gig

451
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:30.200
economy to now with with blockchain technology and everything is moving so

452
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:34.460
quickly that states can't,
can't even keep up.
Right.

453
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:36.770
So I'm there with you on that because that's glorious.

454
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.040
I'm very happy about that and see that because it's,
to me it's like,

455
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.650
well how are people listening to all of these conversations,

456
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:44.070
all of these podcasts that are out there

457
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.310
<v 2>and communicating about them so quickly and it's like the government can't,</v>

458
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.650
I can't keep up with all of that.

459
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:53.580
The change can't because people are lighting up all the time now in a much

460
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:57.780
faster way and I think we're changing in a much more rapid way and I think

461
00:26:57.781 --> 00:26:58.800
that's actually really cool.

462
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:01.920
There's a danger to it because we could just spin out of control and do all

463
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:04.320
sorts of awful things.
But what you said,
well,

464
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.630
what did you say before about the general inertia of people or something that

465
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.450
the general left to their own ways of figuring things out?

466
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:15.360
I'll figure it out.
And,
and you know,
there's a reason why or

467
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.240
<v 1>politics seem reactionary on the left and the right,</v>

468
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.780
everyone's trying to bring back something.
There's a,

469
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.140
there's a nostalgia on the left and an establish it on the right and they're

470
00:27:26.141 --> 00:27:29.980
trying to use the state to hold us back like,
and,

471
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.760
and whatever.
It's a vision of the,
is it the 60s?
Is it,

472
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.970
is it the seventies?
Is it preindustrial revolution?
You know,
is it some risks?

473
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:43.590
So Ian Fantasy of perfectly quality and that the left might imagine,
or,

474
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.080
or,
or the ride,
uh,
thinking about,
you know,

475
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:51.280
a world of high tariffs of the 1880s or nineties or,

476
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.970
but everyone's looking back to something that they want to create and there's a

477
00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:58.150
real fear of the future,
future on the left and the right.

478
00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.290
And it's a future without control.
It's a future where we're able to travel,

479
00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:04.390
where we want to download the apps.

480
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:08.620
We want to invent what we want to work by ourselves.
Live where we want to live,

481
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.550
be digital nomads,
tr,
you know,
traveled around.

482
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.000
Do what we want this,
this will,

483
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.550
<v 2>that's so cool.
That's not what people should be fearing people.</v>

484
00:28:18.551 --> 00:28:21.880
Everyone should be going,
holy cow,
this is the free is coolest thing ever.

485
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.260
That's the world I want to live in.
I want to land.

486
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.980
That obviously is why you're so attracted to bitcoin also.
Right?

487
00:28:26.981 --> 00:28:31.030
In crypto in general.
Sure.
Cause it's sort of the backbone.
Well out of this.

488
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:32.380
I mean if you think about it,

489
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.750
<v 1>I mean we've waited our whole lives and actually generations of great</v>

490
00:28:35.751 --> 00:28:38.780
intellectuals have lived,
lived in diet for so long,

491
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:44.020
wanting something like a private currency that that emerged privately,

492
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:47.480
that operates without financial intermediaries,

493
00:28:47.481 --> 00:28:50.960
that the government is not controlling,
that it's global.
That doesn't,

494
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.970
it's not restrained by currency zones that anyone can have access to.
You know,

495
00:28:55.971 --> 00:29:00.230
a true democratic technology like bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.

496
00:29:00.231 --> 00:29:03.440
That is just a dream come true.
That is glorious.

497
00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:06.320
That's why I write about it all the time and talk about it all the time.
It is,

498
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.750
it is the outright killer.
It is the alt left killer.

499
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.320
It's the thing that's going to ultimately,
I think,
um,

500
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.100
protect us from these wicked ideologies that are constantly trying to control

501
00:29:16.101 --> 00:29:16.934
their lives.

502
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.620
<v 2>Because basically at some point,</v>

503
00:29:18.621 --> 00:29:22.880
one of these ideologies is going to get too much control of the state have just

504
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.730
financially

505
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.420
<v 1>forever.
I mean,
you know,
one of the things that,
that when I think about this,</v>

506
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:30.030
sometimes when you get depressed about the divisions in our public life,

507
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:32.970
in the way people are tearing,
tearing each other apart,

508
00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:36.390
and the way you opened up the newspaper and you can barely even read it anymore,

509
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.890
you know,
it was like,
yeah,
I know,
I know,
but it's like Donald Trump,

510
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.450
you then it's like,
you know,
I'll put Trump,
you know,
and it's just,

511
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.640
it's just this forever debate.

512
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:51.210
And the one thing that I think maybe we should not be entirely unhappy about

513
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.960
this.
As you look back at history,

514
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:55.780
when freedom emerges out of the high middle ages,

515
00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:01.020
it wasn't because any one great intellectual or anyone great state or anyone

516
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:03.610
great power said,
hey,
let's let everybody be free.

517
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.410
It was because there's so many competitors for power.
They,
nobody could gain.

518
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.630
The monopoly was the church,

519
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.510
it was the nation state,

520
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.950
it was the localities on monarchical state,
uh,
the,

521
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.630
the landed aristocracy,
you know,
the,
the,
the rise of the merchant class,
you know,

522
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.920
so there are all these independent power centers strewn throughout European

523
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:31.390
society and nobody could get,
get access to the finals,

524
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:34.780
single singular control,
no unitary power.

525
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.180
And so that fight that took place amongst so many disparate powers,

526
00:30:39.181 --> 00:30:44.080
that actually led to a kind of flourishing of freedom.
So you know,
and a sense,

527
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:47.260
the fight between the left and the right today is not the worst thing if they

528
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:51.330
just keep fighting and leave the rest of us alone.
Right,
right,
right.
All right,

529
00:30:51.331 --> 00:30:53.860
so [inaudible] we're going to be that lucky,
but okay.

530
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:56.800
So before we spend the whole second half on the question that I started this

531
00:30:56.801 --> 00:30:57.760
whole thing with,

532
00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.750
do the people who want freedom basically and a light touch of government,

533
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.310
are they always added disadvantage because there's another set of people who

534
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:09.430
will always use the apparatus against them where if they're being true to

535
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:13.300
themselves,
they won't use the power to stifle of their people.

536
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.310
There are all sorts of other things.
So in an odd way,

537
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:17.830
our ideas are at a distance.
They always have been.

538
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:19.600
We've always been a kind of minority.

539
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.330
So even again over the last two or 300 years of political history,

540
00:31:24.331 --> 00:31:28.000
I've always been that third way.
That's fine.
Minority.
But we had,

541
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.800
we had rare victories but big ones,
you know,
like the end of slavery,
you know,

542
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.390
um,
was just glorious.

543
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:38.050
I mean the protection of the great banking empires of Europe from,

544
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.120
from the populace rabble,
you know,
from the,

545
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.550
from the preachers who wanted to destroy it.

546
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.290
There were these great victories of the victory of free trade,
you know,
but,

547
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.280
but we've won every once while,

548
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.900
and it always changed the world because once you have a little bit of freedom,

549
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.140
just a little bit,
it just blows up and it becomes awesome.

550
00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:57.280
And it's amazing and it,

551
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.700
and it kills power because it's so powerful and so wonderful,

552
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.170
but it's worth fighting for.
And we've always fought mainly through ideas,

553
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.310
not through army's,
not through,
through guns and controlling states.

554
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:14.311
It's always been the philosophical awesomeness of this position has been the

555
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:19.450
celebration of the common man,
uh,
celebration of,
of wealth,

556
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.670
of the love of,

557
00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:25.220
of consumerism and commercial life for the coming together of people they noble

558
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.390
meant of people that the,
the right of,
of travel,
uh,

559
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.760
the right of association and to do what you want to have as many children as you

560
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:35.670
want,
to educate your kids the way you want to,

561
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.710
that these kinds of principles are compelling and they've always led to victory

562
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.010
for liberals despite the pressure from the other two sides.

563
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.560
And I think that's,
I think it's going to be our future.
I do.
