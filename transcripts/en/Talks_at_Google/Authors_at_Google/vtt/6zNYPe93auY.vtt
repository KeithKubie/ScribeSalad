00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.297
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:06.640
SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.210
Welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.640
Thanks so much for
joining us today.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.626
It's my pleasure to
welcome Sarah Robb

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:14.860
O'Hagan to the office to
talk about her new book,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.550
"Extreme You--

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.760
Step up, Stand Out,
Kick Ass, Repeat."

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.370
The book not only inspires
you to take risks and step out

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.940
of the box, but is also
funny, entertaining,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.770
and super-interesting
as she takes you

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.941
through her own personal
journey of success and failure,

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.940
and how they have got her
to where she is today.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.564
Please join me in welcoming her.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.280
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Thank you.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.780
Good morning, Googlers.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.694
How is everyone?

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:43.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.770
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
Ready to rock it out?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.770
All right.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.850
So I generally like to stop my
talks with just a little bit

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.866
of context.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.340
Where's the crazy accent from?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.590
I am from New Zealand.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.725
Has anyone been
there in the room?

00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:57.369
Ah, yes.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:58.160
There's always one.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
There's two!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.380
Is it amazing?

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.900
It's kind of amazing.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.840
It was discovered
in 1769, actually,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.290
by Captain James Cook,
who wrote in his log book,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.770
I believe I have found God zone.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.978
I mean, I'm not even kidding.

00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:13.370
It's the most gorgeous
place on the planet.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.950
So why would I leave
New Zealand, you wonder?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.500
Well, there's like
4 million people

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.092
and almost 50 million sheep.

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:21.050
Let's just start there.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.970
That is not like a joke.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.290
That is exactly what
my country looks like.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230
So as a young person
growing up, you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.770
can imagine I had a lot
of like, well, is this it?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.560
Is this my people, or is
there more in the world?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.290
How do we go beyond?

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.600
New Zealand is also
a country that is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.860
very passionate about sports.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.640
I love that I've got my crew
team in the back row here

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.510
today.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.810
So like Americans-- we're
really into sport in America.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.940
Well, in New Zealand,
we're a little country,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.590
but we like swing hard.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.410
In the 1984 Olympics,
which most of you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.900
probably can't even remember
because you weren't born,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.630
I was like a 12-year-old
watching on TV

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.920
as we got the most medals
we've ever won in our history.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.960
And that was 12 medals.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.760
You guys, it's amazing.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.789
We were number 1 on the global
per capita medals table.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.510
That's a big deal to us.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.790
But what's really cool about
it is every medal that we won

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.900
involved a sport where
they were sitting down.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.710
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.670
Look at the pictures.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.840
Like, literally.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.260
Cycling, rowing,
kayaking, horse riding.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.420
I could go on,
like we crushed it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.420
at the sports that involved--
who would have thought, right?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.430
So why am I sharing
this funny story

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.980
with you, is
because I do believe

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.290
as a young person growing
up, it did leave quite

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.310
a profound thought with me.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.270
And that is that it
takes extreme focus

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.010
to achieve
extraordinary results.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.620
Like those little kiwis
punching above their weight,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.710
you have to really
have focus on something

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.540
that is your unique specialty.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.670
And you'll see in
the pictures here,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.820
I've had the great pleasure of
working for some of the world's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.200
most incredible brands.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.660
Sustaining, amazing brands.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.410
And what they all have in
common is this detailed focus

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.770
on what they are, where they're
going, why they're unique.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.510
And they don't get distracted
as the years go by.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.400
And that's especially
important when the landscape

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.110
is so rapidly changing.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.370
And for me being someone who's
gone everything from Virgin

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.030
Megastores-- does anyone even
remember Virgin Megastores--

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.040
when the music
industry got disrupted

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.410
and that company no
longer exists through

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.680
to the likes of Nike, which is
driving innovation and pushing

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.110
forward more than any
other company in the world.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.660
The big difference is
those that consistently

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.940
play their own game,
but just stay in front

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.930
and disrupt themselves before
the industry does it to them.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.210
So I've had these great
career experiences.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.520
And the process
of writing my book

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.380
led me to say, well,
what does this actually

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.380
mean for individuals
as well and leaders?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.310
And you can see here, over the
last three years, it's been,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
I have interviewed 25 of some of
the most profoundly successful

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.440
people on the planet.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.140
Because I wanted to know,
just like those brands,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.920
what is it about them that
uniquely enables them to stay

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.360
on the top of their game?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.330
And what I did is I
went to great lengths

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.370
to sort of go to
all walks of life.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.230
So you see some of
the pictures here,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.540
everyone from Condoleezza
Rice, who we all know,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.090
who is like the world's
most amazing bad-ass,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.226
through to Bode Miller,
who's a downhill skier,

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.350
through to Mister Cartoon,
who's one of the world's

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.300
most famous tattoo artists.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.100
Sam Kass, the White House chef.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.360
What they all have in common
is this incredible ability

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.550
to know their own specialties,
to know what they're

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.850
amazing at, to focus,
like those little kiwis,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.460
and to constantly
disrupt themselves.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.590
Whenever they get to
mastery, push themselves

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.750
to the next level.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.080
So with that said, I
think about this framework

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.660
that I've been developing
and discovering.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.400
And it starts with
you, the person,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.350
like those individuals
I just talked about.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.610
What is extreme you?

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.380
What is you at your
most optimum potential?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.960
What is the core set of
skills that you have?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.240
And generally, extremers,
as I call them,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.620
are not well-rounded.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.120
They're not the
kinds of people that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.460
have tons of experience
in a lot of places.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.770
They're probably super-good
at one specialty,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.370
and really passionate
about it, and we love them

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.340
in the workplace.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.200
However, they need
to be partnered

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.850
with complementary people
to become extreme teams,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.140
like when we get lots of
complementary skills together.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.530
And then ultimately,
the extreme organization

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.540
is that organization
that is loaded

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.320
with people with incredible
skills in specialist areas.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.550
But together, they come together
and focus on a really, really

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.200
focused mission.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.620
So with that said, I'm going to
go through three examples today

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.350
of the kind of key
tenants that I learned

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.210
from all these amazing
businesses and all

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.330
these amazing leaders in
developing the idea that

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.830
was "Extreme You."

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.150
And the first one is what I like
to call make failure your fuel.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.200
It is possibly my most
favorite topic in the world.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.580
And it starts with
the fact that I

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.800
have had a career, mainly in
the sports and fitness industry.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.300
If you Googled me
a couple of years

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.040
ago, what you would
have seen is that I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.020
was known for turning around
Gatorade, a $5 billion sports

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.167
drink business.

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.250
I had all these things
like, "Fast Company's" Most

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.416
Creative People in Business.

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.980
That looks amazing, right?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.220
But what it totally left out
was the fact that in my 20s,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.110
I got fired not once,
but twice back to back.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.090
And I like to share
the story because I

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.570
believe in our culture
today of success.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.290
Whether it's lists of the
40 under 40, 30 under 30,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.220
20 under 20.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.710
Whether it's perfectly
coiffed Instagram pictures,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.754
we tend to show all
the amazing stuff

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:48.170
and we don't tend to show some
of the really embarrassing,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.290
not so cool stuff.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.770
So one of the reasons
I wrote this book was I

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.460
felt it was important to share,
particularly with young people,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.740
that you have to fail in
order to know who you are

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.800
and in order to
succeed in the future.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.660
My example of Virgin,
like I mentioned,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.940
was Virgin Megastores.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.360
I joined in the late '90s, the
year Napster had come along.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.190
So let's just go there.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.570
Remember that.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.090
I still remember
like our big moment.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.150
It was May and we had to
comp Ricky Martin's album

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.460
sales from the year before.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.690
Like, that's how awesome it was.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.030
But in the end, the
company actually

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.610
went under for all the
reasons I said before,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.070
because they were being
disrupted from outside

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.490
and not taking
care of themselves.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.060
But my experience
was someone who'd

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.990
come in from a high-flying role
at Virgin Atlantic Airways.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.350
I thought I had it down.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.140
I was like, rocking
and rolling, not

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.970
listening to anyone around me
in a totally foreign business.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.605
So over my skis, so arrogant.

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:45.800
And I got fired.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.072
Not like laid off,
one-person fired.

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:51.530
And let me explain
to you what that

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.187
feels like when you go into the
office and HR is sitting there.

00:07:55.187 --> 00:07:57.020
And you feel the blood
rush out of your face

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.640
and you get told that you
have a one-week severance.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.467
They're getting rid
of your green card

00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:04.550
application and your visa.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.130
And you get a one-way
ticket back to New Zealand.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.320
In other words, we don't
want you in our company.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.903
We don't even want
you in our country.

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:13.050
Like, that's how awesome it was.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.924
So I go through that,
and then desperate times

00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:18.090
call for desperate measures.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.250
I have three months to
stay in the country.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.010
And I end up taking
a job at Atari.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.880
Does anyone in this
room remember Atari?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.250
Some fond fans, I would imagine.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.840
Which was a disaster for me
because I completely overlooked

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.940
the fact that I cannot
stand video games.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.939
Never have liked him.

00:08:33.939 --> 00:08:34.980
Have no interest in them.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.900
Don't understand them.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.429
Within two years, that's
another company in distress

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.220
and a bunch of people
are getting laid off.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.730
And of course, I'm one of them.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.320
So by this stage, I'm
now in my late 20s.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.700
I've had up to four years
of epic career failure.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.610
Disastrous.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.910
I call it fondly my
"canyon of career despair."

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.530
It was terrible.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.660
But here's the thing.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.610
That same person that
was a total flame-out

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.850
in these two environments.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.280
Eventually, after
I leave Atari, I'm

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.020
desperately trying to
find the right role

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.895
for me going forward.

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:10.950
I finally land at
Nike after 12 months

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.560
of interviewing and trying
and getting in the door.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.990
And that same
loser girl suddenly

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.850
becomes on the fast track,
having a great career,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.700
and rocking and rolling.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.280
And the lesson
here for me was you

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.520
have to experience extreme
environments to understand

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.920
where you suck and
where you thrive.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.080
And when you get yourself
onto the playing field

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.864
where you thrive,
it feels amazing.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.030
And you know the difference.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.720
And all your
confidence comes back.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.140
And that is the importance of
failure on the way to success.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.270
Because quite
honestly, had I not

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.870
just gone through those
two back-to-back firings,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.499
I don't think I would have had
the humility coming in the door

00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:49.290
to succeed at Nike.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.910
I mean, literally
I walk in the door

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.650
and I'm like, please,
don't fire me.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.150
Please, don't fire me.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.120
I will do anything
to do well here.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.790
And one of the great
athletes that I

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.920
had the pleasure of working
with when I was at Nike

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.670
was Bode Miller.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.020
Do you guys know Bode?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.220
He's awesome, by the way.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.750
I mean, the best
skier in the world

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.520
to watch because
there is nothing

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.550
between disqualified and gold.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.370
That's just the way he rolls.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.000
But I really got to know
him around the 2006 Torino

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.570
Olympics.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.530
And he's extraordinary when
you talk to him about failure.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.590
Because he talked
about as a child, when

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.290
he was learning to
ski in New Hampshire,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.350
he physically was smaller
than the other skiers,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.060
so he kept coming
in like 30th, 40th.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.450
Like, certainly not
podium potential, right?

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.060
And the trainers kept
saying to all of them,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.700
well, you've just got to kind
of push yourself incrementally.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.430
That was the way they were
training skiers in those days.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.400
And he's like, well, that
ain't working for me, clearly.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.040
So finally, he's like,
I got to go my own way

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.240
and figure this out.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.310
And he starts
skiing in practice,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.050
like balls to the wall.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.500
If anyone's watched this guy
ski, there is no holding back.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.470
And he would crash a lot.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.180
And it was painful.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.730
But as he said,
that was pushing him

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.850
to the edge of his own
boundaries, edge of his comfort

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.750
level, and teaching him to
be able to eventually recover

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.770
in those crashes to
get to the next level.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.880
So on race day, when the other
guys suddenly go full steam

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.210
ahead, they're crashing.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.840
He actually now can
push to a higher level

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.690
because he's taught himself
through the very act

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.320
of crashing and failing and
pain to get to the next level.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.710
So a great metaphor
for all of us as we

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.601
think about our own careers.

00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:35.100
All right.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.650
So that's making
failure your fuel.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.540
Number 2, I like
to talk about is

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.340
playing your specialist game.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.090
What does that mean
for you personally?

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.780
So I came upon this idea from
studying these great brands

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.610
and businesses that
I've been lucky enough

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.999
to be involved with.

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:54.290
And I would pick out a few
here just to share with you.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.830
So Virgin Atlantic Airways.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.810
Has anyone flown Virgin?

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.570
Is it not awesome?

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.800
You get your hair
done at the clubhouse.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.120
It's amazing.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.050
But Virgin's super-interesting
to me because having spent

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.910
about eight years in
the airline industry,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.200
most of you would know if
you fly United or American--

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.940
especially this week.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.710
But their target audience
is generally human beings

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.750
with arms and legs.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.860
You know what I'm saying?

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.943
Whereas, Virgin, when they
came into the business,

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:26.840
they're like, we're not
going after everyone.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.490
We're going to have this
really defined position.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.350
And we're going
to focus on people

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.140
who are into culture, and
technology, and entertainment,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.190
and fashion.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.800
Everything was built
around that positioning.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.220
And as a result, they've
built this incredible position

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.480
as an airline.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.140
They think of the
travel experience,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.470
I think, more as
entertainment than travel.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.264
I mean, they even
got to the point

00:12:48.264 --> 00:12:49.680
where they were
able to sort of be

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.110
an arbiter of great
taste of movies in flight

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.020
because they thought
about it that way.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.860
Likewise, Strava.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.500
Do I have any Strava
users in the room?

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.910
I cannot believe that.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.295
We've got to get you
out on your bikes, guys.

00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:05.470
Strava is the social
network for athletes.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.390
They're based out
in Silicon Valley.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.560
And what they do is, obviously,
track runners, cycling,

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.390
all these sort of
fitness activities.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.270
But as the founder said to
me when I interviewed them

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.150
for my book, like at
the time they were born,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.860
the Fitbit market
was what everyone

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.320
was going after because
it's big and it's massive.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.140
And they like, well, we could
have done that, but then we

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.620
would have been number 10 in
a giant market instead of they

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.200
just went after cyclists
and only cyclists.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.570
And they were number 1 for
this really small group.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.580
And from there, they've
managed to push out

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.510
because they're going after
very, very passionate athletes.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.420
And then lastly, the Drybar.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.310
Ladies in this room nodding.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.890
The guys right now
are going, WTF?

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.910
What is Drybar?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.540
They are.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.860
I can tell.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.080
Drybar is an
extraordinary story.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.620
I love it.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.460
I interviewed Alli, the
founder, for my book.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.132
Basically, for many
years, hairdressing was--

00:14:00.132 --> 00:14:01.590
certainly, on the
women's side, you

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.660
go to a hairdresser
and anything you

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.980
want to get done, you get done.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.510
So cuts, colors, get your hair
blown out, any of the above.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.790
Well Alli, who
founded the Drybar,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.660
was like, I really don't
want to do all of that stuff.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.360
I'm just really good
at blowing out hair

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.150
because I've loved doing
it since I was a child.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.580
And I want to create
an entire concept just

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.560
around that one thing.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.660
Now, most people would
say, how the hell

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.300
are you going to build a
business around that one thing

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.270
when women need all these
other things done from a beauty

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.140
standpoint as well?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.598
But she's like, I'm going to
be better than anyone at doing

00:14:36.598 --> 00:14:37.680
this one thing.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.670
Sure enough, Drybar is now
coming close to 100 million

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.890
top-line business
based on the fact

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.820
that she's created an entire
category out of this one thing.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.060
Because women, we didn't
used to rock along and spend

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.880
$65 for a blow out
once or twice a week.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.210
Because the category didn't
exist, she's now created it.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.210
And there's many, obviously,
people following her.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.620
And she gets so many
people saying, well,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.184
why don't you add makeup, or
nails, or all the other things

00:15:07.184 --> 00:15:08.100
that women would want?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.160
She's like, because that would
take away my focus from what

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.330
I'm really, really good at.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.430
And I want to be the
best at this one thing.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.530
And it's such a great
lesson because when

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.800
you take all of
those brand lessons,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.410
and then think about
yourself as an individual.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.990
How do you think about
yourself being positioned

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.510
like a brand would be?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.860
How do you think
about your career

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.670
in terms of imagining
that you are

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.850
that product in the
marketplace that you're trying

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.100
to attract people to come by?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.040
Do you feel just like
those three examples

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.180
that you are super-uniquely
differentiated?

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.109
Do you feel like
the airline example

00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:47.400
that you're just trying to
be all things to all people?

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.470
Or do you have your
one unique thing?

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.030
Do you feel like
Alli, that you have

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.600
that specialty that you really
are better at than anyone else?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.790
Because I do believe
when you have that,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.010
and you become super
world-class, that

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:03.250
propels your career forward.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.110
So in my example, I actually
spent most of my life

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.730
being really, really,
really average.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.360
So I'm talking
really wanted to be

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.060
a world-class Olympic
medal-winning athlete.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.670
Never made the
A-team in any sport

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.040
that I participated in at all.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.790
Really wanted to be a
world-famous singer or actress.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.350
Never got picked for solos.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.660
Actually, when we did
"Grease" at my high school,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.950
I didn't even make
the pink ladies.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.430
I was that section that
doesn't go on the stage.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.310
Clearly, just not cut
out to be really amazing

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.270
in any of those things.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.330
However, who would
have thought--

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.620
I didn't know--

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.900
15, 20 years later,
when I finally

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.350
had gone through all these
trials and tribulations, that

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.710
what I actually was developing
was this incredibly competitive

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.220
mindset.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.844
I'm probably the most
competitive human

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.820
being in the room right now.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.190
Combined with a
very creative brain

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.500
developed through tons
and tons of music.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.020
Combined with years of
adventuring in the travel

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.420
industry, which
all comes together

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.300
to make me uniquely good
at innovation in the sports

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.262
and fitness industry.

00:17:07.262 --> 00:17:08.220
Who would have thought?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.761
I didn't even know
that was a career.

00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:11.880
But when I pulled
those things together,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.829
that's where I
suddenly found, wait,

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.250
I'm not getting fired anymore.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.010
I've pulled it all together.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.690
And it's interesting
for all of you

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.030
to understand, what
is that for you?

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.710
Because when you find
it, when you know it,

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.690
when opportunity
knocks-- boy, you

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.610
have to knock down the door.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.660
And in my case, I, actually,
about six months ago,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.910
was not working, not
looking for a job

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.430
because I was working on
the launch of this book.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.617
And along comes an opportunity
with Flywheel Sports.

00:17:40.617 --> 00:17:42.700
And I don't know if you
guys are familiar with it.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.420
I'll quickly tell you a
little bit about Flywheel.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.060
But it's unique
because it's not just

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.900
playing in the sports
and fitness industry.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.900
It's actually way
into the specialty

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.220
that I happen to be uniquely
good at and passionate about.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.700
So if you think about the
fitness industry right now--

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.000
and this may be going on in many
industries around the world--

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.140
we are moving fast from
one-size-fits-all to specialist

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.950
categories.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.180
This is really interesting.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.110
Back in the '90s, if
you think about retail,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.200
we used to go to the
department store,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.540
and then we started
going to boutique retail.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.170
The same thing is
happening in fitness.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.720
So you see all these little
boutiques popping up.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.140
I'm sure some of you in the
room are attending them.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.440
Whether it's cycling, little
running boutiques, boot camp,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.930
like Barry's Bootcamp, if
anyone's attended that.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.990
Zumba from a dance
standpoint, yoga,

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.550
all these little boutiques.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.860
Now, those feel very specialist.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.910
But interestingly, even
within the cycling category,

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.500
you would think that in
itself is a specialty.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.730
But actually, there's three
different kinds of approach

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.980
to cycling as a category.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.380
So if you look at
the kinds of people

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.520
that are attracted into
the boutique cycling world,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.940
you have some for whom it's
a really social experience.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.740
The number 1 reason
they're coming

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.320
is to be social and hang
out with their friends.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.590
You have others, like my friend
in the middle of the room here,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.590
who attends Flywheel,
who probably were

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.940
playing sports in high school.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.180
They're probably a
little bit competitive.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.070
Would I guess at that
just a little bit?

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.150
And they come for
performance because they're

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.330
trying to push their athletic
performance to the next level.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.930
And then lastly, we
have people for whom

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.010
routine is what gets them in
the door to a fitness offering.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.482
Because they don't love it.

00:19:27.482 --> 00:19:29.940
It's not their lifestyle, but
they know they have to do it.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.314
So they're just
looking for, what

00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:33.720
is the thing that is most
convenient to where I live?

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.480
Three different people with
three completely different

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.370
motivations around which to
build a cycling business.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.210
So the notion here is to be
spectacular for a few instead

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.830
of being average for many.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.670
I love this chart.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.920
You will all be able to find
yourselves on this chart.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.300
This is the US population
and everybody's attitudes

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.310
to physical activity
and fitness.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.210
So I will walk you through it.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.390
To your right is 30% of the
population is simply inactive.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.760
Totally don't work out at all.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.720
They exist.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.100
They're hard for me to
understand, but they exist.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.220
Then, we have 18%,
which are what

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.650
we call chore exercisers,
for whom they really

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.120
don't like fitness.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.530
The doctor told them to do it.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.970
It's not fun at all, but they
do get out and push themselves.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.760
Then, you have had workers,
physical laborers, obviously.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.130
And then we get into
the more active.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.920
So the social group
I mentioned before,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.620
for whom it's a really
social activity that they

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.300
want to get out there.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.410
And then, the routines,
as I mentioned.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.950
And then, these last two
groups, passionate exercisers

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.120
and competitive athletes.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.330
Now, competitive athletes.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.939
15% of this population
intellectually type

00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:46.980
as a competitive athlete.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.100
That means you cannot let
your kids win at monopoly.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.860
That means wherever you are,
if you're on a treadmill

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.861
next to someone, you are
aware of their numbers,

00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:56.193
and you are trying to go faster.

00:20:56.193 --> 00:20:57.360
You cannot help yourself.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.550
That is what a
competitive athlete is.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.330
And Flywheel has completely
attracted that one,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.840
tiny segment because everything
about our offering-- we

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.090
have technology so you can
track your performance,

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.940
compete with others in the
room, compete with yourself.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.911
And that is where we
focus all our energy.

00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:16.410
We don't try and
go after all of it.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.370
We go after just one.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.880
And I do believe as a business,
that makes us stronger.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.180
And certainly, as a leader.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.500
I'm like, I'm with my people.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.730
So I feel very comfortable
intuitively with the decisions

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.980
that I'm trying to make.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.660
OK.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.910
That was your specialist game.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.800
So now lastly, I'm going to talk
about breaking yourself to make

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.830
herself, which is an important
lesson that I learned,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.470
particularly from the extremers
I interviewed, that you

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.660
can never get complacent.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.900
So firstly, that means
breaking yourself as a leader.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.160
And I do believe, having gone
through the experience of being

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.470
fired a couple times, it really
sucks when it's done to you.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.200
It's a whole lot better
to do it to yourself.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.020
And that means
really recognizing,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.234
when are you in
your comfort zone?

00:22:03.234 --> 00:22:05.400
When have you been doing
the same thing for a while?

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.420
You've achieved mastery.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.950
You feel amazing.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.680
When is that time to
push to a different place

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.180
and get uncomfortable?

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.090
Now in my case, I actually
quit my job a year ago

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.040
to do just that.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.310
I knew I wasn't
personally growing.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.920
It was the scariest thing
I've ever done in my life.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.210
But my god, it's like I'd
rather that than I didn't do it.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.640
A few years went by, and I
suddenly wasn't keeping up.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.050
And I got laid off again, right?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.970
So what does that mean for you?

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.950
Where is that moment in
your career where you

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.880
have to really push outside?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.270
And it involves challenging
your most stubborn beliefs.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.700
I really have found, from a
lot of the research I've done,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.309
that we do tend to in our
minds get these kind of beliefs

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:50.850
early on in our
career that we're not

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.470
good at certain things.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.160
That we are either an analytical
person or a creative person,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.000
or whatever the
category might be.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.159
Often, those become
our blind spots

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.200
and we just don't kind of
want to deal with them.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.600
But actually, you
should deal with them.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.270
And it's OK.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.230
That's breaking yourself
down to make yourself.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.960
Like, what is it that you are
sort of avoiding in your job?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.880
It isn't an area of
decision-making strength

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.810
for you.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.440
Can you go and take an
out-of-work class on it

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.227
to really push yourself
to the next level?

00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:23.643
Because that is
the kind of thing,

00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:25.900
it will feel uncomfortable,
but it will certainly

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.180
get you there.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.992
And then, break
yourself as a business.

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.450
So you've got to
think as a leader,

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.102
it is your responsibility
to constantly get

00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:37.060
outside your comfort zone
and learn new things.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.730
But you also have to think
as a business, what does

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.380
that mean organizationally?

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.200
I had the great experience
of working at Nike,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.310
and then leaving at around the
time when the whole company was

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.730
re-orientating itself in terms
of how they worked together.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.450
Going from footwear, apparel,
and equipment to categories--

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.640
soccer, running, et cetera.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.370
And what that caused
was all of the employees

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.270
to move into a different place
of how they were interacting

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.780
with different
people to innovate,

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.960
which was actually
incredibly uncomfortable.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.717
But obviously, leads to new
thinking and new innovation.

00:24:10.717 --> 00:24:12.300
So what does that
mean for your teams?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.280
Can you get them into
different train tracks

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.500
in order to create
new innovation?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.180
And inspiration.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.750
It's so important, I believe,
to look outside your category

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.470
to get inspiration for what
you may do going forward.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.900
If I think about Strava,
like if we were just

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.190
to stay in category, we'd
be looking at LinkedIn,

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.190
at Facebook, at all of the
obvious social networking

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.980
players and say, let's do
the same thing as them.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.930
But guess what?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.170
Strava is probably, possibly
one of the only Silicon Valley

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.840
brands that people
tattoo on their ankles

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.610
because they are so
passionate about it.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.640
So we need to look at the
likes of Harley-Davidson

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.310
for inspiration, not
those other brands.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.500
Or, in terms of
an ad marketplace,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.410
we're more relevant to look
at the local cycling shop

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.120
and how they are
curating products

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.616
for their passionate riders,
the necessary regular online ad

00:25:05.616 --> 00:25:06.115
marketplace.

00:25:06.115 --> 00:25:08.860
So thinking about
breaking yourself down

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.920
and getting inspiration
from other places.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.880
And then lastly-- apologies
for putting that Disney song

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.130
into your heads.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.440
It's going to stay there now--

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.400
let it go.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.040
And what I mean by this
is breaking yourself down

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.490
by definition means
letting go of things

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.690
that are comfortable to you.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.610
And it's not going to
feel good, but what

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.130
happens on the
other side is always

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.500
profound amounts of growth.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.740
I think about whether that means
relocating to a different city

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.240
because you got a
job opportunity.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.910
Whether it means moving
into a different department

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.740
that you're uncomfortable with.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.742
Always, you have to let
go of something that

00:25:46.742 --> 00:25:47.950
was comfortable to get there.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.110
But always, once
you're through it,

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.220
it's incredibly empowering
in terms of how you grow.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.440
And I would say from all
of the people I interviewed

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.160
for my book, this was the
one thing that really blew me

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.410
away the most, was
that these were

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.540
like massively
accomplished people

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.550
at the top of their game.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.840
Yet, so willing to be humble
and take a step back and say,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.675
I'm going to start
over in something

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.800
because I want to learn
more, which is a hard thing

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.420
to do when you're already
at the top of your game.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.020
So it is about letting go.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.260
And that's my three
lessons for the day.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.840
So making failure
your fuel, knowing

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.390
what your specialist game is.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.460
And then lastly, break
himself to make yourself,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.040
to really push yourself
to the next level.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.570
And so with that, I think
we have time for questions,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.384
I believe.

00:26:40.384 --> 00:26:41.320
Don't be shy.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.080
Hi there.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.680
AUDIENCE: So you started the
talk about how in New Zealand,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.450
there was a big focus on
exercise and outdoor activity.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.070
So do you think that maybe
what didn't go well at Atari

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.140
and some of the others were even
just the content of the job?

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.140
Like you had to
work at a company

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.570
where you had core
values or passions?

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.220
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
Definitely, yeah.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.400
I think passions
and understanding.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.920
Because you're 100% right.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.310
I can still remember being in
this office in Santa Monica--

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.950
this is at Atari-- with a ton
of the programming guys who

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:20.520
would--

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.860
literally, they
had zero interest

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.160
in going outside into any
part of the universe other

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.020
than working together.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.370
And I was just like,
how is that possible?

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.200
It's sunny outside.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.150
We should all be
going for a run.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.660
It just was a total disconnect.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.730
And I don't judge
that group of people.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.840
That's their lifestyle.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.070
But I don't understand it.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.540
I didn't have a
connection to it.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.950
So I think it's important to
not only have a passion for it.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:53.490
But when you do, you have a
lot more just sheer confidence

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.210
to make decisions
and take risks.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.420
So in the case of
video games, you're

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.730
faced with, should I
do this or should I

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.970
do that in picking which title
we're going to get behind

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.230
for the Christmas season?

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.320
I don't know. because
I'm not that player.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.600
Yet, when I'm in
suddenly, Nike, it's

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.921
like asking me questions
about how an athlete is

00:28:11.921 --> 00:28:13.170
going to respond to something.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.910
I'm like, I got this
because I lived it.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.440
I know it.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.560
So I do think it is about
the content, but also

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:27.210
your own just drive and passion
to get behind it for sure.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.390
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you
very much for your talk.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.240
I loved the point about really
knowing what you're great at

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.865
and focusing and
doubling down on that.

00:28:33.865 --> 00:28:36.364
And I'm wondering if you could
talk a little bit more about,

00:28:36.364 --> 00:28:39.140
do you think about that as
like a functional expertise,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.714
an industry expertise,
the type of organization

00:28:41.714 --> 00:28:42.380
to be a part of?

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.796
Because I think
what's interesting

00:28:43.796 --> 00:28:46.040
is you did many different
things at different places.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.100
So kind of, what's
the common thread

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.990
between knowing what
you're really good at?

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.990
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: And
what's the common thread

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.890
between airlines, music,
video games, and sports?

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.640
Because I think that
is a great question.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.900
And one of the things that
I write about in the book

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.900
is that I believe
that the system is

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.790
designed to make you fit in.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.820
I think for most of us,
whether it's in high school.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.560
You know how we all
kind of got labeled

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.290
as you're either
super-smart, or a jock,

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.870
or-- and likewise, you
get your first job.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.880
And I do think your first job--
like recruiters are typically

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.100
going to want to keep
you in the same place.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.000
I was in the airlines for six
years, and all I wanted to do

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.870
was work for Nike.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.920
Like in my head, I'm a
marketing person in a brand.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.690
It doesn't matter
what category it is.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.540
But the recruiters were like,
you're an airline person.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.550
And I'm like, do I look
like I sniff jet fuel?

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.190
Like, no.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.730
I'm not.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.530
Do you know what I mean?

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.730
And so I do believe that
you are the only one that

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.210
can navigate yourself
out of those verticals

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.460
that people will put you into.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.060
And you have to do it.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.690
And then, the
question is, you ask,

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.500
is it industry or functional?

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.340
I actually think it's a process
of self-discovery to figure out

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.370
what it is for you.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.810
It might be that you're just
bang on in the right industry

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.460
and that's exactly
where you should be.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.890
Or, as I found
actually, with a lot

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.620
of the people I
interviewed, many of them

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.570
didn't figure out
where they're place

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.350
was to sort of land until
well into their 30s.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.030
And even though
you might go, well,

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.041
did that mean the first
10 years was wasted?

00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:25.540
No.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.160
Like in every
instance, it was kind

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.300
of taking an expertise from here
and connecting it over here.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.490
Great example is one
of my favorite stories

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:37.760
in the book was a woman
who had done her MBA.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.930
She was consulting and
in the music industry.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.290
And so she was doing marketing,
representing Gwen Stefani like

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.630
at the top of the game, right?

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.490
Yet, deep down inside,
she was a singer.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.030
And she's like, I'm really
miserable because I'm marketing

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.920
all these other
people and I'm not

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.780
going back to what
I did as a child.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.330
So she goes and basically,
long story short,

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.790
studies her singing again
and ends up coming back

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.350
and ends up singing
at the Oscars

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.765
when "Slumdog Millionaire"
was nominated.

00:31:04.765 --> 00:31:06.550
It's a great story.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.160
Which leads her into--

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.800
OK, now I'm going to
be a full-time artist.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.230
And who would have thought
all that business experience

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.520
enabled her to create--

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.920
she's now created her own brand.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.330
So it does come together.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.860
And I think it's
just about having

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.405
the willingness to
pursue new experiences,

00:31:24.405 --> 00:31:26.530
even if it means it feels
like you're starting over

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.321
because you're not.

00:31:27.321 --> 00:31:30.710
You're going to be adding
it to what you already had.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.640
Definitely.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.610
Two questions.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.250
One, I'm curious what
your sport was or is

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.940
in addition to spinning.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.130
And then second, I
thought the breakdown

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.500
of competitive,
social, and convenience

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.760
was really interesting.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.430
And from the
perspective of Flywheel,

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.020
competitive
definitely makes sense

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.490
with the spinning part of it.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.330
How does barre fit into that?

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.780
Because if you're going for a
specialization of competition,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.360
that to me doesn't
quite [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.443
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: It's
very different, for sure.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.440
At Flywheel, we have
the secondary offering

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.070
called FlyBarre, which is
a barre workout, for anyone

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.310
who knows what that is.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.962
It doesn't feel
like it's the right

00:32:16.962 --> 00:32:18.670
complement because it
feels like it would

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.700
be a different type of consumer,
but it is precision training.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.310
And what we find
is that people who

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:28.990
are doing Flywheel, that's
doing a lot of cardio for them.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.860
But they also need
to complement that.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.750
And our barre program is not
the easiest one on the market

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.260
by any stretch.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.630
And so I think it really appeals
to that person who's like, OK,

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.230
I'm in.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.060
I'm going to go and
really feel it today.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.840
So it does actually end up
connecting because of the type

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.970
of programming that it is.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.981
And then to answer your
question, I tried field hockey.

00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:52.480
Failed.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.180
Tried tennis.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.680
Failed.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.190
Skiing.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.940
Failed.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.550
Water skiing.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.050
Failed.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:56.590
Sailing.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.170
All of the above.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.540
But now I do a lot of
Flywheel, obviously.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.110
And running.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.027
And I do Tough Mudders.

00:33:05.027 --> 00:33:06.610
Anyone in this room
done Tough Mudder?

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.651
One of the great stories
in the book, by the way,

00:33:08.651 --> 00:33:11.080
is Will, the founder
of Tough Mudder,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.650
because that's a great example
to your question of his parents

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.650
are like, can't you
just go be a consultant?

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.710
And he's like, no, I want to
electrocute people for fun.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.600
It didn't sound like it was
going to be a huge success.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.450
Now, I believe they have
something like 3 million people

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.870
have taken these
things globally.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.750
I mean, it's off-the-chart
success story.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.900
But a great example
of he had taken

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.280
all these weird experiences.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.582
He worked in the
Counterterrorism Unit.

00:33:38.582 --> 00:33:40.040
He went to Harvard
Business School,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.930
like all these crazy things
to create this sort of unheard

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:44.740
of concept.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.382
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:50.382 --> 00:33:52.340
So one thing that I really
like about Flywheel,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.881
and I think a lot
of other people do,

00:33:53.881 --> 00:33:57.590
is how it's like kind of on the
forefront of workout technology

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.330
and how you can learn so
much more about yourself.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.220
So my question for you is
kind of like, what technology

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.650
is coming next for Flywheel?

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.066
And like, where
are you guys going

00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:08.000
to take it in, say, five years?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.428
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
Oh, it's coming.

00:34:10.428 --> 00:34:11.719
So yeah, it's a great question.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:15.980
Because Flywheel actually
pioneered the technology

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.550
on the bike.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.940
So for anyone who has been in
the world of fitness for years,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.330
spinning was created in
the '90s, like spinning,

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.130
indoor cycling.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.650
But for many, years,
you could be that person

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.150
in the back of a
dark room when they

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.733
said turn up the
resistance and you're

00:34:30.733 --> 00:34:32.550
sort of kind of pretending.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.980
Not really.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.250
And what Flywheel did was
add technology to the bike

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.280
so that when you were riding,
the instructor would say,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.320
I want your
resistance to be here

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.820
and I want you to
be hitting this

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.699
on the RPMs, which is holding
you very, very accountable,

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:47.900
as you know.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.850
And what's neat
about that, I think,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.250
is that people can
then hold themselves

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.790
accountable over a long period
of time to how they're doing.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.580
So now, I do believe--

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.740
and just with the team that we
are working with at Flywheel,

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.410
we all believe that the future
of fitness is accountability.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.840
I think we're going to see
this more and more and more

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.280
across every category,
where people--

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.620
they want to know the output of
that particular piece of effort

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.780
compared to anything else
that they were doing.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.910
It's not a perfect science yet,
because we can't track things

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.480
like barre in the same way
that we can a cycling workout.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.060
But I believe that's where
all of our effort needs to go.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.830
I also believe that
the fitness industry--

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.350
and as you guys know, we
have the quantified self--

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.000
we got a little bit
too carried away

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.060
with tracking the data as
opposed to giving insights

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.980
of the data.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.980
Going from sort of numbers
to knowledge, if you will.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.950
And I do think that's
also where the future is.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.010
How do we use that data
to prod you, to push you,

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.570
to get you to go
to the next level?

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.899
So we definitely have
a lot of things coming.

00:35:55.899 --> 00:35:57.440
There's a big
announcement, actually,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.370
coming in three weeks.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.170
So watch the space.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:04.730
But very much, we believe that
technology and accountability

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.650
is at the core of where
fitness is going for sure.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.544
So I love your message of
extreme mastery and focus.

00:36:16.544 --> 00:36:18.460
I was also interested,
though, when you talked

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.780
about challenging yourself.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.720
And if you're a creative person,
try to be more analytical.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.260
So how do you balance the two?

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.680
And how do you decide,
when do you just

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.050
focus on mastery versus
challenging yourself

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.730
to something you're not good at?

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.250
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: So I'll
give you a personal example.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.710
Because I think
all of us, when we

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:40.296
play to our extreme
strengths, you

00:36:40.296 --> 00:36:41.920
go to a different
level of performance.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.770
And for me, innovation,
creativity, all these things,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.150
have always been like,
that I can do easily.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.250
Then, I find myself
president of a $5 billion

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.230
business that's needing
to be turned around.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:58.060
And by the way, when I was 20,
I failed stage 1 accounting.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.760
And so in my head, had my entire
career told myself, I suck.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.300
I suck.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.800
I suck.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.590
I can't do this.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.480
Avoided it.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.370
You And finally, I was in a job
where you can't hide anymore.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.740
And so I actually,
like eventually

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.332
put my hand up to my boss
and I said, this is an issue.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:16.040
I ended up going down
the street actually

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.970
to Harvard Remedial
Finance, which was

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.830
awesome for so many reasons.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:25.130
But here's the thing, I
will never be like a CFO.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.754
But what I did come
back with was actually

00:37:27.754 --> 00:37:28.670
a real passion for it.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.560
I've really enjoyed
it and loved it.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.430
And it is just a
complement so that I

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.810
have a better view that I can
balance my strengths with.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:39.280
So that's one
example where I think

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.400
you need to make sure you're not
just ignoring the blind spots.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.780
That said, I also know I
will never, in any role,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.660
not surround myself with
a really amazing CFO

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.400
because that's not ever going
to be my biggest strength.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.660
So it's about knowing kind
of how to surround yourself

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.650
with the opposite skills as
well as kind of just shoring up

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.590
your knowledge to make sure
it's not a blind spot is

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:03.965
what I would say.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:04.506
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:04.506 --> 00:38:05.464
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Hi.

00:38:05.464 --> 00:38:07.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.900
So a lot of us work at, well,
a very large company or work

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.850
with very large companies where
the break yourself to make

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.050
yourself is more challenging.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.040
And so when you're working in
one of those larger cultures

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.400
that has a lot of inertia
to not change or not break

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.160
their own organization,
what advice

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.120
do you have for staying
true to your own individual,

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.150
and then also impacting
a potential break

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.220
in that organization and
leading that yourself?

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.760
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.280
One of my favorite
chapters in the book

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.220
actually is what I
call "Change the Game."

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.730
And it's my personal
experience of actually

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.580
being at Gatorade, which PepsiCo
you may work with, some of you,

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.960
is a giant company
within which Gatorade

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.730
was one $5 billion piece.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.280
And it required--

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.730
I mean, this was a business
that after the recession

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.610
was a $5 billion top line
that lost $500 million

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:11.840
off the top line in 1 year.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.790
I mean, it was huge, right?

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.960
And so small, incremental change
clearly wasn't going to do it.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.770
Yet, to move everyone
along-- like everything

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.110
that we were needing to
do to fix the business

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:28.850
went totally counter to what had
worked for a really long time.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:30.860
And so you sort of--

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.515
I remember along the
way having-- and there's

00:39:33.515 --> 00:39:37.310
a lot of dramatic moments in
the story where we thought

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.840
we were heading
the right direction

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.620
and the business
didn't start turning.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.240
And everyone's questioning,
have I totally screwed

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.320
up the business?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.790
All of the above.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.410
But I do believe,
like in that case,

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.660
I had two things going for me.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.700
One was that by now, I have
developed this real specialty

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.480
of understanding athletes,
innovation in that space,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.900
and I knew it better than anyone
in terms of the broader peer

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.700
group because it was
where I'd grown up.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.160
And secondly, I'd been
fired twice in my 20s.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.230
So every step of
the way, I remember

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.140
saying to myself, to
the point of inertia,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.440
if I play on the defense,
we're not going to win.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.000
And I am going to get fired.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.370
If I play on the
offense, there's

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.211
a good chance we'll win.

00:40:21.211 --> 00:40:23.210
And there's also a decent
chance I'll get fired,

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.170
but that's OK because
I've been there before.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.800
And I'd rather go
down trying to do

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.640
what I did know how to do best.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.660
And I do believe for
all of us, like we

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.180
get into these situations,
particularly in big companies.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.360
And particularly, in
times like the recession,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.800
where the fear kicks in.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.380
And everyone's
like, but the boss

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.910
said they wanted blah, blah.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.770
And this is what
I've been told to do.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.840
But the boss doesn't
want you to please them.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.520
They want you to drive results.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.120
And I think as long as you can
frame what you're doing around,

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.430
I know this doesn't
feel right, but here's

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.380
the line from a to b.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.490
And stay with it.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.409
And like, go with all
your specialty skills.

00:41:01.409 --> 00:41:03.200
That's the other thing
I really believe in.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.780
You will have so
much more conviction

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.380
if you come from a place that's
your own personal expertise.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.230
And you kind of have no choice
but to go against the inertia.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.300
Because in the end, what
happens if you don't?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.125
So I love that
question, by the way.

00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:18.958
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:26.640
AUDIENCE: One more question
if no one else is in line.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.030
When it comes to the space that
you're in, sort of fitness,

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.400
sports in general,
is there a trend

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.171
that you sort of see coming up
behind you that you're like,

00:41:35.171 --> 00:41:35.670
huh.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.580
That's sort of interesting.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.450
I wonder where that goes?

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.824
Whether it's in the breakdown
of the three different kind

00:41:39.824 --> 00:41:42.000
of spaces, or in your
kind of fitness, or sort

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.820
of what are you seeing out
of the corner of your eye?

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.570
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
It's a great question.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.560
I definitely believe that
the boutique specializing

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.760
phenomenon is at the very
beginning of where it's going.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.520
Boutique fitness has grown
400% in the last 4 years

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.030
and big box gyms
have stayed flat.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.360
And what's interesting
is that people are coming

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.640
into the boutique category--

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.510
a little bit of it is coming
from big, full-service gyms.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.840
A lot of it is people coming in
to fitness for the first time.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.780
It's creating a lot of
energy in the category.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.890
I mean, health and wellness
is in a great place.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.510
But I believe with
boutique, we're

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.830
still at the very beginning.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:27.480
Because nobody's really blown
up and scaled yet the way if you

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.930
go back to retail in the '90s,
like some of those boutique

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.710
brands really took
it to the next level.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.360
And I believe what I'm
seeing, at least, is

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.240
there's a lot of people
coming into the fitness space

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.760
right now.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.340
Whether it's sophisticated
investors, leaders, whatever.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.250
I believe it's all going
to start going upwards

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.020
and scaling in a big way.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.500
I also think that
technology is going

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.710
to be a huge driver in
omni-channel experiences.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.420
I think that's going to be--

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.000
so that you can be a part
of the Flywheel community,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.100
and you can participate
in it wherever

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.690
you may be around the world.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.750
I think that's a big piece
of where we're going.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:10.770
That said, I do think that the
in-person experience is not

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:11.500
going away.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.520
And what I mean by that is, if
you look across retail right

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.497
now, definitely
retail in general

00:43:17.497 --> 00:43:19.830
is suffering because everything
is moving to e-commerce.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.130
But look at what's booming.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:24.390
It's things like theme
parks, restaurants, fitness.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:28.846
Because I believe humans are
craving time with other humans.

00:43:28.846 --> 00:43:31.095
And that's what those kind
of businesses are bringing,

00:43:31.095 --> 00:43:32.370
is experiences together.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.090
So I think that's
not going to go away.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.540
In fact, I think there's a lot
more opportunity right there.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.790
AUDIENCE: Who were your
favorite two subjects that you

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.170
interviewed for the book?

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.020
And for any kind of quirky,
different reason than people

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.870
might imagine.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.550
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
You're so funny.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.050
I can't.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.591
It's like picking
one of my children.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.356
I'll pick two
interesting subjects.

00:43:56.356 --> 00:43:57.980
Firstly, I will start
by saying there's

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.700
an amazing Googler in
the book, Dan Keyserling,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.420
if anyone knows.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.545
He now works in Jigsaw.

00:44:03.545 --> 00:44:05.010
So he's a fan favorite.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.710
You can find him.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:11.150
But I would say probably
the unexpected ones

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.960
that really blew
me away were Mister

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.500
Cartoon, the tattoo artist,
was just phenomenal in terms

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.535
of where he came from,
where he got to, how he just

00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:26.270
had this incredible ability
to get uncomfortable and keep

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:27.260
learning.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.090
And some of his one-liners
were just awesome.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.260
I really, really loved him.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.240
And then, there's
a personal story.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.500
Actually, a connection to me.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.110
My sister-in-law-- and
it's an incredible story

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.780
of overcoming
profound mental health

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.740
issues to become really quite
successful on the global stage.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.110
And so different to
anything else in the book,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.300
but so incredibly inspiring.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.650
But they're all amazing.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.980
They were great stories.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.970
Definitely.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.360
AUDIENCE: How do you think
about the competition?

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.130
Let's use SoulCycle.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.250
Obviously, according
to you categories,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.850
they're in maybe
a different one.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.720
But how much do you as the
CEO pay attention to them

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.790
without getting too
paranoid or too distracted,

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.770
but still make
sure that you know

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.809
what you're up against if
they're your top competitor?

00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:14.850
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.080
Well, first of all,
I'm going to say

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.996
something that will
probably sound surprising,

00:45:17.996 --> 00:45:19.305
but I love SoulCycle.

00:45:19.305 --> 00:45:23.790
And I believe that when they do
well, the category does well.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.770
We all do well.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.760
Same with Peloton.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.640
I actually believe all of us
are bringing tons of energy

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.470
and all the boats are rising.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.890
And what's really
interesting is they

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.060
are very different
consumers, people coming

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.390
for very different reasons.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.230
So I don't spend a
lot of time thinking

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.900
about them because I do
spend a lot of time thinking

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.690
about our core
consumer who's looking

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.940
for something quite different.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:51.660
And I would say I personally
learned a lot from working

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.500
at a company like Virgin
or Nike where they never

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.280
thought about the competition
and only play their own game

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.290
compared to the soda wars.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.245
You know, Coke and
Pepsi, Powerade/Gatorade,

00:46:03.245 --> 00:46:05.730
where it's a completely
different mindset.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.399
And that can drag you
into different places

00:46:08.399 --> 00:46:10.440
that aren't necessarily
right for your consumers.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.656
So I think I came away with
that going stay focused.

00:46:14.656 --> 00:46:15.632
Definitely.

00:46:20.595 --> 00:46:22.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.292
I'm a Flywheel devotee, so I'm
so excited to see you here.

00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:26.750
And for those who
haven't tried it,

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.000
we have a great
Googler discount.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.750
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Oh, yes.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.960
AUDIENCE: Try it out.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.501
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN:
We definitely do.

00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:31.750
AUDIENCE: In the vein of--

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.791
I know you had mentioned
that boutique fitness is

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:36.320
sort of just starting and
it's going to explode.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.280
What do you foresee as one of
the biggest challenges facing

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.850
Flywheel in the coming years?

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.880
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: I would
say staying focused, actually.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.460
Because I do think
that there is a ton

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.270
of excitement around the
fitness category in general.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:56.290
I also think daily, there is
new technology and innovation

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.762
that people knocking down our
door, wanting to suggest we

00:46:59.762 --> 00:47:00.970
do this, that, and the other.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.850
And I personally have found--

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.700
because I had not grown up in
a technology company like you

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.870
all, as a CEO, it's hard
to sort the real ideas

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.550
from the many
things that are just

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.270
going to fall by the wayside
and not get distracted

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:17.260
by the wrong ones.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:21.670
So I actually think the
opportunity is so ripe for us,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.620
but we have to--

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.230
we've got to place the right
bets, and focus on them,

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:31.822
and not get spread
too thin, I would say.

00:47:31.822 --> 00:47:32.530
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.490
With your focus and
leadership on technology

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.170
and accountability
in the fitness space,

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.410
are you all thinking about
integrating fitness data

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.360
with larger health care data?

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.380
And how is that materializing?

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.380
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Yes.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.481
We are at the very
beginning of being

00:47:48.481 --> 00:47:50.230
able to think about
it because we're still

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.310
a very young company.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.780
But for sure, I think that's
what we all need to do.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.870
That's what our
consumers want us to do,

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.110
is help them get a
more holistic picture.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.004
So absolutely.

00:48:01.004 --> 00:48:02.360
Definitely.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.955
You mentioned a lot about like
failing early and failing fast.

00:48:07.955 --> 00:48:10.330
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about also

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.900
like during the times
when you have failed,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.570
like how did you go about
picking yourself back up?

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:16.780
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.821
AUDIENCE: What are the
different support networks

00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.190
you had to allow
that introspection

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:26.089
and get yourself to be propelled
up for that post-growth?

00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:27.130
SARAH ROBB O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:35.320
So let's talk about failing fast
for a second and failing hard.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.820
Maybe I'll use that term.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:42.550
Because fail fast is a big
idea that thankfully, you guys

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.050
have brought to the
world in general

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.360
in terms of as we
are in business

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.060
and thinking about innovation,
trying, experimenting,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.650
iterating, rolling, and moving.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.350
And we all have to be
better at doing that.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:58.120
That is different to failure
that really deeply impacts

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.600
you, and teaches you, and
actually takes you personally

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.450
to another level.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.320
And that is one of the reasons
I went to great lengths

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.019
to just put it all out there.

00:49:07.019 --> 00:49:08.560
And by the way, I'm
not the only one.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.310
Like some of the other
stories in my book,

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.820
I said to everyone when
I interviewed them,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.450
I don't want the great
surface amazingness.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.470
Tell me how it felt. And
like Condoleezza Rice, making

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.240
the decision, extraordinarily
tough decision,

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.750
to give up on her dream of being
a concert pianist and take a--

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.480
tell me what that feels like.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.470
But what I would say is you
have to-- like I actually

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.900
break down in the book
the real process of how

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.180
you should go through it.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.680
Because everyone says to me,
how do you go into an interview

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.138
after you've just
been fired twice,

00:49:40.138 --> 00:49:41.800
which is a good question.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.520
But you have to, I believe,
really feel it and process it.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.220
And if you've ever
had a failure--

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.710
I know in my case, I
spent the first, at least

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:55.180
month telling everyone around
me that it was their fault.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.220
You know, it must have
been the sucky industry,

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.780
the leadership, whatever.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.370
And everyone you
tell that to, you

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:01.990
can sort of see in their
eyes that they don't really

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.650
believe you.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.649
And that's because you
don't really believe you.

00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:07.630
And then you have to just
sit there and go, OK.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.350
This hurts.

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.310
I'm going to own it.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.895
But the minute you actually
take ownership for it

00:50:11.895 --> 00:50:13.750
and man up and
say it to someone.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.910
Like in a job
interview saying, I

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.710
got fired because I did this,
which means I will never

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.710
make that mistake again, it's so
empowering because you own it.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.440
You're in control
of it from then on.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.130
So I do think we all tend
to-- it's human nature

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:33.070
to want to cover up
fails because you

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.720
kind of think it's a bad thing.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.320
But when you do, it's like
this scary thing that's always

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.430
chasing you through life.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.440
And maybe it's going to
catch up and someone's going

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.648
to find out about it one day.

00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:45.200
It's better just
to feel it, own it.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.770
And then, by the way,
you do get great growth.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.230
And that's what you
did it for, right?

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.150
I always tell people,
don't fail if you're not

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:58.606
going to get the output on
the other side, for sure.

00:50:58.606 --> 00:50:59.600
All right.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.140
I think my little counter
clock is about to run out.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.816
So thank you very much.

00:51:04.816 --> 00:51:05.690
It's been really fun.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.210
Great questions.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:06.751
Thanks a lot.

00:51:06.751 --> 00:51:09.560
