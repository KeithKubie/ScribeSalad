00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
 

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.860
When you write a fraction,
there are actually

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.330
words for the top number
and the bottom number.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.160
And the words are
a lot more fancy

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.100
than the word "top number"
and "bottom number."

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.115
What mathematicians
typically use

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:21.000
is the word "numerator" for the
top number and "denominator"

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.050
for the bottom number.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.300
 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.450
And what I want to do now that
we know that the top number is

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.900
the numerator of the fraction
and the bottom number is

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.250
the denominator,
I want to compare

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.270
pairs of fractions that have
either the same denominator

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.160
or the same numerator.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.550
So let's look at
this first pair.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.580
I want to compare 4/7 to 3/7.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.470
And I have two wholes
right over here.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.620
They're the same hole, and I've
divided them into sevenths.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340
I've divided them
into 7 equal chunks.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.850
And I want to see what's
larger, 4/7 or 3/7.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.580
So what I can do is,
I can fill in 4/7.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.960
Let me select 4 out of the 7.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.650
So, that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.790
And the fact that trying to even
get to 4/7 I had to have 3/7

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
first gives you good clue
that 4/7 is probably larger,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.030
or it is larger.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.790
But now let's color in 3/7,
just so we can compare.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.280
So 1, 2, 3/7.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.970
And so it's pretty clear
that on the left-hand side,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.250
we are shading in
more of the whole

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.740
than on the right-hand side.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.810
So, 4/7 represents
a larger fraction,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.480
more of the whole than 3/7.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.550
And the way that we can state
that comparison mathematically

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.610
is with the greater than symbol.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.680
We can write 4/7 is
greater than 3/7.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.500
Now, the greater than
and less than symbols

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.010
can sometimes be confusing.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.380
This is greater than.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.410
This is less than.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.660
 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.730
And the way that
I remember it is

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.122
that the greater than symbol,
either symbol, the small pointy

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:11.830
side is always on the
side of the smaller

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.770
number, and the big
open side is always

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.520
on the side of
the larger number.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.810
So here, big open
side is opening

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.690
towards the 4/7, small pointy
side opening to the 3/7.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.720
4/7 is greater than 3/7.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.600
Now, what about 3/7 and 3/4?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.710
So, here I have
different denominators,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.781
but I have the same numerator.

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.530
And so I encourage you
to pause this video

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.060
and draw maybe little
boxes like this

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.300
and try to judge for yourself
which of these is a larger

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.330
fraction, represents
a larger number.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.110
Well, let's color them in.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.069
So, let's think about 3/7 first.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.610
And we actually
already drew it here,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.443
but I can do it really
fast right over here.

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:52.040
So that is 3/7.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.610
I've colored in 3 of
the 7 equal groups.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.230
And what would 3/4 be?

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.930
Well, that's 1/3, 2/4, and 3/4.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.590
And so it's pretty clear
that 3/4 represents a larger

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.060
fraction of the whole,
that 3/4 is larger,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.420
or that 3/7 is smaller.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.120
So we could write that
3/7 is less than 3/4.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420
So, notice, same
exact numerator.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.870
When I divided it-- because
this fraction symbol

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.360
could also be
viewed as division.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.230
When I have it as
more equal groups,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.320
so it's a fraction of
more equal groups, so 3

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.370
out of 7 versus 3 out of 4,
this is a smaller number,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.512
which which makes sense.

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:35.720
Now, let's compare these two.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.360
We have the same denominator,
different numerators-- 3/4

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.520
versus 2/4.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.610
Well, 3/4 we've
already looked at.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.650
We can just shade in 3 of these.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.810
So 3 of these fourths.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.035
So that's 3/4 right over there.

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:52.660
And then 2/4, well,
we're going to only

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.660
have 2 of the fourths, 1, 2.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.010
So 2/4 is clearly
the smaller number.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.040
3/4 is the greater number.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.710
So, once again, we could
write 3/4 is greater than 2/4.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.120
And then finally, I encourage
you to pause the video.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.475
Try to come up with whether
2/4 or 3/6 is a larger number.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.630
Well, let's color it in again.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.050
We've already seen 2/4.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.910
We just have to color
in 2 of our fourths.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.130
So let's just color in 2 of
our fourths right over there.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.420
And then 3/6, we've
split our whole

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.370
into 6 equal sections--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.670
We need to color in 3 of them.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.700
 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.750
And as you see, we're coloring
in the exact same amount

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.900
of the whole.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.640
These two fractions
are equivalent.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.350
These are equivalent fractions.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.140
2/4 is equal to 3/6.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.230
And as you see
here, they're both

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.670
filling in half of the whole.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.530
If we were to just draw
the whole and split

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.060
it only-- let me do this
in a different color.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.210
If we have our whole, and
we were to split it only

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.320
into two sections,
we are shading

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.740
in exactly 1 out
of the 2 sections.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.520
 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.870
So you could say that
2/4 is equal to 3/6,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.450
and they both equal 1/2.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.799
So 1/2 is equal to
2/4 is equal to 3/6.

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:18.299
