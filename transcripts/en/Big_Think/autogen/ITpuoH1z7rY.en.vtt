is the best option at all because the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
is the best option at all because the
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600
is the best option at all because the
question is let's say that the Fukushima

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
question is let's say that the Fukushima
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200
question is let's say that the Fukushima
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.319
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0
and the answer is probably no so even if

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
and the answer is probably no so even if
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630
and the answer is probably no so even if
you were to brace a reactor even if you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
you were to brace a reactor even if you
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249
you were to brace a reactor even if you
were to add more redundant safety

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
were to add more redundant safety
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920
were to add more redundant safety
systems I doubt that it could withstand

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
systems I doubt that it could withstand
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.460
systems I doubt that it could withstand
a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake

a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910
a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake
and tsunami think of driving a car I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
and tsunami think of driving a car I
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.580
and tsunami think of driving a car I
driving a car that's out of control what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
driving a car that's out of control what
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020
driving a car that's out of control what
do you do you hit the brakes

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
do you do you hit the brakes
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.660
do you do you hit the brakes
well the brakes don't work it's still

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
well the brakes don't work it's still
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460
well the brakes don't work it's still
out of control and then the radiator

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
out of control and then the radiator
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.340
out of control and then the radiator
blows up and you say to yourself oh my

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
blows up and you say to yourself oh my
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.639
blows up and you say to yourself oh my
god next is the gas tank the gas tank is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
god next is the gas tank the gas tank is
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.310
god next is the gas tank the gas tank is
going to go what do you do you run it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
going to go what do you do you run it
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160
going to go what do you do you run it
into a river that's exactly what they

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
into a river that's exactly what they
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800
into a river that's exactly what they
did in Japan first the brakes didn't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
did in Japan first the brakes didn't
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.869
did in Japan first the brakes didn't
work because the tsunami wiped out the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
work because the tsunami wiped out the
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.690
work because the tsunami wiped out the
backup system then the core is heated up

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
backup system then the core is heated up
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820

cause a hydrogen gas explosion

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
cause a hydrogen gas explosion
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
cause a hydrogen gas explosion
that's your radiator blowing up and then

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
that's your radiator blowing up and then
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140
that's your radiator blowing up and then
when they do they ran it into the river

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
when they do they ran it into the river
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.940
when they do they ran it into the river
that's the same thing as dumping

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
that's the same thing as dumping
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.520
that's the same thing as dumping
seawater on these nuclear power plants

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
seawater on these nuclear power plants
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.740
seawater on these nuclear power plants
and of course to keep the seawater going

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
and of course to keep the seawater going
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.050
and of course to keep the seawater going
you have to have power and they don't

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
you have to have power and they don't
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.810

lethal so you're cut in this bind even

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820
lethal so you're cut in this bind even
 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.660

if that reactor was a new reactor so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
if that reactor was a new reactor so
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.370
if that reactor was a new reactor so
some people are saying maybe we should

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
some people are saying maybe we should
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.450
some people are saying maybe we should
rethink our commitment to nuclear at all
