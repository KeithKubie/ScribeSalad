00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.322
- [Voiceover] Moussa and Fatu
were each asked to factor

00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:04.900
the quadratic expression

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.300
16 x-squared minus 64.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.947
Their responses are shown below.

00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:13.886
So Moussa factored it this way.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:15.999
Fatu factored it this way.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.204
Which student wrote an
expression that is equivalent

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:20.944
to 16 x-squared minus 64?

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:23.405
So I encourage you to pause
the video and figure that out.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:26.215
Which student wrote an
expression that is equivalent to

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.324
our original one, 16 x-squared minus 64?

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:32.658
Well let's work through it
together, so let's see if first

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:35.920
we can factor this out
somehow to get what Moussa got

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.717
and it looks like Moussa
first factored out a 16

00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:40.819
and then he was left with
a difference of squares.

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.398
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:45.102
So, we can write our original expression.

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:48.562
16 x-squared minus 64,
we can write that as

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.557
16 times x-squared

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:55.133
minus 16 times four.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.083
And when you write it like
that, it's very clear that you

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.882
can factor out a 16.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:02.214
So this is going to be equal to 16 times

00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:04.640
what you have left over is x-squared

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.972
minus four and then x-squared minus four,

00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:10.696
that's a difference of
squares right over there.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.598
So, that part we can factor as,

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:16.611
so we have our original 16 and then...

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:20.878
this part right over here, we can write as

00:01:20.878 --> 00:01:23.502
x plus two times x minus two.

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:26.787
x plus two times x minus two.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.056
If what I just did in this
last step, going from x-squared

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.991
minus four to x plus two times x minus two

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.988
doesn't make any sense, I
encourage you to watch some of

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:38.147
the introductory videos on factoring

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:39.505
and difference of squares.

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:42.222
But the basic idea, I have a form here of

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:45.379
a-squared minus b-squared, so
it's going to have the form

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:48.525
of a plus b times a minus b

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.265
and in this case it's
x-squared minus two squared.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.539
So it's going to be x plus
two times x minus two.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.861
So that's exactly what Moussa got.

00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:59.821
So this one, so Moussa,

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.434
did get an expression
that is equivalent to

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.861
16 x-squared minus 64.

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:05.393
Now let's think about Fatu.

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:08.737
So Fatu didn't factor
out a 16 from the get-go.

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:11.625
It looks like he just
immediately recognized that

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.295
our original expression is
itself a difference of squares

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:16.315
even if we don't factor out a 16,

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:17.859
and so let's re-write it.

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.783
So our original expression, we could write

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:25.419
as, so instead of writing,
well I'm just going to

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.160
write it like this, this
is our original expression.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.271
16 x-squared minus 64.

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:32.837
That's the same thing as, 16
x-squared is the same thing as

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:36.053
four x, the whole thing squared

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.850
and then minus eight squared.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.801
So when you write it like
this, it's clear that this is a

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.751
difference of squares,
so this is going to be

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.129
four x plus eight times
four x minus eight.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.310
Four x plus eight times
four x minus eight.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.761
Once again, if this last
step that I did doesn't make

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.431
a lot of sense I encourage
you to watch the video

00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:56.451
on factoring difference
of squares where we go

00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.575
a lot more into the intuition of it.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.595
But when you see it this
way you realize that Fatu

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:03.312
also got an expression
that is equivalent to

00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:07.207
16 x-squared minus 64, so they both did.
