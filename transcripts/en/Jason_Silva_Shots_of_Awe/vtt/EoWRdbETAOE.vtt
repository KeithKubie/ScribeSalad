JASON SILVA: You know, there's
a great line by Carl Sagan that

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.270
says that understanding
is a kind of ecstasy,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.870
that we are cognitive beings,
we are creatures of mind.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.790
We have natural inquiry
embedded in our bones.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.130
Curiosity defines us.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.120
We are the frontal
lobes of the universe.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.860
But it's also said
that in life, happiness

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.970
comes not from finding
the answers but in seeking

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.284
better questions.

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:37.950
And so in the age of
the internet, where

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030
any query, where any piece of
data, knowledge, or insight

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.730
is a Google search away,
you come to wonder,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.240
are we living in a world
where wonder is expressed more

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.730
intensely, because any time
I wonder about something,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.080
I can look up the answer?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.000
Or is the immediacy with
which the answer is available

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.680
actually dulling us into
a state where we rarely

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.780
experience the
rapture of discovery,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.130
the rapture of the search?

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.485
Not just the destination,
but the journey expressed

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.849
as the labor, the
search, the curiosity

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.820
seeking to satiate itself.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.930
And so it makes you
wonder, will this simply

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.287
open up new vistas,
new questions

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:12.370
we haven't thought of yet?

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.460
Are we offloading the simple
questions to the noosphere

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.660
and making room for new things
we haven't even thought of yet?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.370
I mean, I like to think so,
because I am an optimist.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.280
Unlike Socrates, who felt
that the invention of writing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.940
would atrophy our brains because
we wouldn't have to remember

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.382
anything if we wrote it
down, so, too, people

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:31.840
worry that today's
technologies are

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.220
going to atrophy
part of our brain

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.720
and limit what it
means to be human.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.650
But I think it won't.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.180
I think it will literally
offload some functionality

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.590
and open up new vistas, just
like every technology that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.810
came before.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.440
So that's what I think.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.190
