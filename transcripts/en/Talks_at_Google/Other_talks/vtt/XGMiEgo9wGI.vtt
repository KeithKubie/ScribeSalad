00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:06.120
WINNIE LAM: Hello everybody.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.740
I'm Winne Lam.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.090
It's surreal to be standing 10
feet away from the amazing race

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.857
car driver, Danica Patrick.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.690
And I'm thrilled that
Claire Johnson is here

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.970
today to do the fireside
chat with Danica.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.370
There are many women Googlers
who are in technical roles

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.349
where there are
more men than women.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.140
So we thought it would
be inspiring to hear

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.490
Danica's story
about how she excels

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.320
in the male-dominated
field of race car driving.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.060
So without further ado, please
help me give a very warm

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.260
welcome to Danica Patrick.

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:43.800
DANICA PATRICK: Thank you.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.740
Oh my gosh.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.702
Thank you for coming.

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:47.910
We were just talking about
how sometimes people come,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.930
sometimes people don't.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.570
And I said that the
worst fear for someone

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.770
like me is that you do
these and nobody shows up.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.030
Or you get introduced somewhere
and nobody knows who you are.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.260
So thank you all for coming.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.470
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I think my worst fear is

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.960
that I would host this
and no one would be here.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.090
But you guys, nice job.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.496
We filled the room.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.120
I think we could've
used a bigger room.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.828
So a couple things
because I know you all

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.710
want to hear from Danica.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.510
Just so you know
about this talk.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.250
I feel really pleased.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.810
And I want to think Winnie
and Nicole and Rich.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.470
And folks from the Google
GoDaddy team who helped

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.270
prep this.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.670
We have some great slides and
photos and a couple of videos

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.839
to show.

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.380
And we also have a
bunch of questions

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.740
that luckily I was prepared
with to go through.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.090
We probably aren't going to
have any time for any live Q&amp;A.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.760
But I have looked at the Dory.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.620
So if you have stuff
on the Dory-- and Mave

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.802
is going to pass me notes--
Dory is our internal Q&amp;A tool.

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:38.760
DANICA PATRICK: Got it.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.170
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We're
all about the tech here.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.420
DANICA PATRICK: OK.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.295
I was like, I don't--

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:40.360
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So people
can ask questions from there.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.241
DANICA PATRICK:
--know who she is.

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.740
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: She's like, I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.323
have no idea what
you're talking about

00:01:45.323 --> 00:01:47.136
but please don't bring it up.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.010
But anyway, so we'll
keep an eye on the Dory.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.230
But hopefully we'll get
to most of the topics

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.420
that you all have.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.810
And in full disclosure,
I like to drive fast,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.390
but I do not know that much
about race car driving.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
DANICA PATRICK: Perfect.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.010
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: And some--

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.220
DANICA PATRICK: Neither do I.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.511
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: --of
the folks in the audience--

00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.280
I think you know a
lot-- may not as well.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.574
So I may follow up and ask
you to clarify a few things.

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:10.990
Don't you want to get out of
NASCAR and all the left turns

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.810
sometimes?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.439
Go back to your
open wheel roots?

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.480
DANICA PATRICK: We have
a couple of road courses.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.200
But what I notice in the
gym is that I'm definitely

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.820
dominant pushing with my right
and pulling with my left.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.770
It's very out of balance
when I use dumbbells.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.510
And they're independent.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090
And I'm like, yep.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.120
And nope.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.937
Can't get there.

00:02:30.937 --> 00:02:33.020
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So
when you pick your gowns

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.500
for award shows would that
could be an issue for you?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.458
DANICA PATRICK: Always.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:37.144
Shoulders.

00:02:37.144 --> 00:02:38.560
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: We're good.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.660
We're already getting into it.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.410
So just so folks don't-- if you
don't know who Danica Patrick

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.090
is, I'm not sure why that is--
but she's the most searched

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.920
for athlete.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.970
And we're a search company
among other things.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.010
So certainly she's on our radar.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.640
But has been an amazing
role model for women.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.330
For girls.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.700
But also for anyone who's
an aspiring race car driver.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.590
And grew up in the sport.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.202
And even went to
Europe for some time--

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:07.160
which her parents let
her do, which maybe we'll

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.530
ask how that went--
to continue her racing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.090
education and practice.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.810
And has driven with Indy car.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.920
And is now with NASCAR
on the Sprint Cup Series

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.935
if I'm right about that.

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:19.070
DANICA PATRICK:
You got that right.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.695
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And has been-- I

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:25.040
think folks know-- the GoDaddy
spokesperson for 13 years.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.780
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, been in 13.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.760
After this year, 13
Superbowl commercials.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.984
But since 2007.

00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:32.400
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Since 2007.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.900
OK.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.570
So just a lot of
Superbowl commercials.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.620
DANICA PATRICK: A lot of
SuperBowl commercials.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.036
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Since 2007.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:40.119
And has also hosted the
Country Music Awards.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.160
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah the
American Country Awards.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.166
It was last month in Vegas.

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:47.790
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And been
on the cover of various hotshot

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.319
magazines.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.360
We have one of them here.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.290
Sports Illustrated
is one of them.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.330
ESPN magazine, right?

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.960
I think saw that one.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.310
Anyway, so she-- And you
have your own company, right?

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.374
"Danica Racing."

00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:59.290
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're a businesswoman.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.956
DANICA PATRICK: I
write President on it.

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.440
So it makes me feel really
cool when they say title.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.930
Your signature and title.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.060
And I write president.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.240
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Or
if you go through customs

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.670
and they say, what's your job?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.211
DANICA PATRICK: I
don't actually know

00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.530
what to write when it comes
to that point in time.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.660
I write the same thing now.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500
But for a long time I didn't
know what to write for my job.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.180
Driver?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.220
Or race car driver?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.740
Or professional driver?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.290
Automotive driver?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.680
President?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.680
I mean, that would help.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.020
I would think.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.936
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I think race car driver

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.260
might be cooler than president.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.760
DANICA PATRICK: I
write race car driver.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.020
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think-- I'm down with that.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.600
DANICA PATRICK: Wow, you think
that's cooler than president?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.430
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I do.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.520
Danica Patrick: Well, it's
probably a lot easier.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.610
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That
might be the state of politics

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.010
these days.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.509
All right.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.270
Anyway.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.260
Let's talk a little
bit about when

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.540
you knew that this was
a passion of yours.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.690
DANICA PATRICK: Well, I
started racing go-karts

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.010
when I was 10 years old.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.630
And it really was because
my sister wanted to race.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.200
There I am.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.699
Adorable.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.410
Yup.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.600
I still need glasses,
but I wear contacts.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.970
And I'm positively blind.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:03.820
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
your sister was younger?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.580
DANICA PATRICK: My
sister was eight

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.230
and I was 10 years old, which
is why my number was 10.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.370
So it was really just something
to do together as a family.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.290
And I just took to it.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.490
I started winning my first year.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.720
And I won the championship.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.400
But this kid blocked
me and I didn't

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.233
know how to get around
because he drove down

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:26.804
the inside of the straightaway.

00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:27.970
I figured it out after that.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.761
You just push him off
the end of the track.

00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:32.730
But I didn't know then.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.970
But I think really it
came from the first year.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.640
And just being successful.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.690
And I really liked
practicing and getting

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.620
better and seeing improvement.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.930
And I mean, we all tend to
like things that we're good at.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.180
And it was something that went
well pretty quickly for me.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.540
So it was really year one.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.530
I thought I would go to
college for engineering.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.300
But I didn't.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.220
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
We support that.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.110
We like that.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.980
DANICA PATRICK: I
ended up going--

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.190
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
all support the driving.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.180
DANICA PATRICK: I ended
up going to England.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.980
And I'm not sure
which one was harder.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.688
Which one would have
been harder, England

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:02.820
or engineering college?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.870
But I wanted to go to
college for engineering

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.660
so I could know how
to work on my car.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.150
But I went to a different
kind of college ultimately.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.585
But those were my
plans at 10 years old.

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:13.960
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So how old

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.290
were you when you
went to England?

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.290
DANICA PATRICK: I was 16.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.230
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Wow
and so your family said--

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.520
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah I was
a junior in high school.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.640
And I wasn't really even
there very much junior year.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.490
I went over to England
in the first semester.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.400
I went over for two of
the four months of school.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.580
And did a little bit of racing.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.710
And then I went back
full time after that.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.670
So I left high school halfway
through my junior year.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.159
And I've never looked back.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.950
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And was the thinking

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.199
on that, that you would just
get more experience and--

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.190
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.730
It was described to me
that I can learn more there

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.060
in one year than five
years in America.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.190
And the opportunity
was there to do it.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.770
Really what ended up
happening was this person--

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.110
that told me that I could learn
more there than in the states--

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.680
had followed my career
then for a couple of years.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.330
And contacted me
when I turned 16.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.010
And said, we've
been watching you.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.715
We want to help
you in your career.

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:15.090
And that's when I went over
to England for a little while

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.030
to check things out.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.070
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: This is
someone in the British racing

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.570
scene?

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.950
DANICA PATRICK: There
was an Englishman.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.870
And then there was
a Texas-based family

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.920
that had been involved in
racing for a long time.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.890
So they had followed my
career for a couple of years.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.400
And fortunately
saw me win a lot.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.430
And after that I
moved to England.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.930
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.340
So we have gotten
a few questions

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.860
on our moderator tool.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.080
And certainly, as
Winnie mentioned,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.910
our Women at Google group
is interested in-- as you

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.790
were coming up through the sport
and in those earlier years,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.290
I'm sure it still
is the case today,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.489
but you're a little bit
more established now.

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:55.280
You were certainly
contending with the fact

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.570
that it was more of a
male-dominated sport.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.940
Although women, I think
as I understand it,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.130
from the history of NASCAR were
allowed to race since 1949.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.620
Not the case for
the IndyCar races.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.240
But anyway, women
were allowed to race

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.140
and there were some
women who raced.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.650
But it just really, as
this happens sometimes

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.890
in engineering
classes, very few.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.350
And for you, you've become
arguably the most famous

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.890
female race car driver.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.120
How was it coming up
through the sport?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.260
Did you find that there
were overt obstacles?

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.000
Or was it just
occasionally an issue?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.050
DANICA PATRICK: I think that the
big difference between me, when

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.970
I came along versus when
some of the women in the past

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.260
in the earlier years, were there
is that-- take for instance

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.900
my first Indy 500 was 2005.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.010
And you had to do something
called rookie orientation,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.310
which meant you had
to go out and do 190

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.420
for five laps or 10 laps.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.920
And then you had to do 200.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.270
And then you do 210.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.170
And then 220.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.220
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That
would be miles per hour?

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.053
DANICA PATRICK: Yes.

00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:57.730
And so it was just a
build up in the process.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:04.090
And so I would come
in from making a run--

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.000
and once you've passed
your test and gone

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.020
through all those speeds, then
you get to practice basically.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.220
And I'd come in and I was
basically the quickest car.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.040
So I would come into
the pits and everybody

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.810
would be cheering.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.870
There was a huge slew of
photographers and journalists

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.730
in front of my car.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.550
And on the pit
wall there was tons

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.560
of fans behind the
behind the fence.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.640
And I was embraced in general.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.890
I'm sure there's still haters.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.287
But they exist always.

00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:31.870
In everything.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.244
There's always
going to be people

00:09:33.244 --> 00:09:35.430
that don't like you
or believe in you.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.580
But in general, very well
received and embraced.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.080
And I think that's
a big difference.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.860
In the past I don't think
that was there for them.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.950
Everyone has to
prove themselves.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.220
There's no doubt about that.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.370
I face it as a rookie.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.610
I face it as a girl.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.490
And I face it as
just a competitor.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.530
As a person trying
to beat other people.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.820
So it's always a
challenge to earn respect.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.990
But I think that there's
probably a few more doubters

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.780
along the way.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.990
Or it may take a few
extra times of proving

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.230
what you do, what you can
do, before people really

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.800
believe it.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.590
And then of course there's
just some that never do.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.780
But it's a process.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.660
And still going on.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.140
And I'm sure it will for awhile.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.970
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
talking about the Indy 500,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.850
you were the first woman-- you
lead for 19 laps in the Indy

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.980
500 when you were 23 years old.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.155
So did you feel like you
proved it at that point?

00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:37.780
DANICA PATRICK: Well,
I think that when

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.490
I got my ride in IndyCar-- It
came the year before at Indy.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.420
And I had gone to a press
conference at the track.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.100
And I wasn't racing.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.860
But the team that I drove
for in the lower level racing

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.780
had an IndyCar team.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.910
And so I went to a press
conference on Thursday

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:55.786
before the race.

00:10:55.786 --> 00:10:57.160
And all of a sudden
my boss said,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.590
and Danica's going to drive
in IndyCars next year.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.965
And I was like, I mean,
I'm not going to argue,

00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:03.840
but I didn't know you
were going to say that.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.550
So it came pretty suddenly.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.950
But I got into it in my first
year of Indy Car and thought,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.150
it's not a for sure thing.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.570
You still have to do it.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.770
Just getting there is not there.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.650
You need to do some good
things and establish yourself.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.020
And get some roots in the sport.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.300
And have proper
support from sponsors.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.800
And after that Indy 500 I did.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.272
There was a certain level I
felt a little better after that.

00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:32.980
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I mean you clearly

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.850
had earned your way.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.170
DANICA PATRICK: It was
definitely a pivotal year.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.780
And it was a magical month.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.300
And it was full
of highs and lows.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.250
And the lows were really just
that I was running out energy

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.110
to do interviews.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.550
But that's a good
problem to have.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.453
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Luckily we're catching her

00:11:49.453 --> 00:11:51.202
at the beginning before
the season starts.

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:53.680
DANICA PATRICK: This is my
first day at work, everyone,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.172
this year.

00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:58.630
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That's
true for a lot of us as well.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.926
DANICA PATRICK: Is it?

00:11:58.926 --> 00:11:59.426
OK.

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:00.600
Well, welcome back.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.380
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
On the holidays.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.600
DANICA PATRICK: High on
sugar from the holidays?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.840
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Exactly.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.080
So, then, you won the
IndyCar race in Japan.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.279
And did that feel like--
how big a deal was that?

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.320
Or was it not a big deal?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.278
Because you already kind
of made it in IndyCar.

00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:18.380
DANICA PATRICK: Well,
I mean it's something

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.070
that I am-- I even said it
back then in 2008-- that it

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.270
felt long overdue for me.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.020
There were opportunities that
were probably even better

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.630
to win along the way
that didn't happen.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.380
Versus that day.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.490
So it was but there was
somebody-- another driver told

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.004
me that year at some point,
he said, you know what?

00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:42.670
One day you're going to be doing
just the same thing that you've

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.410
been doing every day
and you're going to win.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.850
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.933
You're doing the same thing
that you do every day.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.000
And so it was a
feeling of relief.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.240
And for the casual fan
or the casual consumer,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.990
first place and winning is
very easy to understand.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.180
And so it was nice
from that perspective.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:11.010
And there was a lot of talk
and argumentative points

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.290
about I haven't won.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.040
And so it did take care of that.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.360
And of course eventually--

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.290
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
It checked off that box.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.330
DANICA PATRICK: So,
I mean, I wanted

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.496
to win a lot more than that.

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:20.110
And there were opportunities.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:25.350
But it seemed like my talent
as a driver in IndyCar

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.086
was going like this and
my cars went like this.

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:30.210
So that didn't really
interject at the right point.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.140
But they did kind
of right at 2008.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.070
Your equipment is
really important too.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.287
Your equipment is
very important.

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:41.620
It's the chicken before the egg.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.320
What is it?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.620
Is it the driver?

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.410
Or is it the car?

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.493
Well, you really can't
have one without the other.

00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:48.370
So if things aren't where
they need to be there

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.730
then the best
driver can't take--

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.105
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: We kind of

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:53.660
have that with computing power.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.100
DANICA PATRICK: Sure.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.600
Absolutely.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.990
You're only as good
as your resources.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.070
Your technology.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.520
Your coworkers.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.790
Your brainstorming.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.590
Your motherboard?

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.870
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.395
Your core.

00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:10.021
Your chip core.

00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:11.353
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah, that's it.

00:14:11.353 --> 00:14:12.040
Chip it up.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.110
Chip me up.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.026
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's what I'm saying.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.470
Back to the
male-dominated thing.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.370
I have found-- and I think
some of the female engineers,

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.160
hopefully some of them are
in the room-- sometimes

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.150
the situation is you
don't get the respect.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.330
And you talked a
little bit about that.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.239
And then you earn it.

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:31.780
And maybe it takes
little bit longer.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.370
And the other situation is maybe
you get too much attention.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.320
Where you're just a
person doing a job.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.660
And I think for you it's
probably frustrating.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.560
I mean, you've gotten
a lot of attention.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.810
I think as a driver.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.377
But maybe a little bit more
sometimes as a female race

00:14:44.377 --> 00:14:46.210
car-- and particularly
being the first woman

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.670
to do some of the things--
we're going to talk about a few

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.060
of them as well.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.860
DANICA PATRICK: And
that does happen.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.290
It's a double-edged sword.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.940
When you are different or
outside of the box and people

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.250
are paying attention.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.390
You do something good or kind
of good and people realize it.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.070
You do something
bad or kind of bad

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.290
and people realize that, too.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.540
So it's a double-edged sword.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.740
But I mean, I'll take it.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.600
Because there's times where
I finished fourth and it

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.170
makes big news.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.390
And that doesn't
happen for anyone else.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.600
So they're noticing
the little things

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.280
along the way a little bit more.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.080
What happened in my first year.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.250
Or something like that.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.610
Something a little bit
unique about it sticks out.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.640
And because I'm a
girl and I'm different

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.390
and these things haven't
been done before.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.700
All I know is that in my
career I just work really hard.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.280
And I know that when I've
done everything possible

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.120
on and off the track to
perform, then people's opinions

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.340
or judgments can't affect me.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.090
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When you work hard,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.970
you've got a lot of, I
think, physical conditioning

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.110
you probably have to do.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.120
And then, do you just
have to drive a lot?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.090
DANICA PATRICK: For my
physical conditioning?

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:57.430
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: For both.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.790
I mean, how do
you stay in shape?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.340
Danica Patrick: I mean, I
take it to the streets--

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.750
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
For driving 200mph.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.730
DANICA PATRICK: In a
calculated fashion.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.090
I do make a lot of
people mad on the road.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.260
I'm sorry about that.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.718
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: I meant more

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.570
in a contained environment.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.280
DANICA PATRICK: No I mean I'm--

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.010
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: On the track.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.530
Do you go and drive every day?

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.080
DANICA PATRICK: There's testing.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.747
Practice.

00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:18.080
Or whatever you want to call it.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.520
We call it testing.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.460
This week-- this
Thursday and Friday--

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.940
we'll be at Daytona getting
ready for the Daytona 500

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.460
at the end of March.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.660
So you do some of that.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.340
The real conditioning
comes in the season when

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.930
you get in the car and you get
racing every single weekend.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.840
And we have two weekends
out of-- we have 38 races

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.740
and two weekends off.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.590
So we race all year.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.760
I mean it just feels
like we race all year.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.270
And then we get five
minutes off and then

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.270
you're right back at it again.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.690
So it goes pretty hard.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.460
For sure.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.540
But do you have to be the
fittest person in the world

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.380
to drive a race car?

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:00.880
No.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.130
But you do you have to be fit.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.200
You do have to be race
fit, as we call it.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.680
There's a lot of repetition.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.710
There's a lot of heat.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.810
There's a lot of adrenaline.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.280
And it's about being able to
control all that and keep cool.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.349
And literally keep cool.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.650
And keep cool in your head.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.480
And not grip the wheel so hard.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.442
And be conditioned for
the repetition, too.

00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:26.150
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And the repetition

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.560
meaning-- because you
don't want to zone out.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.518
Cause you got to keep--

00:17:28.518 --> 00:17:33.060
DANICA PATRICK: Well, it's
this and this and this and this

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.817
and this--- so it's when the
car is not balanced right.

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:39.650
It's not just a matter
of turning the wheel.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.850
It's a matter of
turning the wheel

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.130
and feeling what it's doing.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.810
And catching it all the
way around the corner.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.870
So you're tensed
up the whole time.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.680
And then even down
the straightaway

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.990
the car wants to turn left.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.940
It has stagger.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.990
It wants to turn left.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.300
So you still have to hold
it down the straightaway.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.170
But in the corner you
release and let it in.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.990
And then you're just chasing
it through the corner.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.990
Or you're adding a whole bunch
of wheel because it won't turn

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.480
and then your shoulder
gets an impingement.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.940
And that's not good either.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.480
I know.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.770
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And by
the way, speaking of the heat,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.887
I'm all worried because
the room is a little warm.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:17.970
She's looking at me like--

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.680
DANICA PATRICK: No,
those cars are probably

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.307
130 degrees inside
the whole time.

00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:27.140
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
So you must sweat off

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.420
10 pounds riding it.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.920
DANICA PATRICK:
It's really awesome.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.460
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: But
then you eat one Big Mac.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.980
DANICA PATRICK:
Before we started,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.450
we were just talking about
holidays and being in shape.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.000
And I said that by nature
that my job is athletic.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.090
And if not, I just sweat it off.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.020
By the end of the season I'm
always my fittest and leanest.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.350
Because every weekend
you're in the car three days

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.080
a week minimum.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.330
I was in the car.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.440
I tested on average every
other week for two days.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.210
Every other week, I
would say, on average.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.190
So I'm in the car almost five
days a week most of the time.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.960
And then the races
are four hours long.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.400
So the pit stop isn't
like a pit stop down

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.062
the road for a candy
bar and an energy drink.

00:19:16.062 --> 00:19:17.520
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: No smoothie.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.800
No Starbucks.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.280
DANICA PATRICK: I do drink
something with calories

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.864
but it's not--

00:19:21.864 --> 00:19:24.238
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Like
those gel things or whatever?

00:19:24.238 --> 00:19:27.090
DANICA PATRICK: No, it's
like a premix shake stuff.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.424
But it's by no means a meal.

00:19:31.424 --> 00:19:32.965
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Well, speaking

00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:35.756
of doing a ton of
racing, we we wanted

00:19:35.756 --> 00:19:36.880
to show a video-- Oh, look.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.790
And there you are
winning, as you win a lot.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.120
But one of the videos
we wanted to show--

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.800
it's kind of a long
video guys, but it

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.642
was an exciting, historic
event which was-- she's

00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:50.350
the first woman to
win the pole position.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.710
And this is at the Daytona 500.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.722
So we're going to watch that
video for a couple minutes

00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:56.930
and then we'll talk about it.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.760
DANICA PATRICK: That happens
the week before the race.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.420
So when's the race?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.970
The Daytona 500 is usually
the third or fourth.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.980
February 23 this year?

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.500
So it'll be the week
before that on Saturday.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:20.665
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.

00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:21.748
So in about a month or so.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.220
You're just doing a job there.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.200
But are you thinking, I'm
making history right now?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.090
Are you thinking, I just
need to get pole position?

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:31.740
What was your--

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.323
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I'm just
thinking about taking the car

00:20:34.323 --> 00:20:37.670
and taking it to
its potential level.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.205
And not wasting its potential
by making a little mistake

00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:42.890
and missing a shift.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:43.960
Getting up to speed.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.050
Or clipping the apron when
you're going around the corner.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.610
Because the car doesn't
just go just dead straight.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.540
It kind of follows the road.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.540
And it pulls.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.970
And it moves.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.960
So it's not hard.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.560
Daytona's not the hardest
track at all to drive.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.726
But just the little things.

00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:05.920
I'm not going to be able
to take the car at Daytona

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.650
and take it from a 15th
place car to a pole car.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.520
But I can screw it up and
lose the pole for sure

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.460
by making little
mistakes on the track.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.120
By not getting up
to speed right.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.800
Not taking the right line.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.350
As in, letting the car
open up and pick up speed.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.070
Because every time
you hold wheel on it,

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.144
it's going to scrub
speed and slow it down.

00:21:25.144 --> 00:21:26.810
But you also want the
shortest distance.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.120
So there's a little
marriage between letting

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.600
it open up off the corner
to build up momentum,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.580
but also running
a short distance

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.830
so that you're not adding
feet onto your lap.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.970
Making a longer lap.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.040
So just little things like that.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.254
And catching the apron.

00:21:40.254 --> 00:21:42.420
You're trying to be as low
as you can on the corner.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.080
But the track has
a transition point.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.240
And at that transition point,
if the car bottoms out,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.890
the body work will hit it
and scrub a bunch of speed

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.430
off the car.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.260
So just little things like that.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.010
But I'm not really
thinking about history.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.100
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Basically your answer is

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.017
you're doing your job.

00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:58.641
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah,
I'm doing my job.

00:21:58.641 --> 00:21:59.180
Absolutely.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.465
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're looking

00:21:59.465 --> 00:22:00.330
to win is what you're doing.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.620
DANICA PATRICK: Yes, exactly.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.492
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's a good answer.

00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:05.950
DANICA PATRICK:
Watching qualifying

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.650
is painful as a driver.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.934
After you go there's
literally nothing else

00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:12.350
that you can do
to make it better.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.350
It could only get worse.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.683
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
you need to hang around there

00:22:15.683 --> 00:22:16.440
and watch it, or?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.600
DANICA PATRICK: I went
and worked out actually.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.810
I was like, what do I do?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.480
And I just I went
back to the bus,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.720
got my gym clothes on,
and went into the gym

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.940
and worked out and
watched qualifying.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.740
I was still in the gym when
the last cars were qualifying.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.030
And my PR people kept
coming in and saying,

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.350
you need to get ready.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.310
You need to get ready.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.020
You're going to be on pole.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.090
I'm like, I'm not getting
out of these clothes

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.160
until I see that
car pass the line

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.285
and I know I'm on the pole.

00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.950
Because I'm not jinxing this.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.450
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Good for you.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.390
DANICA PATRICK: I
forgot to eat then, too.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:54.730
So me with no food is no good.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.540
It's no good.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.340
Any girls in here
that feel me on that?

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.394
Seems to be more
of a girl issue.

00:23:01.394 --> 00:23:03.560
So I didn't eat lunch because
I went and worked out.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.143
And then I had to go do all the
interviews for hours and hours

00:23:06.143 --> 00:23:08.790
afterwards.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.500
I probably kept Brian
Williams waiting,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.130
but I had to eat a sandwich
at some point in time.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.140
But it was exciting.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.120
It was a lot of fun.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.010
And it was really
neat to see number

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.690
10 at the top of the boards.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.870
And it's cool just to have
number 10 back really.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.930
Because it was my go-kart
number, as you guys saw.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.730
So I got to choose that number.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.740
So it's really neat to
have my old number back.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.920
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When you went to NASCAR

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.490
you got to choose?

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.200
DANICA PATRICK: When I went to
Stewart-Haas Racing and Sprint

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.640
Cup I got to choose my number.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.330
Yeah.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.910
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.510
That's a factoid for us.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.280
That's good.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.130
So you are one of
the only 13 drivers

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.571
who has led laps in both the
Indy 500 and the Daytona 500.

00:23:45.571 --> 00:23:47.320
DANICA PATRICK: So I
think that's probably

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.720
the coolest statistic to me.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.928
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Is it?

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.300
I wanted to ask you about.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.640
Is that-- again remembering
I don't know that

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.700
much about race car driving--
so is that just totally

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.890
different kinds of racing?

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.440
And to be at the top of
your game in both of them

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.380
is pretty amazing?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.910
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, they
both have the same elements.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.260
But they're just newly
learned disciplines.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.700
So I don't know
how to relate it.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.435
It's like a whole
new computer system.

00:24:09.435 --> 00:24:10.310
It's like, all right.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.830
I need to figure this out.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:12.320
But it's all the same--

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.440
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Different programming language.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:13.760
DANICA PATRICK: --sort of ideas.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.510
It's just trying to figure
it out all over again.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.260
And you'll get it.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.885
But it just takes a
little bit of time.

00:24:18.885 --> 00:24:20.390
And so it's the same thing.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.250
So, yeah.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.910
I thought that's the
coolest statistic.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.640
To be one of 13
drivers in history

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.459
that have led Daytona and Indy.

00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:29.250
That's pretty neat.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.650
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
why are those two races

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.370
such a big deal?

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.950
I mean as you said--

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:32.120
DANICA PATRICK:
They're the oldest.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.890
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--the Daytona track--

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:33.985
DANICA PATRICK: They're
some of the oldest.

00:24:33.985 --> 00:24:34.470
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: The oldest.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.979
Got it.

00:24:34.979 --> 00:24:36.770
DANICA PATRICK: Indy's
about 100 years old.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.322
And Daytona's
about 50 years old.

00:24:38.322 --> 00:24:40.530
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
they get great TV coverage

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:40.950
and all that stuff.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.470
DANICA PATRICK: They do.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.970
There's a lot that
goes around them.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.540
Qualifying is the weekend
before for both of them.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.802
So qualifying happens.

00:24:46.802 --> 00:24:48.260
There's a lot of
media around that.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.810
And then it goes all
the way through the week

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.210
into the race weekend.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.710
Yeah.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.430
They generally have
a culture of fun.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.060
I mean, there's a
lot of campsites.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.410
And people that hang out.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.870
And bonfire.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.470
And set up tiki bars.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.015
And play cornhole.

00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:08.700
And fly their Dale Jr flags.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.770
And some of them
have Danica flags.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.103
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
need to get more Danica flags.

00:25:13.103 --> 00:25:15.297
So let's talk a little
bit about things

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:16.630
that are related to what you do.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.320
Teamwork.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.520
Advice you might have.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.850
Dealing with criticism.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.970
And one of things you've
already talked about--

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.470
and I think people
here might relate

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.761
is-- sometimes it feels like
you've got this repetitive

00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:26.500
stuff and you've
got to stay focused.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.350
And you're also dealing with a
lot of scrutiny, as you said.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.210
Maybe a little bit
more being a woman.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.420
What advice would
you have to people

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.600
who are facing obstacles?

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.070
Who need to maintain their
focus and their confidence.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.110
Even when day in
and day out they

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.080
may not be getting
the rewards that they

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.627
are hoping to get for
their work product.

00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:47.210
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
the difference between someone

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.480
who ultimately is successful
and someone who isn't, is just

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.500
getting up and trying again.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.970
And I feel like I've
seen that in my life--

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.790
again, to other people--
is that things get hard

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.210
and people try again.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.230
And things got hard and people
might try again, might not.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.580
And then things got hard and
they just don't try again.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.890
And giving up
can't be an option.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.115
And I think that goes back
to the core of making sure

00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:15.990
that whatever it is
you're doing is something

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.540
that you love to do.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.740
Something that you enjoy.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.740
Something that maybe if
you didn't even get paid,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.050
would you still do it?

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.280
And I think that's what
pulls you through those times

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.272
ultimately.

00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:30.230
And that's what keeps
you coming back for more.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.670
And that's what that
passion and that love

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.542
for what it is that you do
is what keeps you going.

00:26:35.542 --> 00:26:37.000
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So would you

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.090
say your resilience
and that persistence

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.960
is because you love
what you do so much?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.668
Or is there something
about your parents?

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:45.950
Or anything in your upbringing?

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.420
DANICA PATRICK: I
think that genetically

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.270
I'm determined
because my dad was

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.850
very much like that for sure.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.410
Very persistent and determined.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.500
But I think it's also
because I found something

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.620
that I love to do.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.080
And there's plenty
of other stuff

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.410
that I've done that
I didn't keep doing.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.360
I mean, I didn't keep
playing basketball.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.030
Let's face it.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.770
But I kept racing.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.880
So it was about finding that.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.850
I feel.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.210
And finding it really young.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.850
I'm very fortunate that
I found it really young.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.130
And I tell everyone,
young or old,

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.280
if you could do anything in
the world, what would you do?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.350
Well, why can't
you do that, then?

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.320
At least start.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.270
At least just try to make
an effort at doing it.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.190
You're not going to get
there within one shot.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.370
But you just need
to take baby steps.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.710
And opportunities along the way.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.460
And I feel like, especially
people get out of college

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.940
and they have this idea
of what they want to do

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.606
and their holding out
until they get it.

00:27:38.606 --> 00:27:39.840
Just get going.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.160
Just get working.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.440
And get the experience.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.765
And start working
your way there.

00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:47.890
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think that's great advice.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.130
So you said what makes you
different makes you great.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.511
Where does that
advice come from?

00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:54.510
When you talk to people.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.010
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, I mean I think

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.090
that the most obvious
one, really obviously,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.530
is being a girl.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.290
So when I was
younger, and living

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:07.860
in England and
early teen years, I

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.130
didn't care that I was a girl.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.921
I just didn't want to
make it real obvious.

00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:13.330
I mean, I didn't
want it to stand out.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.570
I didn't wear nail
polish because when

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.750
I talk about the race
car I didn't want guys

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.760
looking at my hands and
seeing pink fingernails.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.540
I didn't wear pink
and purple and make

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.240
it really flashy and obvious.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.500
No hearts and bows.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.884
And just wanted to blend in.

00:28:28.884 --> 00:28:30.550
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're describing

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.674
my seven-year-old daughter.

00:28:31.674 --> 00:28:32.870
DANICA PATRICK: Am I really?

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.360
Hearts and bows?

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.420
Or didn't want to
wear hearts and bows?

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.360
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
She's now rejecting them.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.062
But she was all in them.

00:28:37.062 --> 00:28:39.520
DANICA PATRICK: Well, you go
through these phases where you

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.570
feel comfortable and
sometimes you don't.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.110
And I didn't really feel
comfortable making it obvious.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.230
And so it really was--
I came back from England

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.085
when I was 19.

00:28:49.085 --> 00:28:54.680
And I let myself go there
to be a girl a little bit.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.630
And it really came
from a racy photo shoot

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.080
that I did that it
was more girly of me.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.960
And it just all of a sudden--
stuff started happening.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.490
And people were contacting me.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.770
And sponsors and teams.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.650
But nobody questioned
what I could do.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.250
It wasn't like people
didn't think I could race.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.090
Or their opinion
really changed on that.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.756
Maybe they had an
opinion on what I did.

00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:18.519
But it didn't change
the opportunity

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:20.060
to be able to do
what I wanted to do.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.470
It just really was
opening doors and it

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.490
was allowing-- it was me being
able to tap into something

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.450
that was part of my personality.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.080
I mean, I think we're not
one-dimensional people.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.980
We have all kinds of
different sides to us.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.990
I don't just race.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.190
I don't just work on cars.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.880
I race.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.850
And I like to cook.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.000
And I like to travel.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.140
And I like to look pretty.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.746
And I like to get dressed up.

00:29:42.746 --> 00:29:43.870
And I like hair and makeup.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.286
And I like all
those other things.

00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:49.490
So it was a way for me to--
it was an extension of me.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.706
But it was celebrated.

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:52.080
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So success

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.600
came to you as you
embraced who you were.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600
DANICA PATRICK: Exactly.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.189
So, sometimes, I really
feel that whatever

00:29:58.189 --> 00:29:59.730
it is that's the
most different about

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.225
you is probably
the most important.

00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:02.100
And the most special.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.934
And the most useful.

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.308
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: I once had

00:30:04.308 --> 00:30:06.150
a boss who-- we
worked in consulting

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.250
and we'd go and talk to
clients and I was usually

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.570
the only woman in the room.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.600
And he said, whenever
you say something,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.020
everyone is going
to be listening.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.353
Because you're different than
everyone else in the room.

00:30:15.353 --> 00:30:17.350
And I was like, yeah.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.390
And I think you're
right on there.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.812
I like it.

00:30:20.812 --> 00:30:22.020
So let's talk about the team.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.870
You mentioned this a little bit.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.453
You've got a whole
team you work with.

00:30:24.453 --> 00:30:28.220
You've also got the car and
the technology of the car.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.600
How important is that
team for your success?

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.850
And how do you work with them?

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.525
What's your role in the team?

00:30:34.525 --> 00:30:36.400
DANICA PATRICK: I mean,
the team is critical.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.900
Obviously.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.805
I mean, you need a bus driver.

00:30:38.805 --> 00:30:40.930
You got to get a truck
driver to get the car there.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.640
You've got to get guys to
put the tires on, of course.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.100
So there's a whole bunch
of steps in the process.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.720
And it can't happen
without the other.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.970
But I think more importantly
with team, for me,

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.190
is about morale.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.810
It's about attitude.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:59.064
It's about your mood and
keeping everyone in a good mood.

00:30:59.064 --> 00:31:00.730
All those guys that
you see right there,

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.070
we see each other every
weekend of the year.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.620
Pretty much.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.040
And so that can wear on you.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.440
And it can get exhausting.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.750
That's the family vacation.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.090
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
There's your family.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.120
But you had that whole team
of guys behind the car.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:11.430
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.180
So that's my crew
chief on the left.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.760
He's kind of the other
co-team leader with me.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.530
But the two of us dictate
the mood of the entire team.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.140
Being a leader is also
being a cheerleader.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.410
And it's very important.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.677
So I think that team
is a lot attitude.

00:31:30.677 --> 00:31:33.260
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And then
is your family with you a lot?

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.510
We saw them all on the plane.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.635
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:37.930
That was the day after
the season ended.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.210
We went on vacation.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.750
So that's Ricky's family.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.897
And my family.

00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:43.480
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Did they go out

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.470
for all those 38 weekends?

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.500
DANICA PATRICK: They go out
for-- between the two families,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.700
we see them quite a bit.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.380
And we have two buses.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.530
So our family will
stay on my bus

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.950
or his family will
stay on my bus.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.220
And we'll stay on Ricky's bus.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.100
And we have a total
fancy campground.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.840
We just open our
buses up together.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.600
Open up the tents.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.530
We've got picnic tables.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.220
Grills.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.400
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're making me want a bus.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.149
DANICA PATRICK: Family's
really important.

00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:12.590
And I think that as an
extension of your mood,

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.610
family plays a role in that too.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:18.240
If your home life isn't good
that tends to bleed over.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.050
And vice versa.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.590
So keeping everything
in order and being happy

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.030
is really important,
I think, for success.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.030
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You talked a little bit--

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.390
I think that's great and it
seems like having that support

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:29.880
system--

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.030
DANICA PATRICK: I think I
gotta cheer for the Colts.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.500
We were at a Colts game.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.390
I mean, I'm a Bears fan.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.200
But I don't know anymore.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.170
We haven't been doing so well.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.360
The Colts are on their way.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.940
Did anyone see them come back?

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.630
28 points.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.925
Down a half.

00:32:44.925 --> 00:32:46.050
That was pretty impressive.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.258
I don't know if they'd beat
a California team or not.

00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.320
But I'm sorry but--

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.076
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
have to get off this topic.

00:32:50.076 --> 00:32:52.260
DANICA PATRICK: But
I did watch the game.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260
But I'm still a girl.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.900
I still don't always remember
all the details about it.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.065
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Me either, but I like it.

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:57.490
DANICA PATRICK: I do too.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:57.950
I love football.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.740
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I love football.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.240
All right.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.510
So talking about-- not
related to the NFL--

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.590
DANICA PATRICK: Anybody watch
the GoDaddy Bowl last night?

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.892
Maybe next year.

00:33:05.892 --> 00:33:08.225
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: But
you went from NFL to college.

00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:09.100
You just confused
me for a second.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.050
DANICA PATRICK: I did.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.650
I did.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.483
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
But that was actually

00:33:12.483 --> 00:33:13.960
a good segue for what I needed.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.210
Sponsorship and brand building.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.584
So let's talk about it.

00:33:19.584 --> 00:33:21.000
It's an interesting
thing for you.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.179
You're a brand.

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:23.220
You've got Danica Racing.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.114
You've got your name
as basically a brand.

00:33:25.114 --> 00:33:26.780
You've got your
sponsorship relationship

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.080
with GoDaddy and
some other companies.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.484
But did you ever actively
think about-- I mean,

00:33:31.484 --> 00:33:32.900
you almost mentioned
this when you

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.830
talked about the
photo-shoot and how

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.570
things started to
happen for you.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.230
Do you ever think, I'm
building a brand here?

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.660
When did you realize that?

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.670
Or when did you start
to think that way?

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.640
DANICA PATRICK: It
took a while for sure.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.020
I mean, I think that
the idea of brand

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.420
and the idea of role model
took a little while to set in.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.572
Because it all seems so new.

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:53.530
I'm like, I don't know.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.570
I'm just driving.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.190
And I'm trying to
figure myself out.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.970
But I've been really
fortunate in my career.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.920
I've had great
sponsors along the way.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.410
And Go Daddy being the best.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:09.080
Where I can be myself.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.150
They stand behind
me no matter what.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:16.190
And they have great core values.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:20.400
And they've done some really
great stuff and continue to.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.610
And so brand is very important.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.210
In this day and age,
especially with social media

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.190
and everything like
that, we're all

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.670
reading through authenticity
pretty quickly and easily.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.010
I think you can tell what's
real and what's not real.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.260
And if there's anything that
I want to do, it's be real.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.900
And be someone
that you can trust.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:46.219
And someone that you
look at what I'm doing

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.520
and you believe in it.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.179
And so I've been
lucky enough to be

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.730
able to be selective over
the years with my partners.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.469
And I've got great ones.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.800
And they're extensions
of who I am.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.050
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Are
there are other things that

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.530
come to your mind when
you think about what

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.810
you hope everyone relate--

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.144
DANICA PATRICK: Other than fast?

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:05.310
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Fast.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.850
Good one.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.190
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, back in 2009,

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.340
I signed on with IMG, which
is now William Morris.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:19.700
But we created a brand statement
or a brand title for me.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.934
And it was Beautiful Revolution.

00:35:22.934 --> 00:35:24.350
And it was really
just about being

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.600
able to be feminine, be who
you are, but yet be different.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.087
And so that's the
statement from my--

00:35:30.087 --> 00:35:31.920
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And be revolutionary.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.350
And were you an
active participant

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:33.890
in that whole process?

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:34.730
DANICA PATRICK: Absolutely.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.480
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's pretty cool.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.920
DANICA PATRICK: There was all
these storyboards going on.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.020
And photos of me
doing certain things.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.110
Categorized stuff
from the internet.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:47.370
And it built a story of
what really stands out

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.190
about me in the public eye.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.270
And what people are
paying attention to.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.810
And then words start
to get developed

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.840
from those storyboards
and from those collages.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.945
And then it keeps
whittling down to a title.

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:02.070
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Wow.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.652
Cool.

00:36:02.652 --> 00:36:04.110
So I think we have
a picture of you

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.070
at the Country Music Awards or--

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.250
DANICA PATRICK: The
American Country Awards.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.120
Oh my gosh.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.670
That's the best shot I've
seen of the height difference.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.760
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
If we have time--

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.580
DANICA PATRICK: I have boots on.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:16.860
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
If we have time

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.740
later we'll show a
funny video from this.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.890
But we're going to
run short on time.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.470
But I wanted to ask you about
when you do stuff like this.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.270
When you make these choices.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.835
Besides they don't let you
choose your co-host, I guess.

00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:28.710
Or your co-presenter.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.814
DANICA PATRICK:
No, he was great.

00:36:29.814 --> 00:36:30.183
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: He's so tall.

00:36:30.183 --> 00:36:32.260
DANICA PATRICK: Chris is great.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.440
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Do
you think about your brand?

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.760
Do you think about
what's fun for you?

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.115
Or whether you have
time in your schedule?

00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.240
DANICA PATRICK: Absolutely.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.020
I think about
things that are fun.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.780
I don't know--
Does anybody listen

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.850
to country music in here?

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:43.530
Not many.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.850
I'm not surprised.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.965
We're in California.

00:36:45.965 --> 00:36:46.840
It's OK.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.570
But I know there's
some of you out there.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.590
So it was one of those
things-- country music

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.720
it just happened for me.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.940
I never, ever listened to it.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.440
And my dad always
said, it feels like I'm

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.800
kissing a horse when I
listen to this stuff.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.470
So my upbringing, which
I feel like dictates

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.160
who we are-- seeing your parents
and seeing the way you grew up

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.319
is an explanation
and not an excuse.

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:11.110
You are who you are
because of your family.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.530
And my dad hated country music.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.280
So I never listened to it.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.710
And so I got to NASCAR.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.850
And I mean GAC.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.430
GAC is on the TV.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.270
And it's all country
bumpkin music.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.430
And I just wasn't
having any of it.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.590
I did a music video
with Miranda Lambert.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.550
And it was called
"Fastest Girl in Town."

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.086
And I had not heard her song.

00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:35.960
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
She seems pretty cool.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.240
DANICA PATRICK:
She is very cool.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.280
But I hadn't heard her song.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.780
And it was already
out on the radio.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.310
So I felt kind of bad.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.420
So I thought, I'll
get her albums.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.439
And she had just started a
new band with two other girls.

00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:48.980
And they're called
the Pistol Annies.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.350
So I got that too.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.340
And I listened to them.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.660
And I was like, I think
I like country music.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.239
And it just happened like that.

00:37:56.239 --> 00:37:57.780
Now it's pretty much
all I listen to.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.970
So when the American
Country Awards

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.060
asked me to co-host
the show, I'm like,

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.650
you mean present, right?

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.860
No, co-host.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.530
OK.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:07.775
So--

00:38:07.775 --> 00:38:08.020
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's a lot of work.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.770
DANICA PATRICK: It was
a huge undertaking.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.260
And I'm extremely decisive.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.472
You don't have to ask twice.

00:38:14.472 --> 00:38:15.930
You might have to
tell me something

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:16.889
twice because I forget.

00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:18.680
But you don't have to
ask a question twice.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.510
And my agent asked me
if I wanted to do it.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.750
And he's like,
this is a big deal.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.440
This is a definite yes.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.800
And I'm like, I'm going
to need to call you back.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.120
And in the past he would
tell me, call me back

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:30.910
and let me know.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.550
And I would say, Alan, the
only thing I'm going to do

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.840
is forget to call you back.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.360
I already know the answer.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.700
And so I told him,
I think I'm going

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.490
to need to call you
back on this one.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.510
And I asked around about
what people thought.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.650
Basically, did anybody
think I could handle this?

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.686
So I said yes and it was--

00:38:47.686 --> 00:38:50.060
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Because
that's like multiple hours

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.717
being up on that stage.

00:38:51.717 --> 00:38:53.300
DANICA PATRICK: It's
a shorter country

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.570
show but it's two hours.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.530
And you're co-hosting.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.320
So it's important.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.370
And I ended up singing
and dancing on the show.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.429
I wore a showgirl outfit
at one point in time.

00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:08.970
You should have seen the number
they wanted me to wear first.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.841
I tempered it to
feel comfortable.

00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:12.340
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Good for you.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.710
DANICA PATRICK: Because you've
got to feel comfortable.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.250
And of course that's
the photo that

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.590
makes the magazine or newspaper.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.550
But it went great.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.490
It was a lot of fun.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.906
And more than anything, it was
about having an experience.

00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:23.340
And growing as a person.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.025
And doing something
outside of my comfort zone.

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:27.900
I'm much more comfortable
answering questions

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.810
than I am reading a
prompter and having

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.101
to do something pre-programmed.

00:39:33.124 --> 00:39:35.540
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Back
to the advice and we'll close.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.590
And we'll talk a little
bit about internet

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.480
and small businesses and things.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.110
You really stretched
yourself, right?

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.340
You did something you weren't
that comfortable doing.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:44.970
Where do you--

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:45.986
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I've
always wanted to be a singer,

00:39:45.986 --> 00:39:46.791
but I'm not.

00:39:46.791 --> 00:39:48.790
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
But you sang on the show.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.820
DANICA PATRICK: I sang a lot.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.690
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Where does that come from?

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.280
I mean, if you're talking
to people in the room

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.480
here who are thinking
of trying something new

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.000
or doing something different.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.579
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
that's the only way you grow.

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:01.120
And that's the only
way you can start

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.780
to learn your real capabilities.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.960
And what I've learned
over the years with me,

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.030
is that trying new things ends
up usually going pretty well.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.200
And that's where
you start to get

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.770
more confidence in yourself.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.960
And if anything, you
just learn something.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.040
And you have an experience.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.130
And life is about experiences.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.710
And if something exciting
comes your way just say yes.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.970
Just try something new.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:26.980
And not be afraid.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.920
And the worst thing
you do is fail.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.470
And you just don't
do it anymore.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.170
Or you try again.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.290
So new experiences
are how you grow.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.730
And I think that, that goes
back to the core of-- even

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.070
just living in a new
country when I was 16.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.350
I grew up so fast
because I did that.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.050
And it's about doing things
that are outside of your comfort

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.900
zone.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.301
Something you would not do.

00:40:48.301 --> 00:40:49.800
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.950
So speaking of about building
businesses and brands

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.540
and doing some new things.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.300
One of things that
is not new for you

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.380
is your relationship
with GoDaddy.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.570
But we're going to
talk a little bit

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.940
about the commercial this year.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.020
And the internet and
small businesses.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.320
In your own brand building
and business building,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.010
how important has
the internet been?

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.180
You mentioned social media.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.790
You mentioned
people really being

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.720
able to smell whether
something's authentic or not.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.780
Do you use any Google products?

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.357
Do you use technology a lot?

00:41:20.357 --> 00:41:21.690
DANICA PATRICK: I google myself.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.260
Is that bad?

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.010
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
No, that's not bad.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.680
DANICA PATRICK: I actually
google my name and Ricky's name

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.170
and I look for new photos of us.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.560
Because we get candid
ones taken at the track.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.780
And I never see them.

00:41:38.045 --> 00:41:40.170
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
do not have pictures of me

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.044
and my husband on the
internet when I google.

00:41:42.044 --> 00:41:45.470
DANICA PATRICK: I will say that
Google is the only thing I ever

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.651
use for search engine.

00:41:46.651 --> 00:41:47.150
Always.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.940
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Oh,
we're very happy to hear that.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.844
Thank you.

00:41:53.131 --> 00:41:53.630
OK.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.610
That was a shameless
Google question.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.509
DANICA PATRICK:
That's the truth.

00:41:57.509 --> 00:42:00.050
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Do you
think about building businesses

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.508
online or the work that GoDaddy
does with small businesses?

00:42:02.508 --> 00:42:05.070
How do you think about that?

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.937
Or are you separate
from their business?

00:42:06.937 --> 00:42:09.270
DANICA PATRICK: Where I came
from-- I mean my first Indy

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.732
500 in 2005.

00:42:13.732 --> 00:42:16.700
My website shut down because
there was too much traffic.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.760
It couldn't handle it.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.301
I don't know.

00:42:18.301 --> 00:42:19.690
The server wasn't big enough.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.470
We didn't see that coming.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.260
So--

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.520
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So
that taught you a lesson.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.950
DANICA PATRICK: It taught
me a lesson in 2005

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.070
about being prepared.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.600
But also about how much
interest there is there.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.370
And like you said,
I'm usually one

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.690
of the more searched athletes.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:41.580
And so internet is a huge source
of how we learn about things.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.450
How we maybe choose to
cheer for something.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.000
Choose to like something.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.310
I mean, I use it all
the time for everything.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.810
I mean, GoDaddy is all
about small businesses.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.120
And for me that
taps right into me.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.000
I mean, I'm finding
new gyms to go

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.650
to because I'm
always on the road.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:42:59.460
A restaurant.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.190
A store.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.880
You name it.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.820
A hotel.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:02.820
I need locations.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.920
I need hours.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.850
And if you're not on the
internet, I can't find you.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.130
So I use the
internet constantly.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.630
And it's been a
source of how I've

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.430
gotten to where I am today.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:19.700
And it can also be a
source for someone else

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.250
to see their dreams
come true, too,

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.110
by making themselves relative.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:25.440
I feel like if you're
not on the internet,

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.537
you're not relevant
in this day and age.

00:43:28.537 --> 00:43:29.870
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We agree.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:30.970
Thank you for saying that.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.970
We'd love to see more
businesses get online.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.810
And we're thrilled that GoDaddy
does so much work to help them.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.380
When you think about your
relationship with GoDaddy--

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.140
I mean you've been in the
most Superbowl commercials

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.270
of any celebrity or
some stat like that.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.379
Which is kind of wild.

00:43:44.379 --> 00:43:45.170
But think about it.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.700
DANICA PATRICK: It
is kind of weird.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.940
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
that's since 2007, right?

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.420
DANICA PATRICK: It's like 100
million people every time.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:48.950
That's crazy.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:49.680
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's a lot.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.900
That's a lot of eyeballs.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.530
A lot of impressions.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.570
Then you've got
the YouTube people

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.670
watching it all over again,
which we see a lot of.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.935
When you think about how
their advertising has evolved

00:44:00.935 --> 00:44:02.810
and what they're planning
now for this year--

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.101
I don't know how much you're
allowed to talk about it--

00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:07.680
but you've grown up together.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.309
Do you work together on
the creative concepts?

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:12.600
Or do you do show up and
they're like, here's the plan.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.430
How does it work?

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:14.805
DANICA PATRICK:
A little of both.

00:44:14.805 --> 00:44:18.220
But there's always that trump
card of, I don't like that.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.210
There always has been.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.870
We both respect each other.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.970
And so it's been a
great relationship

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:26.970
from the very beginning.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.386
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So anything

00:44:28.386 --> 00:44:30.200
you could tell us
about this year's ad?

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.250
DANICA PATRICK: No, not really.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.500
I mean, I think there was some
photos that got out there.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.610
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I heard it's different.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:34.790
I heard it's different.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:36.540
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah,
there's two of them.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.740
I'm in one of them.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.156
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: And they're

00:44:39.156 --> 00:44:41.640
talking about
getting found online.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.720
I've been told that much.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.140
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.540
Well, it's all about that.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.090
And it's definitely
about showing women now

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.150
in a really powerful way of
being small business owners.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.290
Being confident.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.760
And trying to see
their dreams come true.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.100
And so I like that.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.310
I mean, I completely
relate to that.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.101
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Do think of yourself

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.689
as a small business owner?

00:45:06.689 --> 00:45:08.730
DANICA PATRICK: I mean,
I guess I do more so now.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.230
I think about it.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.420
And I think about it in
the long-term of like,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.440
at some point in time I
won't be racing anymore.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.731
And then what am I going to do?

00:45:15.731 --> 00:45:18.020
So building the brand
up to a certain point

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.840
and then maybe
branching off so that

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.030
when I retire from
racing-- I'm probably

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.570
not going to be
65-- I'll still have

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:30.204
something fun to do
outside of racing.

00:45:30.204 --> 00:45:31.620
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Do you have

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.544
advice for women in business?

00:45:33.544 --> 00:45:35.585
When you think about
yourself as a business woman

00:45:35.585 --> 00:45:40.131
or your future-- you've given
a lot of great advice actually

00:45:40.131 --> 00:45:42.630
this whole talk-- but when you
think about the business side

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:43.040
of it--

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.581
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
that first and foremost, it's

00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:48.030
making sure that it is
something that you love doing.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.000
But then it's about confidence.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.900
I mean, I remember
being a kid and going

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.080
into a business meeting.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.630
And I said a lot of I
thinks and maybes and likes.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.330
And it's about being
poignant, confident.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.185
You want this.

00:46:02.185 --> 00:46:03.960
This is what's going to happen.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.910
And being aggressive
with your words.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.480
And I think that that's
something to always keep

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.587
in mind-- is to
just be confident

00:46:12.587 --> 00:46:13.670
through the whole process.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.070
And the way that at least
I've generated confidence,

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.240
is by doing my homework and
being smart about something.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.220
And knowledge is power.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.720
And those old
commercials when I was

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.850
a kid watching Sunday morning
cartoons-- knowledge is power

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.570
and stars flew
across the screen.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.330
It's true.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:28.920
It's true.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.490
You can't be in full
control and know everything

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.160
and do a good job unless
you really do your homework

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.556
and know what you're asking for.

00:46:37.556 --> 00:46:38.930
What you're trying
to accomplish.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.047
So confidence and
doing your homework.

00:46:42.047 --> 00:46:43.880
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You sound like you're

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.000
someone who works a lot
on being well-prepared.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.809
I mean you must have prepared
for this thing a lot.

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:49.600
DANICA PATRICK: OK.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.391
Quick little story.

00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:53.180
So I got there to
Vegas and it was

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.170
like four or five
days before the show.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.920
I didn't have anything yet.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.620
I saw the opening.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.880
The cold opening was a pre-tape.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.860
And I had seen that.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.040
But I saw nothing else.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.860
So it's just how it works.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.440
Because the writers that do
all the shows-- the writers

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.500
they do all the shows.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.762
So they came off of
a show that had just

00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:13.970
aired a couple weeks earlier.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.710
And then they started
writing the ACA's.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.430
So it was like, you don't
really have content.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.100
So it kind of scared me.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:25.160
So it wasn't until we went
into our first rehearsal was

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.090
on-- the show was on
Tuesday-- Saturday

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:32.140
we went and read prompter and
did blocks or whatever it is.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.540
And we read the script
on the prompter.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.990
I had never seen the script.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.920
And I'm reading it on prompter
for the very first time.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.080
And so it was a mild disaster.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:50.690
And so, I mean, words
like, a bad rehearsal

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.540
is a good sign for a good
show, they were telling me.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.100
And I'm like, shoot.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.535
So it was a whole
new experience.

00:47:58.535 --> 00:48:00.480
It was like cramming for a test.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.460
As if I ever did that.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.360
But it was solid Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday of line

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.250
reads and going over things.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.750
I mean, I had to
do a dance routine.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.420
So I would just
stop, drop, and roll.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.714
I would just do it on the spot.

00:48:13.714 --> 00:48:15.130
Just so that I
could know I didn't

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.830
need to think about the dance.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.470
And it was just all
about repetition.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.670
So it was like cramming
for those days.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.170
Completely.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.930
Claire Hughes Johnson: You did
prepare, but it was intense.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:24.660
DANICA PATRICK:
I mean, my calves

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.640
hurt from doing that
little dance so much.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.290
It was only 17 seconds.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:32.182
But it was long enough for my
calves to hurt for three days.

00:48:32.182 --> 00:48:33.640
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: You couldn't

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.650
get me to dance
for five seconds.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:35.100
So good job.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.850
DANICA PATRICK: But
it was great because I

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:38.600
was by far outside
of my comfort zone.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.517
But it was really fun.

00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:41.058
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That is great.

00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:42.400
So a couple of final questions.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.066
When you think about
all your balancing,

00:48:44.066 --> 00:48:47.330
you're an entrepreneur, a
race car driver, obviously.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.539
You've done things like this.

00:48:48.539 --> 00:48:50.913
You've got your family that
you spend a lot of time with.

00:48:50.913 --> 00:48:53.350
How do you balance all
those competing priorities?

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.730
Do you have a
framework in your head?

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.280
Or do you just take
it as it comes?

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.610
DANICA PATRICK: I think
you have to take some of it

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.490
as it comes because
sometimes it's new.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:05.980
But for me it's definitely
been a little bit

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.880
of trial and error.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.110
And as your life changes and
evolves, then gets bigger,

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.450
essentially I feel
like the older you get

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.200
there's more to
manage and balance.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.700
And you just have to find
out what your own rhythm is.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.930
How you like to
operate in your day?

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.357
How you like to
prioritize things?

00:49:21.357 --> 00:49:22.940
Do you like to bunch
your schedule up?

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.130
Do you like to spread it out?

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.838
Do you need to make
sure there's lunches?

00:49:25.838 --> 00:49:27.870
I mean, down to all
those kinds of things.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.840
Just, how do you
like to run your day?

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.220
And so I've figured
out what that is.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.710
Now mind you, I mean
I was pretty exhausted

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.247
by the end of that
show in December.

00:49:38.247 --> 00:49:40.330
And the rest of the stuff
I had to do in December.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.320
But sometimes you
have to bend a little.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.497
But you just can't get to
the point that you break.

00:49:45.497 --> 00:49:47.580
If you break then that's
where the problems start.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.850
And then it breaks
everything else down.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:52.800
So it's OK to say no.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.519
And as long as it comes from
a good, honest place of,

00:49:55.519 --> 00:49:57.310
I'm not going to be
good for this situation

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.930
if I say yes, or good for
myself or good for my family,

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.270
then you just say no.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:05.270
And you move on and know
that you're better for it.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.532
And find those
little things that

00:50:07.532 --> 00:50:08.740
make you happy along the way.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.160
Whether it's going to get
a pedicure or massage.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.250
For me, just sitting down
and playing Candy Crush.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.244
Just whatever it is.

00:50:16.244 --> 00:50:18.410
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Is
that on your mobile phone?

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.800
DANICA PATRICK: It is.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.000
Ricky and I are always competing
against who's ahead of who.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.189
I'm behind right now.

00:50:24.189 --> 00:50:26.730
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So you
need to get over done with this

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.260
and do some Candy Crush.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.260
And the final thing you
mentioned for your team,

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.860
that you focus a lot
on morale and being

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.510
someone who keeps
them motivated and up.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:40.310
When you think about leadership
and being a role model, which

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.980
you said came to
you, you realized,

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.756
wow-- you are a role
model, by the way.

00:50:44.756 --> 00:50:47.150
I have a colleague here
who brought her daughter

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.140
because her daughter
wrote a paper about you.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.830
I think.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:55.490
How do you carry
that responsibility?

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:56.657
What kind of leader are you?

00:50:56.657 --> 00:50:58.239
How do you think
about being a leader?

00:50:58.239 --> 00:51:00.170
How do you think about
being a role model?

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:04.660
Is that hard to have to
think about all the time?

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.110
DANICA PATRICK: I think that
it's about being yourself.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.700
And then you can
really never screw up.

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:17.590
And I always encourage everyone,
whether they're young or old,

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:21.250
to do what you love to
do and be who you are.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.670
And then you can't ever make
a mistake along the way.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.080
You just are being who you are.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.730
And if I get fiery and
intense at the racetrack,

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:29.610
I'm not shocking you.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:30.660
I've done this before.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.610
But that's who I am.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.780
And if you don't like it at
least you can respect it.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.999
So that's how I operate
in my days and my life.

00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:40.040
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When did you realize that?

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.650
That you just have
to be who you are.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.980
DANICA PATRICK: I think that
it just grows over time.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.330
I think it's grown
over time to realize

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.570
that you can be
different and it's OK.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.050
And that you can
have an opinion.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.730
And in fact, I'm a
consumer, for sure.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.510
And when I watch
things or people,

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.690
I don't just want to
watch people telling me

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.160
what I'm supposed to be hearing.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.540
I want to see them be
honest and raw and real.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.590
And maybe it sounds like
what I want to hear.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:10.640
But maybe it doesn't.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.990
And I respect them for that.

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:16.750
So I like people
to be who they are.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.792
And the differences are
what make us interesting.

00:52:18.792 --> 00:52:20.166
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.

00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:20.680
Final thing.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.780
It's a new year.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.310
Any big goals for this year?

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.624
DANICA PATRICK: To be
the most Googled athlete.

00:52:25.624 --> 00:52:27.790
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think you already did that.

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.399
You already did that.

00:52:29.399 --> 00:52:30.190
DANICA PATRICK: OK.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.375
To be the most Googled
athlete at least today.

00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:33.750
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.640
I think you're already there.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.490
DANICA PATRICK: No, I want
the whole one actually.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.220
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're all there.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.630
But any races?

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:38.320
Anything?

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.987
Any race car driving thing?

00:52:38.987 --> 00:52:39.310
I should ask.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:41.851
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, it's my
second year in the Sprint Cup

00:52:41.851 --> 00:52:42.430
Series.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.010
It by no makes me
a veteran at all.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.940
But for me it's
about progression.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.470
And I don't think
that you can ever

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.870
know exactly where you should
be or what you should want.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.130
And it's good to set goals.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:59.420
For me I feel good to just
set progression goals.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.970
And know that I'm
getting better.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.220
And when I look back over
the last month, am I better?

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.200
Over the last six
months, am I better?

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.430
And of course my ultimate
goals are I want to win races.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:13.030
I want to run in the top
15 as much as possible.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.900
I want another Daytona 500 pole.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.390
And I want to win
the whole race.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.350
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:18.460
Well, thank you so much.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.894
This was great.

00:53:26.577 --> 00:53:27.660
DANICA PATRICK: Thank you.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.010
Thank you for coming everybody.
