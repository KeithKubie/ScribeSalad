00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:09.240
One of the big assumptions of our times is that if love is real, it must by definition prove to be eternal.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.020
We invariably and naturally equate genuine relationships with life-long relationships.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.160
And therefore it seems almost impossible for us to interpret the ending of a union after only a limited period...

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.860
a few weeks, or five or ten years, or anything short of our or the partner’s death-date...

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:38.020
as something other than a problem, a failure and an emotional catastrophe that is someone’s fault, probably our own.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.380
There are people desperate that they've failed because their relationships have lasted only thirty-two years.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.660
We appear fundamentally unable to trust that a relationship could be at once sincere, meaningful and important...

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.020
and yet at the same time fairly and guiltlessly limited in its duration.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.660
There are, of course, a few very good reasons for our collective valorisation of the life-long love story.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.560
A great many of the pleasures and virtues of relationships do only reveal themselves over time,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.800
once trust has been established and loyalty fully demonstrated.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.280
When two people know it's forever, they will work harder than at anything else in their lives,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.900
there's no option to avoid some necessary but unpleasant issues,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.860
they will do their utmost to understand the mysteries of the other’s psyche,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.740
they will show reserves of tenderness and vulnerability they wouldn’t ever otherwise have accessed.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.260
They will learn to apologize and reach a modesty about their own shortcomings.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.820
They will grow up.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
And in the meantime, day-to-day, they will sample the modest but genuine pleasures

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.720
of cosy Sunday evenings together and shared walks in country parks.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.880
Not least, children always benefit.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.600
But it’s because the charms of the long-term are so clear in our collective imaginations

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.600
that we should acknowledge the danger of cruelly and normatively suppressing all the legitimate claims of short-term love,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.480
an arrangement which deserves to be interpreted not merely as a pathologically stunted or interrupted version of a long-term union,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.480
but as a state with distinctive virtues of its own, one that we might rationally choose from the outset,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.940
knowing from the start that it would be better for both parties if there was a termination point more or less in view.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.320
So much can go right with short-term love:

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.920
When two people know they don’t own one another, they are extremely careful to earn each other’s respect on a daily basis.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.100
Knowing someone could leave us at any time isn’t only grounds for insecurity, it’s a constant catalyst for tender appreciation.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.300
When it isn’t forever, we can let differences lie.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.700
If the journey is to be long, absolute alignment can feel key.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.280
But when the time is short, we're readier to surrender our entrenched positions, to be unthreatened by novelties and dissonances.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.120
The distinctive things they have in their fridge and the peculiar things they like to watch and listen to aren’t affronts to our values,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.180
they're unthreatening invitations to expand our personalities.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.600
Very few of us come out well from being closely observed, 24 hours a day, in a limited space.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.740
These may simply not be the preconditions for getting the best out of some of us.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.940
Our interesting and generous sides may need, in order to emerge,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.140
our own bedroom and bathroom, quite a few hours to ourselves, some space to read and think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.600
and a series of mealtimes alone staring rather blankly out of the window without having to explain how we feel.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.360
It’s not a sign of evil, just what we require to be the best version of ourselves.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.960
What makes people difficult and dooms relationships is almost never the people involved.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.360
It’s what we're trying to do with them.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.680
Inviting someone to marry you is really not a very kind thing to do to someone you love,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.000
because it’s going to drag the beloved into a range of really rather unpleasant and challenging things:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.480
doing the accounts with you, meeting your family regularly,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.720
seeing you exhausted and bleary-eyed after work, keeping the living room tidy, bringing up a child.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.260
To really love someone – that is, to wish the best for someone –

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.520
might more fairly mean foregrounding your best qualities for a few ecstatic months,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.300
and then mutually and tenderly parting at the check-in desk.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.240
Long-term relationships reward some qualities – especially the administrative ones – but they obscure others,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.480
for example, those related to skills at having interesting speculative conversations about ethics or the meaning of life late into the night.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.740
It should be no insult to determine that some people simply won’t be able to shine in the conditions of long-term love,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:04.440
and that it's very kindly playing up to their strengths to leave them long before we ever need to try to arrange a cutlery drawer with them.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.920
We should beware of succumbing to the debilitating feeling that because it didn’t last forever, it can have been nothing at all.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.640
In other areas of life, we know that ‘going on forever’ isn’t the ideal (even when something is very good).

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.800
We don’t necessarily think we have to stay in the same house all our lives though we might really like the one we're in;

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.260
we’re not betraying it or destroying it when we recognize that for a range of reasons it might be wisest to move elsewhere.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:41.900
We need to have an account of love which allows that a relationship can end without anyone having viciously or pathologically killed it prematurely,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.880
for only against such a backdrop can we reduce the debilitating quantity of bitterness, guilt and blame that's otherwise in circulation.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.800
How we see the endings of love depends to a critical extent on what our societies tell us is ‘normal’.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.800
If it was meant to last forever, then every ending will by necessity have to be described as a horrifying failure.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.080
But if we allow imaginative space for short-term love, then an ending may signal a deeper loyalty,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.220
not to setting up of a home and domestic routines, but to a deep appreciation and admiration one felt for someone for a time;

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:32.360
we’ll walk away with a fair and generous sense of all that's been preserved and enhanced by the relationship not being forced to last forever.
