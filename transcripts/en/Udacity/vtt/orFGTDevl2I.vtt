00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.690
Heritability of 0.85 is closer to one,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.300
indicating that genetic factors play a much

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.280
larger role in differences in height across

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.050
the population than environmental factors do. Now

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.820
,if genetics did not play much of a role, then the correlation in monozygotic

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.540
and dizygotic twins would be more similar,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.460
and the heritability would be closer to zero.
