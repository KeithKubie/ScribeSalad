00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.610
So we have two different
molecules here.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.010
This is hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.109
We call it peroxide, because
it has this oxygen-oxygen bond.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.050
And here we have
oxygen difluoride,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.840
where oxygen is bonded to
two different fluorines.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.460
And what I want you to do
is pause this video, use

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.891
this periodic table of
elements I have here,

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.890
and this is more than
just a typical information

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.310
of periodic table of elements.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.654
It also gives you the
electronegativities

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:27.820
of these different elements.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.260
And these
electronegativities are

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.720
based on the Pauling scale
named after famous biologist

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.480
and chemist Linus Pauling.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.240
And so using the
information here

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.660
and what you know already
about oxidation states,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
think about the oxidation
states or the oxidation numbers

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.840
for each of the constituent
elements in these molecules.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.330
So pause the video now.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.740
So I'm assuming you
have given a shot at it.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.560
And you might have
immediately realized

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.970
that something very
interesting is going on.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.840
We've said in the
past that because it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.330
two valence electrons away
from a full valence shell,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.560
because it is so
electronegative,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.980
oxygen typically takes electrons
from other things, typically

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.030
two electrons, which
typically gives it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.395
an oxidation state of
negative-- an oxidation number

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:20.560
or oxidation state
of negative 2.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.365
This is so electronegative,
and it so typically oxidizes

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:25.490
other things that we've
called the whole phenomenon

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.260
"oxidation."

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.010
But what's interesting
here is that oxygen

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.950
isn't purely bonded to
things less electronegative

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.850
than itself.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.780
And the hydrogen peroxide, yes,
it is bonded to the hydrogen.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.440
But it's also bonded
to another oxygen.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.856
And obviously,
these two are going

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:43.030
to be equally electronegative.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.050
So what would be
the oxidation states

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.370
or the oxidation numbers here?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.954
Well, hydrogen, once again,
we portend-- hydrogen,

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:51.370
because it's less
electronegative,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.115
it would have a partially
positive charge,

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.490
because the
electrons would spend

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.860
more time around this oxygen.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.420
But when we're talking
about oxidation states,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.460
we don't like this
partial charge business.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.340
We want to pretend like
these covalent bonds

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.070
are ionic bonds,
hypothetical ionic bonds.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.080
And if they were hypothetically
ionic bonds, what would happen?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.020
Well, if you had to give
these electrons to somebody,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.770
you would give
them to the oxygen,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.860
the electrons in this period,
give them to the oxygen,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.810
giving it an oxidation
state of negative 1.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.360
With the hydrogen having
these electrons taken away,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.050
it's going to have an
oxidation state of positive 1.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.260
And the same thing's going
to be true for that oxygen

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.380
and that hydrogen
right over there.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.310
So this is fascinating,
because this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.260
is an example where oxygen
has an oxidation state not

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.490
of negative 2, but an
oxidation state of negative 1.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.030
So this is already
kind of interesting.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.550
Now it gets even
more interesting

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.550
when we go to oxygen difluoride.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.330
Why is this more interesting?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.430
Because fluorine is the one
thing on this entire table

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.160
that is more
electronegative than oxygen.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.330
This is a covalent bond, but
in our hypothetical ionic bond,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.590
if we had to give
these electrons to one

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.590
of these atoms, you would
give it to the fluorine.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.840
So the fluorine,
each of them would

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.206
have an oxidation
state of negative 1.

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.080
And the oxygen here--
now, you could imagine,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.880
this is nuts for oxygen.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.510
The oxidation state for oxygen,
it's giving up these electrons.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.214
It would be a positive 2.

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:22.630
And we talk about
oxidation states

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.421
when we write this
little superscript here.

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.430
We write the sign
after the number.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.740
And that's just the convention.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.050
But it has an oxidation
state of positive 2.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.740
Oxygen, the thing that likes
to oxidize other things,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.950
it itself has been
oxidized by fluorine.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.880
So this is a pretty
dramatic example

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.920
of how something might stray
from what's typical oxidation

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640
state or it's typical
oxidation number.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.260
And in general, oxygen will have
an oxidation state or oxidation

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.780
number in most
molecules of negative 2.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.340
But unless it's bonded
with another oxygen

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.260
or it's bonded to fluorine,
which is a much more

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.770
electronegative-- or
actually, not much more,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.230
but it's the only atom that
is more electronegative than--

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.320
or the only element is more
electronegative than oxygen.
