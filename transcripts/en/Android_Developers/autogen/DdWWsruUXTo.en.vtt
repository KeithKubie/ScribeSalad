00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.930
 Android Studio 3.3 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.810
 It is now available for download on the stable channel. 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.470
 Used with version 3.3 is Gradle's Android plugin. 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.420
 In this release we have provided 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.060
 Features previewed this year, including a navigation editor, 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.760
 New tracking options for the analyzer, 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.930
 Building system improvements, as well as lazy task configuration. 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.050
 The navigation editor allows you to create targets, 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.600
 Define parameters and specify transitions between them. 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 If you are using a navigation architecture, 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.509
 Then be able to view the entire application process 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.320
 It is a major improvement. 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.180
 You can link them by drag and drop. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 And operate for each user 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.970
 Specifies the type of conversion. 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.610
 The analyzer now allows you to 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.790
 Run API 26, or a later device 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.490
 Select the data collection level for real-time memory allocation. 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.250
 You can choose either full mode or simple mode. 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.140
 This can improve your application performance during analysis. 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.300
 To help you get closer 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 Real user experience. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.610
 With the CPU Analyzer you can view each frame 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.674
 The time rendered on the UI thread. 

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:02.090
 Profiler highlighting 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.180
 Frames longer than 16 milliseconds, 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.720
 Lets you easily recognize when the UI doesn't work. 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.770
 If your app uses an outdated API, 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.840
 Android Studio is now available for you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.600
 More detailed program debugging information. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.570
 You need to add this line of code to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 Gradle file to enable this option. 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 Reducing construction time is our constant focus. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 When using an annotation processor, 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.870
 We have improved incremental Java compilation. 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.530
 We also added a new code scaler, R8, preview 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.300
 It is faster than ProGuard. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.940
 It doesn't even require any code changes. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.820
 Try adding this line of code to the Gradle file. 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.320
 If your project is configured with multiple build differences, 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.620
 IDA will prompt you to sync only the current build. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.090
 This saves you time. 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.280
 You can manually enable it in the Experiments menu. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.100
 The Android Gradle plugin now uses the lazy task configuration API. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.120
 This avoids creating in the Gradle configuration phase 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.770
 The cost of the unused task. 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.460
 The application package now fully supports instant applications. 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.430
 You can create an instant app from the same project 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.140
 And the installed application. 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.360
 It makes it very easy to split the application 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.570
 And reduce its size for a better user experience. 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.940
 To deploy an application as an instant application, 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.390
 Please edit the Run configuration and enable this option. 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.860
 Enjoy Android Studio 3.3. 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.730
 We are always watching the feedback you gave us on the bug tracker. 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.090
 You can do it on the Canary channel. 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.720
 Test the latest build of version 3.4. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 Goodbye.
