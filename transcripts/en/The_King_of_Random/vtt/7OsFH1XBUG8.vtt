00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.480
Hey guys,

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.390
I'm Nate. Welcome back once again to the dome, and as I hope you know when we're at the dome we do crazy fun stuff.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.929
Today our experiment is to find out what happens if you drop a lit firecracker into gasoline.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.779
Now, I'm not going to be quite so dumb as to just hold a firecracker

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.449
and drop it into a pot of gasoline at my feet.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.629
I'm gonna set up a system so that I can light it, run away

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.699
and then have it drop when I am at a safe distance.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.070
Firecrackers have a very short, very quick burning fuse on them. So to make this work

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.230
I'm first going to attach a little bit of a slower burning fuse to the quick fuse of the firecracker.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.889
We'll then tie the slow-burning fuse onto a piece of string that's hanging from a stick over our pot.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.189
Hopefully when it gets down to where the string is tied onto it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.350
it will then drop still burning into our gasoline down below.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.640
The idea is that the firecracker will light the surface of the gasoline as it falls in and then it will still explode while under the gasoline,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.199
launching a giant fireball into the air. First, let's just test if lighting the fuse will make our firecracker drop down before it explodes.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.180
I'm going to light the top of the fuse and then book it to the doorway of the dome so I'm safely out of range.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
And as added protection, I've also put in some earplugs because it echoes a lot in here.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.180
small_explosion.mp4

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.400
That actually worked really well.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.610
I didn't...

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.970
...really think about how these slower burning fuses kind of had a lot of push to them and that sort of made it spin around.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.380
But it still dropped fairly straight down, it still lit off and everything seemed good

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.180
I think at this point we need to try adding gasoline. I have a decent sized metal pot

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.559
and I'm going to start by just putting a little bit - less than half an inch at the bottom of our pot.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.680
I'll light the fuse let it drop in and see what happens.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.399
I'm not sure what the effect is going to be. It's possible that gasoline will stop the short fuse on the firecracker from lighting.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.650
But we'll have to find out.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.159
Well, the motion from the fuse swirling around made it miss our pot just barely

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.670
so I'm going to try and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.140
change the angle of the stick so it's a little more right over it and it can't fly sideways quite as easily, try it again.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.030
That's not how I thought that would go.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.000
Huh.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.720
Wow. That stopped the big fuse. It didn't burn through the string holding it up. It just came untied.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.540
Now I'm just gonna light this on fire and see what happens.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.430
small_explosion.mp4

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.280
I was a little bit surprised when our firecracker and fuse dropped into the gas and nothing lit on fire.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.349
I thought the fuse would certainly keep burning and would probably ignite the surface of the gas.

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.689
That didn't happen so now, just as a test,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.319
I'm going to try lighting a piece of fuse and throwing it right into our pot of gasoline.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.440
Hmm. Not what I expected. It didn't light the gas on fire and the gas actually put it out.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.400
Guess if there's too much gasoline

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.869
it loses the oxygen that it needs to burn. I kind of thought these fuses had enough oxygen

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.389
embedded into them that they could keep burning even if they are underwater, but it doesn't seem to work

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.819
too well with gas. I think what I'll try now is putting another firecracker into the pot with the gasoline

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.139
attached to the side so that most of the firecracker is submerged in the gasoline, but the fuse is above it and staying dry.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.849
Let's try this out. I kind of have a suspicion I'm just gonna light the gasoline on fire

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.309
maybe then if firework explodes it'll just spread lit gasoline everywhere, which is kind of what we're going for. Here goes.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.709
It lit the firecracker! Go, go, go.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.419
Once again, the fuse went out.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.879
I think it was sitting in the gasoline so long as we set up the cameras that it just sort of soaked up

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.478
so I'm going to try doing it one more time and just see if I can do it faster.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960
Try and do this quickly.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.689
Whoa! Yeah!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
That's what I was hoping for!

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.020
So it was already on fire, which I think worked to our advantage when it exploded. It just sent

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.150
flaming gasoline everywhere and kind of a fireball and that was a lot of fun. Well,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.010
we want to try and scale this up. That was awesome.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.610
I'm gonna add a little bit more gasoline

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.969
And then I'm gonna try and make it so several firecrackers go off. Not all the gasoline burned up

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.160
so I'm thinking we might get like one explosion after another of the gasoline which would be pretty sweet.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.600
I now have five firecrackers attached this piece of tape. So same idea:

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.119
I'll lower it down so all five are somewhat submerged into the gasoline, tape it onto the side of the pot,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.350
and then I'll just light the gasoline on fire. I'm not gonna try and aim for the fuses anymore and

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.039
hopefully we get five different explosions. That'd be neat.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.740
Hmm.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.660
Tape. An unexploded firecracker.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.399
Hmm, several more unexploded firecrackers in the gasoline.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.699
I think when the first firecracker went off, since it was

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.070
secured to the same piece of tape that the rest of them were, they all tore away from the edge of the pot and got

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.309
submerged in the gasoline. And I think we've seen that it only works if the firecracker isn't entirely soaked in the gas.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.519
So I'm going to try it one more time getting five firecrackers,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.609
but each one will have its own piece of tape holding it onto the side.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Here goes.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.490
The fuse burnt. Firecracker did not.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.090
Even all of the fuse burned on that one.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.049
I think when the first one goes off

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:10.128
it might splash the gasoline so much that it soaks the other ones and it gets on the top of them, it gets down inside

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.089
and the wicks get hit and it just sort of stops working.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.180
I'd say that's the one that exploded.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.750
All right, continuing on the saga of good decisions made today, I'm gonna see if I can just light the gasoline on fire,

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.250
light the long fuse on this firecracker,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.849
and then once it's getting pretty close to the quick fuse just toss it in and see if it happens to work like that.

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.819
I'm not really hopeful, but it's worth a try.

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:49.689
I

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:57.028
Ah, it went out. Alright, one more thing I want to try. I have three firecrackers which are all bundled around the same slow fuse.

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:59.518
I'll try taping this on so that they're only

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:05.939
partially submerged in the gasoline, light it on fire and see if we can get any sort of larger result with that. Here goes.

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:09.479
Fuse is lit!

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:18.928
I think multiple of them definitely went off. That sounded like a much louder bang.

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.459
There's like not much left in there.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:28.109
There was a little burning bit that I think was the remnants, but I think at least two of them went off.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.659
Maybe all three. I don't know if the fireball seems much bigger, but it's still pretty cool. One more thing

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.698
I want to try as sort of a finale

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.990
This is a good idea.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.090
Fuse is lit!

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:55.559
Ah ha ha! Ha, it worked. I don't have a good way to put that out.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.639
Well there you have it. An experiment to see what happens if we throw a firecracker

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.089
into some gasoline. We tried to set up where a lit firecracker would fall down into a pool of gasoline

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:20.819
and it wouldn't light. We tried lighting the fuse and just tossing it in and that wouldn't light either.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.979
It seems that the fuses on these firecrackers just go out when they have too much gasoline on them.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.080
We did get pretty good results by taking a firecracker with a longer fuse and just

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.059
attaching it to the wall of our pot that had a little bit of gasoline in it with some of the

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.130
firecrackers submerged in the gasoline.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:43.619
And then of course we had a little bit of fun just by splashing some gasoline around our pot so that when it did explode,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.650
it landed on the ground and lit all the ground around it on fire.

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:49.949
That's always a fun time, too. Of course for safety reasons,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.479
I can't recommend you try this because it's very dangerous. Lots of things can light on fire.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.100
Even here in this concrete dome,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.469
there is a risk that the flaming gasoline could splash onto us even though we tried to stay a good distance away

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.640
while it was exploding.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.689
It would be fun to try this experiment slightly scaled up with some larger explosives. That might be something we try in the future.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.910

Once again to the- Wow, it's extra echo-y right here.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.500
One of the firecrackers just went off. Did not see that coming.
