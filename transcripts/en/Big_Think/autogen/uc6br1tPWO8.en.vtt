but you wouldn't sort of get that sense
 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.060
but you wouldn't sort of get that sense
if you listened to our president or the

security and I I don't want to be in the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100
security and I I don't want to be in the
 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.480

position to deny that there are

challenges out there but you know I'd
 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.590

really strongly urge us to put these
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.790
really strongly urge us to put these
challenges in their proper context so

challenges in their proper context so
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.809
challenges in their proper context so
let's talk about one of the challenges

off if they didn't have a nuclear
 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.940
off if they didn't have a nuclear
capability and the question then is how

capability and the question then is how
 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.179

can now you can't eat nuclear weapons
 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.589
can now you can't eat nuclear weapons
and a residual nuclear arsenal I think

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599
and a residual nuclear arsenal I think
 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.179
and a residual nuclear arsenal I think
is no guarantee that the North Korean

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189
is no guarantee that the North Korean
 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.610
is no guarantee that the North Korean
regime won't collapse of its own

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
regime won't collapse of its own

internal rottenness
 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.069
internal rottenness
in fact I anticipate that that's what

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079
in fact I anticipate that that's what
 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.270
in fact I anticipate that that's what
will happen

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
will happen
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.369
will happen
and that'll present its own set of

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379
and that'll present its own set of
 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.270
and that'll present its own set of
challenges

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
challenges
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.129
challenges
but there are a very different set of

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139
but there are a very different set of
 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.009
but there are a very different set of
challenges than the ones that we've been

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019
challenges than the ones that we've been
 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.830
challenges than the ones that we've been
talking about in the general political

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
talking about in the general political
 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.140
talking about in the general political
discourse about the North Korea and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150
discourse about the North Korea and
 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.559
discourse about the North Korea and
nuclear threat in our country so the

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569
nuclear threat in our country so the
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.369
nuclear threat in our country so the
question then is what the United States

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379
question then is what the United States
 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.580
question then is what the United States
should do about North Korea the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590
should do about North Korea the
 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800
should do about North Korea the
challenge that the United States faces

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
challenge that the United States faces
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.670
challenge that the United States faces
is when the regime goes south is it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
is when the regime goes south is it
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.699
is when the regime goes south is it
invariably will won't be tomorrow could

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709
invariably will won't be tomorrow could
 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.759
invariably will won't be tomorrow could
be five years could be ten years it's

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769
be five years could be ten years it's
 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.050
be five years could be ten years it's
going to pose to the United States a

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060
going to pose to the United States a
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.839
going to pose to the United States a
challenge and the challenge involves two

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849
challenge and the challenge involves two
 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.349
challenge and the challenge involves two
elements first of all the United States

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359
elements first of all the United States
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.439
elements first of all the United States
and the South Koreans will be tempted if

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449
and the South Koreans will be tempted if
 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.869
and the South Koreans will be tempted if
a civil war starts in the north or even

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879
a civil war starts in the north or even
 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.939
a civil war starts in the north or even
if there's just large-scale social

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949
if there's just large-scale social
 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.810
if there's just large-scale social
unrest to intervene the South to reunify

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820
unrest to intervene the South to reunify
 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.460
unrest to intervene the South to reunify
their country the United States to try

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470
their country the United States to try
 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.029
their country the United States to try
to clean up the nuclear capability but

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039
to clean up the nuclear capability but
 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.040
to clean up the nuclear capability but
the problem is that there's another

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050
the problem is that there's another
 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.629
the problem is that there's another
great power with

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639
great power with
 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.469
great power with
in North Korea and that's China and the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479
in North Korea and that's China and the
 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.559
in North Korea and that's China and the
Chinese are not particularly fond of the

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569
Chinese are not particularly fond of the
 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.350
Chinese are not particularly fond of the
Kim regime but they're sort of stuck in

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360
Kim regime but they're sort of stuck in
 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.589
Kim regime but they're sort of stuck in
a dysfunctional marriage with them they

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599
a dysfunctional marriage with them they
 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.779
a dysfunctional marriage with them they
don't want a reunited Korea under Seoul

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789
don't want a reunited Korea under Seoul
 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.580
don't want a reunited Korea under Seoul
with nuclear weapons on their border and

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590
with nuclear weapons on their border and
 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.879
with nuclear weapons on their border and
so the real problem that we face is how

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889
so the real problem that we face is how
 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.809
so the real problem that we face is how
we manage the inevitable endgame of a

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819
we manage the inevitable endgame of a
 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.709
we manage the inevitable endgame of a
collapsing North Korea with China and

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719
collapsing North Korea with China and
 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:14.269
collapsing North Korea with China and
here the solution is a explicit set of

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:14.279
here the solution is a explicit set of
 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.709
here the solution is a explicit set of
discussions and agreements with the
