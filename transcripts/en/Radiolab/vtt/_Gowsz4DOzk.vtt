00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.950
Great. You're listening to radio man,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.760
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio.

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
W. Y. C. O. N. N. P. R. Hey everyone. Jad here for this week's podcast.

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
I wanted to play you a piece from one of my favorite producers.

5
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.760
His name is Ben Rubin and uh, he's, he's kind of hard to describe.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.670
He's sort of an audio artists, sort of a documentary producers,

7
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.660
sort of a visual artist if anyone's out there,

8
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.720
has been to the New York Times building, the new one, he and his partner,

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.820
Mark Hanson did this sculpture,

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
that crazy moving sculpture that is in the lobby. Any case,

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.700
this is one of my favorite pieces from him.

12
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:48.990
It's called open outcry and I don't want to tell you too much about it except

13
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.800
that it's about, uh, commodities trading. You know,

14
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.040
like when you picture the trading floor with hundreds of people screaming out

15
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.080
the prices of commodities, there's a name for that.

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.700
It's called the open outcry trading system and all those screaming people sort

17
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:07.701
of in that roiling pit determine on this sort of emergent level,

18
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.650
the price of oil on the price of an ounce of gold.

19
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.670
So Ben decided to do a piece about this and most of what you're gonna hear in

20
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.660
this is actual documentary sound he recorded on the trading floor of the New

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.690
York Mercantile Exchange. There's also going to be a female voice,

22
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.960
sort of an ethereal female voice that was recorded in the studio obviously,

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.590
which is actually her singing the real price of commodities taken.

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.510
You know, the raw data taken from one day,

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.140
I think in September of 2002 though I'm not sure about that day in any case.

26
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.070
Here it is. Open outcry from Ben Ribbon on a on Radiolab

37
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 3>sometimes I see to people,</v>

38
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.350
didn't you hear rebidding and I know if they say I didn't hear you.

39
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:02.530
I know they're not telling me the truth because people always hear my voice.

40
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.790
It's, it's unique and it's a strong voice too. If I'm selling October's,

41
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:06.941
you know,

42
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.910
you don't say you say oc and you don't say the full hand and just say like AUC

43
00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:13.670
at 10 so I just yell out Pocket 10

44
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 4>oh it's 70 bit by by play five. So 25 ox, 75 bed at 78 I tell you today,</v>

45
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.310
seven blocks, seven beds,

46
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.560
(258) 415-5500

47
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.150
<v 5>yeah. Listen to one person at a time.</v>

48
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:35.040
You're hearing everybody speak at the same time.

49
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.040
It's like going to a symphony and hearing every piece of the orchestra,

50
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:41.610
but yet hearing the music at the same time. And in the midst of that,

51
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:44.400
you may observe, for instance,

52
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.910
a broker that you've traded with for years.

53
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.310
You notice face looks like when he's laughing.

54
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.660
You know what his face looks like when he's upset about something at home and

55
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.990
suddenly he's got a nervous look. You can tell when someone is bluffing,

56
00:03:57.991 --> 00:03:59.450
when somebody is not bluffing and this,

57
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.340
these are all skills that are learned over time.

58
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.620
It's really an internal gut feeling.

59
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.990
And as far as just seeing the expression on somebody's face,

60
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:08.070
the way that somebody's breathing,

61
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.080
the way that somebody is leaning on someone else.

62
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.250
I always knew when the guy behind me had a real order, cause when he had a big,

63
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:14.761
big order,

64
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.160
he used to take my shoulder and shove it to the ground trying to hold it.

65
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.190
<v 4>I'm so fat to fit these two,</v>

66
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.250
so 50 these are toe 10 to bed,

67
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.320
five to 10 bed choirs too.

68
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:32.660
Big Novi and a half, five and a half.

69
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.133

<v 1>[inaudible] Silva</v>

<v 3>Orange Juice now,</v>

72
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.753
<v 1>huh?</v>

73
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.110
<v 3>Gasoline, natural gas.</v>

74
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.770
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

75
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.570
<v 3>crude oil. Natural gas.</v>

76
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.960
<v 6>Well, I've been in a ring 32 years. How do I sound? You know,</v>

77
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.260
uh, the open outcry system, which is probably with me,

78
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:20.850
some people may look as an antiquated system.

79
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:25.080
It's probably the most sophisticated timely system, uh,

80
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.490
that's in existence today.

81
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.410
<v 5>If you believe in, if you believe in it, in a marketplace,</v>

82
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.600
this is as pure form as it gets.

83
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.110
<v 6>If everybody's buying, it's going to be tougher to buy, right? Simple as that.</v>

84
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.340
<v 5>Just because you want to sell it at $29 and 55 cents and you're offering 29,</v>

85
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:44.020
55 the guy next to you could be selling it.

86
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.700
The guy in front of you could be selling the guy behind.

87
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.830
You could be selling it and you might not have sold anything.

88
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.640
Volatility makes money. War creates turmoil.

89
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.300
Turmoil creates opportunity. Yeah.

90
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.940
I'm not suggesting that people want terrible outcomes,

91
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.290
but I am suggesting that a lot of people depend on them.

92
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.080
<v 4>Yeah. It's all 50 October, October,</v>

93
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.540
[inaudible] hundred these house days used to half, man. Jeez,

94
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.520
my 25 ds, one bed. So why aren't these two beds,

95
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.160
<v 5>temperature players, a lot of money flying around moment to moment, you know,</v>

96
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:33.110
and um, there's a classic story actually. It's about my father.

97
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.670
And there was a time in silver when, uh, he got into an argument,

98
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.670
somebody and he had their neck down against the rail and a guy looked at him,

99
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:42.980
he says, Marty, even though that you know, you're chairman of the floor,

100
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.200
come in when I have to find you 500 bucks for this. It's,

101
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.420
he looks at the guy, he puts, he, he keeps one hand on the guy's neck,

102
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.160
takes the other hand in his pocket, throws down 1000 bucks.

103
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.680
It says double it cause I'm going to finish him off.

104
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.440
Know two minutes later they're out having a cup of coffee together.

105
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.810
<v 4>J 23</v>

106
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.490
[inaudible] 23 [inaudible]

107
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.660
<v 1>[inaudible] aluminum mockup,</v>

108

109
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.790
<v 0>They're going at school down</v>

110
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.670
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

111
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.160
<v 7>they were members in good standing that had been on the trading floor the day</v>

112
00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:55.500
before September 11th, that we would never see again.

113
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.440
And I think people were very, very aware of their absence. In fact,

114
00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:05.130
the first trading day for at least the first trading day,

115
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.020
some of their positions in the pit were sort of silhouetted by their,

116
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.940
the outline of the footprints and people wouldn't step into those spots.

117
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.363
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

118
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.180
<v 0>that's an open outcry by Ben Reuben as you can probably tell.</v>

119
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.490
That piece is written right after nine 11,

120
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:45.020
he was asked to commemorate the reopening of part of the world financial center.

121
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.750
Most of it was still in rooms, but this one part,

122
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.360
the winter garden was opening back up.

123
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.440
And so he was asked to make a sound piece to install in the winter garden.

124
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.150
And this is a space with, um,

125
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.890
with a grid of palm trees in the middle of very, very high domed ceiling.

126
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.390
And what he did was he installed speakers underneath the trees and that's where

127
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.870
the voices of the traders came from. But, uh,

128
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.490
way up top on the ceiling, he had speakers which played the voice of that,

129
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.650
uh, female ticker.

130
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.000
So it's as if the traders are on the floor and high up above them.

131
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.900
Almost ethereally is the price of the commodities. Kind of a neat idea.

132
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.720
Except you said in the, in the space, the sound was totally terrible.

133
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.830
No one could hear anything,

134
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.220
so he was happy as are we to have it be a radio piece in case you can learn more

135
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.910
about Ben, uh, at his website, ear studio.com. That's
