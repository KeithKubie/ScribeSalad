00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.640
I'm now going to show you what
I think are probably the two

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.490
coolest derivatives
in all of calculus.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.680
And I'll reserve that.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.850
None of the other ones have
occurred to me right now.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.780
But these are definitely to
me some of the neatest.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.795
So let's figure out
what the derivative of

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:16.810
the natural log is.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.530
And just as a review,
what is the natural log?

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.380
Well the natural log of
something is the exact same

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.720
thing as saying logarithm
base e of that something.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.810
That's just a review.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.390
So let's take the
derivative of this.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.455
I think I'm going to need
a lot of space for this.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm going to try to do it
as neatly as possible.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.090
So the derivative of the
natural log of x equals-- well

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.780
let's just take the definition
of a derivative, right?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.780
We just take the slope at some
point and find the limit as we

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.720
take the difference between
the two points to 0.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:08.240
So let's take the limit as
delta x approaches 0 of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.340
f of x plus delta x.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.440
So I'm going to take the
limit of this whole thing.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.450
The natural log ln of x plus
delta x-- right, that's like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.660
one point that I'm going to
take evaluate the function--

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.490
minus the ln of x.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.010
All of that over delta x.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250
And if you remember from the
derivative videos, this is just

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.670
the slope, and I'm just taking
the limit as I find the slope

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.040
between a smaller and
a smaller distance.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.476
Hopefully you remember that.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:44.800
So let's see if we can do some
logarithm properties to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.530
simplify this a little bit.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.820
Hopefully you remember-- and if
you don't, review the logarithm

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.480
properties-- but remember that
log of a minus log of b is

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.390
equal to log of a over b, and
that comes out of the fact that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.930
logarithm expressions are
essentially exponents, so they

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.710
follow the exponent rules.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.180
And if that doesn't make
sense to you, you should

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.580
review those as well.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.090
But let's apply this logarithm
property to this equation.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.110
So let me rewrite the whole
thing, and I'm going to keep

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.580
switching colors to keep it
from getting monotonous.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.780
So we have the limit as delta x
approaches 0 of this big thing.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.230
Let's see.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.060
So log of a minus b equals log
a over b, so this top, the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.120
numerator, will equal the
natural log of x plus

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.270
delta x over x.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.000
Right? a b a/b, all of
that over delta x.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.090
And so that equals the limit as
delta x approaches 0-- I think

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.240
it's time to switch colors
again-- delta x approaches 0

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.025
of-- well let me just write
this 1 over delta

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.730
x out in front.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.010
So this is 1 over delta x,
and we're going to take

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.000
the limit of everything.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.270
ln x divided by x is 1
plus delta x over x.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.580
Fair enough.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.770
Now I'm going to throw out
another logarithm property, and

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.130
hopefully you remember that--
and let me put the properties

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.440
separate so you know it's not
part of the proof-- that a log

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.290
b is equal to log
of b to the a.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.890
And that comes from when you
take something to an exponent,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.300
and then to another exponent
you just have to multiply

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.670
those two exponents.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.890
I don't want to confuse
you, but hopefully you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.370
should remember this.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.710
So how does apply here?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.330
Well this would be a log b.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:09.020
So this expression is the
same thing as the limit.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:23.740
The limit as delta x approaches
0 of the natural log of 1 plus

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.800
delta x over x to the
1 over delta x power.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.820
And remember all this
is the natural log of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.890
this entire thing.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.730
And then we're going
to take the limit as

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.110
delta x approaches 0.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.270
If you've watched the compound
interest problems and you know

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.480
the definition of e, I think
this will start to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.190
look familiar.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.030
But let me make a substitution
that might clean things

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.410
up a little bit.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:59.190
Let me make the substitution,
let me call it n-- no, no, no,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.430
let me call u-- is equal
to delta x over x.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.860
And then if that's true
then we can multiply both

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.450
sides by x and we get
xu is equal to delta x.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.650
Or we would also know
that 1 over delta x is

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.780
equal to 1 over xu.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.150
These are all equivalent.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.720
So let's make the substitution.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.030
So if we're taking the limit is
delta x approaches 0, in this

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.930
expression if delta x
approaches 0, what

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.110
does u approach?

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.320
u approaches 0.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.860
So delta x approaching 0 is the
same exact thing as taking

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.230
the limit as u approaches 0.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.960
So we can write this as the
limit as u approaches 0 of the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.200
natural log of 1 plus-- well we
did the substitution, delta x

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.870
over x is now u-- to the 1
over delta x, and that same

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.960
substitution told us that's the
same thing as one over xu.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.360
Remember we're taking the
natural log of everything.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.550
And we know this is an exponent
property, which I'll now

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.340
do in a different color.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.530
We know that a to the bc
is equal to a to the

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.620
b to the c power.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:35.200
So that tells us that this me
is equal to the limit as u

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:46.810
approaches 0 of the natural log
of 1 plus u to the 1/u, because

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.960
this is one over xu, right?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.270
1/u, and then all of
that to the 1/x.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.110
And how did I do that?

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.950
Just from this exponent
property, right?

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.810
If I were to simplify this, I
would have 1/x times 1/u, and

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.740
that's where I get
this 1 over xu.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.780
Well then we can just do this
logarithm property in reverse.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.370
If I have b to the a I can
put that a out front.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.670
So I could take this 1/x
and put it in front

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.160
of the natural log.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.250
So now what do I have?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.550
We're almost there.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.780
We have the limit
as u approaches 0.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.950
Take that 1/x, put it in front
of the natural log sign.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:40.490
1/x times the natural log
of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.330
Fair enough.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.080
When we're taking the limit as
u approaches 0, x, this term

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.800
doesn't involve it at all.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.030
So we could take this out in
front, because the limit

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.430
doesn't affect this term.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.890
And then we're essentially
saying what happens to this

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.440
expression as the limit
as u approaches 0.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:10.220
So this thing is equivalent to
1/x times the natural log of

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:23.480
the limit as u approaches
0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.320
And by now hopefully you
would recognize that

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.880
this is the definition.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.230
This limit comes to e, if
you remember anything

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.260
from compound interest.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.140
You might remember it as the
limit-- as n approaches

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.430
infinity of 1 plus
1 over n to the n.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.780
But these things
are equivalent.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.360
If you just took the
substitution u is equal to

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.330
1/n, you would get this.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.180
You would just get this.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.500
So this expression right here
is e That expression is e.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.670
So we're getting close.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.760
So this whole thing is
equivalent to 1/x times

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.050
the natural log, and this
we know, this is one of

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.740
the ways to get to e.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.280
So the limit as u approaches
0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.000
That is e.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.030
And what is the natural log?

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.530
Well it's the log base e.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:23.000
So you know this is equal to
1/x times the log base e of e.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.270
So that's saying e
to what power is e.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.870
Well e to the first
power is e, right?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.400
This is equal to 1.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.010
So 1 times 1/x is equal to 1/x.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.280
There we have it.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.190
The derivative of the natural
log of x is equal to 1/x, which

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.260
I find kind of neat, because
all of the other exponents

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.280
lead to another exponent.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.580
But all of a sudden in the mix
here you have the natural log

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.440
and the derivative of that
is equal to x to the

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.420
negative 1 or 1/x.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:49.740
Fascinating.
