00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.000
I've got a square here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.790
It's right like that.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.060
What makes it a square is
all of the sides are equal.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.380
I haven't gone in depth into
angles yet, but these are at

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.520
right angles to each other.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.470
I'll just draw it like that.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.760
That means that if this bottom
side goes straight left and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.880
right, that this left side
will go straight up and down.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.210
That's all the right
angle really means.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.290
Let's say that the side down
here is equal to 8 meters.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.540
This side right here.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.100
And this is a square.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.980
And I were to ask you what
is the area of the square?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.040
Well, the area is essentially
how much space the square

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.430
takes up, let's say, on
your screen right now.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.040
So it's essentially a way of
measuring how much space

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.110
something takes up on kind of
a two-dimensional surface.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.170
A two-dimensional surface would
just be this computer screen or

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
your piece of paper, if you're
also doing this problem.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.680
An analogy would be if you had
an 8 meter by 8 meter room, how

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.570
much carpeting would you need
is kind of the size of the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.240
space you need to fill out in
two dimensions on some

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.500
type of surface.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.750
So the area here is literally
how much is this size that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.980
you're filling up, and it's
very easy to figure

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.605
out for a square.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.830
It's literally going to be your
base times your height -- and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.570
this is true for any rectangle
-- but since this is a square,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.650
your base and your height are
going to be the same number.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.340
It's going to be 8 meters.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.930
So your area is going to be 8
meters times 8 meters, which is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.020
equal to 8 times 8 is 64, and
then your meters times your

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.580
meters -- you have to do the
same thing with your units --

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.200
you get 64 meters squared.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.860
Or another way of saying,
this is 64 square meters.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.390
You might be asking where
are those 64 square meters?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.615
Well, you can actually
break it out here.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:48.470
So let me draw it a
little bit bigger than

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.630
I originally drew it.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.890
I probably should have drawn
it this big to begin with.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.940
So let's say that's
my same square.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.100
I'm going to draw a little
bit, so let me divide

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.240
it in the middle.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.770
Let me see, I have -- and
we divide them again.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.142
Then we divide each side
again just like that.

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:08.410
I could probably do it neater.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.930
And let me do it one more time.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.840
Divide these just like that,
and then divide these

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.010
just like that.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.940
There you go.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.480
OK.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.980
Now the reason why I did this
is to show you the dimensions

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.030
along the base and the height.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.650
We said this is 8 meters,
and notice I have 1, 2,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.610
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.620
And the same thing
along this side.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.340
So when we're talking about
64 square meters, we're

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.520
literally counting each
of the square meters.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.380
A square meter is a
two-dimensional measurement,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.780
that's 1 meter on each side.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.490
That's 1 meter, that's 1 meter.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.480
What I'm shading here in
yellow is 1 square meter.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.030
And you could imagine just
counting the square meters.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.070
In each row we're going to
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.080
7, 8 square meters.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.610
And then we have 8 rows.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.200
So we're going to have 8
times 8 square meters

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.760
or 64 meters square.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.840
Which is essentially if you sat
here and just counted each of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.050
these, you would count
64 square meters.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.540
Now, what happens if I
were to ask you the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.690
perimeter of my square?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.620
The perimeter is the distance
you need to go to go

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.950
around the square.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.990
It's not measuring,
for example, how much

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.070
carpeting you need.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.520
It's measuring, for example, if
you wanted to put a fence

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.050
around your carpet -- I'm kind
of mixing the indoor and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.400
outdoor analogies -- it would
be how much fencing

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.110
you would need.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.210
So it would be the
distance around.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.950
So it would be that distance
plus that distance plus that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.980
distance plus that distance.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.830
But we already know this
distance right here on the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.020
bottom, we already know
this distance is 8 meters.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.480
Then we know that the height
right here is 8 meters.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.180
It's a square.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.570
This distance up here is going
to be the same as this distance

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.710
down here -- it's going
to be another 8 meters.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.450
Then when you go down the
left hand side it's going

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.380
to be another 8 meters.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.670
We have four sides -- 1, 2, 3,
4 -- each of them are 8 meters.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.660
So you add 8 to itself 4 times,
that's the same thing as 8

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.070
times 4, you get 36 meters.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.050
Now notice, when we measured
just the amount of fencing we

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.530
needed, we ended up just with
meters, just with kind of a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.680
one-dimensional measurement.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.080
That's because we're not
measuring square meters here.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.310
We're not measuring how
much area we're taking up.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.560
We're measuring a distance
-- a distance to go around.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.920
We are taking turns, but you
can imagine straightening out

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.570
this fence, and it would just
become one big fence like this,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.160
which would have the same
length of 36 meters.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.010
So that's why we just have
meters there for perimeter.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.640
But for area we got square
meters, because we're counting

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.220
these two-dimensional
measurements.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.840
Now, let's make it a little
bit more interesting.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.070
What happens if instead
of a square I have a

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.780
rectangle like this?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.280
Let's say that this side
over here is 7 centimeters.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.170
And let's say that the height
right here is 4 centimeters.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.845
So what is the area of this
rectangle going to be?

00:05:25.845 --> 00:05:28.280
It's going to be 7
times 4 centimeters.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.490
7 centimeters times
4 centimeters.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.390
Remember, we could draw 7 rows,
right, and each of them is

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.540
going to have 4 square
centimeters -- each of those

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.380
is a square centimeter.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.360
So if you were to count them
all out, you'd have 7 times

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.170
4 square centimeters.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.140
It's 4 centimeters.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.390
So it's equal to 28 centimeters
square or squared centimeters.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.070
What's the perimeter?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.660
Well, it's going to be equal to
this distance down here, which

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.670
is 7 centimeters, plus this
distance over here which is 4

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.480
centimeters, plus the distance
on the top -- this is a

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.170
rectangle, it's going to be
the same distance as

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.440
this one over here.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.170
So plus another 7 centimeters.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.300
Then you're going to have this
distance on the left hand side.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.870
But this distance on the left
hand side is the same as this

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.810
distance right here -- this
is also 4 centimeters.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.450
So plus another 4 centimeters.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.450
And what do you get?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.570
You get 7 plus 4 which is
11, and then you have

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.020
another 7 plus 4.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.020
You have 11 plus 11, so
you have 22 centimeters.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.300
Once again, it's not
a square centimeter.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.300
Now let's divert -- let's go
away from our rectangle analogy

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.760
or our rectangle examples.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.930
So let's see if we can do
the same with triangles.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.940
So let's say I have
a triangle here.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.100
I have a triangle like this.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.720
Let's say that this distance
right here -- actually

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.760
let me draw it like this.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.210
I think this'll make it a
little bit easier for you

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.550
to see how this relates
to a rectangle.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.810
Let me draw it like this.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.810
There you go.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.300
That's my triangle.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.510
And let's say that this
distance right here is 7

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.210
centimeters right down there.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.090
And let's say that the
height of this triangle

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.520
is 4 centimeters.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.160
And I were to ask you what is
the area of the triangle?

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.590
Well, when we had a rectangle
like this, we just

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.660
multiplied 7 times 4.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.600
But what would that give us?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.610
That would give us the area
of an entire rectangle.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.610
If we did 7 times 4, that
would give us the area of

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.050
this entire rectangle.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.640
You could imagine extending
my triangle up like this.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.880
This is a right triangle --
this is going straight up and

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.420
down, this is going straight
left and right on the

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.910
bottom right here.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.910
It's a 90 degree angle, if
you've been exposed to the

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.040
idea of angles already.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.460
So you could almost view it as
it's 1/2 of this rectangle.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.610
Not really almost, it is.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.580
Because if you just double this
guy, you could imagine if you

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.190
flip this triangle over, you
get the same triangle but

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.910
it's just upside down
and flipped over.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.650
So if you think about when you
multiply 7 times 4, you're

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:25.140
getting the area of this entire
rectangle, which we

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.800
just did up here.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.210
But we want to know the
area of the triangle.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.190
We want to know just
this area right here.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.290
You can see, hopefully, from
this drawing that the area of

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.390
this triangle is exactly 1/2
of the area of the

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.990
entire rectangle.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:47.040
So the area for a triangle is
equal to the base times the

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.490
height -- now this so far,
base times height is the

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.150
area of a rectangle.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.755
So in order to get the area of
the triangle, you're going

00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:55.910
to multiply that times 1/2.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.160
So 1/2 base times height.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.320
So in our example it's going
to be 1/2 times 7 centimeters

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.020
times 4 centimeters.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.780
We know what 7 times 4 is.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.880
We already know it's
28 centimeters -- we

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.710
did that up there.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.050
So this right here
is 28 centimeters.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.070
Then we want centimeters and we
want to multiply that by 1/2.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.720
So that's going to be 14
centimeters just like that.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.950
So the area of this triangle
is exactly 1/2 of the

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.700
area of that rectangle.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.670
Now, the perimeter of this
triangle becomes a little bit

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:43.380
more complicated because
figuring out this distance

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.320
isn't the easiest
thing in the world.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.965
Well, it will be easy for
you once you get exposed to

00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:48.870
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.290
But I'm going to skip
that right now.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.010
I'm going to leave that for the
Pythagorean Theorem video.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.450
Let me just give you one
more area of a triangle.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.120
Let's say I have a triangle
that looks like this.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.190
This was a very special case
that I drew to make it look

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.520
like half of a rectangle.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.220
Let's say we had a triangle
that looks like this.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.650
It's a little bit more
skewed looking like this.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:19.346
And let's say that this
distance down here is 3 meters

00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:21.950
-- that distance is 3 meters.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.230
Let's say we don't know what
that distance is and we don't

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.570
know what that distance is.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.660
But we do know that if we were
to kind of drop a line straight

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.670
down like this -- if you
imagine this was a building or

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.760
some type of mountain and you
just drop something straight

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.850
down onto the ground like that,
we know that this distance

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.770
is equal to -- let's say
it's equal to 4 meters.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.140
So what is the area of this
triangle going to be?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.910
Well, we apply the
same formula.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.170
Area is equal to 1/2
base times height.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.490
So it's equal to 1/2 -- the
base is literally this base

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.260
right here of this triangle.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.380
So 1/2 times 3 times the
height of the triangle.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.740
I guess a better way
to think of it is an

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.570
altitude of the triangle.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.760
So this thing isn't even in
the triangle, but it is

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.820
literally the height.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.850
If you imagine this was a
building, you say how high is

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.360
the building, it would be
this height right there.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.395
So 1/2 times 3 times 4.

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:22.880
You use that distance
right there.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.860
Which is equal to 3 times 4 is
12 times 1/2 is equal to 6.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.830
We're going to be dealing
with square meters.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.140
I really want to highlight the
idea, because if I gave you a

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.000
triangle that looked like this,
where if this was 3 meters down

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.250
here, and then if I were to
tell you that this side over

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:50.930
here is 4 meters, this is not
something that you can just

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.820
apply this formula
to and figure out.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.790
In fact, you'd have to know
some of the angles and whatnot

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.840
to really be able to figure out
the area, or you'd have to

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.350
know this other side here.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.480
So this is not easy.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.890
You have to know what the
altitude or the height

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:06.720
of the triangle is.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.900
You need to know this distance.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.330
In this case, it was one of
the sides, but in this case

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.290
it's not one of the sides.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.840
You'd have to figure out what
that side right there on the

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.590
right hand side is in order
to apply this formula.
