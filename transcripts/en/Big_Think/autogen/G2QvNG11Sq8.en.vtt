measurements such as you look inside the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080
measurements such as you look inside the
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.650
measurements such as you look inside the
brain structure and so forth we did this

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
brain structure and so forth we did this
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.980
brain structure and so forth we did this
for things like wind tunnels and flames

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
for things like wind tunnels and flames
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.240

and chemical experiments and so I did a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
and chemical experiments and so I did a
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.120
and chemical experiments and so I did a
lot of things all around the theme of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130
lot of things all around the theme of
 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.120
lot of things all around the theme of
taking classical engineering problems

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130
taking classical engineering problems
 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.530

and applying this sort of radical new

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540
and applying this sort of radical new
 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.360

measurement technique to it and moving

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370
measurement technique to it and moving
 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.360
measurement technique to it and moving
that technique from something that was

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370
that technique from something that was
 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.710
that technique from something that was
qualitative to something that can make

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
qualitative to something that can make
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.840
qualitative to something that can make
quantitative measurements that's sort of

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850
quantitative measurements that's sort of
 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.260

in a nutshell is what I did I planned at

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
in a nutshell is what I did I planned at
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.030
in a nutshell is what I did I planned at
that point nothing other than a

that point nothing other than a
 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.640
that point nothing other than a
straightforward academic career because

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650
straightforward academic career because
 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.320
straightforward academic career because
I love teaching that's really why I

I love teaching that's really why I

became a professor even more than the

research side I love teaching working

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770
research side I love teaching working
 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.310
research side I love teaching working
with my graduate students doing research

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320
with my graduate students doing research
 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.460
with my graduate students doing research
and figured I'd probably do that till I

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470
and figured I'd probably do that till I
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.600
