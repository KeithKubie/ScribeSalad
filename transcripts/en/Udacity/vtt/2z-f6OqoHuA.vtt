00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.009
You may be asking yourself, or

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.070
at least, I hope you're asking yourself, hey, but what about error handling?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.480
I didn't see a .error method on the end of that call.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.140
And you're right.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.750
Because unfortunately, error handling isn't actually built into JSONP.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.010
This is a technical limitation because of what's happening behind the scenes.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.520
But there are workarounds, like what we're doing here.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.960
We can use setTimeout to stop the request if it runs for too long.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.280
Before we run this AJAX request, we'll create this setTimeout function.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.940
When we bind wikiRequestTimeout to this setTimeout function, we automatically

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.770
start a timer that will end 8000 milliseconds later, which is eight seconds.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.720
When eight seconds are up, we'll go ahead and change the text of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.080
the wiki element on the page to failed to get Wikipedia resources.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.420
This is a nice fall back.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.250
This says that if after eight seconds have gone by,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.570
change the text on the page to this.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.300
But of course there's a problem.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.260
If this is all we did we would

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860
no matter what overwrite the text inside the Wikipedia element with failed to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.060
get Wikipedia resources after eight seconds.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.960
In other words, even if this AJAX request came back successful,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.910
this timeout would still occur.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.030
These eight seconds would still pass by, and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.500
the text of the wiki element would change to failed to get Wikipedia resources.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.380
So, we have to add this line here, called clearTimeout, and then pass it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.150
the variable of the timeout we created up here, which is wikiRequestTimeout.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.700
This clear timeout will clear or stop this timeout from happening.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.280
So inside our success method we go ahead and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.270
pinned all the articles to the page and then say hey, stop that timeout.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.280
We don't need that timeout anymore.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.090
And then, it's all good.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.590
There are a few different ways we can handle errors with JSONP requests, but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.560
I thought this is a pretty easy way of doing it.
