00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.190
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Good morning.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.410
You know, any time I have the
opportunity to kick off one

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.430
of these events, I
always feel a little bit

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.670
like I should apologize
for interrupting the party.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.560
So apologies for interrupting
the party, but welcome,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.260
welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.560
I'm Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.220
I direct educational
outreach here.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.450
And I am thrilled to welcome you
to our symposium on diversity

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.070
in children's literature,
sponsored by the library.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.500
And, of course, We
Need Diverse Books.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.510
This morning -- So if you want
to clap or something, feel free.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.800
[ Applause ]

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.290
As you know, our program
really does have a title.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.970
We're calling it Seen and
Heard: The Power of Books.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.310
This program is being
live streamed.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.530
So I want to give a shout out
to all of those in the audience

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.860
that are at a distance,
especially those

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.750
in time zones other than ours.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.990
You know, it's 9 o'clock here.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.580
There's folks in
Chicago are watching.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.420
There's folks in
Albuquerque are watching.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.980
Folks in Sacramento
are out there.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.300
So we appreciate them
getting up for this event.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.980
And finally, I want
to thank my colleagues

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.850
who are making that happen.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.360
Live streams and lights
big screens don't happen

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.660
by themselves.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.670
So thanks to my colleagues
for making things happen.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.970
All right.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.330
So here on Capitol Hill,
three buildings are part

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.080
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.530
And they are named for three
of our founding fathers.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.700
The building that we're in
this morning is the James

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.000
Madison building.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.210
And for those of you who came in
downstairs on our first floor,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.970
if you had looked
over to your left,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870
you would have seen a
statue of James Madison.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.380
And you if you'd walked into the
room, you could have read some

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.920
of his quotes on the walls.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.220
They're engraved down there.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.220
And there's one that sort
of speaks to the Library

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.790
of Congress and to cultural
institutions like the library.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.800
And frankly, I think it sort
of speaks to today's program.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.910
So I'm going to paraphrase
it a little bit for you.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.340
It reads, learned institutions
ought to be favorite objects

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.350
with every free people.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.340
They throw light
over the public mind.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.760
I love that.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.940
They throw light
over the public mind.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.110
Even as Kathy and Alan

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.430
and I were first discussing
this program last summer

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.050
at the ALA conference,
I had a hunch

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.560
that this would be a
light-throwing event.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.840
So now, I'm about to introduce
this morning's panel moderator.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.450
But for the transition to make
any sense, you all will need

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.640
to know that when I described
the library to people

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.970
who do not know much
about it, I often talk

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.610
about it being a place
that sparks ideas.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.470
The primary sources in the
collections: my colleagues,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.860
the architecture of the
Thomas Jefferson building.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.100
They all inspire creativity,
and they help us learn

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.780
and imagine possibilities.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.780
Okay. So a minute ago, we were
talking about throwing light,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.230
and I've just mentioned sparks.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.290
So when Kathy asked me if I
would introduce our moderator,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.850
naturally, I did a
little research about her.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.110
And immediately, I
thought, wow, serendipity.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.810
This author is perfect.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.620
Her website has a fabulous URL.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.350
This morning's moderator is
Linda Sue Park, L.S. Park.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.820
And if you go to her website,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.770
you'll find that
the URL, lspark.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.980
Huh! Magic.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.060
Linda was born in
Urbana, Illinois.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.210
She grew up outside of Chicago
and earned her bachelor's degree

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.060
at Stanford University.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.280
She is a Newberry medalist and
the author of numerous novels,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.500
picture books, and poetry
collections for children.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.530
Her work often uses historical
settings and innovative forms

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.810
to expand young readers'
sense of possibility.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.880
Her poetry collection,
Tap Dancing on the Roof,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.670
utilizes a Korean syllabic verse
form to bring surprise and humor

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.130
to everyday moments and objects.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.120
Her novels for teenage
readers include A Single Shard,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.290
When My Name Was Keoko,
and A Long Walk to Water,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.120
based on a true story.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.570
Her picture books include,
The Firekeeper's Son,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.220
illustrated by Julie
Downing, and Bee-bim Bop,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.630
illustrated by Ho Baek Lee.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.030
She lives with her family
in Rochester, New York.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.160
And I have the feeling
she is just who we need

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.390
to start throwing some light
on our program this morning.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.510
Please join me in
welcoming Linda Sue Park.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:25.200
[ Applause ]

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.740
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Good morning.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.680
I am already having so much fun.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.660
I'd like to thank the
Library of Congress,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.680
and We Need Diverse Books, of
course, and especially Ellen O

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.340
and Caroline Richman
and Kathy Weinberg,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.040
the Walter Awards judging panel,
and all of you for being here,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.810
including those of you online.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.180
I serve on the advisory board
of We Need Diverse Books.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.550
And I'm just so thrilled
that they asked me

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.990
to be the moderator
of today's symposium.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.580
So we have the power of books.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.120
And I'm guessing that if you are
in this room, you have a story

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.930
or two about the power of books.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.260
A couple of quick ones of mine.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.110
My daughter is named
after a character in one

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.780
of Charlotte [inaudible] books.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.510
Many years ago, I moved to
Brooklyn because of A Tree Grows

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.430
in Brooklyn, but
perhaps most important,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.930
I survived a childhood
of being different,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.790
in part because of the
strength books gave me.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.410
This morning, I am delighted
to introduce the three winners

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.050
of the Walter Honor Awards,
whose work turns the power

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.920
of books into a juggernaut.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.060
Margarita Engle is the national
young people's poet laureate

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.780
and the first Latina
to receive that honor.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.750
She is the Cuban-American
recipient of many awards

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.980
for her verse novels,
including a Newbery honor

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.240
for The Surrender Tree,
a PEN literary award

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.470
for The Lightning
Dreamer, a Pura Belpre

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.930
and a previous Walter
honor for Enchanted Air.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.250
And I just decided
that was enough.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.040
I couldn't keep listing
the rest of them.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.530
Most recently, she was named by
the United States board of books

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.680
for young people
as the US nominee

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.570
for the 2018 Astrid
Lindgren Memorial award,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.850
and she is the author
of Forest World,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.730
the 2018 Walter honor title

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.510
for younger readers,
Margarita Engle.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:41.620
[ Applause ]

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.130

a New York public library top
100 book, and Bamboo People,

an ALA top 10 [inaudible] novel.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.470
Mitali was born in Kolkata,
India, and has lived

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.650
in Bangladesh, India,
England, Thailand,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.720
Mexico, Cameroon and Ghana.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.870
She currently resides
in San Francisco

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.640
where she is a lecturer at St.
Mary's College of California.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.740
She is the author of You
Bring the Distant Near,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.320
a 2018 Walter honor
book for older readers.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.620
Mitali, where's Mitali?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.420
There she is.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:27.070
[ Applause ]

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.240

He lives outside Boston, and he
is the author of Disappeared,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.510
a 2018 Walter Honor
book for older readers.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:12.610
[ Applause ]

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:21.640
Okay. We're going to start
with the panelists as readers.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.850
So my first question is, I'd
like to ask them to think back

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.050
to their childhoods and where
did your books come from.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.070
Were you public school
library attendees?

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.370
Was it school?

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.670
Was it your parents?

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.450
How did you have access
to books when you young?

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.750
So Margarita, go ahead.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.820
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: For me,
it was the public library,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.790
the Arroyo Seco branch
in Northeast Los Angeles.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.420
And I would go every
Saturday and get a stack.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.760
But I have to say that
I read more adult books

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.880
than children's books.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.000
That's because I wanted
international books.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.380
I wanted books about
other countries.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.000
And at that time,
there weren't books

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.800
about other countries
for children.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.240
So I would go in the
adult travel section,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.750
which was illegal.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.550
The librarians would
chase me away.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.470
They thought I was supposed to
stay in the children's section.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.730
But I would get anything
about geography and travel

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.150
in other countries
that I could find.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.450
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Wonderful.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.750
Mitali.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.050
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: Yes,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.150
definitely the public
library in Flushing, Queens.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.110
We immigrated -- Yes, Flushing!

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.730
So we immigrated there when I
was seven and come from a family

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.510
that is immigrant and refugee.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.860
My parents lost everything
in the war, left Bangladesh,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.130
arrived in Kolkata, and then
when we came to the states,

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.740
like a lot of immigrant
families, we had very little.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.130
So no books in the home.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.100
But my sister one day
-- I have two sisters,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.970
Sonali, Rupali and Mitali.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.010
We all speak Bengali.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.150
Sonali took me by the hand and
said I have a surprise for you

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.490
because she knew I was a
reader already, took me down.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.800
We walked ten blocks
to the Flushing branch.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.330
And when I walked in, she said,
you can take seven books home.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.210
And I was just is
this Ali Baba's cave.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.510
What has happened?

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.440
So that was where
I started reading.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.110
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
I grew up in Mexico.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.220
My mother was a single mother.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.120
So we lived in my
grandfather's house.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.020
And there was just one
bookcase in his bedroom.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.370
It was like one of those
old kind of glass things.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.170
And I knew where the
key was hidden, so.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.600
And he had this set of volume.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.530
I think it was like 20 volumes
called [foreign language

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.880
spoken], which was like
treasures for youth.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.630
And it was like a compilation
of fiction, nonfiction,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.280
you know, stories of science.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.100
You could learn a language if
you read those things carefully.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.340
So that's how I -- I
went through those books,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:04.930
and I don't think I saw a
library until we moved to Texas

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.230
when I was nine years old.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park:
I think about that.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.870
I think about all the
places in the world.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.570
And even in our country, where
young people don't have access

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:17.130
to a library, how do
they live, you know?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.450
So, I mean, that's
really interesting.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.420
Okay. Could you talk
about the first time?

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.420
And it may not have been in your
childhood, but the first time

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.250
that you felt seen in a book
or heard in a book, right.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.030
So why don't we start at
the other end this time.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.330
Yeah.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.630
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork: You know,
I grew up with this identity

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:41.310
of being Mexican
for a long time.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.450
I didn't become an American
citizen till I was 26.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.580
So it really the authors
from Latin America

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.580
that I just grew up with.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.150
It was only when I was
in college and I realized

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.090
that now I had lived, you know,
15 years in the United States

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.340
and I had gone through learning
a new language and, you know,

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.400
getting paddled for speaking
Spanish in the playground

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.950
and getting rejected
by the beautiful Becky

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.240
because I was Mexican.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.740
But, you know, there
were certain things

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.450
that were a little bit
different than Mexicans.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.010
And I began to acquire
that identity.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.860
And I think it was like [foreign
language spoken], where I kind

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.040
of saw, you know, this
possibility of this, yeah,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.320
this kind of looks a
little bit more like me.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.620
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Okay, Mitali.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.920
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: Yeah.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.250
I wanted books because I
didn't like being seen.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.710
I moved to California when
I was in seventh grade,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.150
and I was the only kid of
color in the whole school.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.920
And I was the only kid not born
in the USA in the whole school.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.420
So books for me were a way
to see and hear other lives.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.270
So at school, I was doing
that code switching dance.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.500
At school, I was using
my curling iron to try

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.520
to transform myself into
Farrah Fawcett every morning,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.650
that I could miraculously look

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.010
like everyone else,
which I never did.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.130
So I think for me, it was
that marvelous ability

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.470
that books give us to
see and hear other lives

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.480
and imagine other lives, which
I feel is a huge advantage

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.000
that we get when we have
to cross borders to read.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240
And so, I was learning to become
fluent in imagining other lives.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.470
And I think that's how
books served me well.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.800
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: I was the
only Cuban-American growing

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.420
up in a Mexican American
neighborhood.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.760
And as much as I loved
the poetry of Mexico,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.070
especially [foreign word
spoken], my mother introduced me

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.310
to [foreign word spoken]
and I love all the poets

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.370
of Latin America and Spain, but
especially the generation of 27

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.300
from Spain, who were, you
know, resisting the oppression.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.060
And so, poetry was
very influential.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.590
But I have to say, as far
as being seen in a book,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:06.360
I was 50 something when I
read Alma Flor Ada's memoir,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.790
Under the Royal Palms, and that
would be the first time I read

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:15.680
something written
specifically about Cuba.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.980
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Right.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.570
So we're here to make sure no
one else ever, no child ever has

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.870
to wait that long again, right.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.040
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: You
know, when I was growing up,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.530
I have a very clear memory of
the first Asians I ever saw

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.970
in a book, which was that
Five Chinese Brothers book.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.430
Yeah. Okay, right.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.730
Let's move on.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.490
All right.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:44.470
Okay. Do you have either a book
or books or an author or authors

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.590
who are your greatest influence

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.880
or your greatest
inspiration, and why is that?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.790
Is it because of their
craft, subject matter, theme?

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.330
I mean, do you have, you know,
authors that you just sort

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.050
of hold up as your light?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.510
Mitali, we'll start
with you this time.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.170
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: I just
finished my annual reread

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.470
of Little Women again.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.860
And I think I loved Jo much, Jo
March, because she was living

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.850
in 19th century Concord,
Massachusetts, and I living

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.730
in a traditional
middle-class Bengali home.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.990
But in terms of the pressure
she faced not to use writing

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.260
as a way to make money,
if you reread that book,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.160
there's a strong theme in there
about how she chose her vocation

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.430
as a writer, despite
all the pressures.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.480
And any of you from South
Asian backgrounds know

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.420
that we basically
had three options:

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.380
engineer, doctor and engineer.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.910
Those were our three
options vocationally.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.810
So yeah. So she pushed
those boundaries,

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.520
and she loved her sisters,
and she loved her writing.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.960
For her, her writing
was something

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.580
that she was never
going to give up on.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.270
And that's how I felt
about my writing,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.910
despite all of that pressure.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.850
A refined Bengali woman in that
time did not write for money.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.490
We wrote for beauty.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.400
And so, I think when Jo said no,
I'm going to make money on this

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.980
and I'm going to be
independent, I loved her,

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.570
and I still love her for that.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.870
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Nice, nice.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.170
So Francisco.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.470
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
I guess, you know,

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.150
one of my favorite authors
is Flannery O'Connor,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.450
a southern author.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.410
And I think I was more her life.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.520
You know, she only
wrote two novels

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.830
and two [inaudible]
short stories.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.650
But she was a person of faith.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.370
And her works are
infused with that faith,

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.120
but you'd never know it, you
know, if you read her work.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.930
In fact, in many cases, you'd
think like the opposite,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:34.280
you know, just because they're
so undidactic and so powerful.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.950
So you read her books, and
then you put it down and like,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.830
you know, what the
hell just happened.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.310
And you begin -- And
a little while later,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.270
you begin to like notice things
that you didn't notice before.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.210
And I think that the ability
to see things differently is

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.040
that power that she gave
me and that I would hope

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.590
to emulate in my writing.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.890
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: And
that's why I'm a Francisco X.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.190
Stork fan.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.500
Exactly as you described
Flannery O'Connor is how I would

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.800
describe your work.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.390
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Nice, yeah.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.690
Margarita.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.990
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: You know,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.300
I'm going to say Marilyn
Nelson's Carver influenced me

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.060
because it was the first time --

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.130
And again, 50 something
when I read it.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.570
But it was the first time
I read a verse biography

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.220
about someone who'd been
neglected by history.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.360
And that's something I've
really strived to do is to write

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.430
about people who've
been forgotten and left

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.730
out of the history books.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.970
And Carver has not been left out
as much as some of the people

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.660
that I've felt inspired
to write about.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.490
But it was just such
a beautiful thing

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:52.140
that she did doing a biography
in verse instead of in the kind

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.040
of formal nonfiction
with footnotes

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:02.270
that a child might not
feel invited and welcomed

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:07.490
to open the pages and go,
ah, this was written for me.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.790
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Have
you ever told Marilyn that?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.090
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle:
No, I haven't.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.390
Maybe she'll she this.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.690
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: If
you don't know this book,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.990
I have a special
affection for this book

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.290
because it was an
honor book the year

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.590
that A Single Shard
won the Newbery.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.890
And it's a heroic
crown of sonnets.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.990
And it's an incredibly complex
form and difficult to write,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.860
and it ends within acrostic.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.580
I mean, it will blow your mind.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.880
So yeah.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.850
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: And it
comes across very simple

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.690
and [inaudible] understand
for a child reading.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.990
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yeah.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.290
It's an amazing book.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.460
Okay. Now, we're going to move
on to our panelists as writers.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.500
And it was very interesting to
receive these books and to go

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.760
through them and to read them in
preparation for this symposium.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.700
And immediately, what I noticed
first, the writer part of me,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.190
is that all three of
them chose to use more

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.960
than one viewpoint, okay.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.360
So we have alternating chapters
or sections in all three books.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.740
So I thought that was a really
interesting thing they have

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.040
in common.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.920
And so, I'd like you to tell us
about your multiple characters

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.440
and why you chose them
to be the ones to be seen

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.170
and heard in your book.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.980
So we'll go with
Margarita this time.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.530
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Well,
Forest World is an eco-adventure

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.360
about biodiversity and
wilderness preservation in Cuba,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.030
but it's also a family
reunification story set in 2015

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.140
when President Obama had
initiated the peacemaking

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.330
process between the US and Cuba.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.750
And I felt so excited.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.080
And the only way I felt

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.140
like I could show this
peacemaking process was

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.730
by two children, siblings, who'd
never met each other before.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.690
And that is very
common where one grows

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.970
up in Miami and one in Cuba.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.400
And so, even though I've
heard people say they don't

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.060
like readings, I'm going
to take just a minute

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.760
to read one very short
poem in the sister's voice.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.380
She's grown up in a
rural area in Cuban.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.960
The reason I did multiple voices
was to show the difference

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.320
between the US and Cuba.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.090
Now the American brother who
grew up in Miami, of course,

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.840
lives on his phone and,
you know, everything's

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.480
about Wi-Fi and video games.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.490
And the girl who's
grown up in Cuba,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.910
of course doesn't
have access to Wi-Fi.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.280
In rural Cuba, the fuel
shortage is so severe

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.730
that most people depend

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.780
on horse-drawn vehicles
or hitchhiking.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:39.490
And nightfall, the
clip-clop of horse hooves.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.110
Rhythmic flashes from
dancing fireflies.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.250
Around each curve
the rising moon.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.900
Abuelo's long folktales
his stories

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.270
of glow-in-the-dark
dogs and magical horses.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.550
My brother's fingers
twitch as if he's longing

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:59.250
to send phone messages
back to his real home.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.260
What was Mama thinking, forcing
un americano to spend time

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:09.730
with los Cubanos, sharing
our quiet isolation.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.030
Thank you.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.320
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Who says
people don't like readings?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.620
I love them.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.370
I love hearing the
author read, right.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.680
Okay, yeah.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.980
Mitali.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.280
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: Yes.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.860
So you bring the distant near
as a story of one Bengali family

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.730
who moves to Flushing
Queens from Kolkata, India.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.920
Gosh, I won't where
I got that idea from?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.460
It's three generations.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.260
And so, I have five
voices, but I wanted

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.060
to show how immigration
affects all three

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.340
of those generations
differently.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.420
So the heroic generation
really is the first one

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.000
that come here seeking really
for the next generation.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.820
They're the ones that
bear the sacrifice,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.900
the loss and the cost.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.200
So that's why, in the book,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.660
the narrative arc
really does belong mostly

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.860
to that first generation,
even though she's

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.630
in the third person voice.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.710
And then there are the two girls
that are the second generation,

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.520
which was mine, the
code switchers.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.310
They're learning how to -- They
know about village Bengali life,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.600
and they know about American
life, in they're learning both.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.410
And they're gaining more
agency in this culture

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.640
than their parents
have at a very age.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.940
So that was important to me

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.240
because that's really
my generation.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.800
And then there's the
third generation, my sons,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.120
and the question being how
Bengali really are they

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.270
and how do we hold onto that
and how important is that in

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.470
that third generations.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.750
So people, they'll
identify as Indian, my sons.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.180
But there are 22 major
languages in India

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.300
and cultures, all
of them distinct.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.980
So for an Indian
to say I'm Indian,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.400
it sounds like it
doesn't make any sense.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.540
So for them, their
Bengali identity,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.660
really it's getting lost.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.280
So there's a loss on both
of those generations.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.760
And it's that middle
generation that straddles.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.590
So I wanted to see all of
those three generations

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.510
and how immigration
affects that.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.810
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.690
So Disappeared has
two main characters.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:10.000
Sarah is a young
journalist in Juarez, Mexico,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.670
and she's investigating
the disappearance

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.430
of so many women
during the time,

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.770
during a certain period of time.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.570
And her brother, Emiliano,
is kind of a real go getter.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.680
You know, he's a soccer star
or football I should say,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:31.680
and has this little
business, a craft business.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.910
And there really like -- The
reason I had like two voices is

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.710
because there were kind
of like two journeys.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.220
One of them is sort of
like the journey of kind

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.840
of physical journey of Sarah
and trying to say alive

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.630
as she begins to uncover
some of the causes

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.330
for the disappearing girl
and her left is threatened.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.110
And then Emiliano is kind
of more like a moral journey

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.530
in his sort of like the
temptations that happen

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:05.630
when you're poor to try to
make money through drugs.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:12.050
And so, there was kind of
like both a physical journey

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.580
and kind of a moral journey.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.170
And I think I needed, you
know, I needed two voices.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.590
And sometimes I think that like
the two characters are just part

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.890
of myself.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.080
You know, Emiliano is who I am,
and Sarah is who I'd like to be.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.030
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Nice.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.330
All right.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:31.190
I'm hoping for honesty with
this next one, when I ask you

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.270
to describe a typical
writing day.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:39.610
So my honesty would be email,
eBay, Tetris, open the document,

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.970
stare at the document, Tetris.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.270
Okay, right.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.440
So what is a typical
writing session for you?

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.030
And Mitali, we'll start
with you this time.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.920
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: I'm
motivated by shame.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.890
I come from a same based author.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.440
So recently, I have the
strong suspicion that editor

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.760
and agent have discovered
that about me.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.120
Grace is here, my editor.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.160
And I think they just realized
that without a deadline,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.210
I have the same schedule as you.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.700
So I work best under a
deadline because then, you know,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.310
if I don't make it, there's the
horror of being ashamed, right.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.420
And I work in coffee shops
because I like that buzz.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.950
So there's an app
that you can download

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.380
that is called coffee shop buzz

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.930
that you can actually
have that on your phone.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Parker:
You're kidding.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.830
Oh my God.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.130
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: I'm one

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.430
of those annoying
people in the Bay Area.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.730
I shift coffee shops so
I don't get that look,

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.400
like get an office,
you know that look.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.750
But I shift coffee shops and
I'm the person that takes

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.850
up the space near the plug.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.340
Yeah, that's me.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.640
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Francisco.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.940
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork: You
know, I should say this

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.220
because Arthur Levine
is in the audience

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.960
and he's going to -- My editor.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.070
I sit in front of a computer,
and I tell myself I'm going

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.550
to do this for two hours
and see what happens.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.700
You know, I don't do words
and quotas and so forth.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.540
I'm going to show up.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.210
And sometimes, it's
a few sentences,

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.860
and sometimes I make it
to a page and a half.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.160
And I keep going.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.680
So I work in the mornings, and
then afternoons are for naps

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.230
and to-do lists for my wife.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Okay, nice.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.830
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: Wait.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.050
Who was the write that said
I spend all morning putting a

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.830
comma in and all afternoon
taking the comma out?

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.970
I can't remember the writer.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.960
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Just
take everything Mitali said

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.550
and reverse it.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.610
I need peace, quiet, solitude.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:40.520
I write with a pen by
hand, preferably outdoors,

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.730
and daydreaming is the
essence of my process.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.030
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Parker:
Interesting.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.080
Because I'm sort of all over
the map, I write my novels

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.370
on the computer, but I do poetry
and picture books with a pen.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.670
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins:
That's how I write poetry

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.110
with right hand too.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.410
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yeah.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.340
Sort of. Now the third
section, which is the panelists

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.450
as authors, which is different
from being writers, right.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:08.280
Okay. I'd like you all to share
a favorite story about one

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.980
of your young readers

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.950
that illustrates our
theme of the power books.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.450
I'm going to start on this
one, my favorite letter

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.870
that I have ever gotten
from a young reader.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.730
Dear Ms. Park.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.390
I was absent the day we
picked our author to write to,

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.510
and you were the only one left.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:33.260
[ Laughter ]

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:39.510
So my question for you is,
do you know Gary Paulsen.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:45.090
[ Laughter ]

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.240
But I was delighted that he
had a favorite author, right.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.210
So it doesn't have to
be me, but they have

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.890
to have a favorite author.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.970
Okay, Margarita, one
of your young readers.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.670
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: I have
received letters asking me

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.920
to pass messages along
to other authors also.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.030
But for me, the most
powerful moments have been

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:10.170
when I read a poem that is
very personal, so especially

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.500
when I read from my
memoir Enchanted Air.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.610
Very often, a student will
stand up out of the crowd

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.440
and read their own poem to me,
in front of their classmates.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.290
This is happened to me on Skype.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.950
It's happened in person.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:34.250
The most powerful moments have
been when it was a student

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.930
who the teacher said,
later, told me privately,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.630
I didn't know that
boy could read.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.710
And he was writing
his own poetry.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:49.500
And then also, a young girl who
came up to me and recited a poem

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.380
about being a homesick refugee.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.820
And she was from Syria and had
just recently come to the US.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.770
So these kids that we are
speaking to and reading to,

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.150
they're writing, and we don't
know that unless we open

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.240
up to the, and read
our own work to them

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.770
and share it very personally.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.070
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yeah.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.630
She felt so seen, that girl.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.560
Right. So Mitali.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.670
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins:
Well, I just Skyped

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:28.300
with a intergenerational book
club in upstate New York.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.620
And so, the librarian
had arranged a visit.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.130
The senior center
had read my book,

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.010
and the teenagers
had read my book.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.300
So they were discussing it
together and they were going

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.120
to have an Indian dance
thing and a whole day.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.680
And this is the first
time this has happened

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.290
because I gave my
best Skype I thought.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.020
And then they started talking
and they forgot I was there.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.500
I was like this huge head on
the wall [inaudible] because one

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.660
of them started sharing, one
of the Indian women there,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.870
started sharing the story
of her arranged marriage

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.170
and how she had met her husband.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.880
I had talked about my parents,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.180
who had met each other
on their wedding day.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.660
So she started talking, and
all the teens were just focused

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.960
on her story.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.810
But that was exciting
to see that connection.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.380
And I think the other part I
love, even in this digital age,

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.280
and I'm a huge social media
geek, is when you go to schools.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.240
Do you guys mind a
spoiler about the book?

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.870
You okay? Well, one of the
characters dies in the book.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.920
And every book, every father

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.570
in every book I write
is based on my dad.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:31.180
And so, we had just lost my dad
right before the book launch.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.970
And so, I had to go on tour
and visit all these schools.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.710
And I thought, oh, gosh, how
am I going to make it through.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.290
You're trying to
be professional.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:42.200
And I went to the school
in Kalamazoo, Michigan,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.730
but 148 eighth graders,
the media,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.030
all the electricity was out.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.440
So everyone is shivering
in coats,

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.930
and it was a title I school,
lots of school [inaudible] kids,

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.240
lots of immigrants and refugees.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.860
And I hadn't realized the
English teacher had read

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.160
the book.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.460
I didn't know that.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.760
She had read the book.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.060
So I shared my story.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.660
And then, a 14-year-old
boy's hand goes up.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.670
And I was really
trying hide my grief.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.030
And I thought I'd
done a great job.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.930
And his hand goes up and
he says, I have a question.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.230
And his voice, you know,

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.350
has that cracking 14-year-old
voice, I have a question.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.650
And I said, yeah.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.010
He said, what, I love that dad.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.500
Why did that dad have to die?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.090
And I thought, oh, gosh.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.550
So that was hard.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.170
You know, I'm thinking, man,

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.410
thanks for getting me
choked already [inaudible].

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.330
Anyway. We are a
very crying culture.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.700
So feel free to join
in [inaudible].

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.530
I started crying in front
of all those 14-year-olds.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.150
I mean -- And the best part
of it, I think the connection

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.120
that I want to share with you
is that every single faith

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.130
in that room had
so much compassion.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.810
They all loved my
dad with me, so.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.610
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Joe: Nice.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:59.290
[ Applause ]

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.590
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
Why do you do this to me?

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.520
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: This is
the gift, my immigrant gift

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.280
to Americans, everybody cry.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.580
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
Make them cry.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.880
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins:
I make them cry.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.180
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
Make them cry.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.980
I think probably
I wrote this book

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.730
about a young girl who's
recovering from depression,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.390
you know, a day after
a suicide attempt.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.490
And I really wanted to make
sure that that book was,

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.300
and I tried very hard, you know,
to various drafts to make sure

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.330
that I got it right and that
if it ended up in the hands

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.120
of somebody who was like
thinking about what to do

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.390
with life, that it would point
them in the right direction.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:40.470
So the emails that I
get sometimes from kids

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:46.300
that thank me for the book,
it makes it all worthwhile.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.600
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.180
Thank you.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.480
Thank you, all.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.150
Okay. This question
has a choice for you.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.510
Tell us about the next book
that's coming out for you

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.830
or what you're working on now.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.130
So Francisco.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.310
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork: So this
is the first time I'm trying

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:10.290
to do a follow up to the
previous book, in Disappeared.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:16.820
The kids kind of
get to the border.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.620
And then, so the next
book is their lives,

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.830
their undocumented lives
in the United States.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.130
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Wow.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.430
Can't wait.

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:30.260
How far along are you?

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.130
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
My editor is over there,

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:36.450
so I can't -- It's
due this summer.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:39.510
And I just asked him to
define summer for me.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.040
[ Laughter ]

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.790
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Summer
in the southern hemisphere.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.440
Okay. Margarita.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.640
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: My next
first novel is Jazz Owls,

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.650
a novel of the Zoot Suit Riots.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.660
And it's about the
-- They're misnamed.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.380
They should be called
the sailor riots.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:07.020
It's about the sailors attacking
Mexican American youth,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.240
their rage triggered by the side

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.540
of interracial dancing during
World War II, in Los Angeles,

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.500
in my home neighborhood.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.600
And it comes out
did I say in May?

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.900
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: No.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.200
May, this May?

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.500
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Yeah,
it comes out in May.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.470
And then next year, Soaring
Earth, which is a sequel

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.940
to my childhood memoir
Enchanted Air.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.410
It's about my high
school and college years

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.910
of the protests of the '60s.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.340
And it's really embarrassing,
and I will go

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.230
into hiding when it comes out.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:47.130
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: I
can't wait for that one.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.510
Okay.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.180
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: I have
my first picture book coming

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.480
out next year.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.780
So FSG Macmillan.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.350
It's called Gifts for Abuela,
illustrated by Sara Palacios.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.570
So I'm excited about that.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.270
It's a California story
because it's about our wall

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.830
on the border and it's about
a little girl who wants

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.280
to get a gift to her
Abuela across that wall,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.030
on the Dia de Los Posadas.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.310
So that is my next book.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.390
And then I am working on
Boy Wonder and Cat Girl,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.950
which is multiple narrators.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.250
I know, it's kind of a --

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.420
I'm trying to get into the
Bali woods superhero vibe

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.820
of this novel.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.930
It's about two teens from
Boston who go to Kolkata

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.770
and are just discovering a
lot about their own stories

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.300
as they confront some of
the trafficking that happens

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.980
in the city of my birth.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.280
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Wow.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.360
Well, I'll get in on
this just for a minute.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.500
Next spring, I have a
picture book coming out.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.540
There are dragons in
Western mythology and dragons

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.880
in Eastern mythology, and
they have a lot in common,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.180
but they're also different.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.490
So your Western Dragon has wings
and breathes fire and lives

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.370
in caves and hoards treasurer,

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.690
but Eastern dragons don't
do any of those things.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.270
So this is a little girl dragon
named Gandra [assumed spelling],

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.800
whose father is from the East

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.320
and whose mother
is from the West.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.910
She breathes fire from one
nostril and mist from the other.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.330
So it' my little
mixed-race dragon book.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.810
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: I want
to give a quick shout

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.110
out to Linda Sue's
parents who are here too.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.800
So I would love to
say hello to them.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.600
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yeah,
my parents are here.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:25.800
[ Applause ]

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.500
My father got some love a
few months ago on Twitter.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.800
He asked me.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.100
He was visiting and asked
me for a good book to read.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.250
So I gave him Angie
Thomas's The Hate U Give.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.830
And he was keeping a
little list for me of stuff

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.750
and phrases he didn't
understand.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.510
So the first question
is, what is this hoes.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:48.720
[ Laughter ]

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.300
Okay. So that was
a fun conversation.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.610
All right.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.910
We're going to move now
to a lightening round.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.150
Now the questions thus far
I did give the panelists,

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.090
so they could, you know,
think about it a little bit.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.550
These, they have not seen, okay.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.010
So it's just going to
be a lightening round.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.430
We'll just keep going like this.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.740
They start easy, okay,
and they're going

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.140
to get a little harder, right.

missing voices

because I certainly
can't do it all.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.060

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.280
that a poem is never
finished; it's just abandoned.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.960

&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork: No.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.520
I'll go. You should be last.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.540
I think it's not about my books,
but I think the action item

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.840
that I would say is

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.290
to try mentor a young
person in your life.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.750
Just listen to their works.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.590
Help them along as best you can.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.410
And you don't have to
be a writing coach,

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.720
but just one young
person that you find.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.020
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park: Yes.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.320
Jackie Woodson says she's trying

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.670
to change the world
one reader at a time.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:55.970
&gt;&gt; Mitali Perkins: Yay.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:57.290
That's great.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:01.090
I'd say play around with
the windows and the mirrors.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.810
I found unexpected
mirrors in books,

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.190
and so will the kids
that you serve.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:11.650
So I would say let kids roam
freely, but don't limit them

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.690
to just the ethnic
or racial mirror

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.710
because they're going
to find that.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.190
And I think play around with it

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.040
in your collections
and your displays.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.840
So I would hate -- I heard
for many years in my career,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.560
we just don't have an Indian
population in our community,

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.510
Mitali, and so that's why.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.030
So I don't hear that anymore.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.910
And I want to keep
that going forward

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.880
because our books
are for all readers.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.430
And really, that's the --

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:43.090
I am so thankful too
We Need Diverse Books.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.940
I mean, we've been writing
for years and years and years.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.040
And just to see the attraction
you guys have given our work

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.380
because I don't hear
that anymore.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.450
And so, I'd say let your
young readers roam freely.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:54.750
Find the windows and mirrors,

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.800
and just offer them
a feast of books.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.100
&gt;&gt; Francisco X. Stork:
There you go.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.400
Nice job.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.700
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue Park:
Thank you, Mitali.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.250
You've also given me the perfect
ending because most of us use

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.170
that windows and mirrors
metaphor, which has been

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.380
so incredibly useful, right.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.710
And here with us today, we have
the originator of that phrase,

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.200
Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.510
If you want to come
stand up, Dr. Bishop.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:27.970
[ Applause ]

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:32.380
She was doing this work before
most of us knew it was work.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.660
So we're so honored that
she's here with us today.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.240
So I guess a few minutes break
now before our actual Walter

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.540
Award ceremony starts.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.840
And thank you all.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.140
So I had a great time.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.940
I hope you did too.

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.700
[ Applause ]

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.750
&gt;&gt; Kathie Weinberg: When Linda
Sue said she wasn't going

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.470
to do your basic cookie-cutter
diversity panel, I thought,

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.010
okay, we're in for a good ride.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.310
And you know what?

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.610
It was a wonderful ride.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:47:59.910
Thank you, Linda Sue.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.730
Thank you, Margarita,
Mitali, and Francisco.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.490
You know, you have
taken us on journey.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.790
You made us laugh.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.090
You made us cry.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.140
And I'm glad none of you
became the engineer, doctor,

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.290
engineer that you
might have been.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:20.420
I just wanted to say,
speaking on behalf

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.830
of We Need Diverse Books,
it's been a pleasure

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.640
to cosponsor this symposium
with the Library of Congress.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.290
And we especially appreciate
the assistance and warm welcome

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.770
of Lee Ann Potter, the director
of Education and Outreach

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.830
for the Library of Congress.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.220
We're going to take
a 15-minute break.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.230
Coffee, tea in the back, water.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.820
Bathrooms down the hall.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.070
We've also set up book
sales thanks to the library

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.640
of Congress book sale office.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.390
And please, you know, go
ahead and purchase those.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:57.680
The authors will very nicely
be signing during the reception

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.980
that will follow.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.690
We want to make sure
that they have time to --

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.430
We're celebrating them during
the reception, so we don't want

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.960
to make them work
the whole time.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.770
So no personalizing and also
no photos for the signing.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.160
And then we're going to
try to do that efficiently

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.620
and then let them enjoy
and mingle with all of you.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.580
So see you back here
in about 15 minutes,

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.290
and thank you and thank you.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:25.510
Let's give one more hand for
these wonderful panelists.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:35.630
[ Applause ]

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:37.530
Hello and welcome.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:44.840
There's nothing like an unruly
crowd of librarians, teachers,

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.860
educators and publicists.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.070
Networking is really great.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.370
And we're going to do it
afterwards at the reception.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:57.600
So thank you very much
for your patience.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.580
I'm Kathie Weinberg,
and I'm the codirector

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.980
of the We Need Diverse
Books Walter awards.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.040
We welcome you to the third
Walter Dean Myers award

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.670
for outstanding children's
literature.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.060
It's fitting to start
with an often heard quote

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.970
from Walter Dean Myers, whose
legacy we honor with this award.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.310
Reading is not optional.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:28.400
This award says that children
finding and seeing themselves

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.450
in books is also not optional.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.890
We Need Diverse Books was
founded with the hashtag

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.860
and 21 people a couple
years ago.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.560
And now, it has grown
to a global presence.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.820
We know how global it is because
one of our founders and the head

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.420
of We Need Diverse Books, Ellen
Oh, know who we missed today,

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.660
is in Hong Kong at
the book festival.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.270
So I hope she's watching
our live stream.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.630
So everyone say hi to Ellen.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.620
&gt;&gt; Multiple Speakers: Hi, Ellen.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.920
&gt;&gt; Kathie Weinberg: Okay.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.210
Okay, so as an organization,

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:07.690
We Need Diverse Books have
brought positive change

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.300
to the publishing world and
the books being published.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.680
When We Need Diverse Books
started the Walter award three

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.580
years ago, we had
for our first year

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.320
under 40 books submitted
for consideration.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:26.060
For the Walter 2017,
we had 76 awards,

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.990
76 submissions for the Walter.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:33.430
And for Walter 2018, while
we did add the category

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:38.690
of younger reader, our
submissions were over 180 books.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.550
So that's the beginning
of progress.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:45.210
We have a lot of thank
you-s to hand out today.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.510
First, to the Library of
Congress for their hospitality,

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.670
especially Dr. Carla
Hayden, Lee Ann Potter,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.990
Clay Pencheck [phonetic],
Karen Jaffe

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.810
and Sasha Doughty [phonetic].

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:01.740
We could not do this without
the We Need Diverse Books staff

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.310
and volunteers.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.990
A big thanks to Caroline
Richmond.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.890
She's everywhere.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:12.610
She's the We Need Diverse
Books program director.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:15.040
Judy Schricker, the CFO

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.460
and Christine Vallis
[assumed spelling],

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.200
the financial manager.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.590
And we couldn't do this either

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:22.920
without events planner
Karen Brown.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.780
And we want the We Need
Diverse Books volunteers

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.080
to please stand up.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.860
So all We Need Diverse
Books people

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.510
that have volunteered please
stand up and we can thank you.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:43.130
[ Applause ]

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:47.690
And we want to take a moment to
honor the memory of the legacy

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.370
of Walter Dean Myers and
thank his family and friends

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.790
for their continued
support of the award.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.940
Of course, the award
would not be possible

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.860
without our most talented and
slightly bleary-eyed judges

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.910
over there, who have read some
wonderful books this year.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:08.160
Co-chair Terry Hong is not with
us today, but Maria Salvador,

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.510
co-chair, is over there.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.670
[ Applause ]

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:19.800
And judges Derek Ivie, Dora
Maher, Nayantara Mhatre,

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.020
Ruth Lowery, and Deb Taylor.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.510
Would you please stand
up so we can thank you?

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:34.150
[ Applause ]

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.650
And while we're on a thank you
role, I want to say a big thanks

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:41.810
to the publishers, many of
whom are in our audience today.

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.260
Thank you for listening
to We Need Diverse Books

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.140
and supporting the
need for diversity

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.600
in children's literature.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.810
One last thanks to our
audience of readers,

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.980
educators, and librarians.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.930
We could not spread the We Need
Diverse Book word and put books

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:01.290
by diverse authors with
diverse characters in the hands

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.490
of children without your help.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.290
Thank you.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:10.090
[ Applause ]

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.910
We have a wonderfully
full program.

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:15.520
And to start it out, I would
like to introduce Mark Sweeney.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.580
He is the acting deputy director
of the Library of Congress.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.840
While we miss Dr. Hayden, we're
very appreciative of Mark's time

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.600
and interest in the
award ceremony.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.570
Mark is also the
chief of humanities

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.440
and social sciences division
at the Library of Congress,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.980
plus serves as a
director of preservation.

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.780
Welcome, Mr. Sweeney.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:41.780
[ Applause ]

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Well, good
morning, everyone here.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.970
The energy in the room
is really infectious.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:49.660
So I'm pleased to add
my voice to the chorus

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.470
of voices welcoming
you here to the Library

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.650
of Congress this morning.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:58.140
As you know, we're here
today with our colleagues

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.530
from We Need Diverse Books,
to highlight diversity

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.020
in children's literature.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:06.970
Just four years ago, We
Need Diverse Books began

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.820
as a simple hashtag on Twitter.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.210
Today, the organization has
grown from a grassroots movement

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:20.140
into a 5013C nonprofit with
a team that spans the globe.

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.330
Writers and illustrators,
editors and agents,

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.340
book bloggers and book lovers,

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.160
the We Need Diverse Books
team seeks to create a world

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.380
in which every child
can see themselves

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.630
in the pages of a book.

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.920
The Library of Congress
shares this goal.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.640
We are proud to have hosted this
morning's symposium on diversity

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.720
in children's literature
and also

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.960
to be hosting this ceremony.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.930
Both events highlight
and promote books

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.460
that broaden our notions
of diversity and engage us

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.730
in meaningful conversations
about them.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.960
To honor exemplary diverse
books created by writers

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.910
and illustrators from
marginalized communities,

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.780
We Need Diverse Books
established the Walter Dean

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.930
Myers Award for outstanding
children's literature,

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.210
the Walters.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:10.710
Walter Dean Myers was
a five-time winner

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:16.070
of the Coretta Scott King award
and two-time Newbery honors.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.130
He was named the third
national ambassador

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.480
for Young People's Literature
by the Library of Congress,

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.780
the Children's Book Council

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.770
and the Every Child
a Reader in 2012.

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:28.480
We are delighted that the MC

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.900
for this morning's ceremony is
the current national ambassador

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.750
for Young People's
Literature, Jacqueline Woodson.

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.510
And I'm delighted
to introduce her.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:43.770
[ Applause ]

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:48.060
Jacqueline is a four-time
Newbery honor medalist,

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.470
a Coretta Scott King
book award winner,

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.800
a former young poets laureate.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.840
Her platform reading
equals hope and change,

00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.910
What's Your Equation, encourages
young people to think about

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.440
and beyond the moment
that they are living in,

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.400
the power they possess and
the impact reading can have

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.130
on showing them ways in which
they can create the hope

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:13.810
and change that they
want to see in our world.

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:16.220
Please join me in
welcoming Jacqueline Woodson

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.020
to the podium.

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:31.190
[ Applause ]

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.490
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Morning.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.790
What an honor.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.510
Okay. I would be remiss to
not do this for my panelists.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.660
[ Applause ]

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:46.510
Y'all will get it after
this afternoon's viewing.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.720
[ Laughter ]

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.960
Oh, man, that was the
best symposium ever, ever.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:02.580
I didn't space out once.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.010
It really was the best.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.920
So thank you, thank you.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.070
What an honor to be in the room,
and what an honor to be back

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:12.370
at the Library of Congress.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.070
There's so much love
in the room.

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:18.230
This is place that as a
young person I never came to,

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:21.520
and I never thought
it was for me.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:30.010
And Dr. Carla Hayden, the staff
here, the energy is amazing now.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:34.270
And to look around this room and
to see how diverse it is to be

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:38.530
in this moment of We Need
Diverse Books is everything.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.230
It is a dream and beyond.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.820
So I just want to say to the
young people in the room,

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:48.920
hold fast to dreams because
this is what they become.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.530
And y'all are amazing, amazing.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:58.210
I am still high on the march
on the national walkout

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:00.240
and all the work that the
young people are doing

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.550
to change the world and all the
work my fellow writers are doing

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:06.450
to keep us here.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:09.140
So what an absolute honor.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:15.470
I have a speech written because
I don't get nervous unless they

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:18.500
tell me that it's
being televised.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.600
So suddenly, the
intimacy is gone

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.420
because I know y'all won't judge
me, but the people out there.

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.720
I see you.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.540
And bless this.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.840
The ceremony is a
little bit longer

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.950
because We Need Diverse
Books is very excited

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:41.030
to present our first
bookseller of the year award.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.270
It is a true universally
acknowledge --

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:49.460
See, see, this is what happens.

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.380
And for the, you know, for
the Newbery, for the Caldecott

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.960
and the award that's
being given this year,

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.240
it's right now called
the Laura Ingalls Wilder,

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.430
but there's work being
done to change that name.

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:05.610
You have to write a speech
and submit it a couple

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.840
of months beforehand,
so they could record it

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.040
and I guess you're not
supposed to mess up on it,

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.530
like I'm messing up here now.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.140
But just the idea of having

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.000
to write something long
before you get in the room

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.450
with the people who
you're going to say it to,

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.380
you don't know how the
world's going to change.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.600
I mean, it changes so quickly.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.020
And what you write two months

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.320
from the day you give the speech
can be not so relevant anymore,

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.750
but this is very relevant.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.760
I do digress.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.080
That was all to just
kind of cover

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.030
up my flubbing, the
writing here.

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.740
It's a very New Yorker
thing to kind

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.120
of knock you off
track for a minute.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.400
It is a true universally
acknowledged

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.300
that every diverse
book is in need

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.310
of a bookseller to hand sell it.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:57.070
Of all the gatekeepers in
the publishing industry,

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.420
booksellers may be one
of the most important,

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.980
as people who both curate
collections and get books

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.630
into the hands of readers
who will purchase them.

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.960
They have the power to
create book bestsellers,

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.930
but more vitally, they have
the power to represent;

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:15.220
meaning that children can go to
their stores and either search

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.040
in vain for books that
reflect their world or smile

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.670
when they see themselves
on the shelf.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.630
Today, We Need Diverse
Books is proud

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.490
to present its first
bookseller of the year award,

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.180
a prize that was created
because our organization wanted

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.190
to recognize the role that
booksellers have as drivers

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.310
of the publishing industry.

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:38.110
No one can read or buy a book
that they've never heard of.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.630
This is our thank you to
the independent booksellers

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:45.560
of our country for championing,
and I might be mispronouncing

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.110
that because that's
not a word I wrote.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.790
And I usually write words
that I pronounce a lot.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:55.610
So, but, you know, it means
for being champions of.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.370
The cause of diverse
books and showing

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:03.020
that they can, in fact, sell.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.680
We do buy books.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:11.970
The winner of the first annual
We Need Diverse Books seller

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.710
of the year award is Sarah Look

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:18.030
of Charis Books and
More in Atlanta.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.010
And I love this bookstore.

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.280
I don't have enough time to talk

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.760
about how much I
love Charis Books,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.830
one of the early
bookstores that I visited

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:30.630
and the community
that happens there.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.670
So I'm very proud to
present this award.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:35.390
As the oldest feminist
bookstore in the country,

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.110
Charis Books is a local
institution that is proud

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:41.480
and open about its mission
to reflect a wide spectrum

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.750
of experiences, lives
and families.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.050
Their excellence

01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:48.790
in the supportive diverse
books is evident in the types

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:53.200
of events that it programs,
in the antiracist resistance

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.750
and LGBT book list, in its race
conscious parenting collective,

01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:01.130
in its community
outreach to librarians

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:04.250
in schools via diversity
teachings and, of course,

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:09.350
in its collection, which
honors all types of diversity.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:14.160
We need Diverse Books is honored
to present Sara and Charis books

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.980
and more with two awards:
one for them to keep and one

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.730
that will remain at Charis
Books until the next bookseller

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:23.030
of the year is nominated.

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.330
And then you've got
to give it back.

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:28.510
Sorry. Thank you,
Sara and Charis Books.

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:41.590
[ Applause ]

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:42.890
No speech.

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.320
I think you have to stand here

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.900
and let me take a
picture with you.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.290
Sorry. We didn't
practice that part.

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.590
Sorry.

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:54.510
Thank you.

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:59.470
[ Applause ]

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:00.880
You might want to
check your luggage.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.520
I've been stopped for these.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.970
And now, we move on to
the Walter awards, right.

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.270
Am I? Okay.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:13.220
&gt;&gt; Any way you like it.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.900
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Thank you.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.150
So now we move on to the

I'll just drop the honoree.

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:42.950

I think there was
one year you got two

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:07.320
at the same, ceremony, right?

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.610
Yeah. He's not messing
around, y'all.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:13.230

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.880
It's not out yet.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.760
And the track series Ghost
Patina and then coming up,

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.270
Sunny and Lu and long way down,

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:13.090
which received both a Newbery
honor and a Printz honor.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:14.390
He lives in Washington DC.

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:16.430
And just an aside about Jason.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:21.720
So I have a 10-year-old
son who reads differently.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.800
And he listens to
audiobooks non-stop.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.280
And every time I ask
him what's in his ear,

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.770
Jason Reynolds, Jason Reynolds.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:32.070
But you listened
to that already.

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.750
I'm listening to it
again, Jason Reynolds.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:39.250
But he loves this writer,
as do so many of us.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.510
Congrats, Jason.

01:06:41.510 --> 01:07:01.510
[ Applause ]

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:02.940
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Hi, everybody.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.020
There's a whole lot of
y'all in here this year.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.370
So I have a few minutes
to say a few words.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.930
First, let me just thank you
to the Library of Congress.

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:14.490
Thank you to We Need
Diverse Books.

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.960
I am forever grateful for
the work that you've done.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.100
Thank you judging
panel and committee.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:23.740
It has never lost on me how
fortunate I am every time

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.040
anything like this happens.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.300
I am truly grateful.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.510
Thank you to my mama,
who you always --

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:34.220
[ Applause ]

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.970
I like to -- I always
tell people it's important

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.550
to make sure everybody who
knows me knows her, right.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.770
I think it's important
to do that.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:46.260
At the end, you know, all of us,
our lives are sort of fleeting.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.610
And at the end of the day when
she's out of her or when I'm

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:51.910
out of here, I want her
legacy to be as solid

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:54.130
and as perpetual as my own.

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:55.620
It's important, right.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.920
So shout out to my mom.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.850
Thank you everybody
that's been up,

01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:01.600
all the honorees,
all the winners.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.020
It's just so cool to be
around such important

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:06.220
and interesting people
doing such fantastic work.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.610
And, of course, the
great Jacqueline Woodson.

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:11.770
She's the only person I
know who is so decorated,

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:15.320
has so many everything, right.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.630
She has all the awards,
and yet somehow it seems

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.130
to not take herself
very seriously.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.050
I think there's much
to be learned

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:24.860
from understanding
what it is our role is

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.880
and what we're really doing and
that the awards are amazing,

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.100
but they don't necessarily
change our character.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.400
They shouldn't at least.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.700
Who we are is who we are.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.290
And I'm grateful for you
for being a big sister to me

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:37.520
in this interesting journey
of the literary world.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.580
Also, my agent, Elena, is here
and my editor, Caitlyn Dlouhy,

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.170
both of whom are
just as responsible

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.830
for the work that I do.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.900
Now with all that being --
Because you got to do all that,

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.390
right, because then
somebody going to be like,

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:50.690
you ain't even thank
the committee

01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:54.310
and you ain't even think
-- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.880
All that's over.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.220
Here's what I want to
say really quickly.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.140
I've been doing some research
and working on this new book.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.440
I can't talk about it.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.780
But I'm picking around
ideas, right.

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:05.590
And this is sort of what happens

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:07.920
in my brain is I have all
this stuff happening up here

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.320
and it's moving around,
and I'm trying to figure

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.620
out what to do with it.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.840
And I've been really
working on this.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.420
We all know the adage if
a tree falls in the forest

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.040
and no one is around to hear,
does it make a sound, right.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.410
We've all grown up hearing that.

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:19.860
I'm not even sure if many
of us have ever thought

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.270
about what exactly
is being said.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.650
But we hear that all the time.

01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.900
I've done some research on it
because I'm interested in it,

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.550
and I think it's a
fascinating saying.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.260
And I've been digging around
trying figure out what

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.130
that means for my life,
what that means for my work,

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.820
what exactly are they
even talking about.

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:35.550
Turns out that thought it is
a philosophical statement,

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:37.500
it actually was a
scientific statement.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.620
And scientists were saying
basically that if a tree falls

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.280
in the forest, what happens
when it come to sound is

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.580
that the tree hits the ground.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.880
There's a vibration
from that impact,

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.690
and that vibration then
somehow travels to --

01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:55.040
Y'all didn't make the
announcement [laughter]?

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.480
Exactly. The tree falls,
hits the ground, all right.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.780
There's a vibration.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.080
That vibration travels
to the eardrum.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.380
And then when it
hits the eardrum,

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.680
the eardrum makes the sound.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.660
But if the vibration does not
hit the eardrum, technically,

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.960
then the sound is not made.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.260
That's how sound works, right.

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.490
So the scientists were saying
if a tree hits the ground

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:11.790
and no one is there to hear it,

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.600
technically it does
not make a sound.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.100
of course, for me, that is --
I mean, it makes sense sort of,

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.540
except for the fact that I
think somehow in that argument,

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.850
it sort of disqualifies the
idea of the vibration being made

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:26.150
in the first place, right.

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:28.460
So if a tree is a piece of
matter, a tree is a thing,

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.020
it's a living thing, a breathing
thing, a growing thing,

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.420
once that tree hits the ground,

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.720
there's a vibration made whether
someone is there to hear it

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.950
or not is of less
importance than the fact

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.150
that the vibration is made
and to not acknowledge

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:41.910
that vibration is to
disqualify that life

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:43.670
and the falling of said tree.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:45.510
Now from a philosophical --

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.520
[ Applause ]

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.660
Now from the philosophical,
from a philosophical standpoint,

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.960
right, which is the
other argument,

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.390
which is the colloquial
argument that most of make

01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:56.690
when we say this, right.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:58.680
If a tree falls in the forest
and no one is around to hear it,

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.230
does it make a sound,
and we look at that

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:02.570
as a philosophical
statement, right.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:04.850
From a philosophical standpoint,

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:09.940
I think that perhaps we're not
necessarily asking the right

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.240
questions, right.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.210
It's like that seems like just
a limited and simplified sort

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:16.270
of question to be asking about
a tree that falls in a forest

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:17.820
with no one around to hear it,

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.230
because there are other
questions, extenuating questions

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.980
that we should be
asking ourselves

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.280
to better understand the context
in which a tree is falling

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.910
in a forest with no
one around to hear it.

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:30.470
For instance, is
the wind blowing?

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.770
For instance, was the
tree struck by lightning?

01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:35.710
For instance, is there something
eating at the base of the tree,

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.350
which makes it a
little less strong?

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:40.240
For instance, are there
termites eating the tree

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.540
from the inside out?

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.710
All of this would help us try
to better understand whether

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:48.910
or not it matters that
if a sound is made or not

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:52.500
if a tree falls in a forest
with no one there to hear it.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.310
Now let's transpose
tree for child, right.

01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:00.250
From a scientific standpoint,
from a scientific standpoint,

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.720
if a child falls
and no one is there

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.910
to hear it, does
it make a sound?

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:07.590
According to the scientists,
the child does not, right.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.070
According to what
I'm arguing, thought,

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:12.170
is if we say the child
does not make a sound,

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:13.870
if we say that the
child's impact

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:15.870
on that ground does
not create a vibration,

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:20.240
then we disqualify the
life of said child, right.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.440
Now from a philosophical
standpoint,

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.580
if a child falls,
does it make a sound?

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.120
Again, I think we need
to ask more questions.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.630
Number one, was there
wind blowing?

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:34.020
Was there something
there pushing the child?

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.820
Was there something
there, a force,

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.600
an unseen force forcing
the child down?

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.930
Was there something there eating
at the child's base, right?

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:44.630
Something there that maybe we
don't know eating at the child.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:46.530
Were there termites involved,

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.370
eating the child
from the inside out?

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:50.820
Was lightening striking
any way in the vicinity?

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.550
Was anything on fire?

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:55.700
Was the ground weakened
by anything, right?

01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:02.340
And lastly, lastly,
why aren't anyone --

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.430
Like, where are the
people, right?

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:07.470
If a tree falls in the forest

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.490
and no one is around,
does it make a sound?

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.920
the question is, why
is no one around?

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.220
Where are the people?

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.280
Where is everyone, right?

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.380
Because that's the question
that we should be asking,

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.360
and that is what long way
down is actually about, right.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.700
Everyone is saying like, oh,
it's about a kid and a gun.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.000
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.350
This is about acknowledging
the fact that the kids

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:30.370
that we judge every single day
have all kinds of things going

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:33.520
on around them, forces that
cause these kinds of issues.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.330
And it's best for us to ask
ourselves some true questions,

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.360
to really mind our own psyches.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.660
This book is not
about any child.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.290
This book is about you.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:42.590
You read the book.

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.890
Whatever you think happens
to this kid at the end

01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:47.610
of book has more to say about
you than that child, right.

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:51.020
Do your work to make sure that
our babies have a fair shot.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.440
That's all I ask for.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.290
Shout out to also -- Before I
get off the stage -- I'm done.

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:56.320
But before I get off the
stage, I also just want

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.690
to say really quickly to
Margaret Angle, my friend.

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.710
It's important, and I want to
make sure I acknowledge her

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.330
because at the end of the day,
she could probably explain

01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:07.050
that the power of novels and
verse far better than I could.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.570
I think her job and her
role in the position

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:11.290
that she holds is
very important.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.140
And I think she understands the
power of poetry and the power

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.720
of verse and its force in a way

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.730
that I hope to mature
to someday.

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.620
And it's important that
she know that as well.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.920
I appreciate y'all.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.220

very, very much.

01:14:56.590 --> 01:15:03.020
You can't just drop mics that
are attached to a podium.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.310
So thank you, Jason.

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:09.300
I think it's a good moment

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.340
to just bring the
ancestors into the room.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:19.160
I do this as often as I can.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.760
When you hear the powerful
words spoken by our writers,

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.950
I think it's important for
us all to remember the people

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:28.730
who came before us and
how important they were

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.700
to who we are now, to
being able to stand here,

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:36.220
and the people who've left this
world but still walk with us.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.890
So if we could just take
two minutes and just shout

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:42.510
out a name of someone who you
want to bring back into the room

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.630
or who already is
in the room with us.

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:48.390
I think that would be
fitting in this moment

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:51.700
of remembering Walter
Dean Myers.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.000
That's the name I'll say.

Why'd you make me
follow the philosopher.

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.310
After we heard Jason
speak, I asked Eric, I said,

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:14.830
you want to go next [laughter].

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:17.500
Something to start
with, an epitaph.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.220
We've already invoked
the ancestors.

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.590
So I'm going to start
with the poem

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:28.820
that concludes Schomburg,
epitaph, 1938.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.000
If this proverb, a book is a
garden carried in a pocket,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.510
is true, then Arturo Alfonso
Schomburg, the historian

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:42.810
and book collector, had a green
thumb and a harvest of pride.

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:46.090
There was no field of human
endeavor that he did not till

01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:49.780
with his determined hand, that
he did not sow with the seeds

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.270
of curiosity, where he
did not weed out truths,

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.310
lies and half-truths,
or that he did not water

01:18:56.310 --> 01:19:00.480
with a growing sense of
African awareness and heritage.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.560
If a book is a garden
carried in a pocket,

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.490
then Schomburg yielded
a bumper crop,

01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:10.940
blanketed Mount Kilimanjaro
with African violets.

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:15.940
If I had African
violets this morning,

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.640
I would certainly give some
to We Need Diverse Books,

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:26.420
to the judges, to my editor,
Hilary Van Dusen, my agent,

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:30.010
Rubin Pfeffer, to my family
and friends who are here

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.430
with me today, to all of
the librarians and educators

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:38.050
who use my books and other
diverse books in classrooms,

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:42.760
to last but not least,
my frequent collaborator,

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:47.850
Eric Velasquez, who
pitched this project to me.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:52.160
Schomburg, in several ways,
brings my book full circle,

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.820
as does this award ceremony.

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.680
Just as Schomburg experienced
a slight at the hands

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.020
of his fifth-grade
teacher who told him

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:03.540
that African descendants
had no history worth noting,

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.960
I was dissed by an
eighth-grade teacher.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.600
Fascinated with the
Harlem Renaissance,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.430
I wrote a research
paper on Countee Cullen

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.040
after having read
his poem Incident.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.230
I was one of only four black
students at my grade level,

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.220
at an exclusive Quaker
school in Baltimore.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.230
And I was the only
one of those four

01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.090
who had transferred
from public school.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:29.110
When I got my paper back,
the teacher had given me a B,

01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:34.140
and it offered but one
comment: did you write this.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.770
Obviously, he had
expected less of me.

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:41.160
Ever since, I have
strived to use my pen

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.020
to affirm my heritage
and culture.

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:46.400
When I was an aspiring
children's book writer,

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.530
before I had anything
published but adult poetry,

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:52.740
I studied the work
of Walter Dean Myers.

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.910
Among the mentor text that
I turned to were Brown Baby,

01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:00.820
I'm sorry, Brown Angels,
Angel to Angel, Harlem,

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.580
and One More River to Cross.

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:07.660
When I was in graduate school, I
worked on a photo essay project

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:11.830
that evolved into a children's
book, many years later.

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.380
It took 20 years to be exact.

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.860
My picture research took
me to the Schomburg Center,

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.200
to Moorland-Spingarn Research
Center at Howard University,

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.880
and to the Library
of Congress prints

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.710
and photographs department,
in this very building.

01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:30.160
I was looking for images
to accompany my poems.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.520
Instead, I found pictures
that begged for words.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.450
Some were of historic figures.

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:39.300
Others were of everyday people
whose names have been lost.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.230
I wrote poems to
give them voices.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:46.730
I began right then and there
collecting images and stories.

01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:51.810
I'm going to close with a poem
from that book that first led me

01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:55.920
to the Schomburg Center:
Remember the Bridge.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.780
Remember the bridge that
your ancestors crossed,

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.940
the sweat that was spilled
and the lives that were lost.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.120
Remember the slaves
who raised corn

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.640
and cotton keep singing
their songs

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.090
so they won't be forgotten, the
Underground Railroad that passed

01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:12.710
through at night, the
signs and conductors

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:14.830
that guided slaves' flight.

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.700
Remember the soldiers who fought
though they knew they might not

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.210
be free when the
battle was through.

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:24.960
Remember the old souls who
handed down tales, the bold men

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.920
and women who blazed their
own trails from the South

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.520
to the North, from farm
to big-city, with satchels

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.220
of dreams and no use for pity.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.680
Remember the bootblacks
who made old shoes shine,

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.130
the industrious laborers
who manned factory lines.

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:45.360
Remember the housemaids
who scrubbed dirty floors,

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.650
the leaders who spoke
out to open closed doors.

01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:51.800
Remember the hard way
the ancestors came,

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.940
snatched from the motherland
bound in iron chains.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.540
Remember the voyage,
the capture, the chase,

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.540
young warriors who vanished
without even a trace.

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:07.310
Remember the ocean much too
vast to span, long shadows

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:09.880
on shorelines and
footprints in sand.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.190
Forget not the glory of Africa's
past, the temples and riches

01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:17.660
that to this day last,
bronze baskets and mud cloth,

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:22.400
pyramids of stone, ebony
statues and bracelets of bone.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.090
The journey continues.

01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:26.620
The bridge still holds strong.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:28.570
Hands reach across water.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.680
Hearts sing a new song.

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:54.670
That posing for the picture
thing is the most awkward part,

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.510
right.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:00.000

Oh, man. Eric Velasquez.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.450
One cool thing is the children's
book writing community is small,

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.160
so we all know each other.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.460
A lot of us know each other.

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.410
A lot of us go way, way back.

01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:24.570
And when we get together, we
have a lot of catching up to do.

01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:28.190
So it was so great to
be reunited last night

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:29.660
and to be able to
gossip about all

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.130
that stuff we didn't
get a chance to talk

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:34.570
about and to catch up.

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:38.940
And I want to make a point about
the importance of picture books.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.200
I feel like when
I read Schomburg,

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.850
I learned so much
that I didn't know.

01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:47.230
And I think sometimes we
think picture books are

01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:48.540
for young people.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:53.510

everyone, so.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.390
And they're a great way to
teach about the narrative arc.

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:02.600
They're a great way
to teach poetry.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.310
So many of the forms
are so poetic.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:13.530
So get these books into the
hands of writers of all ages.

01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:17.260

important and world changing.

That's so funny.

You know, people born in Harlem
are so the real thing to me.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.540
So I was always so
jealous of black people

01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.090

three letters as Harlem.

So we'll give you pass on that.

01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:12.730
But his work is mind blowing,
and he is mind blowing.

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:15.080
And I'm so glad to
share the stage with him

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.510
and present him with this award.

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.430
There is a lot of you in here.

01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:38.880
Okay. Well, I have my speech.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.060
Okay. I wanted to start with,
for those that didn't see,

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.580
the video that I recorded

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:50.480
for the We Need Diverse
Books Organization, my wish.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.540
And my wish is that
in my lifetime,

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:57.890
we'll replace this word,
"diversity," especially

01:26:57.890 --> 01:27:01.630
in books, with the
word "normal."

01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:06.470
It's a simple concept, you know.

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.340
Because diversity in my
house didn't really exist.

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:11.540
I grew up in a Spanish-speaking
household,

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:14.600
but we went to the movies
to see American films

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.210
that spoke English, watch
Spanish speaking television,

01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:18.850
listen to salsa music,

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:21.060
but we also listened
to the Temptations.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.170
So it was like, you
mean diversity is

01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:27.940
like everything,
but that's my life.

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:33.350
So that's my wish for all
of you, lots of normal.

01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:38.220
Okay. Now to my thanks you-s.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.330
So I want to thank the We Need
Diverse Book Organization,

01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:47.700
as well as the Walter
Award judging committee,

I would also like to thank

Rachel Smith for their hard work

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.270
and dedication to this project,

and to the public relations
team, including Phoebe Kosman

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.860
for their tireless efforts.

To master author Carole
Boston Weatherford,

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:26.430
thank you for writing
a glorious manuscript.

01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:29.200
You truly outdid
yourself with this one,

I want to thank the love of
my life, Elizabeth Rosario,

not only for posing as
Elizabeth and Phillis Wheatley,

but also for the
love and support,

[ Applause ]

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.750
Okay. I first became aware

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:03.670
of Arturo Alfonso
Schomburg in the third grade.

01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:08.210
My teacher, Ms. Holmes, kept
a poster of Arturo Schomburg

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:11.120
on her classroom wall,
along with posters

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.290
of Martin Luther King Jr.,
Malcom X and Marcus Garvey,

01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:17.780
that Marcus Garvey
poster with the cute,

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.610
the really cool, you know.

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:23.070
He had the uniform
with the -- Yeah.

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:29.430
But what a gift the day she
said to me that Arturo Schomburg

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:32.320
and I shared something
in common,

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.450
that we both had
roots in Puerto Rico.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:39.950
And as she continued with a
brief talk on Arturo Schomburg,

01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:44.220
for the first time in my life, I
found a hero that looked like me

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:46.250
and that I can identify with.

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:49.740
I could not wait to get
home and ask my grandma

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:53.380
if she knew this great man
responsible for the library

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.640
on 135th Street in Harlem.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.810
[Foreign language
spoken], I asked thinking

01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:08.930
that I would just throw
her off with the name.

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.230
[Foreign language spoken].

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:12.510
Of course, that man
was a genius.

01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:19.090
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:22.250
The same place we come from.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.830
However, aside from
Schomburg's collection of books

01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:31.040
and artifacts, she didn't
know much more about the man;

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.860
37 years later, while

01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.390
at the Schomburg Center
attending a performance

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:38.750
of the last poets with Elizabeth

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:42.590
and her good friend Sheena
[assumed spelling], Sheena turns

01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:44.560
to me and says, you know,

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.690
there are no children's
books on Arturo Schomburg.

01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:51.560
You know, you ought to
think about doing that book.

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.190
Suddenly, I realized that
this was the handsome man

01:30:57.190 --> 01:31:01.260
in that poster that I would
stare at day after day

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:05.910
in third grade, that genius that
my grandmother talked about.

01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:07.860
Wait, wait.

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:12.470
I contacted Carol
immediately and asked her

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:15.000
to write me a manuscript
on Schomburg.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.160
That was 2006.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.400
We submitted the project to
several publishing houses

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.170
and we were rejected everywhere.

01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:33.270
This is just a story about
a man who collected books.

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:34.600
He's so boring.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.180
Jazz him up a little
bit, you know.

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:41.430
Well, it didn't happen then.

01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:45.590
In 2014, our now
agent, Rubin Pfeffer,

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:48.030
decided to give it another try.

01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:53.780
And after a lot of work, a new
manuscript and new sketches,

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:56.190
Schomburg, the man
who built a library,

01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:59.310
found a home at Candlewick
Press.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.390
What a journey.

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:04.680
However, it was through
Carol's brilliant words

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.010
that I truly discovered
Schomburg's genius

01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:10.540
and his gift to all of us.

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:14.030
This project has changed
my life in so many ways.

hospital, didn't I.

great, great grandson.

know, the first Latino.

Why does it say Latino?

over with the judges and
have a photo with the judges.

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.100
Then, they will go over
and they will be signing.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.910
I have strict orders.

01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:33.860
They're just going to be
signing and no photos.

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.160
And I'm sorry about that.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.460
But we want them to have
time to enjoy themselves,

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.970
because they certainly
earned it.

01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:42.270
So thank you all.

01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.680
You've been a wonderful
audience.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.910
And thank you very much to
the Library of Congress.

01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:47.710
Thank you.

01:38:47.710 --> 01:38:52.510
[ Applause ]

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:56.160
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
