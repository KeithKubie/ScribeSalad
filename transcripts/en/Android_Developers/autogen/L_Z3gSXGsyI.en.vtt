let's go back to the slides and check

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.660
let's go back to the slides and check
 

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.650
let's go back to the slides and check
out how this relates to app patterns

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:44.660
out how this relates to app patterns
 

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.360
out how this relates to app patterns
so material design for apps is something

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:47.370
so material design for apps is something

and we're really excited what this will

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120
and we're really excited what this will
 

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.240
and we're really excited what this will
do for app developers so with Android

two-dimensional space users could scroll

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.150
two-dimensional space users could scroll
 

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.000
two-dimensional space users could scroll
down they could scroll up they could

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.010
down they could scroll up they could
 

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.010
down they could scroll up they could
scroll left they could scroll right that

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.020

had a lot of power but we found that

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:05.970
had a lot of power but we found that
 

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.000
had a lot of power but we found that
just a little too often users would get

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.010
just a little too often users would get
 

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.650
just a little too often users would get
a little confused where should I go next

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660

to get more content to get more action
 

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.540
to get more content to get more action
so we've doubled down on the concept of

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:14.550
so we've doubled down on the concept of
 

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.730
so we've doubled down on the concept of
a vertical layout where users start out

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740
a vertical layout where users start out
 

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.440
a vertical layout where users start out
anchored at the top so they always know

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:18.450
anchored at the top so they always know
 

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.510
anchored at the top so they always know

can add a wearable action George at the

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380
can add a wearable action George at the
 

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.080
can add a wearable action George at the
bottom and when the user reaches the

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.090
bottom and when the user reaches the

scroll directions this this component

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620
scroll directions this this component
 

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.010
scroll directions this this component
can peek into view and if you have a

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.020
can peek into view and if you have a
 

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.110
can peek into view and if you have a
more complicated app that has you know

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120
more complicated app that has you know
 

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.030
more complicated app that has you know
multiple views that are necessary to

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040
multiple views that are necessary to
 

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.010
multiple views that are necessary to
render in it you can add a wearable

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.020
render in it you can add a wearable
 

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.320
render in it you can add a wearable
navigation drawer to the top of the app

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:15.330
navigation drawer to the top of the app
 

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.360
navigation drawer to the top of the app
that peeks in when the user reaches the

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.370
that peeks in when the user reaches the
 

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.750
that peeks in when the user reaches the
top so the main benefit of this is that

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760
top so the main benefit of this is that
 

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.420
top so the main benefit of this is that
the relatively small screen of a wear

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:23.430
the relatively small screen of a wear
 

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.580
the relatively small screen of a wear
device is maximized by having the

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:25.590
device is maximized by having the
 

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.650
device is maximized by having the
content be front and center and then

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660
content be front and center and then
 

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.360
content be front and center and then
actions are available just off the

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.370
actions are available just off the
 

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.160
actions are available just off the
screen and navigation is available just

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.170
screen and navigation is available just
 

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.050
screen and navigation is available just
off the screen so let's let's take a

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060
off the screen so let's let's take a
 

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.580
off the screen so let's let's take a
look at this from the end users point of

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:34.590
look at this from the end users point of
 

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.190
look at this from the end users point of
view so here's a user scrolling down in

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200
view so here's a user scrolling down in
 

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.160
view so here's a user scrolling down in
an app and they reach the bottom and the

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.170
an app and they reach the bottom and the
 

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.680
an app and they reach the bottom and the
drawer is right there for them to grab

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:41.690
drawer is right there for them to grab
 

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.200
drawer is right there for them to grab
and we'll loop that around again so they

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.210
and we'll loop that around again so they
 

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.000
and we'll loop that around again so they
scroll down they either change scroll

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.010
scroll down they either change scroll
 

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.590
scroll down they either change scroll
direction or reach the bottom and the

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600
direction or reach the bottom and the
 

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.060
direction or reach the bottom and the
drawer is there and there's a primary

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.070
drawer is there and there's a primary
 

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.240
drawer is there and there's a primary
action there that they could

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.250
action there that they could
 

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.010
action there that they could
tapped if that's what they wanted but if

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.020
tapped if that's what they wanted but if
 

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.360
tapped if that's what they wanted but if
they want to explore more actions they

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.370
they want to explore more actions they
 

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.450
they want to explore more actions they
just drag that drawer up let's look at

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.460
just drag that drawer up let's look at
 

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.220
just drag that drawer up let's look at
the navigation drawer and we'll wait for

00:12:59.220 --> 00:12:59.230
the navigation drawer and we'll wait for
 

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.250
the navigation drawer and we'll wait for
this animation come around one more time

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.260
this animation come around one more time
 

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.500
this animation come around one more time
and so here's the user at the top of

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:04.510
and so here's the user at the top of
 

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.240
and so here's the user at the top of
their app and they drag down for their

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.250
their app and they drag down for their
 

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.620
their app and they drag down for their
navigation drawer and they can change

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:07.630
navigation drawer and they can change
 

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.750
navigation drawer and they can change
views watch this one more time for

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760
views watch this one more time for
 

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760
views watch this one more time for
clarity they dragged down there in their

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:11.770
clarity they dragged down there in their
 

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.200
clarity they dragged down there in their
navigation drawer and they can change

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.210
navigation drawer and they can change
 

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.410
navigation drawer and they can change
views so now that we've talked about

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:16.420
views so now that we've talked about
 

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.060
views so now that we've talked about
layout and functionality let's talk a

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.070
layout and functionality let's talk a
 

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.460
layout and functionality let's talk a
little bit about aesthetics Android wear

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.470
little bit about aesthetics Android wear
 

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.490
little bit about aesthetics Android wear
wand auto apps have generally taken

wand auto apps have generally taken
 

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.800
wand auto apps have generally taken
their design cues from handset which

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:25.810
their design cues from handset which
 

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.000
their design cues from handset which
generally means bright white apps and we

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.010
generally means bright white apps and we
 

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.770
generally means bright white apps and we
think this is this is great but we want

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:31.780
think this is this is great but we want
 

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.300
think this is this is great but we want
to make something that's really specific

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.310
to make something that's really specific
 

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.190
to make something that's really specific
for wearables and that means that we're

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200
for wearables and that means that we're
 

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.930
for wearables and that means that we're
recommending that all apps develop a

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:36.940
recommending that all apps develop a
 

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.060
recommending that all apps develop a
dark app a dark color palette there's

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.070
dark app a dark color palette there's
 

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.430
dark app a dark color palette there's
two big benefits for this one is that

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440
two big benefits for this one is that
 

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.290
two big benefits for this one is that
OLED displays are actually very powerful

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:46.300
OLED displays are actually very powerful
 

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.790
OLED displays are actually very powerful
on Android wear devices and they're very

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800
on Android wear devices and they're very
 

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.580
on Android wear devices and they're very
popular and OLED displays consume a lot

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:50.590
popular and OLED displays consume a lot
 

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.460
popular and OLED displays consume a lot
less power when they're set to emit less

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:53.470
less power when they're set to emit less
 

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.530
less power when they're set to emit less
light so if you choose if you have a

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:55.540
light so if you choose if you have a
 

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.240
light so if you choose if you have a
light a white light less light less

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.250
light a white light less light less
 

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.950
light a white light less light less
light emitting you'll you'll save the

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:01.960
light emitting you'll you'll save the
 

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.260
light emitting you'll you'll save the
user power the other main benefit is

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:06.270
user power the other main benefit is
 

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.340

social appropriateness there's just a

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.350
social appropriateness there's just a
 

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.110
social appropriateness there's just a
lot of contexts where emitting a lot of

lot of contexts where emitting a lot of
 

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.510

light is just not good design so if

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:12.520
light is just not good design so if

having to bring their phone so they get
 

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:58.960
having to bring their phone so they get
faster times and this is also really

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:58.970
faster times and this is also really
 

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.220
faster times and this is also really
going to dramatically change the

and that's because we're going to be
 

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.290
and that's because we're going to be
able to bring a more Android development

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.300
able to bring a more Android development
 

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.819

here's how it used to work if the watch

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.130
here's how it used to work if the watch
 

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.680
here's how it used to work if the watch
needed some data from the cloud it would

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:17.690
needed some data from the cloud it would
 

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.750
needed some data from the cloud it would
start with a request to the phone then

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:19.760
start with a request to the phone then
 

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.100
start with a request to the phone then
the phone would get the data from the

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.110
the phone would get the data from the
 

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.439
the phone would get the data from the
cloud download it put it back in the

00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:23.449
cloud download it put it back in the
 

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:24.939
cloud download it put it back in the
wearable data layer take it over to the

00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:24.949
wearable data layer take it over to the
 

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:26.470
wearable data layer take it over to the
watch and the watch could then display

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480
watch and the watch could then display
 

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.939
watch and the watch could then display
it well with standalone apps you'll be

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:30.949
it well with standalone apps you'll be
 

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.230
it well with standalone apps you'll be
able to use the network connection

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240
able to use the network connection
 

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.199
able to use the network connection
directly on the watch so you'll be able

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:35.209
directly on the watch so you'll be able
 

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:38.350
directly on the watch so you'll be able
to use HTTP TCP UDP whatever you want

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360
to use HTTP TCP UDP whatever you want
 

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.579
to use HTTP TCP UDP whatever you want
and you don't have to worry about

00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:39.589
and you don't have to worry about
 

00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:42.100
and you don't have to worry about
whether that device has a Wi-Fi or

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.110
whether that device has a Wi-Fi or
 

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.500
whether that device has a Wi-Fi or
cellular radio because no matter what

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.510
cellular radio because no matter what
 

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.449
cellular radio because no matter what
we'll still be able to if we need to

00:16:46.449 --> 00:16:46.459
we'll still be able to if we need to
 

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:50.559
we'll still be able to if we need to
proxy the network from the phone and so

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:50.569
proxy the network from the phone and so
 

00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:52.120
proxy the network from the phone and so
you'll be able to take all the

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.130
you'll be able to take all the
 

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.590
you'll be able to take all the
development patterns that you know from

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600
development patterns that you know from
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.559
development patterns that you know from
Android phone a tablet development use

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:56.569

so if you get a notification from an app

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:57.500
so if you get a notification from an app
 

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.320
so if you get a notification from an app
it appears in both places if you take

00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.330
it appears in both places if you take
 

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.149
it appears in both places if you take
action on either of those places it's

00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159
action on either of those places it's
 

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:03.610
action on either of those places it's
reflected in the other and of course if

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:03.620
reflected in the other and of course if
 

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.870

you dismiss from one place it's gone

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880
you dismiss from one place it's gone
 

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.899
you dismiss from one place it's gone
from the other as well and that has been

achieved in the past with notification

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:09.289
achieved in the past with notification

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.040
having to worry about what operating
 

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.860
having to worry about what operating

look super important considering this is
something we wear so and then the

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:21.530
something we wear so and then the
 

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.770
something we wear so and then the
interactivity applies that API is that

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.780
interactivity applies that API is that

we added last year really made the watch

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:26.780
we added last year really made the watch
 

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.350
we added last year really made the watch
face a tool so it's not just for showing

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360
face a tool so it's not just for showing
 

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.570
face a tool so it's not just for showing
data it's for interaction as well and so

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:31.580
data it's for interaction as well and so
 

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.010
data it's for interaction as well and so
we wanted to take that and bring it to

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.020
we wanted to take that and bring it to
 

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.070
we wanted to take that and bring it to
all the apps that run on Android wear so

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080
all the apps that run on Android wear so
 

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.630
all the apps that run on Android wear so
imagine if all the apps could

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
imagine if all the apps could
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.910
imagine if all the apps could
participate in on the watch face show

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:39.920
participate in on the watch face show
 

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.310
participate in on the watch face show
information and then generate those user

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320
information and then generate those user
 

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.350
information and then generate those user
experiences so we're adding this

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360
experiences so we're adding this
 

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.430
experiences so we're adding this
complications API and Android web 2.0 so

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440
complications API and Android web 2.0 so
 

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.830
complications API and Android web 2.0 so
the term complications comes from

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840
the term complications comes from
 

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.900
the term complications comes from
traditional watch making and it refers

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:52.910
traditional watch making and it refers
 

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.690
traditional watch making and it refers
to any informative element on the watch

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:55.700
to any informative element on the watch
 

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.860
to any informative element on the watch
face that's not just telling you the

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:56.870
face that's not just telling you the
 

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.020
face that's not just telling you the
time so on traditional watch faces this

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.030
time so on traditional watch faces this
 

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.090
time so on traditional watch faces this
could tell you the day of the week or

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.100
could tell you the day of the week or
 

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.070
could tell you the day of the week or
the day of the month when your alarms

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080
the day of the month when your alarms
 

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.270
the day of the month when your alarms
gonna go off or maybe that phases of the

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.280
gonna go off or maybe that phases of the
 

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.010
gonna go off or maybe that phases of the
Moon yeah if you're a werewolf hunter

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.020
Moon yeah if you're a werewolf hunter
 

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.340
Moon yeah if you're a werewolf hunter
very important so and we think for

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:12.350
very important so and we think for
 

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.750
very important so and we think for
smartwatches they should be able to do

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760
smartwatches they should be able to do
 

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.460
smartwatches they should be able to do
Smart Watch II things these

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:15.470
Smart Watch II things these
 

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.110
Smart Watch II things these
complications so they should tell you

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120
complications so they should tell you
 

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.090
complications so they should tell you
Smart Watch types of data like how many

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.100
Smart Watch types of data like how many
 

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.650
Smart Watch types of data like how many
steps you've taken how many calories

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:20.660
steps you've taken how many calories
 

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.630
steps you've taken how many calories
maybe you've eaten if you have incoming

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640
maybe you've eaten if you have incoming
 

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.760
maybe you've eaten if you have incoming
messages and of course they should also

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:24.770
messages and of course they should also
 

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.820
messages and of course they should also
react to touch so touching that

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:27.830
react to touch so touching that
 

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.230
react to touch so touching that
notification should drive me to an

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240
notification should drive me to an
 

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.760
notification should drive me to an
experience where I can then act on it

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:30.770
experience where I can then act on it
 

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.110
experience where I can then act on it
and so the complications API is a API

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120
and so the complications API is a API
 

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.940
and so the complications API is a API
for data providers and watch face

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:36.950
for data providers and watch face
 

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.730
for data providers and watch face
developers and it lets the two work

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:39.740
developers and it lets the two work
 

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.650
developers and it lets the two work
together to provide both form and

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.660
together to provide both form and
 

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.720
together to provide both form and
function to the watch face and there's

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:43.730
function to the watch face and there's
 

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.040
function to the watch face and there's
no need for them to know anything about

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.050
no need for them to know anything about
 

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.030
no need for them to know anything about
each other in advance

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:46.040
each other in advance
 

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.920

a existing watch face so they already

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.090
a existing watch face so they already
 

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.970
a existing watch face so they already
shipped and they've upgraded it to use

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:38.980

of the complication API and you can see

00:25:59.340 --> 00:25:59.350
of the complication API and you can see
 

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.570
of the complication API and you can see
that it makes obvious reference to

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:00.580
that it makes obvious reference to
 

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.690
that it makes obvious reference to
mechanical watch faces and of course it

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:03.700
mechanical watch faces and of course it
 

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.840
mechanical watch faces and of course it
has that classic looking dial

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:05.850

this up to a ranged value type then

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760
this up to a ranged value type then
 

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.730
this up to a ranged value type then
maybe as it gets warmer outside it'd get

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:32.740
maybe as it gets warmer outside it'd get
 

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.130
maybe as it gets warmer outside it'd get
the watch face gets redder our watches

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:35.140
the watch face gets redder our watches
 

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.140
the watch face gets redder our watches
were red yeah yes our watches were red

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:37.150
were red yeah yes our watches were red

all day yesterday and I think my face
 

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.670
all day yesterday and I think my face
may have gotten redder and this on to

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:40.680
may have gotten redder and this on to
 

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.030
may have gotten redder and this on to
alright so watch face is 2.0 it's a it's

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.040
alright so watch face is 2.0 it's a it's
 

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.820

actually because the messaging app has
 

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.130
actually because the messaging app has
marked the conversation as red because

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:00.140
marked the conversation as red because
 

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.540

you'll be able to make watch faces and
 

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.430
you'll be able to make watch faces and
when users download install them they'll

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440
when users download install them they'll
 

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.560
when users download install them they'll
be ready to go for when users want to

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:56.570
be ready to go for when users want to
 

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.590
be ready to go for when users want to
type and so now I've sent my message I

00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600
type and so now I've sent my message I
 

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.270
type and so now I've sent my message I
see it appear right on the card and the

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:01.280
see it appear right on the card and the
 

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.400
see it appear right on the card and the
card doesn't go away and this happens

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:03.410
card doesn't go away and this happens
 

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.930
card doesn't go away and this happens
for two reasons the first is we're using

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:04.940
for two reasons the first is we're using
 

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.940
for two reasons the first is we're using
the new messaging style for

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:06.950
the new messaging style for
 

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.440
the new messaging style for
notifications that's been out of android

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:08.450
notifications that's been out of android
 

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.650
notifications that's been out of android
and is also on Android wear 2.0 and

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:11.660
and is also on Android wear 2.0 and
 

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.900
and is also on Android wear 2.0 and
that's going to allow the UI to take

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:13.910
that's going to allow the UI to take
 

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.280
that's going to allow the UI to take
that reply and just put it right in the

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:15.290
that reply and just put it right in the
 

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.840
that reply and just put it right in the
card it knows where to put it because of

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:16.850
card it knows where to put it because of
 

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.850
card it knows where to put it because of
the clearly defined semantics of the

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:18.860
the clearly defined semantics of the
 

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.120
the clearly defined semantics of the
message and also we're asking developers

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.130
message and also we're asking developers
 

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.300
message and also we're asking developers
not to retract messages until they know

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.310
not to retract messages until they know
 

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.340
not to retract messages until they know
that the user has dismissed them and we

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.350
that the user has dismissed them and we
 

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.270
that the user has dismissed them and we
think that that's going to create

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.280
think that that's going to create
 

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.100
think that that's going to create
longer running conversational experience

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.110
longer running conversational experience
 

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.980
longer running conversational experience
and in general notifications on where

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:32.990
and in general notifications on where
 

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.690
and in general notifications on where
2.0 are going to be a lot more like they

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:34.700
2.0 are going to be a lot more like they
 

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.210
2.0 are going to be a lot more like they
are on phones and tablets on a phone or

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.220
are on phones and tablets on a phone or
 

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.650
are on phones and tablets on a phone or
a tablet you have this expectation that

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:38.660
a tablet you have this expectation that
 

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.170
a tablet you have this expectation that
if you swipe down on the shade and you

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:41.180
if you swipe down on the shade and you
 

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.970
if you swipe down on the shade and you
touch a notification you get to an

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:42.980
touch a notification you get to an
 

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.830
touch a notification you get to an
experience that you know for the app

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840
experience that you know for the app
 

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.540
experience that you know for the app
that submitted the notification you get

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:46.550
that submitted the notification you get
 

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.190
that submitted the notification you get
to a part of that app where you can then

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200
to a part of that app where you can then
 

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.640
to a part of that app where you can then
act on whatever you've seen and we want

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:51.650
act on whatever you've seen and we want
 

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.110
act on whatever you've seen and we want
that to work the same for Android wear

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120
that to work the same for Android wear
 

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.450
that to work the same for Android wear
so we're asking developers to set the

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.460
so we're asking developers to set the
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.610
so we're asking developers to set the
content intent to drive users back to

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:57.620
content intent to drive users back to
 

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.520
content intent to drive users back to
your carefully crafted experiences now

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:00.530
your carefully crafted experiences now
 

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.110
your carefully crafted experiences now
if you're using notification bridging

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120
if you're using notification bridging
 

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.600
if you're using notification bridging
what happens so in this case there isn't

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:04.610
what happens so in this case there isn't
 

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.540
what happens so in this case there isn't
an app on the watch but we have a

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:07.550
an app on the watch but we have a
 

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.610
an app on the watch but we have a
solution so we decided to make a great

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:09.620
solution so we decided to make a great
 

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.040
solution so we decided to make a great
expanded notification experience and

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.050
expanded notification experience and
 

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.990
expanded notification experience and
this works for all notifications when

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000
this works for all notifications when
 

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.580
this works for all notifications when
you touch a notification you launch into

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:15.590
you touch a notification you launch into
 

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.340
you touch a notification you launch into
it and it kind of stands in for the app

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:18.350
it and it kind of stands in for the app
 

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.420
it and it kind of stands in for the app
and for messaging especially we're able

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:22.430
and for messaging especially we're able
 

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.850
and for messaging especially we're able
to present an experience that's a lot

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:24.860
to present an experience that's a lot
 

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.960

like the best of what we see in
 

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.110
like the best of what we see in
messaging apps so because of all the

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120
messaging apps so because of all the
 

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.030
messaging apps so because of all the
data you add in your messaging style for

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.040
data you add in your messaging style for
 

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.410

in in the right place and we've also
added a smart replies API that lets

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:38.780
added a smart replies API that lets
 

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.530
