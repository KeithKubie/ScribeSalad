00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Astonishingly, the mass of the spacecraft is not important at all.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Imagine that you have 2 spacecrafts going along the same trajectory.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You could join these to form a spacecraft of twice the mass,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that would still follow the same trajectory.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the mass is of no importance--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the mass of the spacecraft, that is.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The size of the moon.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, we should not be hitting the moon,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but otherwise the size of the moon is not of importance.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The motion of the moon, however, is of vital importance.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We have to take care that the rocket is fired into empty space

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the moon eventually appears in the right place.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The size of the earth is of vital importance

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to get close to the surface as we return.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The motion of the earth around the sun isn't that vital.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And should we be treating this as a 3-dimensional problem?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Imagine the earth as a sphere and the moon as a sphere,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the trajectory takes us around earth,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
around the moon and back.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This looks very 3 dimensional

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
should we be dealing with xyz coordinates.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Actually, however, this trajectory is mostly in a plane.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you look at that motion from above,

00:01:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we see planar motion, and it's almost okay to treat this trajectory in a 2D fashion.
