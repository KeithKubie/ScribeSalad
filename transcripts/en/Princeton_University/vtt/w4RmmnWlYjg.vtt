TANYARADZWA TAWENGWA:
So Umqombothi

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.660
is an African a capella group.


00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.600
I founded it my freshman year.


00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.000
And it was really just
motivated because I thought,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.840
I love singing.


00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.760
And I was coming from
an international school.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760
And I came to Princeton.


00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.260
And I love the a
capella groups that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.410
were shown at Tiger's Roar.


00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.010
But I said something's missing.


00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.300
We need to add
something in the mix.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.000
A little spice.


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.140
And so Umqombothi is an
African a capella group.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:52.090
[SINGING]


00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.650
TOLA EMIOLA: We come in.


00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.330
We figure out what songs we're
going to be performing next,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.440
and try to go through
them, teach new members who

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.310
don't know the songs.


00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.020
We teach them those songs.


00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.160
And, yeah, we just basically
stand in a little arch

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.700
the whole time, and
we sing together.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.860
[SINGING]


00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.930
TOLA EMIOLA: It's a
really fun loving group.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.800
And they have a lot of
fun when they perform.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.810
They incorporate different
types of performance.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.890
They dance at performance.


00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.600
There's drumming.


00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300
There's just so much
heart in the group.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.080
So I just wanted to
be a part of that.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.710
TANYARADZWA TAWENGWA:
The most beautiful thing

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.060
about Umqombothi is when
Umqombothi is not just us,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.020
but it's a community.


00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.850
And it's a community
of people, where people

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.120
come into our space and amidst
the stress and the weight

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.790
of Princeton, they
come in where there's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.680
a performance and arch sing,
or even just a release party.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.090
You see people shake
loose, break free,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.960
and have a good time.


00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.060
That's the ethos that
I wanted in the group.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.720
And it's so beautiful
to see that spirit

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.640
really manifesting itself in
terms of people even outside

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.380
of the group.


00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.320
I think that's the
most beautiful.
