00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] During
the American Revolution,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.730
everyone became a little
bit of a philosopher.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.480
Walking down the street in Boston

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.630
past coffee houses and taverns,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.720
you might hear ordinary
people debating equality

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.420
and natural rights.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.300
Before it was even a political revolution,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.250
the American Revolution
was a revolution of ideas.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.670
You see these ideas
all over the literature

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.020
of the time period,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.570
perhaps most famously in
Thomas Jefferson's language

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.630
in the Declaration that
all men are created equal,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.900
endowed with certain unalienable rights,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.820
the idea that everyone
has the natural right

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.080
to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.520
You would see it in the most famous slogan

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.660
of the revolution, no taxation
without representation,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.380
the idea that the people would have a say

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.210
in the laws that affect them.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.740
The revolution even went so far

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.450
as to criticize the idea of monarchy,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.860
which pamphleteer Thomas
Paine called absurd.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.520
These ideas criticized
long-standing social norms

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.370
about who deserved to rule

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.940
versus who deserved to be ruled.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.410
It's likely that most of the founders

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.370
thought these ideas primarily applied

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.590
to the political struggle

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.090
between the colonies and Great Britain,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.780
but it wasn't just elite white men

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.670
who considered these radical notions

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.440
and thought about how to
apply them to their own lives.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.850
These revolutionary ideals
increased the awareness

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.910
of inequalities in society more broadly

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.580
and caused some people to call for changes

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.570
in voting rights, in the
institution of slavery,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.040
and the status of women.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.110
One major change that the
revolutionary ideals caused

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.200
was an expansion of political democracy

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.790
in state governments.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.390
So after the revolution,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
all the states wrote new constitutions.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.300
And every one of them

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.650
instituted a representative government

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.830
through an elected legislature.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.910
And almost all of them also reduced

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.870
the property requirements for
voting and office-holding,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.500
which previously had limited the franchise

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.620
to wealthier white men.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.150
After the revolution,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.220
a majority of white men
had the right to vote.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.200
And voting rights would continue to expand

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.883
until all white men had the
right to vote by the 1830s.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.740
In fact, some state
constitutions, like New Jersey's,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.530
didn't specify who could vote,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.390
so long as they met the new
lower property requirements.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.240
So between the revolution and 1807

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.480
when they changed the law,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.050
property-owning women and free
people of color could vote.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.200
Another social change that was brought on

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.760
by these revolutionary
ideals was the emergence

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.330
of the abolition movement to
end the practice of slavery.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.150
So almost all of the
founders were slave owners,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.770
and they didn't seem to
notice any contradiction

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.590
between the idea that
all men are created equal

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.460
and keeping Africans in perpetual bondage.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.620
But that did not mean that
others missed the connection.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.480
During the revolution itself,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.270
many enslaved people escaped,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.890
filed petitions for freedom,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.300
or they joined the
military to gain freedom

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.260
on the side of the Americans,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.870
but more frequently on
the side of the British

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.840
who offered freedom in exchange
for serving in the army.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.700
After the revolution,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.960
northern states either abolished slavery,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.110
or they began a process
of gradual emancipation,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.070
so saying that enslaved people

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.880
who were children might remain in slavery

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.080
until they were in their mid to late 20s

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.680
and then would be free, and
their children would be free,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.870
so that over the course of the late 1800s

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.090
and early 1900s, in most northern states,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.750
slavery was either entirely eliminated

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.750
or phased out to the point

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.670
that there was a very
small enslaved population.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.990
Southern states did not abolish slavery

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.910
in response to the revolution,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.610
and this would continue to
expand sectional tensions

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.870
between the north and the
south until the Civil War.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.260
The last change in social values

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.330
that I wanna discuss relates
to women's role in the war.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.840
Women played a pretty crucial role

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.270
in supporting the independence movement,

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.870
and they also drew on the rhetoric

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.020
of revolutionary ideas

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.700
to support their claims for
an improvement in status.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.160
Abigail Adams, who was
the wife of John Adams,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.080
wrote to him while he was
in Philadelphia working

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.710
on the draft of the
Declaration of Independence

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.140
with Thomas Jefferson and others.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.730
She wrote, in the new Code of Laws

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.070
which I suppose it will be
necessary for you to make,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.820
I desire you would remember the ladies

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.760
and be more generous and favorable

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.780
to them than your ancestors.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.440
If particular care and
attention is not paid

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.650
to the ladies, we are
determined to foment a rebellion

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.210
and will not hold ourselves bound

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.890
by any laws in which we have
no voice or representation.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.480
In general, the revolution didn't result

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.250
in a huge change of status for white women

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.730
and none at all for enslaved women,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.500
but one idea did emerge that
would foment social change

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.070
farther down the line,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.420
and that was the idea of
republican motherhood.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.220
So republican motherhood was the notion

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.220
that for this new democratic
American nation to work,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.560
the country was going to
need virtuous citizens.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.280
And who taught men how
to be virtuous citizens?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.370
Their mothers.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.500
So thinkers of the time period,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.990
particularly a Philadelphia physician

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.560
and singer of the
Declaration of Independence

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.290
named Benjamin Rush,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.130
argued that women should
receive more robust education

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.460
in order to better educate their sons.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.960
So instead of only learning
household skills or etiquette,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.900
women should learn
philosophy and mathematics.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.840
Now, while this concept
was mainly in the service

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.080
of improving the education
and virtue of men,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.330
it did result in the
expansion of women's education

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.090
and the founding of new
schools and colleges for girls.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.140
And many of the girls who
attended those schools would go on

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.850
to be major reformers and activists

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.690
in the women's rights and
abolitionist movements

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.140
in the 19th century.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.060
I wanna finish by just
briefly taking a look

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.300
at John Adams' response
to his wife's letter

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.700
encouraging hin to remember the ladies,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.510
which is not nearly as
famous as her letter,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.640
but I think still tells us a lot

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.310
about the ideas of the time period.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.930
He said, as to your
extraordinary Code of Laws,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.610
I cannot but laugh.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.450
We have been told that our
struggle has loosened the bands

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.720
of government everywhere,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.600
that children and
apprentices were disobedient,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.300
that schools and colleges
were grown turbulent,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.180
that Indians slighted their guardians

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.080
and Negroes grew insolent
to their masters,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.300
but your letter was the first intimation

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.040
that another tribe more
numerous and powerful

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.440
than all the rest were grown discontented.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.730
And there at the end
he's referring to women.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.270
You can tell that John
kinda takes this as a joke.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.640
He can't imagine that the ideas

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.350
that he and the other
founders used so persuasively

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.980
in the American Revolution
would lead women

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.490
and African-Americans

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.680
and working class people like apprentices

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.460
to apply those same notions to themselves.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.070
But perhaps the joke was
on John Adams after all,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.153
because that is exactly what they did.
