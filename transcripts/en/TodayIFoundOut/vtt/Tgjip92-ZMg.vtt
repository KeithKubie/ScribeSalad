00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:11.929
Although 
generally in Australia, Canada, England and

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.759
Wales, Scotland, the U.S. and New Zealand
you cannot be subjected to a second trial

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.660
after a first has been completed, there are
exceptions.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.470
What is Double Jeopardy?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.711
Generally speaking, double jeopardy prohibits
a second trial where a criminal defendant

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:32.150
has been acquitted (autrefois acquit), convicted
(autrefois convict) or pardoned in a first.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.150
This would not apply to such cases as depicted
in the 1999 film Double Jeopardy.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.200
Without giving away too much of the plot,
in the film, they claimed she would get off

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.920
scot-free if she killed her husband again
after being convicted of killing him before.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.750
This is not correct as these would be two
separate crimes, not to mention in separate

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.750
states.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.670
It just so happened she was wrongly convicted
of the first.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.600
In other words, if a person robs a store and
is convicted of it, then later robs the same

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.920
store, even with every detail of the crime
identical down to the clerk working and what

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.120
was stolen, the person can be tried again.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.360
It’s very obviously still a separate crime.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.720
(So in this case one of the core plot points
of the film turns out to be based on a false-premise,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.680
not unlike the 2014 film Lucy where the protagonist
ultimately accesses the “other 90%” of

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.460
her brain and develops superpowers from it…
in truth, you actually use 100% of your brain

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740
already.)

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.020
In any event, the idea of double jeopardy
arose naturally in the English common law

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.979
as early jurists realized the “anxiety and
insecurity” that ensued when people were

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.340
tried multiple times for a single crime.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.060
Although this still remains a concern, and
the continued justification for the rule,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.280
in many jurisdictions, there are ways in which
a person can be tried twice for the same offense.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
The United States

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.710
The United States retains very strong prohibitions
against double jeopardy, although given its

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.080
system of federalism (where the federal and
state government may have overlapping criminal

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.959
laws), criminal defendants may be tried in
both state and federal courts for the exact

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.590
same criminal act.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.680
This idea, first expounded in U.S. v. Lanza
(1922), is now known as the dual sovereignty

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.909
doctrine.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.780
In addition, if a trial is begun, but it does
not end in judgment (guilty, innocent or acquitted),

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.120
the criminal defendant can often be retried.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.799
This often arises in cases where a jury cannot
reach a decision (a hung jury), and a mistrial

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.980
is declared.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980
Canada

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.560
Unlike the U.S., in Canada, the provinces
have no authority to make criminal laws, so

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.980
as a result, only one jurisdiction, its federal
government, prosecutes crimes.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.989
Not recognizing the concept of dual sovereignty,
at least according to some experts, Canada

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.209
applies double jeopardy even to prosecutions
that have occurred in other countries.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.209
Canada’s double jeopardy rule also prohibits
the prosecution’s appeal of an acquittal,

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.700
except when it appeals “a point of law”
(as opposed to an appeal on the merits or

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.500
of a factual issue).

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.450
In this limited circumstance, if a procedural
deficiency is found, the matter can be retried.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.450
England and Wales

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.370
Under English law, the prohibition against
double jeopardy may now be suspended in a

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.019
limited number of cases.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.180
Born from the realization that modern scientific
forensic methods can reveal evidence that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.109
was unavailable in years past, beginning in
2005, criminal defendants who had been previously

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.090
acquitted of a serious charge may be retried
if “new and compelling evidence” is brought

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.309
to light.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.859
Crimes that reach the seriousness threshold
include murder, war crimes, rape and certain

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:45.859
drug offenses.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.199
The compelling evidence that justifies a retrial
cannot have been available at the time of

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.459
the first trial.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.319
Notably, this undermining of double jeopardy
protection applies retroactively – meaning

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.299
that people who were previously tried when
double jeopardy had its full effect, can now

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.639
be retried.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.760
As a result, some criminal defendants who
confessed (or bragged) after their first acquittal

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.709
may now be tried again, based on that confession,
such as Billy Dunlop, who was convicted of

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.220
the 1991 murder of Julie Hogg in a 2006 retrial.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.060
Note that, unlike in America, in the United
Kingdom, ex post facto criminal laws are merely

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060
frowned upon, but not prohibited.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Australia

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.520
Also hoping to hold more people accountable
for serious crimes, in 2006, the Council of

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.860
Australian Governments (COAG) created a model
for double jeopardy reform to be instituted

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.389
by its member states.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.330
By 2012, each state had some form of limited
exception to double jeopardy available to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.370
retry a defendant in the face of a false acquittal
for charges of murder and other serious crimes

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.750
including gang rape and some drug offenses.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.360
On May 1, 2014, multiple outlets reported
that Queensland authorities were proposing

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.300
to make its exception to double jeopardy completely
retroactive, although its earlier exception

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.550
applied only to trials after 2007.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.870
If this proposed change is passed, retroactive
double jeopardy for certain serious crimes

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.370
will be the law across Australia.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.560
Like the U.K., Australia does not prohibit
ex post facto criminal laws.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.560
New Zealand

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.699
New Zealand generally prohibits retroactive
criminal laws, although its exceptions to

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.950
double jeopardy, passed in 2011, apply to
acquittals entered after June 2008.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.199
These two exceptions are: where the criminal
defendant was acquitted through some criminal

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.509
action, and where “new and compelling evidence,”
is found in a serious case (defined as those

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.889
with a maximum penalty of at least 14 years
of prison).

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.620
As with other jurisdictions, this new evidence
could not have been available for the first

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.620
trial.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.620
Scotland

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.599
Passed in 2011, the Double Jeopardy Act also
provides limited exceptions to the prohibition

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.889
against a second trial, and applies in cases
of a tainted acquittal or in light of “new

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.189
and compelling” evidence.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.379
However, according to commentators, unlike
other jurisdictions the Scots law was broadly

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.599
written, such that it could apply to any offense
and leaves the decision to allow a retrial

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.889
largely to judicial discretion.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.689
As a result, some commentators have opined
that the Scottish exception essentially eliminates

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:44.439
the entire protection, or as lawyers like
to say, created the “exception that swallowed

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.749
the rule.”
