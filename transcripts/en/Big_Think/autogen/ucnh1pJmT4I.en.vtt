as good if not better as any human
player as computer memory and

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410
player as computer memory and
 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.000
player as computer memory and
sophistication has increased you know

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
sophistication has increased you know
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
sophistication has increased you know
its outstripped human memory and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
its outstripped human memory and
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.970
its outstripped human memory and
sophistication so so I don't know

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980
sophistication so so I don't know
 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.740
sophistication so so I don't know
everything it seems to me the thing that

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750

me that first of all there's a
 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.039
me that first of all there's a
relationship with language that the best

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049
relationship with language that the best
 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.169
relationship with language that the best

that's it that because he has a
 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.169
that's it that because he has a
particular relationship with the

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179

thing so that's the first thing is when
I'm looking at work I've tried to see

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700
I'm looking at work I've tried to see
 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.550
I'm looking at work I've tried to see
what is the relationship with language

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560
what is the relationship with language
 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.239
what is the relationship with language
and and the second the second things are

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249
and and the second the second things are
 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.370

and out of which their whole sensibility
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.250
and out of which their whole sensibility
proceeds you know now that to have all

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260
proceeds you know now that to have all
 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.710
proceeds you know now that to have all
of that in the form of artificial

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
of that in the form of artificial
