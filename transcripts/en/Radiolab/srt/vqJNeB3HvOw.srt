1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,860
Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad
[inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,370
Radiolab and this, this like this.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,690
This is Alex bellows. Okay. He's a writer.
He's written a lot about sports. Uh,

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,310
particularly about Brazilian soccer
but also math or he likes to say maths.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,120
And when I read my first math
book, here's looking at Euclid,

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,020
I went and gave loads of talks and at
the end of the talk that all be someone

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,960
who put their hands up and they'd
say, what's your favorite number?

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,970
And this used to just irritate me because
I myself don't have a favorite number.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,060
You don't have a favorite
number? No, I think it's stupid.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,660
I know that's actually incorrect.
I did think it was stupid.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,810
I just didn't have one. Okay. And
why would the question annoy him?

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,330
[inaudible] to me it's the most
normal question you could ask. Well,

13
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:45,740
but this is, remember this is this is,

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,350
he's talking about a math
book to math enthusiasts.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,080
What's your favorite numbers?
Like sort of a, it's like,

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,390
it's too silly or maybe it's
like they're making fun of him.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,070
I got so free rated that once I think
I was a bit tired. It was like, Hey,

18
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:00,110
I don't know where the Gig was. And I
just said, well it's your favorite number,

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,270
just turning it back at the person
in the audience. And they said,

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,610
um Oh 12 I was shocked with it. But you,

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,470
you weren't asking me because you were
kind of taking the piss out of the math.

22
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:09,681
No,

23
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:13,520
you actually really wanted to know because
you wanted to share your own favorite

24
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,930
number. And he's like, oh yeah.

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,100
And then the person sitting
next to them were like, yeah,

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,340
like mine's eight and then my mind seven.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,570
And I thought this is interesting and I
can remember asking the audience as well

28
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:27,320
who he has got a favorite number and at
least half the people put their hands

29
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:27,910
up.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,900
And in a way that you go from being a
smoker when you stopped smoking to be like

31
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:37,190
a rabbit. Anti-Smoker I went
from being your favorite number,

32
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:41,030
agnostic to being obsessed with
favorite numbers. B started a website,

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,470
favorite number. Dot Net. You know,

34
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:46,190
just asking people to hit the question
and I put it out there and I helped them

35
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,400
out on my blog and I had
within the first few weeks,

36
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,280
I actually more than 30,000 people.

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,690
Hello? Hello. Hi. From all over the
world. This is Jenny from round lake,

38
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:59,380
New York. My name is Sitar from
Dubai, [inaudible] Sydney, Australia,

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,650
[inaudible] Bhaskar, Norway
telling me their favorite numbers.

40
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:07,330
My favorite number is definitely
eight 30 29 11 and the reasons why,

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,890
the reason it's four is because my
favorite card is ace of spades and it's

42
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,210
commonly called the death card.

43
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:18,211
My birth date is four 1459
so by from nine is four.

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,010
My favorite number is 100
because it is two zeroes.

45
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,010
Okay, so here's what's fascinating about
this, at least to me. First of all,

46
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,790
the volume of response.

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,830
He got about 30,000 submissions
from all over the planet.

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,130
We put out a call on our app, which are
the voices you're listening to here.

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,240
And we got 30,000 no, we got a
gin. That's good. That's okay.

50
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,810
I clearly people want to talk about
their favorite numbers and about their

51
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,250
reasons which are

52
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,430
from the heart. The numbers.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,240
Five was always a friend cause it feels
like home and family and it's kind of

54
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,310
whole and balanced. People
talked about it in emotional

55
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,000
terms, really warmness, coolness,
standoffishness inviting this.

56
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,190
It's this a hole in emotional landscapes
in here under the numbers and nothing

57
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,970
to do the numbers really, but it's just
there. It was there from the very start.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,760
Okay. First of all, where do
numbers go? Who invented them? Well,

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,650
it depends what you mean by numbers.

60
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,300
If by numbers mean this idea that we can
tell the difference between two things

61
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:29,260
and three things and we'll then we've
had that ever since and if humans existed

62
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,780
and you can test on
animals and they do it too,

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,060
but if you're talking
about symbols and words,

64
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,700
abstractions to designate
specific numbers.

65
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,560
This is probably only about 5,000
years old and was an invention of the

66
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,281
Sumerians,

67
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,730
which is basically Iraq and Alex is
from the moment they came up with these

68
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,360
samples,

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,180
they then added sort of extra
layers of utterly [inaudible] stuff.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,660
Writes, like, let's take the
Sumerian word for one. Um,

71
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,720
and apologies for my accent and Sumerian

72
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,260
fall. You, I am, I assuming
it's been very rough, I guess,

73
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,660
which has ges, I, I usually
say get pass. Yes. Yeah.

74
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,650
Or however you say it.
That's the word for one.

75
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,990
And that is also the word for Phallus.

76
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,810
And the word for to is min mean,
which is also the word for woman.

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,920
And one can only really speculate,
but there are, you know why.

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,520
One is man and two as women,
it could be, um, could be,

79
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:31,120
they had some sort of Adam and
eve notion in mind, like me first.

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,300
You second or could be our distinguishing
feature is that we have one of what

81
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:42,880
makes us a man and that woman has
two breasts, where to look, look,

82
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,930
whatever they were thinking,

83
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,450
they were not the only ones to
be thinking along these lines.

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,130
You go forward 3000 years, 3000 years
later, you get to [inaudible], right?

85
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:55,270
The [inaudible] theorem guy
yet. So Pythagoras repeated.

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,870
The one is male, two is female thing.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,790
By saying that odd numbers or masculine
and even numbers were feminine,

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,690
even tried to justify by
saying look like do the,

89
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:09,220
do the calculations here because
when you add even to odd,

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
say three plus two, you get odd five,

91
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,470
which means that when
you add man to woman,

92
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,880
you get man said man is kind
of stronger, um, than, than,

93
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,890
than women by that logic.

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Odd plus odd makes even so what
does that two males make a female?

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,190
I mean the whole thought is
a little farfetched to me.

96
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,630
So that is Steve Strogatz, professor of
math at Cornell, irregular on our show,

97
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,890
friend of radio lab.

98
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,490
Peter of the Pythagorean way of thinking
about numbers except for the triangle

99
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,110
thing, which he loved. But, but
here's what's weird, is it, you know,

100
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,430
go 5,000 years after the Sumerians and
right up to the present time when Alex

101
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,990
does this worldwide survey though,
what's your favorite number thing? Years.

102
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:57,860
Something weirdly familiar. I
will just read you for example,

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,970
some of the adjectives and reasons why
people prefer the number one strong,

104
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,650
strong, independent
pendant, honest, brave,

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,850
brave, different tying earring,
lonely, lonely cowboys.

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,190
Knows your cowboy words. Exactly.

107
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,811
A picture,

108
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:21,811
the number one as a man in a really
nicely tailored Italian suit.

109
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,730
He's got dark hair.

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,950
I don't know why it's like Marcella
Mastriani rather than John Wayne too.

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,340
Cautious wise, pretty
soft, nurturing, cold,

112
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:41,080
fragile, very personal.
Unintimidating open, a friendly,

113
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,000
relational, sympathetic, complimentary,
quiet, easy to understand. Flexible.

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,800
It makes more sense. The kind of
feminist kind of feminine, well,

115
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:55,510
stereotypically feminine and we use our
both men and women contributing these

116
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,300
descriptors for these
two numbers. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,120
That was really striking to me and
it made me think, do you know what?

118
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,540
We could all laugh at Pythagoras and the
Sumerians and all the kind of ancient

119
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,440
people saying, well one is
male and two is female bits.

120
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,170
Some fragments of that remain this way.

121
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,440
This is not like a scientific
study well serve actually.

122
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,030
The more that you look, there's
kind of some science behind it.

123
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,940
In fact, there's a guy and
this study in Indiana, a place,

124
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:29,510
you know a yes. This guy, James Wilkie,
assistant professor of the university,

125
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,780
you know, or damn. So James and
his team, here's what they do.

126
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,900
They take a baby that's just
been born. Yeah, a few weeks old.

127
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,950
Impossible to say. Just with the
face, whether it's [inaudible].

128
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,750
So you had to get a 50 50 they show
people pictures of these androgynous,

129
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,220
a little bay region buried over in the
side where you would hardly notice them.

130
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,030
All heart strings of four
or five digit numbers.

131
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,050
Numbers happen to be either all even
or all odd. Right? And James Guy say,

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,780
don't worry about those. They there,
they're there for the storage.

133
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,780
These are tracking numbers.
Go ahead and adore these.

134
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:02,020
Just focus on the babies and the
pictures and tell us male, female,

135
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,410
just look at the face and tell us
whether it's a male or a female.

136
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,250
And it turns out that if a
baby is next to our digits,

137
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,370
you're more likely to say that it's a by
that f the baby is next to even digits

138
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,960
really well with me. How much more
likely by a lot or by a teeny bit.

139
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,470
By statistically significant
amount, not a landslide.

140
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,530
Do you yourself assign any gender
to either one? Do you find odd?

141
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,780
A little more male in some, no, not at
all. No. I've never felt that at all.

142
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,770
I've known that they were a bit different
because they sort of feel different.

143
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,280
So he decided to investigate just to
see if there's anything behind it. Yeah.

144
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,290
Why not? Which led him and us to
a guy named Greg Roland. Okay.

145
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,050
Okay. This is Robert. Hi Robert.
How are you? This is Andy.

146
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,930
I'm a producer working with
Robert m d so first of all,

147
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:56,010
can you just tell us like w
e you have a peculiar job,

148
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,770
I guess at least peculiar to
me. Like what do you do? Well,

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,280
I have founded a company called the
semiotic alliance, which is a business,

150
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,570
right? It is a consultancy. Yeah.
So Greg is paid very good money,

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,040
but some of the biggest
brands in the world,

152
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,930
Coca Cola for IBM to give them advice
about how their brands would go down.

153
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,490
We look at people's emotional responses
to culture, symbols and ideas.

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,510
On the basis of this, we can help
companies with packaging, advertising.

155
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,110
And often he says what that means is he's
helping companies harness the symbolic

156
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:29,150
power of numbers. I think
one of the most exciting, um,

157
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,310
encounters with mathematics
for me was with KFC

158
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,180
with the 11 Herb's a spices

159
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,063
who, who

160
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,320
[inaudible] 11 witches
capitalistic in its,

161
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,290
in its secrecy. Such a
strange number. Well,

162
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:55,000
I thought that Colonel Sanders was in his
experimental kitchen and just and just

163
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,210
happened to Sanders. You
southern Oh Sanders fan.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,350
Colonel Sanders was in his kitchen and
he was just fiddling around and he came

165
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,910
up with 11 herbs. We call
the herbs here and spices.

166
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,720
That's one version of the truth.

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,750
But the symbolic truth is far more
interesting and potent 11 has enormous

168
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,790
mystical potential simply because
it's not 10 or 12 or five.

169
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,360
It's not a sensible number.

170
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,180
What's wrong with 10 if I say
with my 10 herbs and spices,

171
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:28,780
because with tenure implying
that you have a decimal balance.

172
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:33,781
So work is going to be very hard to
engage people emotionally with with 10 10

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,960
Phil's ordered feels highly rational.

174
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,110
Greg says it may have something to do
with the fact that you have only 10

175
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,010
fingers are looking at them.

176
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,130
Dan as seven 11 just is that extra
one that has made Colonel Saunders on

177
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:53,480
copyable and the same thing might be
happening with five oh one jeans like you

178
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:53,580
know,

179
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,580
why is it five oh one jad and not 505 oh
one again has just gone one beyond the

180
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,920
place you would expect to get to wait
a second. What if you don't want that?

181
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,130
What if you want a product where
you need to play it safe? Well

182
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,600
then you can stick with multiples of
10 which is really useful when you're

183
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,560
trying to be practical or sorry,
tip it absolutely. For example,

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm being attacked. We're
winning the war against sin.

185
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,890
Take the act, be cream, oxy
10 which viewing your face,

186
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,750
I know you're not entirely unfamiliar
with it. 10 there is obviously,

187
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:30,370
you know that's where
we get to a solution.

188
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
That's where are the fingers
on our hands run out.

189
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,230
So there is a sense of completion there.

190
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,920
The sense of we've gone through the
process and we're going to come out. Okay.

191
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,270
Um, and of course that's why
11 is interesting. Just your,

192
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,930
your embarking into the infinite. Um,

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
at that point you're going to be
on the human finger count. Ah,

194
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,693
interesting.

195
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,363
[inaudible]

196
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,200
11 herbs and spices. That's right.

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,440
How did the you say that as if you want
to taste the thing I do like I used to

198
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:07,930
love getting that as a kid.

199
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,000
I did the 11 did the 11 number 11
some tickle you in any way? Yes,

200
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,820
definitely would not buy it
with 10 herbs and spices.

201
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:20,200
That sounds very solid
and Stalinist. Really?

202
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,970
No, I'm Yanking, I'm yanking. I'm
yanking your wishbone. Oh really?

203
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:28,210
I was kind of hoping, no, I
don't mean it. No, come on.

204
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,420
I got to agree with Steve. Like the, the,

205
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,870
the idea that 11 is mystical
because it's one more than 10 mm.

206
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,590
Although with 10 I think he has
a point. It is boring. I agree.

207
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,640
Here's just a fact.

208
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,810
Big Companies With Large Checkbooks
called Greg up all the time for it.

209
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,020
I think the thing about numbers is
that because they are so rational, uh,

210
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,800
so abstract for that very reason, they
ask you us in some way. Bizarre. Huh?

211
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,730
I think human beings have an absolute
need to invest emotion, love,

212
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:57,564
hate,

213
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,600
fear to invest in non rational into things
which seem almost obscenely rational.

214
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,103
Hmm.

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
My magic number is number eight.

216
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,000
I turned age 18 on October the eighth

217
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,020
1988.

218
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Number four because I want a
swimming race in a plane for

219
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,701
as a child.

220
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:26,680
My favorite number is three because
to me it recalls to mind the trinity.

221
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,990
Now, however you feel
about all this stuff,

222
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,700
one thing that seems
pretty interesting to us,

223
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,150
I had to Alex's you'd expect if you were
asking the world to give you a favorite

224
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,870
number, that'd be a huge difference
from one culture to the next.

225
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,670
13 is an unlucky number.

226
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:43,570
You don't have a 13th floor in America
in Korea that doesn't have a fourth floor

227
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,320
because it's unlucky for
over there. Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,860
But here's something
interesting. The entire plan,

229
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,890
all the continents and everyone in
all the continents came to a kind of

230
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:57,760
consensus around one number. Yeah.

231
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,590
So tell me Alec,

232
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,820
what was the world's favorite number?

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,100
I hope you got some good audio
of a drum roll coming up.

234
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,350
Movie [inaudible] myself

235
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,230
seven it's seven. My favorite
number is seven. I like the number,

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,070
say favorite number is number seven
and we heard pretty much the same thing

237
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,580
in second place was three and
the third place was there. Yeah,

238
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:25,810
but it was a big win for seven 30% I had
a three I became really interested in

239
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,030
seven because yes, we all
lose the favorite number,

240
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,120
but why is it the people's favorite
number and when did that begin?

241
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,110
And I have one. Oh Great. I love
hearing reason. Holes in your head.

242
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,140
Years two and two. One in one
nozzles. Three and four. Five yeah.

243
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,840
Six and seven. Yeah. Seven,
seven holes in your head.

244
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,290
There is no way that can be true.

245
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Well then then look up at the night sky
and BMS at potassium so you don't have

246
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:53,630
a, what do you see? The Sun,
the moon and five planets.

247
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:57,020
Seven you spend the whole night
looking at seven. Yeah, of course.

248
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,620
That's not what you hear from people.
Then number seven just looks beautiful.

249
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,670
What you hear from people.
It's about how beautiful it.

250
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,510
I liked the way it looks when I write
it is a good looking number or how it

251
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,690
sounds. Sounds beautiful. Sounds perfect.

252
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
A lot of people came in about the sentence
sound of seven. I get on that train.

253
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:16,440
I think seven comes out of your
mouth real nicely. Yes. Sevens set.

254
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,470
I just didn't feel like the number
seven belongs to me. I guess.

255
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,740
[inaudible] it even sounds
good in Arabic, right? Yeah.

256
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,730
Hebrew Sheva really similar. See
it. Oh it sounds great. In Spanish.

257
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,480
Oh this. This makes me feel a little sad.

258
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,120
Not to get silly but on you,

259
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,800
but there's a certain pleasure that people
are getting that I'm not getting from

260
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:44,780
numbers ever. Cause I feel like,
like if someone says eight is curvy,

261
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,870
part of me feels you're talking about the
shape of the way that we draw than the

262
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,190
number eight as a numeral.

263
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,220
That has nothing to do with
the number eight talking about.

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,690
It's the way I see you say eight to
me. I see. I don't see eight apples.

265
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,730
I see that curd IC, the two circles,

266
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,940
one on top of the other best
income makes me, that makes me sad.

267
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:08,780
That makes me feel like you're missing
the reality of the number eight which is

268
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,890
that eight has intrinsic properties.
That's really dry speak, but,

269
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,450
but eight eight is a, I mean like 10 okay.

270
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,280
10 to me is much more like when you go
to the bowling alley and the 10 pins are

271
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,870
lined up in that triangle pattern. Yeah.
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

272
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,980
There's the one and the two
then the three, then the four.

273
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,960
That is a gorgeous way to think about
10 10 is about this magnificent symmetry

274
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:37,730
that can make a triangle, but seven is
a disaster as a mathematical object.

275
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,240
I mean it doesn't have nice symmetries.

276
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,420
If I tried to put bowling pins
down with seven it's ugly.

277
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,580
However you arrange it to me,

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,960
so it makes me feel left out that I
can't have the same fun that other people

279
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:56,710
are having. Okay. But if you ask Alex,

280
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:01,711
why is seven the world's favorite
number he says is because seven is

281
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,570
arithmetically unique.

282
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,840
If the only digit of the first 10
numbers that can either be multiplied or

283
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,610
divided within the group,

284
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,140
so one, two, three, four,

285
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:17,020
five we can double them and
they stay under 10 in the group.

286
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:20,860
You've got to keep them in the group six
what's left? Seven weeks? We had six,

287
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:25,861
eight and 10 as you can have them and
the ones left are seven and nine and nine

288
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:30,790
you can find by three. So seven is unique.

289
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,130
So you think that there's
enough arithmetic in
everybody that without having

290
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:38,230
worked it out as
painfully as you just did,

291
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,830
people will still find that there's
something unusual about seven

292
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,770
mathematically, not about memories,
not about culture, not about shape,

293
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,030
just about the math itself. You cannot
separate the math of all of those things.

294
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:56,031
The way we understand numbers is to do
with their arithmetic and that it's,

295
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:01,050
the arithmetic has been
absorbed by culture and sort
of the greatest example of

296
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:06,051
that is the predominance of seven
as the most special religious,

297
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,430
mystical number that there is.

298
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,750
Oh, so he thinks it's not so much that
the culture has gotten into the math.

299
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,110
It's the other way around that the math
actually was there first and then that

300
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,180
got into the culture. Yeah.

301
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,460
All right. You're making me feel better.

302
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,440
[inaudible]

303
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
would you like to thank somebody? I would.

304
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,160
I like to thank Steve Strogatz once again
for joining us whenever we call him.

305
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,360
I'd like to thank Sally Bellows, whose
book is called the Grapes of math.

306
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:47,770
How life reflects numbers and numbers
reflect life. Right. Well, we should go,

307
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:51,460
I guess I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm
Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
