00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.002
Let's see if we can
write 0.36 as a fraction.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.460
There are several
ways of doing it.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.380
The way I like to do it
is to say, well, 0.36,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.300
this is the same thing
as 36 hundredths.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.230
Or one way to think
about it is this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.515
is in the hundredths place.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.110
This is in the
tens place, or you

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.660
could view this
as 30 hundredths.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.480
You could view this as 3
tens, or 30 hundredths.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.670
So we could say that this is
the same thing as 36 hundredths,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.985
or this is equal to 36/100.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.589
And we've already
expressed it as a fraction,

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.130
but now we could
actually simplify it

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.350
because both 36 and 100
have some common factors.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380
They're both divisible
by, well, looks

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.202
like they're both
divisible by 4.

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:51.660
So if we could
divide the numerator

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.122
by 4 and the
denominator by 4, we're

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.330
doing the same thing to both.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.490
So we're not changing the
value of the fraction.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.459
36 divided by 4 is 9, and
then 100 divided by 4 is 25.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.010
And now these two
characters don't

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.040
seem to share any
other common factors.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.920
And so we've written
it in simplified form,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.780
and we're done.
