00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 align:start position:0%
season at least they were going for
 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.069 align:start position:0%
season at least they were going for
something<00:03:37.090><c> like</c><00:03:37.329><c> that</c><00:03:37.510><c> like</c><00:03:37.660><c> hey</c><00:03:37.750><c> we</c><00:03:37.930><c> got</c><00:03:38.049><c> a</c>

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
something like that like hey we got a
 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
something like that like hey we got a
really<00:03:38.290><c> leave</c><00:03:38.590><c> them</c><00:03:38.739><c> on</c><00:03:38.919><c> something</c><00:03:39.730><c> strong</c>

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 align:start position:0%
