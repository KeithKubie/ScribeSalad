00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.660
&gt;&gt;Adam: Good afternoon.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.910
Authors at Google NY are pleased to welcome
back Paul Ingrassia to share with us his recent

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.730
book, "Engines of Change: A History of the
American Dream in Fifteen Cars."

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.650
Paul Ingrassia is the former Detroit bureau
chief for the Wall Street Journal, winner

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.570
of The Pulitzer Prize in 1993 with Joseph
B. White for reporting on management crisis

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.930
at General Motors.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.000
Ingrassia has chronicled the auto industry
for more than 25 years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.170
His prior book, "Crash Course, The American
Automobile Industry's Road from Glory to Disaster,"

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.080
was the first book published about the 2009
bailouts and bankruptcies of General Motors

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.080
and Chrysler.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.830
He's a frequent op-ed contributor to many
publications and is currently with Reuters

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.780
and I'd like you to welcome my Dad to talk.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.040
[applause]

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.820
&gt;&gt;Paul: Very nice.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.090
Hello.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.350
Thanks.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
Well, thanks Adam.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.120
That was a very generous introduction.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.109
Adam was kind enough to mention the Pulitzer
Prize that came my way back in 1993, when

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.659
I was based in Detroit and Adam was growing
up there.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.090
And my best memory of that story, actually,
is the next day one of his younger brothers

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.569
went to school and told his teacher his dad
had just won the Pulitzer Surprise.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:29.569
[laughter]

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.179
I think he had it about right.

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.669
I just want to talk to you about my book a
little bit, "Engines of Change," which is

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:43.639
really a look at the last hundred years of
American cultural evolution through 15 cars.

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.479
The cars are listed here.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
I don't have time to go through all the 15
during this presentation, but I'm gonna go

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.119
through a bunch of them and then just scroll
through the rest of these in a quick order.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.030
And this was really kind of a fun book to
do, basically.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.979
I mean, writing books is a lot of work, but
I'm sorry this one is done because it really

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.899
gave me a chance to really dig in to a lot
of things in automobiles and the history of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.930
automobiles and the cultural impact of automobiles
that has fascinated me for a long time.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
And I think has a lot of fascination for a
lot of people.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.409
I imagine, it's a little bit weird to be honest
with you, talking to a Google audience about

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.180
the cultural impact of cars, or certain cars,
because at some point, someone's gonna do

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.470
a great book about the cultural impact of
key developments in technology, whether it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.480
was the first Mac computer, or whatever it
was--the invention of the browser, all that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
sort of thing.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.299
And I think that the interesting thing is
that these things have a tremendous impact

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.680
on how we think and live in a lot of ways.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.860
And certain automobiles really uniquely captured,
or shaped, the spirit of their day, either

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.049
reflected it or captured it.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:14.140
And at some point, like I say, someone will
do the history of technology using this sort

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.329
of approach to looking at technological innovation
back from the days before "laptop" was a high-tech

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.910
term and that sort of thing.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.579
So, but my really expertise is in automobiles.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.439
As Adam can tell you, I have zero expertise
in technology.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.879
In fact, I might even ask one of you to come
up and forward my slides during the middle

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.700
of this presentation.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.469
I started out with the premise of this book
that American culture--.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.799
Let's forget about cars for a minute.

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:52.680
American culture is like this big tug of war,
OK, between the practical and the pretentious,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.150
between the ordinary and the ostentatious,
up down versus uptown versus downtown, Saturday

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.260
night Sunday morning, that sort of thing.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.200
And that is really reflected in all the automobiles
in this book.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.489
And I'll show you that as I go along here.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:17.090
And especially in the first two automobiles,
the Ford Model T and LaSalle, which is a dead

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.859
brand now, but was the first yuppie car of
its day.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.160
The Model T was introduced in the Fall of
1908.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.530
It was literally the car that put Americans
on wheels.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.199
Other cars of the day were sold for well over
a thousand dollars at the time.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.200
And the introductory price of the Model T
was only 850 dollars.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.390
It was the first car with interchangeable
parts.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.150
It was Henry Ford's vision of how to put people,
make America a mobile automotive society.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.139
And it had interchangeable parts and very
flexible chassis that could go anywhere.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.450
I mean, the roads in that day were even worse
than the roads of today, I might add.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.639
There was a, one of the, Henry Ford's favorite
jokes was about the farmer who asked to be

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.160
buried in his Model T Ford because the Model
T had gotten him out of every hole he'd never

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.139
been in, OK?

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.979
And another apocryphal perhaps story of the
day was about a university researcher who

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.600
went out to an isolated, rural homestead and
talked to the housewife there and said, "Look.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600
I don't understand this.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.729
You have a Ford Model T sitting in front of
your log cabin here, but you don't even have

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.729
indoor plumbing.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.870
Tell me about your priorities."

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.830
And she said, "Well, look.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.000
It's pretty simple.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.229
You can't go to town in a bathtub."

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.270
And that explains the value of the Model T.
It really made automotive transportation,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.580
going anywhere you wanted, when you wanted
available to the common man.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:59.090
And it really ended rural peasantry in America
in a way that Europe never had that happen,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.770
to be honest with you.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.560
So, Ford Model Ts introduced in 1908.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.910
Five years later, 1913, Henry Ford comes up
with this amazing innovation called the moving

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.389
assembly line.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.620
He actually got his inspiration of this from
the dis-assembly lines of the stockyards of

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.820
Chicago where animals are being slaughtered
and cut into steaks.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.990
He reversed the process, right?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.710
And that's how they assembled cars.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.150
And a few months after that, in January of
1914, he followed that with the five dollar

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.940
day--the average factory wage at the time
was about two and a quarter a day.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.330
He more than doubled that.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.159
And he incurred the wrath of the Wall Street
Journal and a lot of other industrialists,

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.159
basically.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.669
But he paid people a five dollar day.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.150
And it really, all that really made mass manufacturing
come in to play and they created the foundations

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.520
for the American middle class.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.280
So this one development of his, the Model
T Ford, had incredible, incredible legs if

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.260
you will and incredible impact.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.319
By the early 1920s, Henry Ford applied all
those manufacturing efficiencies and he lowered

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:14.520
the price, the basic price of the Model T
from 850 dollars to 260 dollars--cheaper than

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.030
ever, right?

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.210
But by that time, Model T sales were falling
dramatically.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.210
And why was that?

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.240
It was really pretty simple, basically.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.250
They didn't call the Roaring 20s, "Roaring"
for nothing.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.330
America was becoming an urban society and
people wanted automobiles, not only for physical

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.340
transportation, but they wanted them for social
mobility, if you will, to show off their status

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.949
of life and that sort of thing.

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:43.130
So, along comes General Motors with a different
idea about cars.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.199
It'll sell them for more money, but make them
snazzier, sexier, a little more appeal, a

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.130
little more stylish.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.130
And this is what you get.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.130
You get the LaSalle.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.610
It's the first yuppie car.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.110
It's a beautiful automobile, even today looking
at its design proportions.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:06.819
It was the first automobile designed by Harley
Earl, who was the father of American automobile

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.030
design.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.650
And it was launched in 1927, which incidentally,
was the same year the Model T died.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:20.900
In this, by driving a Model T, you can get
anywhere, but you wouldn't be able to show

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.310
off.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.430
By driving this car,you can really show that
you had arrived.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:33.680
So, it's sort of the bookends, if you will,
of practicality and pretention, really uniquely

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.710
captured in these two cars.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:42.260
And ironically, the Model T's demise came
in the same year that the LaSalle was launched.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:51.820
So after the LaSalle is alive from the 1927
to 1940, when GM discontinued the brand, but

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.650
the 30s and the 40s don't really have much
of a place in my book to be honest with you,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:02.550
because cultural evolutions ran into two big
hiccups in America in the 30s and the 40s.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.350
One was called the Depression, right?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.590
And the next was called the War.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.060
In World War II, all civilian automobile production
was discontinued.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.190
It was curtailed.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:18.270
So, those factories in Detroit were building
planes and tanks and military transports and

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.460
all of that sort of things.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.830
So, the whole car thing discontinued for a
while.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.830
But then comes 1953.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.760
1953 is a seminal year in America.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.330
The, what happened in '53 was the Korean War
ended, Hugh Hefner started this magazine called

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:45.560
"Playboy," a young singer named Elvis Presley
began his recording career.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.570
So you get this picture, right?

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.310
Of a whole generation of Americans that had
grown up, that had come of age, knowing first

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.970
Depression and then War.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.651
So, real privation when they were coming of
age.

00:09:56.651 --> 00:10:02.220
And all of a sudden, we had peace and this
was the year that Jack Kennedy went to the

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.220
Senate.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.290
It was the year that Eisenhower went to the
White House.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.290
We have peace.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.290
We have prosperity.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.080
And you get this picture of a whole generation
of Americans who had grown up in tough times,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.400
wanting to let loose a little bit.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.190
And here comes the Corvette.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.250
The first Corvette is pictured on the upper-right
there.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.950
And it was a disaster.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.150
Corvette was a disaster at first.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.740
It had an anemic 6-cylinder engine.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.510
I mean, it looked kinda cool.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.380
But the 6-cylinder engine was slow.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.140
It had a two-speed automatic transmission.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.140
The roof leaked.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.160
I mean, it had a pull-over roof.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.030
They were all convertibles, but the roof leaked.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.470
In fact, a couple of owners who bought their
Corvettes during that day, actually drilled

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.480
holes in the floor to make sure the rainwater
could drain out properly during storms.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.000
So, about a year after GM introduced the Corvette,
the company was ready to kill the car.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.920
They were gonna discontinue it.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.520
And this came to the attention of a young
engineer, named Zora Arkus Duntov.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.510
He's a mid-level engineer for Chevy.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.680
And so, it'd be like, for example, if one
of you guys--any of you--who might be a mid-level

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:16.240
engineer at Google got word that the company
was about to discontinue Chrome entirely.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.770
And he just wasn't gonna take this lying down.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.930
He skipped up through several layers of management
and wrote a letter to the top guy at Chevrolet

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.560
and said, "Look.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.450
We cannot let this happen.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.630
Ford's about to introduce the Thunderbird.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:34.050
If we retreat where introduces the Thunderbird,
we're gonna take a black eye.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.830
And not only just in the face of the auto
industry, but really in the face of all America,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.460
in the eyes of everyone in America."

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.830
So, the irony about Zora Arkus Duntov was
he was raised as a Bolshevik.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.680
He was born in 1910 in St. Petersburg.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.200
His parents were Bolshevik functionaries,
basically.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.580
So, he grew up during the Revolution.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.040
And after the Revolution, his parents were
posted to Berlin of all places in the '30s,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.070
as Russian diplomats.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.230
And then, when the war broke out between Russia
and Germany, he had to flee and managed to

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.230
get out of Europe.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.230
Came to America.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.510
Finds himself in Detroit.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:17.200
And you had the irony of the all-American
sports car, the Chevrolet Corvette, being

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.900
saved by a Bolshevik boy.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900
But Zora argued--.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:27.660
This car would not be alive today, frankly,
without this guy's vision and determination

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.260
to save the car.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.360
It literally, management was ready to kill
it and he pleaded, "Let me improve it."

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.480
So, he went back a did a lot of work on it.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.960
And over the years, it just got to be a really
iconic automobile.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.430
The other signature car of America in the
1950s--remember, this is the Post War Pax

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.510
Americana, right?

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.140
It's peace, prosperity.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.810
The economy is doing well.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.810
Was tail fins.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.380
They are actually introduced by Harley Earl
in 1948.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.540
And they were sort of small at first, a little
like finlets on the back of fenders, if you

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.880
know what I mean.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.300
But in the mid-1950s, Chrysler was really
hurting.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.250
It's market share was sagging, brought in
a new top designer and he started putting

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.370
bigger and bigger fins on the back of Chrysler's
cars.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:22.390
And as a matter of fact, what Chrysler did
was not only market these fins as styling

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.020
cues, right?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.430
Chrysler actually sold them, billed them as
safety devices.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:32.251
I know, it's hard to believe, but the exact
terms of the old sales brochures were, these

00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:34.790
were called "graceful, directional stabilizers."

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.790
OK?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.750
A little dodgy, I'll admit it.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:43.310
But so what happened was the, this is the
1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz, the biggest

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.470
tail fins of all time.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.850
This is like, remember the Jetson's anyone?

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.850
OK?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.700
This is like George Jetson's car, sort of.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.450
But what happened was a young General Motors
designer named Chuck Jordan.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.820
He just passed away a couple years ago.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.970
I was fortunate enough to interview him before
he died.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.140
But he was the only--.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.510
He later became Vice President of Styling
at GM.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.010
But he was a young Cadillac designer.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.040
He heard rumors about Chrysler's 1957 models.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.070
He took a drive over his lunch hour one day.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:20.070
Snuck around the back of a Chrysler storage
facility and saw the '57's with their big

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.110
fins.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.600
Hopped in his car.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.970
Drove back to his office in a panic.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.670
Ran in to talk to his boss and said, "We're
about to get out-finned."

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.670
OK?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.720
So, GM put its designers back to the drawing
board.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.890
And a couple years later, it takes a couple
years to really bring a car to market.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.180
They came out with the biggest tail fins ever.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.560
And my favorite quote about the tail fins
came from Bill Mitchell, who is Harley Earl's

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560
successor.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.570
He said, "You know, I say if you take the
tail fins off a Cadillac, it's like taking

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.100
the antlers off a deer.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.200
You got a big rabbit."

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200
OK?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.770
So, anyway, nothing quite symbolized "the
sky's the limit" ethos of America in the 1950s

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.680
as these tail fins.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.900
But remember what I said about the ostentatious
and the practical, right?

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.140
We are about to swing back to the practical
in a really big way.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.140
This is the anti-Cadillac.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.250
OK?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.680
It came out in the early 1930s.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.480
Ironically, the Beetle, and later the Microbus,
which was developed right after World War

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:33.120
II, but it really had the same, has the same
underlying vehicular architecture, same chassis

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.910
as the Beetle.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.600
The Beetle was Hitler's car.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.030
I mean, the irony of the Volkswagen Beetle
is it went from Hitler's car to Hippie icon.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.910
I mean, you could not make this up, right?

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.440
This is like the epic automotive journey of
all time.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.430
It was actually developed at Hitler's behest
to put German's on wheels, the way Henry Ford's

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.760
Model T had put Americans on wheels.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.540
And the, it was very practical, not at all
pretentious, as you see.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.570
And it was, it came out just before the war,
but right after the first few Beetles were

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:12.330
built, World War II broke out and therefore,
Beetle production was curtailed till after

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.040
the war.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.900
And what happened was really that some American
GIs, who were stationed in Germany after the

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.400
war, started driving these things.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.280
It was the only car they could get.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280
They liked it.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.310
They brought it back to America.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.390
And it took off, surprisingly, in the '50s.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.780
More and more people started buying them.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.860
Back then, two car families were a rarity.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.200
Maybe ten, 20 percent of Americans had second
cars.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.320
This was the ideal second car, if you will--cheap,
easy, you didn't need to carry the whole family

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320
in it.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:50.320
So, the Beetle gradually grew in sales.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.940
It wasn't even named the "Beetle" by the way.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.310
The original name was the "Kraft durch Freude
laden," which meant the strength through joy

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.310
car.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.290
It was chosen by Hitler, sort of a dumb name.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.890
But after the war, the Germans called it the
Volkswagen Sedan.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.260
They thought the word "beetle" was derogatory.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.579
So, they wouldn't even allow the word beetle
to be used in the sales literature till the

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.809
early 1970s.

00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:15.620
But Detroit was shocked by this, right?

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.230
They see the Beetle and they think to buy
a Beetle you gotta be like, either a Pinko

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.459
or a weirdo or a cheapo--maybe all three.

00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:30.389
So, it was mystifying that basically in Detroit's
views that the Beetle took off.

00:17:30.389 --> 00:17:34.809
And then the microbus came along as well.

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:40.460
So, what really made the Beetle take off in
the '60s and made it a hippie icon was not

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.000
only its simplicity, but the great funny advertising.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.070
They had a great advertising agency, here
in New York, called Doyle Dane Bernbach.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.539
And they had marvelous ads.

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:55.309
These are two of my favorites.

00:17:55.309 --> 00:18:01.809
They found out, the people at DDB found out
that literally a hillbilly couple, who lived

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:08.220
in the Ozarks, in a cabin without running
water had their mule pass away and went out

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.340
and bought a Beetle to replace the mule.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:17.529
So, one of the guys from the agency, Bob Cooperman,
who later became the Chairman of the agency,

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.850
flies out to the Ozarks.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.470
Knocks on the door of the log cabin.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.679
Mr. Redman Hinsley, the guy pictured here,
answers the door.

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.659
Mr. Cooperman explains, "I'm from New York.

00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:28.809
I'm from an ad agency.

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:32.039
I'm gonna take your picture and put you in
an ad."

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:36.730
Mr. Hinsely thinks it's a city-slicker's scheme
to get him to steal his land.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.490
He runs and grabs his shotgun.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.490
OK.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.129
They calmed things down and smoothed things
over after that.

00:18:44.129 --> 00:18:47.659
And they do this wonderful ad in American
Gothic-style, right?

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:51.190
I mean, there's Mr. and Mrs. Hinsley with
the pitchfork.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.379
There's the Beetle.

00:18:52.379 --> 00:18:54.980
And there's the cabin they lived in.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.500
And the headline is great.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.450
"It was the only thing to do after the mule
died."

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:05.029
And this is the kind of the hip, irreverent
stuff they did.

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:07.970
The actual, the real hippie favorite, of course,
was the Microbus.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:14.159
And, as a matter of fact, it was such a hippie
favorite, that in 1995, this musician--you've

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:18.700
probably heard of named Jerry Garcia, passed
away.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.389
He was young, but he had lived a hard life
in a lot of ways.

00:19:22.389 --> 00:19:24.559
Let's put it that way.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.679
Volkswagen took out this ad in Rolling Stone
and other magazines.

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:34.970
It shows, it's a sparse pencil sketch of a
Microbus with a teardrop coming out of one

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.650
of the headlights.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.970
I mean, that's advertising, but that's like
really art, frankly.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.600
It's just a beautiful ad.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.250
The word Volkswagen doesn't even appear.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.730
I doesn't need to.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.450
The only text is Jerry Garcia, and the year
he was born and the year he passed away.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.950
So again.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.399
you have the practical and the pretentious.

00:19:55.399 --> 00:20:00.909
Now, this actually is one of my favorite cars
in the book, even though it's a tragic car

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:06.700
and it was literally a fairly flawed car.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.620
And remember, this book is not the 15 best
cars of all time or worst cars.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:17.820
It's really cars that had a defining influence
on how we think and how we live as a people.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.200
And the Chevy Corvair surely was one of those.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.289
It was really GM's answer to the Beetle.

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:27.731
The Beetle did not have its engine in the
front.

00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:31.220
It was a rear-engine car with an air-cooled
engine, so there was no radiator.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.529
It made it very lightweight.

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:40.100
Put the engine right on top of the drive wheel,
so there was great traction in the snow.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.710
This genius, Ed Cole, was running Chevrolet
at the time--the guy that really helped develop

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.580
the Corvette.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.200
Cole had a vision of a bigger, rear engine
air-cooled car called the Corvair.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.539
And by the way, when it came out in 1960,
he made the cover of Time.

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:04.000
It's, so that the car got 29 miles to the
gallon.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.140
That's amazing for that day.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.340
It's not even bad for today, is it really?

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.820
But in that day, most cars got eleven or twelve
miles to the gallon.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.789
So, it was really incredible because he didn't
have the weight of a radiator and didn't have

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:19.900
the drive shaft to connect the engine in front
to the drive wheels in the back.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.669
The engine was right in back.

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:27.299
The problem was, the Corvair, unlike the Beetle,
was a longer car.

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:31.500
And all that weight in the back made it susceptible
to spinning out around corners.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.420
So, the Corvair does pretty well for a few
years.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:41.399
And then in 1965, this young lawyer, he's
unknown and he's out of work, but he's fascinated

00:21:41.399 --> 00:21:42.590
with automobiles' safety.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.629
And he writes this book called, "Unsafe at
Any Speed."

00:21:46.629 --> 00:21:48.720
And his name, of course, is Ralph Nader.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.040
At first, the book went nowhere.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.230
I mean, no one even noticed this book was
published.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.460
But then, the New York Times revealed that
General Motors had hired private detectives

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.539
to spy on Nader's private life, 'cause they
wanted to know who's this guy badmouthing

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:06.840
our car?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.600
When word of this broke in the New York Times,
there were hearings in front of Congress.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.870
A fellow named Jim Roche, who was then the
President of General Motors, went down from

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:23.789
Detroit to Washington and apologized publicly
to Nader in front of Congress with all the

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:27.100
network TV cameras going.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.769
One of the ironies is, by the way, that Nader
missed the apology.

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:36.730
He missed the apology 'cause he did not own
a car and couldn't get a taxi that morning,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.730
OK?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.760
You couldn't make it up.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.429
But after that, basically the book became
a bestseller.

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:45.649
Corvair sales nose-dived.

00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:51.320
And the ramifications of this car on our life
and our society were just remarkable.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:59.700
For one thing, the government changed its
whole attitude toward regulating industry.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:07.700
So, before the Corvair, regulation of industry,
whether it be coal mining, meat packing, car

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.759
building, computer making, anything, was really
very light in this country.

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:18.379
But after that, the whole regulatory apparatus
of the Federal Government, the concept changed

00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:20.539
that the government's gotta protect the people.

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:29.850
So, all kinds of safety and other regulations
came in on products--baby food, hot dogs,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.539
cars, everything else really.

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:38.140
And so, America took a whole different approach
to regulation.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.399
The other thing is, that a whole new growth
industry was started.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:44.399
I mean, you guys work at Google, right?

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:45.399
Most of you anyway.

00:23:45.399 --> 00:23:50.700
So, there are two great growth industries
in America in the late 20th Century.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.320
One is technology.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.309
What was the other one?

00:23:56.309 --> 00:24:01.169
[laughs] Suing anybody.

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:04.369
Lawsuits was the second greatest growth in
the history of the 20th Century.

00:24:04.369 --> 00:24:08.110
All of product liability law is descended
from this car.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:13.840
Basically, the whole idea, definition of what
constituted product liability was greatly

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.190
expanded for what a defective product in legal
terms was, greatly expanded because of the

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.190
Corvair.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.659
So really, the Corvair really created--.

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:25.230
That's why there's so many lawyers today.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.890
Adam's two brothers are lawyers, OK?

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.139
So, what can I say?

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:31.639
Where did I go wrong?

00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:34.220
The Corvair collectors today are very passionate
people.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:39.670
I mean, they have, despite the car's flaws--the
obvious flaws--they collect cars.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.889
They go to conventions.

00:24:40.889 --> 00:24:44.139
They have license plates on their cars.

00:24:44.139 --> 00:24:47.460
One is "wealth space 2."

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.440
The other is, one of my favorites is "F space
Ralph."

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.590
My absolute favorite is one word, Nadir.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.350
N-A-D-I-R.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:05.799
But the Corvair's impact on American life
and thought did not end with product liability

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:10.019
law and regulation and all that kind of stuff.

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:14.210
The car was killed in 1969, same year that
Ralph Nader made the cover of Time.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.240
You see it here.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.389
And you see that little Corvair driving off
into the sunset.

00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:21.169
That's the year the Corvair was discontinued.

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:28.070
Thirty-one years later in the year 2000, we
had a Presidential Election in this country.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.090
It was George W. Bush versus Al Gore.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.280
Remember the hanging chads in Florida?

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.000
All that stuff?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.570
There was a third-party candidate in that
election.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.830
And that was Ralph Nader.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.039
Exactly.

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:47.760
Bush lost the popular vote, as you'll recall.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.100
But he won Florida by less than two thousand
votes.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.210
When the Supreme Court finally decided that
issue.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:03.080
Ralph Nader got 95 thousand votes in the State
of Florida that year.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.210
It's obvious, intuitively obvious, that almost
all those votes had Nader not been on that

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.509
ballot would've gone to Al Gore instead of
George W. Bush.

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:20.110
So, really, 31 years after it's death, Corvair
actually played a defining role in a Presidential

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:25.009
Election 'cause there's no way Ralph Nader
would've been on the ballot in Florida.

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:27.909
He was a nobody until the Corvair made him
famous.

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:34.700
So, I think it can safely be said at any speed,
that the legacy of the Chevy Corvair helped

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.850
to make George W. Bush the President of the
United States.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.850
Think about that for a minute.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:49.230
[laughs] The next car in the book is a Mustang,
which is really the great youth car of the

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.230
1960s.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.490
I'm gonna skip over that quickly because the
'60s were a very interesting period.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.899
They were sort of like two--.

00:26:57.899 --> 00:27:00.480
If you were alive in the '60s, there was the
good half and the bad half.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.289
The early '60s were all about the Beatles
and about Civil Rights.

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:13.360
And they were about the Ford Mustang, to capture
the youthful exuberance of the '60s, the decade

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.039
when Baby Boomers came of age.

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:19.429
The last half of the '60s was very different.

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:22.030
It was basically, this is not Spock, by the
way.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.279
This is John DeLorean who invented the other
great car of the '60s, if you will.

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:28.980
And that's the Pontiac GTO, the first muscle
car.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.739
In the latter half of the '60s, things took
a darker turn in America.

00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:35.190
I mean, it wasn't Civil Rights anymore, so
much.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.029
It was urban riots that got the headlines,
OK?

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:42.919
And The Beatles were replaced by a harder,
tougher-edge band in popularity--The Rolling

00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:44.889
Stones.

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:50.850
And the Mustang, the fun and youthful car
was replaced in popularity in a lot of ways,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.529
or at least moved to the, what moved to the
fore was the Pontiac GTO, which is the first

00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:57.640
muscle car, really.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:03.700
And it was this, kids were drag racing on
streets all the time and all that sort of

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.700
thing.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.679
In fact, in Chicago, the fire department took
to hosing down some of the streets on Friday

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:14.900
and Saturday nights so the kids couldn't race
on them actually.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900
It was that pervasive.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:21.330
But it was a, this is the GTO, which is basically
just a big engine in what was then considered

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.760
the body of a small car.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.239
They were great to drive, by the way.

00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:33.830
And again, after the '60s was over, America
needed to have a little retreat, if you will.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.440
The '60s were a very tumultuous period in
America.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.039
So, along comes the '70s when things, everybody
need a break a little bit in the practical

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:46.259
return to the form.

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:49.909
The '70s were not a good decade in America.

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:52.039
We had Watergate, right?

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:54.220
We had defeat in Vietnam.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.809
We had inflation, stagflation.

00:28:56.809 --> 00:28:59.820
We had two oil crisis.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.230
We had bell-bottomed pants.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.990
We had Donny and Marie.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.230
I mean, all kinds of bad stuff was going on
in the '70s, right?

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.269
So, along comes--.

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:10.539
American cars were terrible.

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:11.539
The quality was awful back then.

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:15.879
I mean, they used to fall apart regularly.

00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:20.510
The signature car, American car of the decade
was the AMC Gremlin.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.510
Anybody remember that?

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.510
I hope not.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.510
OK.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.510
Some of you do.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.510
Yeah, the Gremlin.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.820
It was introduced on April Fool's Day, 1970.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.159
No kidding.

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:33.629
The design was sketched out on the back of
a Northwest Airlines air sickness bag.

00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:35.580
No kidding.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.179
But along comes this little Japanese company
that was really new in the car business.

00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:44.320
It built this reliable, fuel-efficient car
called the Accord.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.549
And a decade later, basically, they started
building the Accord in America.

00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:52.419
It was the first foreign car to be built successfully
in America, in a factory near Columbus, Ohio.

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:55.919
And that actually started 30 years ago this
November.

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.909
The 30th Anniversary is coming up.

00:29:57.909 --> 00:30:03.190
It really changed the whole industrial landscape
in America.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:09.029
And so, the Accord really was again, a retreat
from all the wackiness of the '60s and the

00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:18.649
'70s and a basic common sense, down to earth
car that got you where you were going.

00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:21.889
This is actually one of my favorite cars in
the book since it's one of the cars I actually

00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:24.850
owned--a Chrysler minivan.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.759
We got ours in 1984 when all of our boys were
real young.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.770
And so we used to take trips to Grandma's
house.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.519
And this was pretty easy.

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:36.649
The remarkable thing about this car is that
the same two guys who developed the Ford Mustang

00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:39.830
in the '60s, developed the minivan.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.999
It was Lee Iaccoca and Al Spurlick.

00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:43.610
So, just think about this.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:47.649
In the '60s, the Baby Boomers were coming
of age, just getting their drivers license,

00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:48.649
right?

00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:52.169
A big change in their lives at that time,
a big transition in their lives.

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:53.169
OK.

00:30:53.169 --> 00:30:56.320
Twenty years later, it's another big transition.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.440
They're coming into their 30s, their childbearing
years.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.799
So, Boomers, in the meantime, between the
'60s and the '80s, they grew up.

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:07.879
They went to college.

00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:09.440
They got haircuts.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.000
They got jobs.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.370
They got married.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.519
And they started families.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:17.539
Not always in that order, but more or less.

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:18.539
That's what happened.

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:24.480
And along comes this vehicle that basically
replaces the station wagon as a basic family

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.950
transportation.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.249
And it becomes a real symbol of--.

00:31:28.249 --> 00:31:34.690
In the 1990s became a symbol of what was then
regarded as the most potent force in American

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.210
politics--that is, the soccer mom.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:42.350
So you had this New York Times, all the papers
were sending the kids around, reporters around

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.610
the kids' soccer games to interview mothers
about "how does it feel to be a political

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.539
force this year?"

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:52.669
One mom told the paper that, "I gotta go home
and I gotta thaw something for dinner.

00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:55.480
I just don't have time to be a political force
today."

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:01.059
It played a lot of different ways.

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:03.200
[pause]

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.889
The '80s were the period of the yuppies.

00:32:05.889 --> 00:32:10.769
The BMW 3 Series was the quintessential yuppie
car.

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:17.609
Ironically, we think of BMWs as really neat
cars now, but right at, in the early, in the

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:21.749
late '50s, the company almost collapsed.

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.909
It was saved by two German half-brothers.

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:29.330
Mercedes-Benz was about to acquire BMW and
basically kill the brand.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.259
It was saved by two German half-brothers,
Herbert and Harold Quandt.

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:37.630
Herbert was legally blind, couldn't even drive
a car.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.960
Harold's step-father was one of the more notorious
figures in history.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.460
His name was Joseph Goebbels.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.340
That's really not widely known these days.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:52.369
But anyway, these two half-brothers saved
the company and then basically over the years,

00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:54.629
BMW just started building better and better
cars.

00:32:54.629 --> 00:33:00.990
And it became the quintessential yuppie car
of the 1980s.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.649
My favorite bumper sticker from that era was
found on many a BMW.

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:07.850
"He who dies with the most toys wins."

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.850
OK.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.960
A little obnoxious.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.529
Jeep was another car in the book.

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:18.100
It basically started the whole outdoor recreation
thing.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:24.350
At that time, LL Bean and other companies
were making their products go mainstream.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:29.700
And Patagonia was making all its coats in
bright, vivid pastel colors, et cetera, et

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.700
cetera.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.700
And Jeep did the same thing.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.879
They basically took what used to be a work
utility vehicle and made it a popular fashion

00:33:35.879 --> 00:33:38.609
statement if you will.

00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:42.820
Ironically, Jeep's had nine owners in its
corporate lifetime.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:48.951
The last two have been the Germans and the
Italians--the same two countries that the

00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:52.850
Jeep as a wartime vehicle helped to defeat
in World War II.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:58.910
The Jeep was actually developed to fight the
war in 1940.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.369
This is actually a fun, this is actually a
fun chapter to write.

00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:05.309
This is the second last car in the book, which
is the F-Series pickup truck.

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:06.309
And why was it fun?

00:34:06.309 --> 00:34:10.560
Because it gave me a chance to write about
my other passion besides vehicles, which is

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.600
country music, OK?

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.520
I mean, pickup trucks and country music were
both marginal sorts of things in American

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.890
life until the late, until the 1970s when
they started to go mainstream.

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:27.240
And the more pickup trucks went mainstream,
the more country music played off that and

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.770
vice versa.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.200
Some of the great country songs were really
built around pickup trucks, including one

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.110
of my all-time favorites you guys have probably
heard.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.790
It's a Joe Diffie song--"Leroy the Redneck
Reindeer."

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.790
Anybody know that?

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:42.870
No, I guess not.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:43.870
OK.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.429
Anyway, Leroy is Rudolph's cousin.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:50.640
And one Christmas Eve, when Rudolph gets sick,
Leroy dashes from Nashville to the North Pole

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.450
in his pickup truck and saves Christmas, basically.

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.400
Pickup trucks became very big political symbols
in America--still are.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.970
So in 2010, there was a special election in
the State of Massachusetts to fill the seat

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.330
of the late Ted Kennedy.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:12.130
And the guy who won it in a big upset victory
was Scott Brown, a Republican, unheard of

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:16.460
in Massachusetts, right?

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.900
[pause]

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:23.780
He won by driving around the state, campaigning
in his used pickup truck.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.780
That was his symbol.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.951
The New York Times wrote about it.

00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:27.900
Everybody wrote about it.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:35.610
Ten months later in the mid-term Congressional
elections of 2010, there was a candidate for

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:42.690
Congress in Tennessee who actually advertised
himself as a "truck driving, shotgun shooting,

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.190
Bible reading, crime fighting, family loving,
country boy."

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.230
This guy was a Democrat, OK?

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.730
It shows you how far that went.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.830
He lost that, he lost his race, by the way.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:36:00.420
But pickup trucks are still a big political
and cultural symbol in the South and the West.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:08.470
And finally, the last car in the book is the
Prius, which is known as the Pious in some

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.690
circles after the people who drive it.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.440
It was introduced in Japan in 1997.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.060
It came to the US in the year 2000.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.390
The first successful mass-market hybrid car.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.390
Remarkable engineering feat.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.920
I mean, this is as remarkable as the browser.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.270
I mean, amazing how they did this.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.990
The breakthrough here came in 2003 when the
second generation Prius was introduced.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.560
It was bigger, roomier, could hold a family,
better performing and all that sort of thing.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.360
In the 2003 Oscars, all the movie stars used
to be ferried up to the red carpet, right,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.280
in their big stretch limousines.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.330
They were just clamoring over each other to
be photographed arriving in a Prius.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.120
And that's what really made the car's popularity
take off.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:04.550
And one of my favorite incidents in the book
occurred in March 28th, 2007.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:09.390
There is a guy is arrested on the freeway
in the Bay Area for going more than 100 miles

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.070
an hour in his Prius.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:16.090
And this comes to the attention of a guy named
Gary Richards.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:21.760
Gary Richards writes the car column called
"Mr. Road Show" for the San Jose Mercury News

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.320
in Silicon Valley, right?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.350
He hops on the story because the guy who owned
this Prius that was driving at the time was

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:32.170
Steve Wozniak--a name obviously familiar to
you.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:37.930
He fires off an email to the Woz and says,
"Hey, is it true you were arrested for going

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.430
105 miles an hour in your Prius?"

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:46.030
The Woz fires back a quick email and says,
"Not true.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.030
104."

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.030
OK.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:52.470
So, the dialog goes back and forth about what
it was like to be in court and all that sort

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.470
of thing.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.500
The judge fined him 700 dollars.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:03.040
The, at that point, Mr. Road Show sends an
email that says, "Well, OK.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.090
How did it feel?

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.370
How did the Prius handle?

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:09.920
What was it like going 104 miles an hour in
your Prius?"

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.090
And Wozniak sends back an email that says,
"You know, it was really stable.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.740
It felt pretty good.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.130
It was actually kind of like my Hummer."

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.100
[laughs] So, here you have a guy who has a
Prius and a Hummer.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.310
Which, I mean, the best analogy I can make
for you guys is probably someone who like

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.410
has a Mac and a PC maybe, right?

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.410
OK?

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.470
So, he has a foot in both camps.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.590
It was a really interesting cultural exchange
there if you will.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.750
Anyway, that's basically the book.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:43.190
It's a journey through modern American culture
as seen through the lens of automobiles.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.270
You could do the same kind of book, and someone
will, about technology or maybe movies that

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.270
had a big influence on our culture, which
certainly a lot of them did.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:56.150
Someone will probably do those books one day,
but not me 'cause I write about cars.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.560
Anyway, you've been a great audience.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.650
Thanks for having me back at Google.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.830
I'll be glad to answer a few questions.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.830
[applause]

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:06.914
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi, my name is Igor.

00:39:06.914 --> 00:39:10.250
And my question is how you see the future.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.250
What is the next car?

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.170
&gt;&gt;Paul: You know, that is a great question.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:18.150
So, if I'm doing another edition of this book
five years from now, right?

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.950
What would be the car I would include in this
book?

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.610
The most likely car.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.660
To be honest with you, I'm not even sure it
will be a car.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:36.090
It might even be some sort of a car type concept,
maybe a blend of car sharing with social networking

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.180
or something like that.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:41.940
I mean, are we gonna one day have a company
that's called like eHarmony Zip Car.com?

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.010
I mean, who knows, right?

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:50.010
So I think automotive transportation, people
want personal transportation.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.230
They wanna be able to go where they want,
when they want.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.160
They want horizontal freedom if you will.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.870
But a lot of people these days don't want
to have a car full time.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.440
Some people wanna share one if you will.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.030
And this whole social networking thing is,
I don't have to tell you guys.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.590
It's sort of a big deal.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.550
The business model is still being worked out.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:15.600
But it could be some sort of a combination
of car club, online dating, social networking.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.340
I don't know.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.520
It's a very, I can't predict the future, but
I wouldn't be surprised if it was something

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.520
like that.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.610
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.480
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Why didn't you include station
wagon?

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.820
I thought that was like the quintessential
American car.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.980
&gt;&gt;Paul: How do we live and think as a people
today that is different because of the station

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.980
wagon?

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.990
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I think concept of like road trips
and like the National Lampoon Summer Vacation,

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:46.370
tying all your luggage to the top of the car
and going across the country.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.370
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.090
I think that's a valid argument.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:54.900
I mean, 'cause I said in the afterward of
the book, the hardest part was figuring out

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.560
which cars to leave out.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.360
A question I often get is, "Why didn't you
include the '57 Chevy, one of the greatest

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.520
cars of all time?"

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.440
But I can't really say that we had a definitive
change in our lifestyles because of that.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.300
Now, station wagons did bring in the family
road trip.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.240
I really thought that the impact of the minivan,
if you're gonna choose one family vehicle.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.740
The minivan was more revolutionary, I think,
because not only did it bring family road

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.400
trips to a new level, but it also ushered
in this whole fascination with trucks that

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.690
Americans have.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:34.110
And basically, around 1990, Americans were
actually buying more trucks, meaning minivans,

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.690
pickup trucks, and Jeeps, than they were cars.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:43.560
Now it's swung back to automobiles more, but
trucks are still a very high percentage of

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.800
what Americans buy for personal transportation.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.220
And so, I really think the minivan over the
station wagon really had a more--.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.910
I mean, I mention the station wagon in the
book because the minivan supplanted the station

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.090
wagon for family transportation.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:06.240
The minivan was just, it far more influential
not only in culture, but in terms of politics

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.870
because the whole soccer mom phenomenon that
came up and all that sort of thing.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:11.870
OK.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.150
Any more?

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:23.160
No one's gonna ask me what kind of car I drive?

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.610
It's a red one.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.610
Thanks very much.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:26.611
[applause]
