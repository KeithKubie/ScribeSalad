1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.340
You know,
when,
when you look back on your career,

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:06.150
like do you have like a most satisfying victory?
Yeah.
What is it?

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.450
Acim rock night was going to say that I was going to say the rematch,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.700
the first or the second.
The second one.
The love of Christ.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.760
When a guy,
when a guy beats you like that and then,
you know,

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.010
you could have beaten them or you should have beaten him.

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.200
Is that what bothered you so much?
Um,
no.

8
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:27.080
You know what really bothered me is the fact that I gave him an opportunity.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.030
I gave him a fight when,
uh,

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.590
I'm basically waiting for Tyson and I have to keep busy.

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.460
I'm looking down the list of who to fight.
He's number seven.

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.320
I realized that he's durable.

13
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:42.730
He's not one of these guys that get knocks out easy.
So I wanted to give my fans,

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.470
you know,
a proper fight box,

15
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.860
the best guy out there and not bucks an easy guy that's easy to get knocked out.

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.560
I don't want to go home and two rounds.
So,

17
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:52.750
and then another reason a lot of people don't know.

18
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.720
I went to Africa to fight because Muhammad Ali went to Africa.

19
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.050
You fought in Africa.
So I wanted to do that.
I want it to be,

20
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:00.580
I wanted to fight in Africa.
You know,

21
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:04.810
I say I'm a world champion so I need to fight all around the world.

22
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:07.270
So that's what made me go to Africa.

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.380
The only thing about Africa is I didn't know that it was such a high altitude up

24
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.920
there.
And for me to have a fight,

25
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
I should have got there a lot earlier,
but I was doing ocean's 11 at that time.

26
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.870
He said,
Oh,
you would do in the movie.
I wasn't doing no movie.

27
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.270
I was sitting around half the time waiting for them to change the lights,

28
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:29.020
then go out and go up there for two minutes and then go back and sit there for

29
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.760
another two hours while they changed the lights.

30
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.450
So we training at all when that was happening.
Yeah,
always training.

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.960
But it wasn't like it wasn't the conditions of training.
You know,
I needed a bag,

32
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.290
I needed sparring partners.
That would be up there a lot sooner.

33
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.730
So you're just kind of acclimatize.
Yes.
How many thousand feet?

34
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:50.580
Was It above sea level?
Higher than a big beer?
There was Cape Town,
right,

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.460
so more than six.
Wow.
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

36
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.090
it was kind of weird because when I started working I was like throwing punches.

37
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.250
Then I found myself going,
so I had to take two steps back and I'm like,

38
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.060
oh no,
no,

39
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.400
don't tell him this flight's going to be one of those fights where I have to

40
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:10.690
take my time.
So I basically went out there taking my time.

41
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:13.090
I realize he's dealing with the same thing I'm dealing with,

42
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.770
although he was there a lot earlier,
but you know,

43
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.690
I had a couple of things going wrong boxing up four in the morning.
Uh,

44
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.690
they couldn't find a big enough ring.
Then they,
when they put the room together,

45
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:29.770
it was like a 18 by 19 so,

46
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.280
and then the,
the punch that actually hit me,

47
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.320
I actually thought I was going to block it,
but it came around this side.

48
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.100
I'll put my hand,
I put my hand up to block it,
but it came round,

49
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.870
hit me one of those things where a man through a terrific punch with my chin

50
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:47.890
happened to be in the way of,

51
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.580
what is it like when that's over and you're sitting there and you know you lost,

52
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.800
but you know that under the right circumstances this guy is not at your level.

53
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.150
Uh,
in fact,
you know,
my problem was solved before I got out of the ring.

54
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.510
I knew what I did wrong,
which was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

55
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.540
He's like,
Oh,
another day he,

56
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.840
he wouldn't throw lucky punch like that and it wouldn't hit me and he wouldn't

57
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:18.300
have a riff that,
you know,
was on his side as well.
How was the ref on the side?

58
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.990
Um,
when I say the refs on his side,
you know,
I got a little early,

59
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.340
I got knocked down in the second round.
I'm the,
I'm the champion,

60
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.440
at least give me a chance,
not waive the fight strip.
You know,
you've seen,

61
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.690
you've seen the Deontae a title.
Like,
you know,

62
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.820
if that was the ref,
he counted them out straight away.

63
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.570
That's what stopped it at the press conference 12th round.

64
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.040
That right left and Deontae landed the fact that Tyson got up and then one the

65
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:52.270
remainder of the round.
That is crazy.
Yeah,
I am so frustrated with that.

66
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.210
Fights not happening again,
man.
Every,
you know,

67
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.530
I'm looking at the heavyweight scene and um,
I'm looking at,

68
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560
obviously I'm Joshua Joshua from England and you know,

69
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.870
he had the opportunity to fight Deontae and didn't take it.
I'm like,

70
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.951
if that was me,

71
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.890
I would've took that chance because you never know what happens down the road.

72
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:14.650
Likes what's happening now.
And uh,
you know,

73
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.630
to me he's being put on the shelf now.

74
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.450
He asked the puck somebody that nobody really wants him to balk cause he

75
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.630
fighting next a baby,
a baby,
middle of a big baby,
big baby milk,

76
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.400
you know,
big baby Miller.
I haven't seen too much of him.

77
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.870
I don't know too much about him,
but you know,
he talks a good fight.
I knew,

78
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.550
I know he weighed,
weighed over 300 pounds at one time.
And,
and yeah.

79
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.780
And uh,
you know,
now he's got an opportunity to fight to Joshua.

80
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.490
So he's taken full advantage of it.
Like he should.
But you know,

81
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.610
I don't see anything in his history to show me that he can beat Joshua,
you know,

82
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.760
move,
you peak and he can,
he can bang though.
He can bang.

83
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.430
If you're there to Bang Josh.
Joshua got feed,
he's going to move.

84
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.370
He's not going to stay there and bang,
it's an excellent boxer.
Yeah.

85
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:03.820
He's going to be a small box here in this fight,
allegedly.

86
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.070
<v 1>We'll see.
Right.
I mean,
never know.
Yeah.
I mean this,</v>

87
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.330
this isn't one of those things where I think this is where Anthony has gotta be

88
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:14.020
extra careful because is going to train twice as hard.

89
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.270
And if Joshua doesn't train,
like he's fighting Deontae he's gonna.

90
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.190
He may take it for granted,
make a mistake

91
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.470
<v 0>and you can do that.
I've done that.
I've done that.
And it's nothing.</v>

92
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.190
It's nothing that he's done on purpose.
It's not,
it's like it's a mental thing.

93
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.310
Yeah.
It's a mental thing.
Like when you find Maravich yeah,

94
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.080
that guy wouldn't go home.
Wouldn't go home.
Gave me a lot of trouble.

95
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.770
It was at that fight gave me a lot of trouble.
Um,

96
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.790
<v 1>Lennox box,
this guy around the ring for 12 rounds,</v>

97
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:44.320
like literally the guys heads snapping back in.
This guy's not going,

98
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
not going to be well,
he was going nowhere.
That is,

99
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.560
that's gotta be a weird feeling to when you know how hard you punch and you see

100
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:52.130
a guy just

101
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.990
<v 0>eating them.
Like some people just are built weird.
They just can take a shot.</v>

102
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.450
No,
I learned that coming up.
I learned that like,
Yo,

103
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.990
some guys that are tough to the head or week to the body,
uh,

104
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.010
some guys are tough to the body week to the head and some guys just made out of

105
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.030
rocks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's almost like a ignorant bliss.

106
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.660
They just don't know they're supposed to feel bad,
you know?
I don't know.
I mean,

107
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:16.670
I really think it's a physiological thing.

108
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.430
I think some guys can just take a shot.
They just,

109
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.420
they're just built better sometimes of being in fights.
Where have gone in.

110
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:28.421
The man's hit me on the Chin first couple minutes and it's likely just glanced

111
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:32.870
off my chin.
I was like,
I ate it.
I ate the Puncho and it didn't hurt me.

112
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.080
And it was like,
what happens?
I punch.
It was so hard.
It hit you on the chin.

113
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.170
Everybody was saying,
Yo,
did you see that punch?
He never felt it.
I'm like,
no.

114
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.760
And when I look at tape of it,
it's like,
wow,
I did get it.
Hm.

115
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.610
Is it because like,
are there a bunch of factors?

116
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.840
Like how much you got hidden training?
How well you feel coming into the fight?

117
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.660
Yeah.
There's where you're at in your career and there's a lot of factors.

118
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.790
Like for instance,
let me give you a good weekend factor.

119
00:06:55.791 --> 00:07:00.791
If you have inbox for two years and all of a sudden you step into the ring and

120
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.390
it's a title fight and you box,

121
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.880
you got the first good hit you get is going to concuss you really because you,

122
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:09.440
you haven't been getting those hits for that lot two years.

123
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.910
Now this man hit you with a two years.
Uh,
um,

124
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.520
and you're getting used to it and you have,

125
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:19.730
you felt it and you've gotten over it.
You need to get over that hill.

126
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.480
Is it a mental hill?
It is a mental hill because even for me,
for me,

127
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.830
when I haven't fought for awhile,
you know,
I go out there until I get hit.

128
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.520
Once I get hit that wakes everything up was like,
Yo,

129
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.670
this is not supposed to go like that.
You're not supposed to hit me.

130
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.430
I'm supposed to hit you.
So I guess I could go in.

131
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.690
So the hot scene Rockman fight after it was over,

132
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:44.330
were you worried that you were going to get,
we're not going to get a rematch?

133
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.250
Yes,
I was very worried.
In fact,
we chased them two,

134
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:54.050
three courts around the world and the,
he didn't want to fight me and I,

135
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.110
you know,
if I was in this position,
I wouldn't want to fight me either because,

136
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.820
uh,
you know,
I'm coming back for revenge.

137
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.760
Plus there's a big money fight out there.
Would Tyson he so,
um,

138
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.870
so happened to say after the fight,
no more Louis Tyson,
no more Louis Tyson.

139
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:14.060
And he actually left um,
South Africa without visiting Mandela.

140
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.540
Like why you go African?
Obviously Mandela.
I did.

141
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.560
He just wanted to get out of there.
Yeah,

142
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.930
he just belt and that $7 million that he got off of Don King.

143
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.430
So the fight got made again because after the third courtroom the judge says,

144
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.430
whose signature is this?
I'll seem said it was his,
you signed it?
Yes.

145
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.350
Well you got to give them the rematch.
This is,

146
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.750
you signed it to give them a rematch so you have to give him a rematch.

147
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:45.980
So he didn't want to hear that.
So I was happy.
[inaudible] how long did it take?

148
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.570
Two years.
Two years.

149
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.890
And then was all at all those brawls in the member of the ESPN studio when him

150
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.830
and Rockman I got into a fight at a table and everything.
Yeah.

151
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.260
Clinics was wearing this big Steve Harvey suit.
Did you,

152
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.360
let me tell you it wasn't Steve RBC to,
cause I had this,

153
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.300
I'm going to have the slippers shoes in the world.
I didn't come there to fight.

154
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.010
Right.
I came there to like,
you know,
do press slippery shoes are the worst.

155
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.880
If anything goes down.
You got those leather shoulds.
Oh my God.
On carpet.

156
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.250
You know,
just keep walking away.

157
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.490
That's when you got to learn Jujitsu.
Now when you were in that time period,

158
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.030
I don't remember.
Did you have fights in between?
Uh,
yeah.

159
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.540
How many fights did you have after a rock?
Oh No,
it didn't have no fights.

160
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.730
No fights.
No.
I just trained for Rockman just waited.
Yeah.

161
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.160
So it took you two years.
Two years.
Ah.
That must have been so frustrating.
It was.

162
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.310
It was because you never know if you're going to get the fight or not or you

163
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.690
know,
these guys are running from you.

164
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.800
They signed to fight a rematch because you know,
now they didn't want to sign it.

165
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.720
I remember when that right hand landed.

166
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.870
I remember when I was watching it at home and I threw my arms up in the air.

167
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.710
I was like,
Oh shit.
Yeah.
I went to sleep,
sleep.

168
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.300
Let's,
let's check this out man.
I mean,
for a long time coming,

169
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.840
you're waiting for it.
You know.
For this,

170
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.110
this fight Rockman couldn't cut catch me cause my speed was different.
You know,

171
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:11.940
in South Africa was a lot slower.

172
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.220
Now he got kind of a little frustrated because he couldn't get his boom.
Yep.

173
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.080
Oh Man.
No.
Over the top of the shoulder.
Cortez,
let them count though.

174
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.120
Oh,
that was a phenomenal player.

175
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.170
That was probably one of the most satisfying one punch knockouts I've ever

176
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.250
watched.
Yeah,

177
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.120
because I knew what you had gone through and I knew like everybody knew you were

178
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:36.690
one of the greatest of all time,
man,
to have you get killed like that.

179
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.471
First of all,

180
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:41.790
it made it endeared people to you in a way because it shows your vulnerability,

181
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:45.870
but also your character and your ability to come back,
which is not easy.
Man.

182
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:48.810
When you get stopped like that,
like psychologically,

183
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:51.570
it's got to be fucking with your head.
Let me tell you,

184
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:55.620
the first time I lost everybody was coming up and shaking my hand and said,
well,

185
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.710
what are you going to do now?
I'm like,
what do you mean,
what am I gonna do now?

186
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.970
Yeah.
Well what you to do now?
I'm going to go back and when my championship,

187
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:05.940
I said,
okay.
You know,
they didn't think it was going to be possible,

188
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:10.941
but I'm thinking Muhammad Ali gained the championship three times,

189
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.120
so I've only lost it once.
I can do it again.

190
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.220
It takes a special person to do it and I can do it.
