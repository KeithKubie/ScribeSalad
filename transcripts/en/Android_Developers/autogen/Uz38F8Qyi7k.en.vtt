opportunities the first one is the

advantage that proved to us and now
 

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.420
advantage that proved to us and now
every new feature that we are developing

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:25.430
every new feature that we are developing
 

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.160
every new feature that we are developing
is based on this new modular architect

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.170
is based on this new modular architect
 

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.470
is based on this new modular architect
sure which means that turning those

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
sure which means that turning those
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.259
sure which means that turning those
features into instant app is very very

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:33.269
features into instant app is very very
 

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:35.750
features into instant app is very very
quick and it's almost painless so if

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760
quick and it's almost painless so if
 

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.240
quick and it's almost painless so if
your features are ready modular this

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.250
your features are ready modular this
 

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.269
your features are ready modular this
wouldn't cost you much and if they're

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279
wouldn't cost you much and if they're
 

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.829
wouldn't cost you much and if they're
not it's really an opportunity to

00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839
not it's really an opportunity to
 

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:45.889
not it's really an opportunity to
modularize record the second challenge

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899
modularize record the second challenge
 

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:47.990
modularize record the second challenge
was the sizes so your instant tab

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000
was the sizes so your instant tab
 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.480
was the sizes so your instant tab
shouldn't be more than four megabytes

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.490
shouldn't be more than four megabytes
 

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.829
shouldn't be more than four megabytes
and in those four megabytes you have

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839
and in those four megabytes you have
 

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.500
and in those four megabytes you have
shared resources which are not directly

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:54.510
shared resources which are not directly
 

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.840
shared resources which are not directly
your feature so we had to find ways to

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:56.850
your feature so we had to find ways to
 

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.310
your feature so we had to find ways to
reduce the the size of our instant app

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320
reduce the the size of our instant app
 

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.889
reduce the the size of our instant app
the first thing we did was to assess the

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899
the first thing we did was to assess the
 

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:06.560
the first thing we did was to assess the
libraries we had for instance we found

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.570
libraries we had for instance we found
 

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.259
libraries we had for instance we found
out that fresco was a library that was

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:09.269
out that fresco was a library that was
 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:13.189
out that fresco was a library that was
way too big it it was almost as big as

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199
way too big it it was almost as big as
 

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:15.470
way too big it it was almost as big as
the instant app itself so removed it we

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480
the instant app itself so removed it we
 

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.620
the instant app itself so removed it we
removed this one and we replaced it

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:18.630
removed this one and we replaced it
 

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.460
removed this one and we replaced it
button by another one and our main app

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:22.470
button by another one and our main app
 

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.540

now benefits from those changes in terms

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:26.550
now benefits from those changes in terms
 

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.879
now benefits from those changes in terms
of designs we couldn't with this four

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:28.889
of designs we couldn't with this four

this is something we still do right now

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:40.709
this is something we still do right now
 

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.910
this is something we still do right now
for our new features and our benefits

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920
for our new features and our benefits
 

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.280
for our new features and our benefits
from it results because the experience

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:49.290
from it results because the experience
 

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.980
from it results because the experience
is better with an internal app we see a

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:51.990
is better with an internal app we see a
 

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.620
is better with an internal app we see a
better conversion rate and that's once

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:54.630
better conversion rate and that's once
 

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.170

metric so when we have an increase in

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.010
metric so when we have an increase in
 

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.189
metric so when we have an increase in
conversion rate this means we get more

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199
conversion rate this means we get more
 

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:04.520
conversion rate this means we get more
money also we found out that this allows

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:04.530
money also we found out that this allows
 

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.260

not in their own country because we made

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.150
not in their own country because we made
 

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.350

we now have this share reaching 30% so

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.010
we now have this share reaching 30% so
 

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.490
we now have this share reaching 30% so
it's a good way of reaching customers

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:29.500
it's a good way of reaching customers

user flow we'll we'll try to reduce the
 

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.390
user flow we'll we'll try to reduce the
number of steps then one key thing we'd

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400
number of steps then one key thing we'd
 

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.730
number of steps then one key thing we'd
like to to make is develop the

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:47.740
like to to make is develop the
 

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.910
like to to make is develop the
restaurant page as an instant app as you

and most of this traffic is on the
 

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.360
and most of this traffic is on the
restaurant page because people type

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.370
restaurant page because people type
 

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.030
restaurant page because people type
directly a restaurant name so when we'll

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.040
directly a restaurant name so when we'll
 

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.860
