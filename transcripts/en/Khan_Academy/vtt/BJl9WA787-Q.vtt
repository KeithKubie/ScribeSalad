00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.750
- [Tutor] Rory suspects that
teachers in his school district

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
have less than five years
of experience on average.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.440
He decides to test his null hypothesis

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.320
is that the mean number of years
of experience is five years

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.990
and his alternative hypothesis
is that the true mean

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.750
of years of experience
is less than five years,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.040
using a sample of 25 teachers.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.260
His sample mean was four years

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.460
and his sample standard
deviation was two years.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.810
Rory wants to use these sample data

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.340
to conduct a t test on the mean.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.520
Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.250
Calculate the test
statistic for Rory's test.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.928
So I always just like to remind
ourselves what's going on,

00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:43.598
so you have your null hypothesis here,

00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:45.915
that the mean number
of years of experience

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:48.120
for teachers in the district is five

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.350
and then the alternative hypothesis

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.125
is that the mean years of
experience is less than five

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:55.140
for teachers in the district.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.510
So if this represents all
the teachers in the district,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.060
the population, then what
he did is he took a sample

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.960
and says he used a sample of 25 teachers,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
so n here is equal to 25
and then from that sample,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.220
he was able to calculate some statistics,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.698
he was able to calculate the sample mean,

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.820
so that sample mean was four years,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.860
the sample mean was four years

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.860
and then he was also able to calculate

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.120
the sample standard deviation,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.290
the sample standard deviation
was equal to two years.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.150
Now the whole point that we do,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.168
or the main thing we do when
we do significance tests

00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:34.380
is we say alright, if we assume
the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.880
what's the probability of getting

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:41.370
a sample mean this low or lower

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.070
and if that probability is below

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.580
a preset significance level,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.340
then we reject the null hypothesis

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.113
and it suggests the alternative,

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:50.820
but in order to figure
out that probability,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.830
we need to figure out a test statistic,

00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:55.662
sometimes we use a z test,

00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:57.516
if we're dealing with proportions,

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.840
but when we deal with means,
we tend to use a t test

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690
and the reason why is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.420
if you wanted to figure out a z statistic,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.620
what you would do is you
would take your sample mean,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.120
subtract from that the assumed mean

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.874
from the null hypothesis, so mu

00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:16.460
and I'll just put a little
zero, sub zero there,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.480
so this is the assumed mean
from the null hypothesis

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.320
and then you would want to divide by

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.010
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.700
of the sample mean, so
you'd wanna divide by that,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.910
but this, we don't know

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.940
and so that's why instead,
we do a t statistic,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.037
in which case, we take the difference

00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:42.824
between our sample mean and
our assumed population mean,

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:46.610
the population parameter
and we try to estimate this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.450
and we estimate that with
our sample standard deviation

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.004
divided by the square
root of our sample size

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.979
and so if you're inspired,
I encourage you right,

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.359
even if you're not inspired, (laughs)

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.230
I encourage you to pause this video

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.500
and try to calculate this t statistic.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.460
Well, this is going to
be equal to, let's see,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.890
our sample mean is four

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.640
minus our assumed mean is five,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
our assumed population mean is five,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.780
our sample standard deviation is two,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.920
all of that over the square
root of the sample size,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.480
all of that over the square root of 25,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.560
so this is going to be equal,
our numerator is negative one,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.020
so it's negative one
divided by two over five,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.775
which is equal to negative
one times five over two

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:35.310
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.250
equal to negative five
over two or negative 2.5

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.490
and then what we would do
in this, what Rory would do

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.360
is then look this t value up on a t table

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.996
and say, so if look at a
distribution of a t statistic,

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.010
something like that and say,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.650
okay, we are negative 2.5

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.530
below the mean,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.590
so negative 2.5

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.088
and so what he would wanna do
is figure out this area here,

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:10.720
'cause this would be
the probability of being

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.210
that far below the mean or
even further below the mean

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.970
and so that would give us our p value

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.960
and then if that p value is below

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.710
some preset significance level,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.074
that Rory should have set, maybe 5% or 1%,

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:25.707
then he'll reject the null hypothesis,

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:29.020
which would suggest his suspicion

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.626
that the true mean of years of experience

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.913
for the teachers in his
district is less than five.

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:35.939
Now another really important
thing to keep in mind

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.570
is they told us that assume all conditions

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.299
for inference have been
met and so that's the,

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.460
assuming that this was
truly a random sample,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.229
that each of the individual observations

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.499
are either truly independent
or roughly independent,

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.810
then maybe he observed
either with replacement

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.170
or it's less than 10% of the population

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.200
and he feels good that
the sampling distribution

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.426
is going to be roughly normal

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.970
and we've talked about
that in other videos.
