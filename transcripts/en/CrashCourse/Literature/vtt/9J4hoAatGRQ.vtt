00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.900
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course
English Literature, and today we return to
Romeo and Juliet, a tale of love and woe.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.020
Or else a tale of lust and woe.
Anyway, it's definitely a tale of woe.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:18.620
As the play begins, Romeo is telling us that
he is completely in love with a girl, and will never love anybody else, and her name is Rosaline.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.980
And a day later - A SINGLE DAY –
he has married an entirely different girl!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.120
And the whole thing is forbidden in a desperate and exciting way –

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.340
"My only love sprung from
my only hate", etc.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.480
And that makes me wonder, does romantic
love benefit from – or maybe even require – these
kinds of obstacles to feel intense and real?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.400
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Yes.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.180
Truly spoken like a teenager, Me from the Past,
because from where I'm sitting, true love is when
you're standing in line at a Chipotle, and you say,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.380
"I shouldn't get guacamole", and the great love of
your life says, "You know what? Just get the guac!"

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.900
And then you go home, and you watch TV
together while eating burritos.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.280
THAT's true love, Me from the Past, of a depth
and quality that you can only imagine and poor
Romeo and Juliet will never know.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.180
And not least because there were no
Chipotles in medieval Verona.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:13.160
[Theme Music]

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.380
So it's telling to look at the way that Juliet describes
her own feelings and the reasons for them.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.149
She calls their romance:
"too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.949
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.'"

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:30.200
But then in the same scene, she says:
"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.880
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite."

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.100
The lightning is over in a flash, but the
sea is infinite. Juliet also famously speaks

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.630
of her "true love's passion", which conflates
two very different ideas. As previously noted,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.909
true love is eating burritos together on the
couch in your sweatpants, whereas passion

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.869
never involves burritos. - what's that? What's
Rule 34? Oh? Rea- Wow. Really? Okay, yes,

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840
apparently passion occasionally involves burritos.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.399
By the way, this play is full of bawdy jokes,
usually told in prose, courtesy of the Nurse

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.149
or Mercutio, so it's not like Shakespeare
wasn't aware of sex without love. Are Romeo

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
and Juliet making themselves believe
they're in love to excuse their sexual desire?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.420
Would Juliet have gotten tired of Romeo? Stan, I
thought that we had established that these

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.330
were real. How is this... why is this happening... ah,
it's a metaphor, isn't it, Stan? Get rid of the metaphor.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.459
Possibly, Romeo can be a little bit intense,
like sword-fight-murder intense. And although

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.400
Juliet violently rejects Paris, the man her
father wants her to marry, he seems like a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.120
pretty stand-up guy, and in many ways, is
a better match for her than Romeo.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.470
So Romeo and Juliet's flirtation follows the
traditions of courtly love, a medieval concept

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.780
still popular in the Renaissance, that advocates
love at first sight, and forswearing all for love.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.680
But vitally, you aren't supposed to sully
courtly love with sex or marriage, and Romeo

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.720
and Juliet clearly do. You're supposed to
sit around and pine and be miserable for the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.459
rest of your Edith Wharton-ing life, like
Petrarch and Dante did, all these supposedly

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.819
amorous Italians, but all they ever did was
write poems.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.900
Right, so you could really read the first
couple of acts of Romeo and Juliet as a potential

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.569
comedy - girl falls for the wrong boy, they've
got to figure out what to do. So far, that's

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.659
the plot of A Midsummer Night's Dream. But
with those characters, there was no skoodilypooping.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.430
Romeo and Juliet do skoodilypoop, and sullying
their love with sex, even post-marital sex,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.720
proves kind of deadly. Oh, it's time for the
Open Letter?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
An open letter to literary sex. But first, let's
see what's in the secret compartment today.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.660
Oh, it's Shakespeare socks! Perfect, because Stan won't let me wear shoes, because they just painted the set.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.480
Dear literary sex, why you gotta be so fatal?

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.540
Here's an interesting fact - until about 40
years ago, every single human who was ever

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.629
born, was born as a result of sex. But to
read the great novels and plays of human history,

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.290
you would think that the mere act of having
sex is fatal, like 65% of the time. How did

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.200
we acquire all these Montagues and Capulets
if just having sex is so dangerous?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.930
And I've noticed that having sex is particularly
fatal to young ladies. And that doesn't seem

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.390
very fair! After all, it does take two, to
fandango.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.010
Best Wishes,
John Green.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
Okay, but as always in Shakespeare, it's not
quite that simple, and there are indications

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.090
that Romeo and Juliet may be, at least in
Shakespeare's conception, really in love.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.980
I mean, in their first conversation, they
speak a total of fourteen lines to each other,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.820
and those fourteen lines, when combined, form
a perfect Shakespearean sonnet. So this isn't

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.820
some random hook-up at a party; this is literally
instant poetry. And Shakespeare bestows some

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.510
of his most gorgeous lines of them - Northrop
Frye called this play "word magic".

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.570
Not only that, but remember, through their
deaths, this intractable conflict between

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.820
two families is ended. And in that story of
transcendental suffering and sacrifice, one

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.840
can't help but recall the more famous story of
transcendental suffering and sacrifice -- that of Jesus.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.010
So Romeo and Juliet don't really do much together
- if you think about it, they don't even actually

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.540
die together. Only a few days separate their
meeting and their deaths.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.540
We can see the play, then, as a tragedy about
time - how little there is of it - and also

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.850
about about youth - how we assign passionate
importance to things and people when we're

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.640
young, because we don't have the breadth of
experience to behave more moderately. Which

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.840
is maybe the tragedy of adulthood. Old folks, Juliet maintains, are "unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead."

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.900
But for me, the play is ultimately about having
to make difficult choices with limited information.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.630
This love, which feels real, and therefore,
I would argue, is real, has to be balanced

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.990
against responsibilities to your family, and to the state,
in the form of the Prince of Verona, and to the Church.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.990
In your life, are you going to seek what you
want, or are you going to listen to your parents

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.820
when they tell you what to want, or to the
state, when it tells you what to want? Until

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.130
the end of the play, both Romeo and Juliet
are trying to find ways to please all these

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.790
masters - the self, the state, the church,
the family - and that is what kills them.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.190
Had they just run away together, or hooked
up without getting married, in an un-churchly

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.960
fashion, they probably would have survived.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.580
Their love is an ardent and over-the-top response
to the violent and unjust world in which they

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.910
live, and the patriarchal authority that controls
that world. But they can never fully abandon

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.710
or reject that authority. And this is still
a challenge for teenagers, who are often dismissed

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.410
as idealistic or melodramatic, and who must
balance the intensity of their feeling against

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.460
the expectations of the world around them.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.870
Don't drop out of high school to follow your
dream of being a trapeze artist, honor thy

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.280
father and mother, register for the draft,
don't pass up a full ride to Harvard to follow

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.940
your girlfriend into the Marines, etc. Let's
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.640
As Harley Granville-Barker puts it, "Romeo
and Juliet is a tragedy of youth as youth

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.780
sees it." If you're young or have ever been
young, you know what it's like to be pulled

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.730
in many directions while trying to discern
whether feelings that are brand-new to you

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.340
are more like "flashes of lightning" or an
"eternal ocean". And you know what it's like

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.120
to want to live fully and fearlessly, and
maybe even a little foolishly. And the occasionally

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.620
tragic thing is that you are just grown-up enough,
for that kind of thinking to get you killed.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.080
Romeo and Juliet, to live the lives they want,
must also alter the world, or maybe even the

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.900
cosmos. They're always looking for night to
come quickly, or to stay late -- Juliet tells

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.910
the horses that draw the sun to "Gallop apace,
you fiery-footed steeds", a speech that was

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.450
considered so racy that many nineteenth-century
actresses wouldn't perform it.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.500
And in the next scene, after their single
night of wedded bliss,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.750
she tries to keep the dawn from arriving,
telling Romeo: "...it is not yet near day:

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.630
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear..."

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.220
Characters are constantly evoking light and
dark imagery, and calling out to the sun and

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.120
the moon, to day and night, as if they were
seeking some control over the universe. Because

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.830
it's they only way they can have all of what
they want - their families at peace, their

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.130
faith, and their life together in their hometown.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.980
But the universe will not bend to them, or
to anyone -- no matter how real your love,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.700
you can't avoid fate, and you can't alter time. Well,
except for daylight savings. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.160
So, that's one way to read the story - Romeo
and Juliet's hubris in believing they could

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.680
change the universe leads to their demise.
But actually, how responsible are they?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.520
I mean, there's a lot of bad luck involved.
There's the messenger's delay, the hastening

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.970
of the wedding between Juliet and Paris...

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.030
Now, in the source material, Brooke's "The
Tragic History of Romeus and Juliet," Brooke

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.870
makes it explicit that it's their own fault,
and they get what they deserve. But Shakespeare

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.860
is a lot more ambivalent -- the friar who marries
them worries that "violent delights have violent ends,"

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.880
which seems to imply that Romeo and
Juliet are to blame for their own undoing.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.410
But the play calls them "star-crossed," which
implies that their sad end was written out

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.490
by fate, before they ever even met.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.640
As with so much Shakespeare, and with great
literature in general, how you feel about

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.400
this question says a lot about you. And these
meditations on faith, combined with the question

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.060
of whether immediate attraction can lead to lasting love, have made Romeo and Juliet a story with legs.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.700
These days, it might be race that separates
the two loves, as in West Side Story, or religion,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.240
as in a 90's production in Bosnia that saw
a Christian Romeo and a Muslim Juliet.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.240
The obstacles may change, but the underlying problem
of love in an unjust world isn't going anywhere.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.130
It's tempting to dismiss the plot of Romeo
and Juliet as sappy, emo romance, but in truth,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.430
each of us will live out our lives having
answered, consciously or not, the questions

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.490
at the heart of the play. Do you believe that
fate is inescapable, or that people forage

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:11.250
their own lives? Is the fault in the stars,
or in ourselves? And will you prioritize your

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.470
personal wishes, or the wishes of your family,
or your religion, or your country?

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.530
If you think about it, Romeo and Juliet aren't
offered an easy choice. They could hurt family

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.410
members they love, or they can hurt each other.
Either way, there will be tragedy, and these

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.870
messy, ambiguous, ethically fraught high-stakes
questions are still a part of all of our lives.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.560
Shakespeare's gift to us is giving a voice
to them, in all their maddening complexity.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.120
