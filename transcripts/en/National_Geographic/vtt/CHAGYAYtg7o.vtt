[music playing]

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.166
The roots of war lie buried
deep in the human past.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.834
It has been a part of us
since before recorded history.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:26.166
At the dawn of civilization,
our ties to the land

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.467
drove us to protect
what was ours.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:32.600
We began to raise our children
not as hunters and farmers

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.333
but as soldiers.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.133
Fear drove us to
fight to survive.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.400
This primal fear
fueled the engines

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.266
of war, armies multiplied,
and our empires grew fast.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.400
But war is not only
fought with soldiers,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.867
it is fought with
inventions, the spear,

00:00:54.867 --> 00:01:00.700
bow, iron, gunpowder, the bomb.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.166
War pushes the
envelope of technology,

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.800
granting us God-like powers.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100
Tribal raids have given
away to nuclear missiles,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.033
smart bombs, and cyber war.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.734
Our instruments of
death have become

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:21.200
so powerful they now threaten
to erase humankind completely.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.166
But is there more to
war than meets the eye?

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.633
Is it more than just
a plague on humanity?

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:30.500
War has transformed our
culture and rewritten

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.166
the map of the modern world.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.533
Technologies have
revolutionized medicine,

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.867
transportation, communication,
changed how we live

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.200
and how we think.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.133
This is the story of how
war makes us who we are,

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:52.834
how it shapes not just our world
but our destiny as a species.

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.834
This is origins.

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.433
