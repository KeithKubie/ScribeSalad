hello hello my name is Ella and I come

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939
hello hello my name is Ella and I come
 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.110
hello hello my name is Ella and I come
from Croatia my question is in regards

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
from Croatia my question is in regards
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.020
from Croatia my question is in regards
to this even talking to theory about Big

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
to this even talking to theory about Big
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.249
to this even talking to theory about Big
Bang whether you agree with it or not

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259
Bang whether you agree with it or not
 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.939
Bang whether you agree with it or not
thanks bye so I hide Ella you're asking

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
thanks bye so I hide Ella you're asking
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.439
thanks bye so I hide Ella you're asking
whether I agree with Stephen Hawking's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
whether I agree with Stephen Hawking's
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960
whether I agree with Stephen Hawking's
theory of the Big Bang well Stephen has

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
theory of the Big Bang well Stephen has
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.519
theory of the Big Bang well Stephen has
been working on the details of the how

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
been working on the details of the how
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.950
been working on the details of the how
it actually works out and so I can't

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
it actually works out and so I can't
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.750
it actually works out and so I can't
really argue with his question about the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
really argue with his question about the
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.550
really argue with his question about the
details but I can tell you that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
details but I can tell you that
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.410
details but I can tell you that
astronomers have known about the Big

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
astronomers have known about the Big
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170
astronomers have known about the Big
Bang since 1929 and it was predicted

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
Bang since 1929 and it was predicted
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930
Bang since 1929 and it was predicted
even before that mathematically so it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
even before that mathematically so it
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360
even before that mathematically so it
was discovered in 1929 by Edwin Hubble

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
was discovered in 1929 by Edwin Hubble
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130
was discovered in 1929 by Edwin Hubble
who discovered that distant galaxies are

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
who discovered that distant galaxies are
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780
who discovered that distant galaxies are
going away from us with immense speeds

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
going away from us with immense speeds
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.450
going away from us with immense speeds
that are proportional to the distance so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
that are proportional to the distance so
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700
that are proportional to the distance so
that discovery back in 1929 told us

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
that discovery back in 1929 told us
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529
that discovery back in 1929 told us
immediately that something very amazing

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
immediately that something very amazing
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299
immediately that something very amazing
happened at the beginning of time and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
happened at the beginning of time and
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.520
happened at the beginning of time and
we've been thinking about it and working

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
we've been thinking about it and working
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439
we've been thinking about it and working
out the details ever since so there's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
out the details ever since so there's
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.200
out the details ever since so there's
pretty solid understanding that the Big

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
pretty solid understanding that the Big
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.439
pretty solid understanding that the Big
Bang really did happen and now the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
Bang really did happen and now the
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810
Bang really did happen and now the
question is how did it happen so we're

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
question is how did it happen so we're
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.189
question is how did it happen so we're
waiting for Stephen Hawking and other

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
waiting for Stephen Hawking and other
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080
waiting for Stephen Hawking and other
people like him to help us work out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
people like him to help us work out
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.689
people like him to help us work out
those details
