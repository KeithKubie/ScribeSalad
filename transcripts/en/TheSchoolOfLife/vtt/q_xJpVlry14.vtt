00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.220
One of the things that most strongly differentiates modern from traditional societies

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.580
is the business of rituals.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160
Broadly speaking, modern ones have very few of them;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.560
Traditional ones have a lot of them.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.920
What is a ritual?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.860
It's a periodic invitation by your society,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800
typically by its religion,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.900
to come together with other people for an event that marks an occasion,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.380
often of an underlying spiritual or psychological nature.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.480
Perhaps it's the start of the year,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.780
the birthday of a God,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.380
a day to apologize,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.800
or a moment to feel grateful for springtime,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.880
or the love of now dead relatives.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.640
And so you dance,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.520
say some rather formal words,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.640
eat an unusual food,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.260
or wear special clothes.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.960
And by doing all this,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000
you are, somehow, helped.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.540
Purged in some way.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.580
Helped to grow, transition to a new stage,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.860
reconnect to an important idea, or guided to inner peace.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.480
What marks out modern societies

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.540
is how ruthlessly they've stripped back rituals.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
Largely because they get in the way of making money.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.860
To generalize, when societies become modern,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.040
rituals drop out of the calendar and the main focus starts to be private and work life,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.640
and not much in between.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.280
A key part of understanding our own times is therefore to grasp the history of rituals.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000
What they have been, where they've gone,
and in what ways we might be missing

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.200
them today?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.100
Rome, 17th December, 150 AD

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.290
It's the first day of a three-day
celebration known as the Saturnalia: a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.149
ritual festival in honor of Saturn, Roman
God of wealth and agriculture.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.369
The Saturnalia is a time of ecstatic release
and exuberance. The Roman poet Catullus

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.430
describes the occasion as "the best of
times."

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.079
All the normal social codes and rules
are temporarily put on hold or turned

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.130
upside down.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.119
Masters are expected to look after their
slaves and parents to obey their

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.660
children. Slaves can't even insult and
poke fun at their masters with complete impunity.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.080
Important magistrate and public officials

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.140
wear colorful sometimes silly clothes and cones on their heads.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.629
Your meant to shout "Io Saturnalia" at
strangers when you pass them in the street.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.099
Married couples can have affairs and no
one is meant to be unduly upset.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.360
Women can make the first move on men or sleep with one another.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.690
There are orgies and you can gamble and
drink as much as you like.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.790
Then after three days of fun everything
comes to a stern halt and order is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
restored but life feels a lot less
bitter and oppressive.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.290
The slave is back to his dinner duties
but the memory of having called his

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.910
master a shit lighten his burdens.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.360
The mistress of the house is back to putting up with her boorish husband

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.500
but the two nights with
a hairdresser make a sarcasm and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.260
dullness importantly more bearable.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.140
Across Rome a great many people can't wait for the 17th of December to
roll around again.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.390
Alexandria, Egypt, 10th day of Tishrei, 969 AD

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.020
It is shortly after the beginning of the Jewish new year,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460
in one of the thriving centers of Jewish life,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.260
under the protection of benevolent Arab rule.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.640
The Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur is a Solomon critical event in the Hebrew
calendar.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.880
Leviticus instruct that on this date all
Jews must set aside their usual family and commercial activities

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.460
and mentally review their actions over the preceding year.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.190
Identifying all those whom they've hurt
or behaved unjustly towards.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.580
The ritual festival is kicked off by the blowing of the shofar:

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.380
a hollowed-out ram's horn.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.100
Then together in a synagogue the Jewish
community repeat in prayer:

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.820
"we have sinned we have acted
treacherously."

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.420
They then seek out those whom they frustrated, angered, discarded
casually or otherwise betrayed.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.840
And offer them their fullest contrition.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840
This is God's will,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.440
and a rare opportunity for blanket forgiveness.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.310
"All the people are in Fault" says the
pray and "so make all the people of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.190
Israel be forgiven including all the strangers who live in their midst."

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.300
The day of Atonement has the immense advantage of making the idea of saying sorry

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.740
look like it came from somewhere else
neither the idea of the perpetrator nor of the victim.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.780
Under the assumed eye of a benevolent God,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.060
it allows everyone a chance to make a
clean break and move on.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.020
Medina, June 12, 10 AD

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.820
It's the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.760
marking the first revelation of the Quran to
Muhammad.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.000
As one of the five pillars of Islam

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.590
fasting is obligatory for virtually all
Muslims,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.419
requiring abstinence from sex as well as smoking swearing and violence.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.780
Fasting is believed to cleanse the soul
by removing from it

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.960
worldly concerns and focusing on God
alone.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.260
It's admired as a way to teach self-discipline, self-control and empathy for those less fortunate.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.900
Adherence to Ramadan will provide strength and

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.159
spiritual growth for the upcoming year.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.119
Ramadan gives vital encouragement to an
enduring human desire:

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.900
the wish to start a fresh, reform oneself and lead a better life hence forth.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.020
But rather than these ambitions being left to the individual alone,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.889
Islam wisely creates a collective moment
to strengthen the will and it finds a

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.280
fitting physical activity to support
what is at heart

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.280
a spiritual endeavor.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.540
Gazelle Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, 1652

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.900
A mother has come to visit her adult daughter and grandchildren,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.520
for a few weeks in a village community of the Baining tribe.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.560
Now it's time to say farewell.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.949
There is sadness all around and the
mother and her guide head off through

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.719
thickly forested hills.

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.900
It may be a long time to mother and
daughter will see each other again.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.230
The Baining have developed a special
word to describe the feeling that can come over you

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.740
when a friend or relative you love has
left.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.740
They call it "Awunbuk".

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.440
Symptoms of Awunbuk include sleeping in, losing a sense of purpose and an inclination to burst into tears.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.980
But the Baining have also developed an
accompanying ritual to deal with the sadness of Awunbuk:

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.159
The people who have been left are granted three days during

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.159
which they're not expected to do any
gardening or hunting.

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.679
Everyone is supposed to behave very
gently around them.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.980
Then, on the third day the sufferers have to leave a coconut shell of water on the veranda of their house.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.839
It's believed to soak up sadness and
with a few ritual words they then throw

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.250
the water out into the garden there by
purging their emotions and signaling a

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.139
return to active life.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.640
The ritual of Awunbuk is similar to
morning rituals all over the world.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.400
It legitimates what might otherwise be
a guilty or confused melancholy.

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.929
It gives sadness a shape and a direction.

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:53.000
It demarcate a time for it

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.040
and then gently creates a moment when we meant to
overcome it and rejoin the group.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.500
Warsaw, Poland, spring 1798

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.800
It's the Jewish festival of "Birkat Ilanot"

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.110
which dictates that at the time of the
first blossom the community will gather

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.399
outdoors by some trees and flowers in
bloom to appreciate the beauty of nature

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.739
and honor the generosity of its creator.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.300
In the company of a rabbi, Jews recite a ritual prayer from the Talmud honoring
the hand that made the blossom:

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.560
"blessed are You Lord our God, King of the
universe who didn't leave a single thing

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.969
lacking in his world filling it with the
finest creatures and trees so as to give

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.009
pleasure to all of mankind.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.969
2,000 kilometers to the west, an English poet is also struck by the beauty of spring

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.620
and wants to express his enthusiasm and gratitude:

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.750
"I heard a thousand blended notes while in a grove I sat reclined" writes William Wordsworth

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.960
in the opening stanza of his
"Lines written in early spring" of 1798.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.640
Both the Jewish community and the poet appreciate springtime

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.380
but the poet is not interested in ritualizing his feelings.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.180
He is emblematic of a new age known as Romanticism which
believes in leaving people to feel

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.210
things at their own pace at a time of
their choosing.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.850
Religious belief is in decline across
Europe and for many rituals are tainted

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.000
by being associated with a supernatural.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.590
That's unfortunate even in the hands of
religions rituals have been guardians

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.820
are very important states of mind that
would otherwise be crushed or neglected.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.100
A book of poetry is in the end a hushed
object in a noisy world whereas a ritual

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.750
protects emotions to which we are
sincerely inclined but which without a

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.830
degree of fabrication and structure we
might be too distracted and

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.580
undisciplined to make time for.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.580
London, October 1834

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.740
James patterson, the governor of the Bank of England cuts annual, national or so-called bank holidays

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.840
to just four a year.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.700
Only three years earlier the English bank like many

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.370
English businesses had been closed for 36 days a year to make room for all

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.610
sorts of traditional ritual festivals up
and down the land.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.980
The bank's drive to slash holidays is typical of a hundred year long process that begins in the

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.520
late 18th century.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.520
The industrial
revolution has made it deeply

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.920
inconvenient for employers to let their
workers take holidays to mark this or

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.840
that ritual.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.220
The collective purification
of the soul is of no interest to employers.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.550
It's something you can do in your own
time.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.780
There are even suggestions to put an end to Christmas and Easter

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.680
which together cost industry of fortune.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.880
Nuremberg, Germany, 30th of August
1933

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.720
Adolf Hitler leads "The Rally of Victory".

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.180
700,000 people are in attendance.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.560
People sing marshall songs are gonna blast from speakers.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.080
There are banners of swastikas torchlight parades

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.779
and thousands of soldiers goose-stepping.

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:57.889
To engender a sense of fraternity flags are ritualistically touched against a

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:02.249
blood-soaked flag from Hitler's Beer
Hall Putsch of November 1923.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.940
Hitler speaks for hours on racial supremacy, German art and architecture and

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:10.519
an international Jewish conspiracy
threatening to bring down the Aryan race.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.470
Behavior like this hastens the modern
suspicion of any ritual behavior.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.650
Collective activity and excitement start
to seem ever more eerie mob like and

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.800
out of sync with an individualistic age.

00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.709
London, 30th of July 1966

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.349
96,000 people including the Queen of England

00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:33.920
take their seats inside Wembley stadium to watch England defeat West Germany in

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.120
the world cup final.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.760
32 million people are watching on TV.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.160
The picture of England captain Bobby
Moore hoisting the trophy is

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:45.620
immortalized by statue in East London
while the ball is canonized in a special

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.980
museum in Manchester.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.059
Rituals have continued into the modern age but they now tend to be around sport.

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:56.420
They're very limited in their ambitions
and lack a lot of the psychological

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.160
richness of religious minded rituals of
old.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.520
Australia, 26 of May 2015

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.080
The 18th annual Sorry Day is held in Australia, when white Australians atone for the

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:11.229
removal of 50,000 children from
aboriginal tribes.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.220
The day is a somber occasion for reflection with speeches from the indigenous Australian community

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.500
and politicians of all stripes.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.660
However, the day meets with little public enthusiasm and engenders little change

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.500
no compensation is awarded and many feel
the day obscures the still prevalent

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.460
kidnapping of children from aboriginal
families.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.040
Like so many modern rituals even once emphasizing important events in a nation's identity

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.320
national Sorry Day feels rather placid and in many ways token.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.700
The part of human nature the craved and created rituals has not been
eliminated but it is currently in many

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:53.269
developed societies quiescent or
unfairly tainted by associations with a

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.610
less admirable sides of religion.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.720
So a lot of what we used to do in ritual
ways we now do privately:

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:03.900
we have moments of carnivalesque
indulgence, we get drunk, have affairs

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.900
say sorry, purge ourselves and feel
grateful for existence.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.800
But we also do so without guidance and therefore our behavior often lacks boundaries or is

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.810
half-hearted or colorless.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.310
We also often just forget things.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.380
We have very few collective appointments with important emotions

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.560
but perhaps we remain in need of rituals all the same.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.420
Points in the calendar that help us in our endeavors to be sane and kind.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.320
A challenge for the future will be to
create new rituals every bit as

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.820
convincing as those of old with the
proper resources of art, music and design

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.240
that will take some of the burdens
off us as individuals.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.920
We'll have realized that being modern has not replaced our need for rituals.
