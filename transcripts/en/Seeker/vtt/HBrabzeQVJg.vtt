“One is the loneliest number …”

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.290
Hey everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.930
I don’t care how much Netflix and ice cream
you consume, being alone for long periods

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.250
of time SUCKS.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.580
It makes us sad, eats away at our self-esteem
and our immune system, makes us more susceptible

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.150
to chronic diseases and may even shorten our
lifespan.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.250
But could loneliness actually be a good thing?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
Loneliness is the emotional state that arises
from perceived isolation.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.210
Like Hunger, Thirst, and Pain, Loneliness
is an “aversive cue:” a negative feeling

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.000
that we want to move away from.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.980
Think of it as an evolutionary mechanism that
says “hey, you’re in danger and friends

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.460
could help”.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.220
Humans evolved to be social animals: groups
provide protection and shared resources that

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.220
help us survive.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.870
When it comes to gathering food, building
shelters, and defending themselves, communities

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.510
of humans have a much better chance of survival
than individuals do.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.830
And so scientists say, we evolved a “need
to belong”.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.000
In fact, loneliness may have been so important
for survival that we evolved a unique set

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.170
of neurons in our brains dedicated to it!

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.310
In a paper recently published in the journal
Cell, neuroscientists at MIT identified a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.990
region of the mouse brain that is uniquely
responsive to isolation.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.049
The researchers used a technique called optogenetics,
in which light is used to activate or inhibit

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.580
selected groups of neurons in a modified rodent
brain, to manipulate a cluster of Dopamine-sensitive

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.170
neurons in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus, (which
is a region of the mouse’s brain that’s

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.880
been associated with depression).

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.229
For now let’s call this special set of cells
“loneliness neurons”.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.170
In the study, researchers introduced a lonely
experimental mouse to a new mouse friend,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.319
and observed a significant increase in activity
of the “loneliness neurons”.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.020
Then they gave the mouse a choice between
spending time alone or with another mouse

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.829
and studied how optogenetic stimulation of
the “loneliness neurons” influenced the

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.670
mouse’s choice.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.189
Activation of the neurons caused the mouse
to spend significantly more time with a mousy

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.759
companion then alone, indicating that when
the neurons fire mice seek out social interaction.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.249
But was the mouse’s choice motivated by
positive reward or a negative experience?

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.119
To determine this, scientists let mice roam
around in a box that contained two areas.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.410
When the mouse spent time in one area, its
“loneliness neurons” were stimulated,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.840
while in the other area, they were not.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.819
Interestingly, the mice avoided the stimulating
area indicating that the activation didn’t

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.319
make them feel very good.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.380
This observation lead researchers to suggest
that activity in this brain region may be

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.760
connected to a loneliness-like state that
motivates mice to seek out social contact

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.849
to feel better.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.300
These finding reinforces the evolutionary
view that loneliness is actually a good thing,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.560
because it encourages us to seek social contact
and in turn keeps us healthier and safer.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.650
Even in just this study there is so much more
to the story, and if the research is extrapolated

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.050
to humans it could not only help to explain
motivations behind our own feelings and behavior

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.980
but also help us study what happens when those
things go awry.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.360
But before we all get too excited the neuroscientist
in me must extend a note of caution: it’s

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.610
important to remember that human brains and
mouse brains are similar in some ways, but

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.769
not the same and mice do not display identical
social behaviors to humans.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.609
But for now, since we can’t manipulate human
brains the way we do with mice, we have to

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.870
make do with what we learn from rodents...and
hope that somebody gave those lonely mice

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.110
a hug and some tiny ice cream and told them
that they’re terrific and it’s all going

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.190
to be okay… you’ll find somebody who will
love you for who. you.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.410
are. and you’ll never be lonely again…sorry

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.840
Well, if I haven’t managed to convince you
to stop staring at this screen and seek social

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:54.379
contact, check out this video by Laci on how
loneliness can kill you:

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.379
What about you?
