Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.070
Welcome to Smarter Every Day. So today's episode's a little bit different. I have a question

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.120
about breathing. It's pretty simple. See our bags are packed and we're about to go to the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.300
hospital to have our third child, and my question is this. How do you go from,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.480
this. My baby, in my baby.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.660
To this. Now 72 hours ago, my son was inside

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.710
my wife, and now he's not. He's no longer in a liquid environment, he is in

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.900
a gaseous environment. So something has to change, and in fact it's awesome.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.090
To learn more about this let's go talk to somebody that's smarter than me.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.270
Well, my wife could do it but she's tired. Goodnight
-Goodnight.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.360
Alright, so to figure out how babies go from living in a liquid

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.490
environment to an air environment we had to come to smart guy's house, so

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.670
we came to a doctor's house.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.860
Spiral staircase, you know he's smart. So, let's go check him out.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.040
Hey how's it going?
-Hey Destin.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.250
So this is Dr Schuster, and Dr Schuster

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.310
is, a baby delivery doctor we'll call you for the video.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
-Alright
So, he also plays music, so that lets you know that he's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.070
really really smart. So we're gonna get some info from him.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.750
[music]

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.300
OK so my question

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.470
is pretty simple. How do we go from breathing fluid inside

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.660
the mother's womb, to breathing air?
-As the baby's coming out,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.830
and gets squeezed as it's coming through the birth canal. All that fluid that's been in the lungs

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.000
which is the urine from the baby and the poop from the baby, I mean all the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.190
bad stuff. Once they get squeezed that stuff comes out and that baby takes that very

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.220
first gasp, that gasp of, oxygen.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.280
The thing that, that baby needs. That triggers huge changes in the circulation

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.350
of baby, and that's what allows everything to start working, the baby's breathing on it's own then.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.430
So there's actually like a switch that's flipped or something when the baby

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.600
breathes for the first time?
-A couple of valves that change the circulation, change the plumbing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.780
if you will, in the heart.
Really. So where are these valves

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.840
these valves are actually in the heart?
-The top half of the heart, yeah. There's something

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.020
called the foramen ovale, which is just a big flap that sits between the right and left

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.220
atrium. It closes, once that baby gets that first little bit of oxygen, that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.390
first breath.
OK so that's pretty amazing. So the first time the baby takes a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.590
breath, and that's why that first cry is so special, becase that's actually [clicks fingers]

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.770
the moment where the baby's, autonomous.
-It's all breathing. Yeah it goes from

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.950
breathing it's own poop, to breathing real oxygen, the real nutients that it needs

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.940
for life.
Oh that's awesome. Thank you very much.
-Any time. Glad to do it.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.340
Alright, we got a little man.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.430
Let's check him out. He's alive and well and his lungs are

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.510
working and he's breathing air. One thing that happened right when he came out

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.640
is, this right here. After he started squealing a little bit, I could hear

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.780
that [clicks fingers] change when he went from fluid to, air.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.960
The nurse brought him over here and she stuck this tube down his throat,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.140
and she starts sucking amniotic fluid. This little

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.340
guy started telling us what he though about everything. So check him out.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.520
Get in there, see his face.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.690
Mmmhmm.. That's what I'm talking about. Check this out.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.870
It's an ultrasound from 5 months ago when he was still in the womb. This is real data.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.040
If you look close you can see all four chambers of the heart.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.110
If you look even closer you can see that little thing that Dr Schuster was talking about.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.290
OK I didn't understand that so I had to get my wife to put it on engineering paper

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.480
so I could figure it out. So in your heart you have four chambers, and the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.570
blood, as it exits the lungs, it goes through the heart and comes back to your body.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.690
And after it exits your body, it goes back through the heart and then goes back

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.820
to the lungs. We all know this, but here's the deal with

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.990
the heart before the baby comes out of the womb. You have something here called the foramen 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.170
ovale, and you have here something called the ductus arteriosus. [newborn noises in background] I hear you.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.360
buddy, hold on. So what's going on here is, before birth

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.400
the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus divert blood

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.470
from the lungs, so what that means is only about 7 percent of

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.640
the blood flow goes to the lungs. [infrant crying]
Daddy's here, hold on.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.830
So, basically, before birth the lungs are really really

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.030
small. They're not inflated, because the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.220
which is right here, diverts that blood flow. So once it flips over,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.410
the foramen ovale closes in about an hour, and the ductus arteriosus

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.590
goes away and becomes a ligament after about 5 days. I think this is really awesome.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.780
You can see that the blood flow goes back to 100 percent for the lungs, and the..

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.910
Alright, I'll.. [baby crying] I can get him.
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.460
The nurses are gone, so I started messing around with

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.530
their stuff. 
Woah.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.600
Check that out. Alright. 
Now we turn on a super light.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.690
This is , this is

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.880
active tracking.
You asleep?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.560
-Not any more.
Just bear with me. Look at this, I found a magic wand.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.230
What? Alright so watch this.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.350
So, there's a big light spot, and if I hold the magic wand

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.530
at the light spot, and I start blinking away, the lights will follow

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.710
the magic wand. It tracks it.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.890
So it's

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.770
actively tracking this bulb.
