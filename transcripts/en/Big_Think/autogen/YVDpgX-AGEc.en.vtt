the idea behind snoop is that is that
 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.779 align:start position:0%
the idea behind snoop is that is that
the<00:00:41.940><c> places</c><00:00:42.540><c> which</c><00:00:42.989><c> we</c><00:00:43.290><c> select</c><00:00:43.770><c> and</c><00:00:44.040><c> craft</c><00:00:44.399><c> are</c>

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 align:start position:0%
the places which we select and craft are
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.500 align:start position:0%
the places which we select and craft are
rich<00:00:45.329><c> with</c><00:00:45.570><c> clues</c><00:00:46.100><c> about</c><00:00:47.100><c> what</c><00:00:47.820><c> we're</c><00:00:48.000><c> like</c>

rich with clues about what we're like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
environment what can you learn about
them<00:00:56.129><c> and</c><00:00:56.309><c> we</c><00:00:56.550><c> certainly</c><00:00:56.760><c> form</c><00:00:57.090><c> lots</c><00:00:57.239><c> of</c>

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 align:start position:0%
them and we certainly form lots of
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 align:start position:0%
them and we certainly form lots of
impressions<00:00:57.870><c> which</c><00:00:58.410><c> one's</c><00:00:58.710><c> the</c><00:00:58.980><c> which</c><00:00:59.280><c> of</c>

those impressions are accurate which

and<00:01:06.390><c> this</c><00:01:07.110><c> is</c><00:01:07.260><c> I</c><00:01:07.439><c> think</c><00:01:07.799><c> sort</c><00:01:08.010><c> of</c><00:01:08.100><c> the</c><00:01:08.220><c> the</c>

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 align:start position:0%
and this is I think sort of the the
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.990 align:start position:0%
and this is I think sort of the the
intellectual<00:01:09.150><c> kernel</c><00:01:09.450><c> really</c><00:01:10.700><c> interests</c><00:01:11.700><c> me</c>

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
intellectual kernel really interests me
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
intellectual kernel really interests me
is<00:01:12.210><c> how</c><00:01:13.170><c> are</c><00:01:13.470><c> we</c><00:01:13.590><c> connected</c><00:01:13.740><c> to</c><00:01:14.250><c> our</c><00:01:14.369><c> spaces</c>

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
is how are we connected to our spaces
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.070 align:start position:0%
is how are we connected to our spaces
and<00:01:15.000><c> I</c><00:01:15.030><c> think</c><00:01:15.210><c> we</c><00:01:15.270><c> often</c><00:01:15.390><c> don't</c><00:01:15.570><c> realize</c><00:01:15.960><c> it</c>

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I think we often don't realize it
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660 align:start position:0%
and I think we often don't realize it
cuz<00:01:16.229><c> so</c><00:01:16.380><c> automatic</c><00:01:16.950><c> we</c><00:01:17.070><c> just</c><00:01:17.280><c> say</c><00:01:17.340><c> oh</c><00:01:17.369><c> I</c><00:01:17.460><c> like</c>

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
cuz so automatic we just say oh I like
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.749 align:start position:0%
cuz so automatic we just say oh I like
that<00:01:17.700><c> photo</c><00:01:18.000><c> and</c><00:01:18.210><c> put</c><00:01:18.299><c> the</c><00:01:18.420><c> photo</c><00:01:18.630><c> up</c><00:01:18.869><c> but</c><00:01:19.759><c> but</c>
