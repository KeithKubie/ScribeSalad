Episode 15 Reform Movements

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.630
Hi I’m John Green.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.470
This is Crash Course U.S. history and today
we finally get to talk about sex.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.470
Also some other things.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.750
Today we’re gonna discuss religious and
moral reform movements in 19th century America,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.720
but I promise there will be some sex.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720
Mr. Green, Mr. Green.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.890
Is it gonna be about real sex or is it gonna
be able people who are obsessed with not having

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.890
sex?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.900
You got me there, Me from the Past.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.199
But how (and whether) we skoodilypoop ends
up saying a lot about America, and also people

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.920
in general.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.120
Intro
So, one response to the massive changes brought

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.570
about by the shift to an industrialized market
economy was to create utopian communities

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.190
where people could separate themselves from
the worst aspects of this brave new world.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.080
The most famous at the time, and arguably
still, were the Shakers, who were famous for

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.580
their excellent furniture, so you can’t
say that they really fully withdrew from the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.580
market system.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.600
Still Shaker communities did separate themselves
from the competition that characterized free

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.070
markets, especially in terms of the competition
for mates.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.280
They were celibate, and therefore only able
to increase their numbers by recruitment,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.329
which was made a little bit difficult by celibacy.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.479
But they did do a lot of dancing to sublimate
their libidinous urges, they embraced equality

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.220
of the sexes, and at their peak they had more
than 6,000 members.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.409
Today, they are still one of the most successful
utopian communities to have emerged in the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.450
19th century.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.500
They have three members.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.750
Much more successful in the long run were
the Latter Day Saints, also called Mormons,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.590
although at the time their ideas were so far
out of the mainstream that they were persecuted

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.670
and chased from New York all the way to Utah.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
In addition to the Bible, The LDS Church holds
the Book of Mormon as a holy scripture, which

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.799
tells of the resurrected Jesus’s visits
to the Americas.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.159
And while it was subject to widespread persecution,
and even some massacres, the LDS Church continued

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.270
to grow, and in fact continues to today.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.280
So, while some of these communities were based
in religion, others were more worldly attempts

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060
to create new models of society, like Brook
Farm.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.429
Founded in 1841 by a group of transcendentalists,
is a dependent clause that always ends in

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.100
failure, Brook Farm tried to show that manual
labor and intellectual engagement could be

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.469
successfully mixed.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.179
This community drew on the ideas of the French
socialist Charles Fourier, who as you may

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.810
recall from Crash Course World History believed—no
joke—that socialism would eventually turn

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.321
the seas to lemonade.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:18.810
And much like Fourier’s planned communities,
Brook Farm did not work out, largely because—and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.360
I can say this with some authority—writers
do not enjoy farming.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.610
Nathaniel Hawthorne, for instance, complained
about having to shovel horse manure.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.880
But if he’d only kept shoveling horse manure,
he might not have shoveled The Blithedale

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.610
Romances onto an unsuspecting reading public.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.610
I’m sorry, Nathaniel Hawthorne.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.300
I do like The Scarlet Letter, but I feel like
the only reason you’re read is because you

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.840
were, like, the only author in pre-Civil War
America.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.320
So either we have to pretend that America
began with Huck Finn’s journey on the Mississippi

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.860
or else we’re stuck with you.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.890
It was just, like, you, Thomas Paine, Mary
Rowlandson, a bunch of printed sermons, and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.210
James Fenimore Pooper.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.510
Anyway, the most utopian of the utopian communities
were set up at Utopia, Ohio and Modern Times,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.120
New York by Josiah Warren.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.140
Everything here was supposed to be totally
unregulated and voluntary including marriage,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.250
which, as you can imagine worked out brilliantly.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.060
But, without any laws to regulate behavior,
Warren’s communities were individualism

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
on steroids, so they collapsed spectacularly
and quickly.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.640
But these utopian communities were relatively
rare; many more 19th century Americans participated

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.730
in efforts to reform society rather than just
withdraw from it.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.680
And behind most of those reform movements
was religion, particularly a religious revival

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.490
called the 2nd Great Awakening.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.680
This series of revival meetings reached their
height in the 1820s and 1830s with Charles

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560
Grandison Finney’s giant camp meetings in
New York.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.870
And in a way the 2nd Great Awakening made
America a religious nation.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.680
The number of Christian ministers in the United
States went from 2,000 in the 1770s to 40,000

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.760
by 1845.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.280
And western New York was the center of this
revivalism.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.490
That’s where Joseph Smith had his revelations.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.820
It’s also where John Humphrey Noyes founded
his Oneida Community, in which postmenopausal

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.260
women introduced teenage boys to sex, and
which eventually ceased being a religious

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.200
community and evolved into—wait for it—one
of the world’s largest silverware companies.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.050
That’s right, every time you take a bite
of food with Oneida cutlery, you’re celebrating

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.950
free love and May-December relationships.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.540
Well, more like February-December relationships.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.900
(Libertage: Turning Free Love into Fancy Forks)
So, yes, religious fervor burned so hot in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.840
upstate New York that it became known as the
“burned-over district,” and New York remains

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.760
the heartland of conservative Christianity
to this day.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760
Or not.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.570
The Awakening stressed individual choice in
salvation and a personal relationship with

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.630
Jesus Christ, and it was deeply influenced
by the market revolution.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.680
So, like, while many preachers criticized
the selfish individualism inherent in free

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.660
market competition, there was sort of a market
for new religions and preachers, who would

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.650
travel the country drumming up business.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.440
Awakening ministers also preached the values
of sobriety, industry and self-discipline,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.810
which had become the essence of both the market
economy and the impulse for reform.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.820
There are three points I want to make about
the religious nature of all these 19th century

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820
reform movements.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.940
First, it was overwhelmingly Protestant.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.250
Like, all these “new” religions were protestant
denominations, which meant that they wouldn’t

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.460
have a lot of appeal to immigrants from Ireland
and Germany who started to pour into the United

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.430
States in the middle of the 19th century because
A. those people were mostly Catholic, and

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.060
B. reasons we’ll get to momentarily.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.780
Secondly, many of these reformers believed
in perfectionism, the idea that individuals

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.870
and society were capable of unlimited improvement.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.290
And third, many of the reform movements were
based ultimately on a different view of freedom

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.830
than we might be used to.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.400
And this is really important to understand,
for 19th century reformers, freedom was the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.760
opposite of being able to do whatever you
wanted, which they associated with the word

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760
license.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.710
They believed that true freedom was like an
internal phenomenon that came from self-discipline

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.400
and the practice of self control.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.360
Essentially, instead of being free to drink
booze, you would be free from the temptation

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.370
to drink booze.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.120
According to Philip Schaff, a minister who
came to Pennsylvania in the 1840s, “true

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.990
national freedom, in the American view [is]
anything but an absence of restraint … [It]

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.680
rests upon a moral groundwork, upon the virtue
of self possession and self control in individual

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680
citizens.”

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.050
Members of the fastest growing Protestant
denominations like Methodists and Baptists

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.949
were taught that it wasn’t enough to avoid
sin themselves; they also needed to perfect

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.430
their communities.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.770
And that leads us to America’s great national
nightmare, temperance.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.810
Now you’re not going to see me advocate
for prohibition of alcohol, but to be fair,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.240
Americans in the first half of the 19th century
were uncommonly drunk.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.710
In fact, in 1830, per capita liquor consumption
was 7 gallons per year, more than double what

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.710
it is now.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.400
And that doesn’t even count wine, beer,
hard cider, zima, pruno.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.180
By the way, some people like to have home
breweries or whatever, but at our office,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.180
Stan’s been making pruno under the couch.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.990
The growing feeling among reformers that we
should limit or even ban alcohol appealed

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.669
to those protestant ideas of restraint and
perfecting the social order.

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.919
And that’s also precisely why it was so
controversial, especially among Catholic immigrants,

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.660
who A. came largely from Germany and Ireland,
two nations not known for their opposition

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.850
to strong drink,
and B. were Catholic and the Catholic church’s

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.240
morality didn’t view alcohol or dancing
as inherently sinful the way that so many

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.690
Protestant denominations did.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.850
And then we have the widespread construction
of asylums and other homes for outcasts.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.670
Anyone who’s ever done a bit of urban exploring
knows that these places were built by the

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.100
hundreds in the 19th century—jails, poorhouses,
asylums for the mentally ill—and while they

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.650
might not seem like places of freedom, to
reformers they were.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.520
Remember, freedom was all about not having
the choice to sin so you could be free of

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520
sin.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.729
Bear in mind, of course, that the crusading
reformers who built these places usually chose

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:29.729
not to live in them.

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.820
And speaking of places you’re forced to
go regardless of whether you want to, the

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.949
mid 19th century saw the growth of compulsory
state-funded education in the United States.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.229
These new schools were called common schools,
and education reformers like Horace Mann hoped

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.580
that they would give poor students the moral
character and body of knowledge to compete

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.580
with upper-class kids.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.580
And that worked out great.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.820
Just look at where we are on the equality
of opportunity index.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.580
Now, this may seem like an obvious win for
all involved, but many parents opposed common

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.320
schools because they didn’t want their kids
getting moral instruction from the government.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.110
That said, by 1860, all northern states had
established public schools.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.710
But they were far less common in the South,
where the planter class was afraid of education

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.520
falling into the wrong hands, like for instance,
those of poor whites and especially slaves.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.330
Which brings us to abolition.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.100
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.430
Abolitionism was the biggest reform movement
in the first half of the 19th century, probably

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.480
because—sorry alcohol and fast dancing—slavery
was the worst.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.790
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the only challengers
to slavery were slaves themselves, free blacks,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.790
and Quakers.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.460
But in the early 19th century, colonizationists
began to gain ground.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.750
Their idea was to ship all former slaves back
to Africa, and the American Colonization Society

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.170
became popular and wealthy enough to establish
Liberia as an independent homeland for former

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.170
slaves.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.750
While the idea was impractical, and racist,
it appealed to politicians like Andrew Jackson

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.850
and Henry Clay.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.740
And some black people, who figured that America’s
racism would never allow them to be treated

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.350
as equals, did choose to emigrate to Liberia.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.320
But most free blacks opposed the idea; in
fact in 1817, 3,000 of them assembled in Philadelphia

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.470
and declared that black people were entitled
to the same freedom as whites.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.560
By 1830, advocates for the end of slavery
became more and more radical, like William

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.990
Lloyd Garrison, whose magazine The Liberator
was first published in 1831.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.300
Known for being “as harsh as truth and as
uncompromising as justice,” Garrison once

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.880
burned the Constitution, declaring it was
a pact with the devil.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.070
Radical abolitionism became a movement largely
because it used the same mix of pamplheteering

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.670
and charismatic speechifying that people saw
in the preachers of the Second Great Awakening,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.130
which in turn brought religion and abolition
together in the North, preaching a simple

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.050
message: Slavery was a sin.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.600
By 1843, 100,000 Northerners were aligned
with the American Anti-Slavery Society.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.440
What made the radical abolitionists so radical
was their inclusive vision of freedom.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.480
It wasn’t just about ending slavery but
about equality—the extension of full citizens’

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.410
rights to all people, regardless of race.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.170
By the way, it was abolitionists who re-christened
the Old State House Bell in Philadelphia the

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.170
“Liberty Bell.”

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.920
Why does all this awesome stuff happen in
Philadelphia?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.060
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.690
So, needless to say, not all Americans were
quite so thrilled about abolitionism, which

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.660
is why slavery remained unabolished.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.950
Often, resistance to abolitionism was violent—like,
in 1838, a mob in Philadelphia burned down

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.530
Pennsylvania Hall because people were using
it to hold abolitionist meetings.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.399
And you were doing so well, Philadelphia!

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:24.550
A year later, a mob in Alton, Illinois murdered
antislavery editor Elijah P. Lovejoy when

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.060
he was defending his printing press.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.860
This was the fifth time, by the way, that
a mob had destroyed one of his newspapers.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.640
Even Congress got in on the “let’s suppress
free speech and the press” act by adopting

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.250
the gag rule in 1836.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.640
The gag rule prohibited members of congress
from even reading aloud or discussing calls

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.760
for the emancipation of slaves.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760
Seriously.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.000
And you thought the filibuster was dysfunctional.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.740
The best known abolitionist was Frederick
Douglass, a former slave whose life story

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.410
was well known because he wrote the brilliant
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.410
An American Slave.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.980
But he wasn’t the only former slave to write
about the evils of slavery: Josiah Henderson’s

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.230
autobiography was probably the basis for the
most famous anti-slavery novel ever, Uncle

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.230
Tom’s Cabin.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.180
Uncle Tom’s Cabin sold more than a million
copies between 1851 and 1854.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.760
And despite the unreadable, heavy-handed prose
drenched in sentimentality, the book is a

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.190
great reminder that bad novels can also change
the world, which is why it was so widely banned

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.190
in the South.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.460
But while based on a black man’s story,
Uncle Tom’s Cabin was written by a white

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.270
woman, which shows us that black abolitionists
were battling not just slavery but near ubiquitous

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.270
racism.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.000
Like Pat Boone rerecording Little Richard
to make it safe for the white kids at the

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
sockhop.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.170
They had to fight the pseudoscience arguing
that black people were physically inferior

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:37.900
to white people or just born to servitude,
and they had to counter the common conception—still

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.330
common, I’m afraid—that there was no such
thing as African civilization.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.010
Oh, it’s time for the mystery document?

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.110
The rules here are simple.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.650
If I guess the author of the mystery document,
I do not get shocked.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.160
Let’s see what we got today.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.511
“Beloved brethren – here let me tell you,
and believe it, that he lord our God, as true

00:11:55.511 --> 00:12:00.300
as he sits on his throne in heaven, and as
true as our Savior died to redeem the world,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.060
will give you a Hannibal, and when the Lord
shall have raised him up, and given him to

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.269
you for your possession, O my suffering brethren!
remember the divisions and consequent sufferings

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:14.589
of Carthage and of Haiti … But what need
have I to refer to antiquity, when Haiti,

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:19.390
the glory of the blacks and terror of tyrants,
is enough to convince the most avaricious

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.830
and stupid of wretches?”

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.610
Alright Stan, this is going to take some serious
critical thinking skills so let’s break

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.610
this down.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.490
So the author’s clearly African American,
and an admirer of the Haitian Revolution,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.010
which means this was written after 1800.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.960
Plus, he references Hannibal, who Crash Course
World History fans will remember almost conquered

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.029
the Romans using freaking elephants!

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:38.620
And Hannibal was from Carthage which, I don’t
need to tell you, is in Africa.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.870
He also warns that Haiti is the terror of
tyrants, referencing the widespread massacring

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.930
of white people after the revolution.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.920
Okay that’s what we know.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.350
And now we shall make our guess.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.810
Henry Highland Garnett?

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.890
UGH I HATE MYSELF.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.890
It’s David Walker?

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.529
I’m not gonna lie to you, Stan, I don’t
even know who that is, so I probably deserve

00:12:57.529 --> 00:12:58.529
this.

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:59.529
AH!

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.529
That’s how you learn, fellow students.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.529
It’s not about positive reinforcement.

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.360
It’s about shocking yourself when you screw
up.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.140
I got a 3 on the AP American History test,
so I should know.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.810
So black abolitionists like Frederick Douglass,
Henry Highland Garnett and apparently David

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.400
Walker were the most eloquent spokesmen for
the ideal of equal citizenship in the United

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.029
States for black and white people.

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:18.040
In his 1852 Independence Day Address.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.930
By the way, international viewers, our Independence
Day is July 4th, so he gave this speech on

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.020
July 4th.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.970
Frederick Douglass said:
“Would you argue with me that man is entitled

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.970
to liberty?

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.269
That he is the rightful owner of his own body?

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:30.790
You have already declared it.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.350
Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery?

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.370
… There is not a man beneath the canopy
of heaven that does not know that slavery

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.820
is wrong for him.”

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.310
And in the end, the sophistication and elegance
of the black abolitionists’ arguments became

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.780
one of the strongest arguments for abolition.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.430
If black people were better off enslaved,
and inherently inferior, how could anyone

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.579
account for a man like Frederick Douglass?

00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:56.420
Abolitionism—at least until after the Civil
War—pushed all other reform movements to

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.420
the edges.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.620
But I just want to note here at the end that
it’s no coincidence that so many abolitionist

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.709
voices, like Harriet Beecher Stowe for instance,
were female.

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:08.140
And their work toward a more just social order
for others transformed the way that American

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.120
women imagined themselves as well, which is
what we’ll be discussing next week.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.200
I’ll see you then.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200
Thanks for watching.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.261
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:17.990
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.490
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.480
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.250
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.310
If you have questions about today’s video,
you can ask them in comments where they’ll

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.800
be answered by our team of historians.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.870
You can also suggest captions for the libertage.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.630
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:33.920
Gonna hit the globe!
