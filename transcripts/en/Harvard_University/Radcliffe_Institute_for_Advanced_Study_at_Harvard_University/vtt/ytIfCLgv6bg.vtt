[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.480
- I would like to bring
up James Santangelo, who

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.510
is a graduate student
in evolutionary biology

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.610
at the University of Toronto.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.650
And James is going to tell
us about rapid evolution

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.095
in urban settings using the
white clover as a model.

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:25.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:28.870
- Awesome.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.701
So thanks for having me here
to talk to you guys today.

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.700
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about some

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.200
of the work I've been
doing trying to understand

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.540
how species evolve in
response to urbanization

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.580
as part of my PhD.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.500
So as I'm sure
many are familiar,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.690
we're part of this new
epoch now that geologists

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.080
refer to as the Anthropocene,
in which human beings are having

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.800
a decisive impact on the state,
dynamic, and future of planet

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.971
Earth.

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:53.470
Now, much of these
changes are being

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.130
driven by urbanization, in
which huge swaths of Earth's

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.380
natural landscapes
are being converted

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.160
into human settlements like
towns, villages, and cities.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.920
And prior to 1990, the
traditional view of cities

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.290
was that they were
very much anti-life.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.690
Looking at a dense, smoggy
metropolis like this,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.360
how could it support
levels of biodiversity

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.100
that would make it
interesting or worthy

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.190
of study from a
biologist's standpoint?

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.500
And this is a serious
problem, because of course,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.590
urban environments are
distributed across the world.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.680
As of 2008, the majority
of the human population

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.600
lives in cities, and
urban environments

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.087
continue to expand
across the world.

00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:32.920
And so there's a pressing
need to understand

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.110
how species are
evolving or adapting

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.630
in response to these
changes, and whether we're

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.360
going to be able to recover some
of the species that are most

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.810
at risk.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.240
And so an emerging view is that
cities are living laboratories

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.140
of biological investigation.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.990
And I think this view is
emerging for three reasons.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.740
The first is because of the
scale of urban environments

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.830
that allows us to use
independent cities peppered

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.230
across the world to
test interesting ideas

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.180
in evolutionary biology.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.910
The second is because
work by urban ecologists

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.400
since the 1990s have
found that, rather

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.800
than decimating
biodiversity, cities

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.110
harbor unique
biological communities

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.132
and altered ecological
interactions.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.340
And so we know a lot about
how cities are influencing

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.234
the ecology of
species, but we still

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:19.150
know very little about
how they're influencing

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.100
the evolution of species.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.620
And finally, relative to
some of the other stuff

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.480
we've been hearing about
today, urbanization

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.109
is a really recent phenomenon.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.900
In the Americas, for
example, it dates back

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.899
but a few hundred years.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.140
And so any evolution
that we see in cities

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.890
is really rapid evolution that,
prior to a few decades ago,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.020
was thought to be impossible.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.470
And so we now recognize
that evolution in cities

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.510
could happen in four main
ways, which I've broken up here

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.210
into non-adaptive and
adaptive mechanisms.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.320
So the first, of course, is
mutation, whereby, for example,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.020
urban pollution causes
individual mutations

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.870
at the level of
individual-based substitutions

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.410
in the genome of organisms
that are living in cities.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.230
This is the one that we
know the least amount about.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.530
The next is gene flow, or the
exchange of genetic information

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.820
among populations.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.940
As cities become erected,
and we put barriers in place

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.820
like roads and buildings,
this limits the exchange

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.970
of genetic information among
populations of species that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.659
refuse to cross those barriers.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.450
And this can have really
pronounced effects

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.550
on the evolution
of those species.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.920
The next is genetic
drift, where you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.080
have an ancestrally
large population

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.360
with a ton of genetic
variation that

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.000
then gets fragmented into
a small population because

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.030
of the construction of a city,
and that small population now

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.087
contains only a small subset
of that initial variation.

00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:39.670
And then finally we
have the mechanism

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.500
that most people
are familiar with,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.230
natural selection,
or the differential

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.420
reproductive success
of individuals

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.260
leading to the survival of
some at the expense of others.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.470
Throughout my talk, I'm going to
focus on these three mechanisms

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.940
here.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.190
And I'm going to do so
using the model system

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.280
white clover that's been
the focus of my PhD.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.290
White clover is
an excellent model

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.830
for understanding the impacts
of urbanization on evolution,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.050
because its distribution
overlaps largely

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.159
with that of humans.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.200
You'd be hard pressed to
go anywhere in the world

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.720
where humans are found
and not find white clover,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.160
and this is because
of its history

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.701
in the agricultural
industry of being

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:19.329
seeded into agricultural
pastures for use

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.589
as forage and the like.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.160
And so it occurs
on a global scale.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.110
I'm going to focus on
a single trait, which

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.254
is the production
of hydrogen cyanide.

00:04:28.254 --> 00:04:29.920
This is a trait that's
primarily thought

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.560
to be involved in defense
against chewing insects.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.340
And it's populations
of white clover

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.470
are polymorphic for
hydrogen cyanide, which

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.180
is to say that, in
any one population,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.950
some individuals are
going to produce it,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.810
whereas other
populations are not.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.185
And this is going
to become relevant.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.810
And it's worth taking
a minute to study

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.670
the genetics of cyanogenesis.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.920
And it's relatively simple
from a genetic standpoint

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.540
relative to some of the other
traits we've heard about today.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.929
We have two genes.

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.470
The first gene
encodes the production

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.180
of cyanogenic glucosides.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.060
You either have a functional
copy or a non-functional copy.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.044
And I'm abbreviating
this gene as AC.

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:06.710
We then have another
gene, which encodes

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.500
the production of a
hydrolyzing enzyme, linamerase.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.450
And again, you could
have a functional copy

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.280
or a non-functional copy.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.320
To produce hydrogen
cyanide, individuals

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.980
require a functional copy
at both of these genes.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.130
If an individual lacks a
functional copy at either

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.900
of these genes, they
lack the ability

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.760
to produce hydrogen
cyanide, and they're

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.837
what we term acyanogenic.

00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:30.420
Now, this phenotype
has a long history

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.790
of study in
evolutionary biology,

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.070
dating back at least
to 1950s, where

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.530
we found
continental-scale patterns

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.430
in the frequency of this trait
in Europe, North America, Japan

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.970
and New Zealand, such that,
in the southern warmer regions

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.280
of the continent, you get
really high frequencies

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.070
of hydrogen cyanide
that gradually taper off

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.230
as you move north across
the continent, such

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.730
that in the north
of Sweden, there's

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.380
very little frequencies.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.450
And the change in the
frequency of this trait

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.310
across the spatial
gradient is what

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.010
I'm going to refer to as a
cline for the rest of this talk.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.960
And this cline is
thought to arise because

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.020
of the cost of producing
hydrogen cyanide in really

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.280
cold environments where frost
causes the cells to burst,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.500
resulting in hydrogen cyanide
being released in plants that

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.790
produce it, and the inadvertent
poisoning of that plant.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.860
And so in really
cold environments

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.330
where cells are prone to
breakage due to frost,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
there's active selection against
individuals producing hydrogen

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.060
cyanide, explaining
their lower frequencies

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.246
in the north of Europe.

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:35.120
And so what we're
interested in understanding

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.340
is whether the same
processes happening

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.380
at a continental scale
could be happening

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.540
at the more local
scale across cities,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.150
because of this phenomenon
known as the urban heat island

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.080
effect.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.230
Where we know that downtown,
for example in Cambridge where

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.450
we are now, it tends
to be quite a bit

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.940
warmer than outside of
the city in the more

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.340
rural regions pictured here.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.410
And so if the same
processes happening

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.500
at a continental scale are
happening on a local scale,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.510
then we might expect
something like this,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.340
where if we plot the
frequency of hydrogen

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.420
cyanide on the y-axis, and the
distance to the urban center

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.380
on the x-axis, we'd expect
higher frequencies of hydrogen

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.330
cyanide in the urban core.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.610
This would be the equivalent
of southern Europe,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.730
and lower frequencies outside
the city, the equivalent

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.524
of northern Europe.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.940
And so a previous
master's student

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.340
in the lab, Ken Thompson,
was interested in testing

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.090
this hypothesis.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.780
So he went to four large North
American cities, Montreal,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.000
Toronto, Boston, and New York.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.120
In each city, he collected
plants from 40 populations

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.830
along an urban rural transect.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.160
This is the one spanning
South Boston here.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.560
And in each population, he
quantified the proportion

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.650
of plants that were producing
hydrogen cyanide in any one

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.287
population.

00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:47.870
And he was interested
in understanding

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.440
how the proportion of plants
changes as you go from inside

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.100
to outside of the city.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.160
And what he found was
the complete opposite

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.040
that we predicted,
which is often

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.290
really interesting in science.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.530
And so we find that
inside the city,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.470
you actually have much lower
frequencies of hydrogen cyanide

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.240
than you do outside the city.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.280
Remarkably, he found
this same pattern

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.930
in three out of the four
cities that he assayed.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.930
Now, he tested a bunch
of different mechanisms

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.660
that could explain this
pattern, but ultimately settled

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.030
on urban-to-rural
snow depth gradients

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.560
as being the main cause.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.350
And the interesting thing
here is that, in the winter,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.750
the urban heat
island effect melts

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.700
all of the snow on
top of the plants.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.140
And so plants in
the city are then

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.420
exposed to the frigid
air temperatures,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.100
resulting in selection
against plants

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.960
producing cyanide
in the same way

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.549
that we see in northern Europe.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.880
Incidentally, the one city
that didn't show this pattern

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.570
was Montreal, which gets so much
snow that no urban heat island

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.400
effect can melt all
of it, and so there's

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.550
no pattern in Montreal--

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.680
pretty clear cut.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.740
There is a problem though,
which is that, one, he only

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.510
had a few cities,
and so we don't know

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.100
how general this pattern is.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.590
And the second is that all
of those cities get snow.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.090
And so we don't
have a control case.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.760
What's happening in cities that
never get snow or never see

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.162
frost?

00:09:04.162 --> 00:09:06.370
So I'm going to address the
following three questions

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.000
for the remainder of this talk.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.710
The first is, how
repeatable are these clines

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.830
across urban rural transects,
along a latitudinal gradient

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.690
in eastern North America?

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.660
The next is, can we predict
the presence or strength

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.900
of these clines based on
regional patterns of snow depth

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.550
or minimum winter temperature?

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.550
And finally, are there
any other mechanisms

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.700
that might explain the presence
of these clines across cities?

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.382
So I'll start with
the first question.

00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:34.090
At the start of my
degree, what I did was

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.710
I went to an
additional 12 cities

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.860
in eastern North America, all
the way down to Tampa, Florida,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.180
in each city following the
exact same sampling protocol.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.820
And so to show you some of
that data here, we have,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.100
again, the frequency
of hydrogen cyanide

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.190
on the y-axis and the distance
from the urban center.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.700
When we look across all 16
cities for which we have data,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.140
the pattern is clear.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.600
There tends to be, on
average, less hydrogen

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.840
cyanide inside the city
than outside the city.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.650
But there's variation
in this, and this

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.680
is averaged across 16 cities.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.470
It turns out that eight
out of the 16 cities

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.560
showed this pattern, which is
quite remarkable, because we

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.854
never see the pattern in the
opposite direction, which

00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:16.270
is starting to suggest that
there might be something going

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.700
on here.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.400
And I'm going to show you some
of that variation in a minute

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.580
when we ask whether or not
we could predict the strength

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.250
or presence of these clines
based on regional winter

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.650
conditions.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.050
If we could, it might look a
little something like this.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.390
Again, same figure that
we've been looking at.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.760
In northern cities where it
tends to get really cold,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.190
we would expect
really strong clines.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.780
But in more southern
cities where

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.660
we don't have that selective
agent, namely frost,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.200
we wouldn't expect
to see it at all.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.650
And so we would expect the
strength of these clines

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.830
to decline as we go south
towards the equator.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.750
If we look at the
data, here's a map

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.060
of winter temperature
on the background, all

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.020
of the cities highlighted here.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.570
What we find is
that in the north,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.400
we indeed do get strong clines.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.100
This is the one in Toronto,
consistent with the hypothesis

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.740
that minimum winter
temperatures could be important.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.500
But of course, we actually see
some of our strongest clines

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.211
in some of the southern cities.

00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:13.460
And so it's starting to look
like something else might

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.470
be going on here that we
can't quite explain yet.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.200
And so what's
driving these clines?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.750
So far, the data suggests
that frost and snow

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.550
can't be the only
mechanisms, because we

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.920
see strong clines in
cities that don't get snow

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.454
or don't get frost.

00:11:30.454 --> 00:11:32.370
They could be important
in some of the cities,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.500
but it's clearly not
true in all cases.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.210
We know that cities
vary in a lot

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.010
of environmental
conditions, and so it's

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.690
going to be important
to try to identify

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.410
what some of these drivers are.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.410
So I'd like to take a
minute to think about what

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.650
other explanations
might drive the repeated

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.334
evolution of the same
pattern across space.

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.000
And I want to take a
minute to emphasize

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.980
the role of neutral
evolutionary processes,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.030
because we've been talking a lot
about natural selection today.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.570
But it turns out that neutral
processes operate quite heavily

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.690
in cities because of the
small population sizes

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.090
where genes are
fluctuating randomly,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.720
and tend to be lost or fixed in
small populations with greater

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.710
probability.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.240
And so remember, the
genetics of this trait

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.070
requires that you
have a functional

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.040
copy at both of these genes.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.170
That means, if
both of these genes

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.380
are fluctuating randomly,
then for this trait

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.050
to go up in frequency,
both of the genes

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.420
have to go up in
frequency in tandem.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.000
If either of them goes
down in frequency,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.860
then the frequency
of the phenotype

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.990
is going to go
down just by chance

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.660
alone because of the
fact that you need

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.980
both copies in a population.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.440
And so you could
imagine a scenario

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.440
where you have a rural
population at equal frequencies

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.450
of both of these genes.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.090
As it colonizes
the urban center,

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.970
random fluctuations at
either of those two genes

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.150
are going to result in the
preferential loss of hydrogen

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.150
cyanide, potentially explaining
why we see less hydrogen

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.830
cyanide inside the city.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.820
So we tested this by developing
theoretical simulations

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.250
of urban evolution, the
first of its kind published

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.290
in a special feature
not that long ago.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.620
What we did was, we said,
what if urban populations

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.700
tend to be small?

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.250
And this is consistent with
much of the literature because

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.250
of urban fragmentation
breaking up the landscape,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.150
whereas rural populations
tend to be really large.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.550
We allowed the exchange
of genetic information

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.640
between populations, and we
were simply interested in,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.340
how often do we get the
same pattern that we

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.400
saw across space just
by neutral processes,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.220
without invoking selection?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.040
And we see that, under really
strong gradients and drift--

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.380
so when there's a really big
difference between the size

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.110
of urban and rural
populations, you actually

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.080
get, on average,
quite strong clines

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.180
in the same direction
as the ones that we saw,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.610
suggesting that genetic
drift on its own

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.280
could generate the
repeated loss of hydrogen

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.130
cyanide inside the
city without ever

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.320
invoking natural selection.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.570
As you decrease the
strength of drift,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.330
you get virtually no clines,
which is to be expected,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.490
because the populations
are the same size

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.750
across the whole transect.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.310
But of course, as you allow more
and more genetic information

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.530
to be exchanged
among populations,

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.720
looking only at the
strongest clines,

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.300
you see a gradual decrease
in their strength.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.150
And so this alone suggests
that the interplay

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.240
between genetic drift, which is
important in small populations

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.480
like those in cities,
and gene flow,

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.220
could structure
some of the clines

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.820
that we're seeing across space.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.690
And so to come back to those
three questions, the first,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.620
how repeatable are these clines?

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.680
We see them in eight
out of 16 of the cities

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.840
that we've surveyed.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.020
We know that frost could be
important in some of these,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.760
but probably not the
only thing going on,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.370
because we have really
strong clines in some

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.600
of the southern cities
that never see frost.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.050
And then genetic drift can cause
these clines on the same order

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.880
as those that we
see in the cities,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.700
but we have recent evidence
that suggests that it doesn't.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.780
And I'm not showing
that evidence here,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.690
but we have evidence
from molecular markers,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.260
for example, that shows that,
in the case of clover anyways,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.360
there is no increased strength
of genetic drift in cities.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.630
And so taken together
then, all of these things

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.470
point to natural
selection as being

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.320
the main driver of the
urban-to-rural clines that we

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.210
see across cities.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.130
Frost might be one
of the mechanisms,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.840
but of course, we
see this pattern

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.502
in cities that don't
see frost, so we

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:39.710
have to start exploring some
of the other agents that

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.210
might be responsible for
driving these patterns.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.740
And so what we really need
is more replication, so more

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.740
cities, and we need
these cities to vary

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.390
in environmental
conditions in ways

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.541
that might allow us to predict
some of these patterns.

00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:55.040
And so I'm excited
to say that we've

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.080
launched the global
urban evolution

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.430
project, which you can read
more about at this URL.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.130
And there's a fantastic
group of people

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.230
that are running the
scenes behind the project,

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.360
ensuring that everything
runs smoothly.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.100
But I want to highlight the
work of 570 collaborators

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.410
from 200 cities
around the world who

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.860
are collecting for us 160,000
clover plants from about

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.550
7,700 populations.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.520
I want to emphasize that a
lot of these collaborators

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.687
are using this as an
opportunity for outreach.

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.270
They're engaging
high school students,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.070
undergraduate
students, which I think

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.470
highlights the power
of urban evolution

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.020
to engage with local
communities and teach people

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.972
about evolution.

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:39.680
We're going to be
doing some phenotyping,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.490
so the hydrogen cyanide
assays I mentioned, but also

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.680
imaging and remote sensing
of all of these populations,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.950
in addition to generating
genome-wide data to get

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.230
a sense of how cities
are driving evolution

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.890
across the whole genome rather
than just a small portion

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.900
relating to the hydrogen
cyanide phenotype

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.610
that I talked about today.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.690
The key questions here, one,
do species convergently adapt

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.110
to cities across the world?

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.010
So do cities cause
the repeated evolution

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.960
of a trait in a single
species across the planet?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.099
And second, what are the
environmental predictors

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.300
of that convergent
evolution on a global scale?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.550
And just to give you a sense
of what this looks like,

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.109
every point here
represents a city

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.940
that's agreed to
collect clover for us.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.019
So we have pretty good
global coverage I would say.

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:27.560
People are really
excited about this.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.520
They're sending us pictures
every day on the Twitter.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.010
And so it's just really
great to see people

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.050
sending us pictures of
them doing fieldwork,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.470
and the data sets continue
to flow in on a daily basis.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.750
So pretty soon we're going
to have an answer to this.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.610
And I think projects
like this really

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.520
highlight that cities
are living laboratories

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.350
to study evolutionary
change because

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.396
of their global
replication, and especially

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:51.770
in cases like
white clover, where

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.380
we have the same species
occurring across the planet.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.590
And so I would say that
not only is urbanization

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.750
a global phenomenon,
but we know now

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.320
that urban evolution generally
is a common phenomenon.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.620
And all of the silhouettes
here represent clear-cut cases

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.540
where cities have
driven the evolution

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.850
in one way or another of the
species that inhabit them.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.020
And the goal is to, as we
accumulate our knowledge of how

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.080
cities are influencing the
evolution of life around us,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.180
we can start incorporating
this knowledge

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.640
into the design of more
sustainable cities,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.530
and hopefully get a
better sense of how

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.990
this rapid environmental
change across the world

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.240
is driving changes in
some of the world's

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.100
most susceptible species.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.100
And with that, I'd like to thank
my two labs, the University

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.140
of Toronto, and of course,
all of the organizers

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.090
for inviting me.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.380
I'm going to flip it
back to the picture

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.570
here, because it's
more interesting.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.380
And yeah, I'd be happy
to take questions.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.143
Thanks.

00:18:46.143 --> 00:18:48.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.280
- James, from the
first time I read

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.380
about your work in the
New York Times till today,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.120
you did not disappoint.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.500
The white clover rules.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.370
So, there is a question.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.410
Yes?

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:05.910
- Hi.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.090
I was wondering if
geological strata or building

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.930
materials are ever a
variable in this at all?

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.550
- Wow.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.800
No, not yet.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.430
In what sense?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.530
Are you thinking that
particular strata might--

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.370
- Well, yeah.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.290
How it affects soil
composition, and then

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.910
how plants might
adapt, not adapt--

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.832
- Oh, yeah.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.040
That's an excellent question.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.456
We have a student
in the lab who's

00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:29.942
going to be approaching that.

00:19:29.942 --> 00:19:31.650
We don't know much
about what's happening

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.620
to the soil in the city
relative to outside of the city.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.412
But I really can see
it as being important,

00:19:36.412 --> 00:19:37.786
especially because
white clover--

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:39.060
and I didn't mention this--

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.870
has a symbiosis with a
particular microbe in its roots

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.360
that fixes nitrogen.
And so you could imagine

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.550
if soil conditions
change and it influences

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.220
the ability of white
clover to form a bond

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.020
with this microbe
in the soil, then

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.940
that could have
potential impacts for how

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.850
it evolves in cities.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.520
But we don't have that data yet.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.830
But that's a really
good question.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.670
- Yes.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:06.290
- In your southern cities
that show the northern cline

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.660
pattern, did you correlate
that with the past winter,

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.737
whether they had snow
or other bad weather?

00:20:15.737 --> 00:20:17.320
- Yeah, that's a
really good question.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.470
So part of the
problem is that we're

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.130
trying to predict these
present clines with relatively

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.080
coarse regional
environmental variables.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.510
And so we actually need to do
quite a bit of a better job,

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.300
I think, of capturing the
difference between cities

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.740
and outside the city.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.480
In that particular
case, the data

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.280
comes from Bioclim, which is
averaged from 1950 to 2000.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.550
And so it sort of incorporates
some of those past conditions

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.000
as a single point variable.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.520
But yeah, we do need to
do a much better job.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.030
- Do you have any idea how
fast these things vary?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.660
Because if you have snow
in Atlanta last year,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.530
will that change the
population in the spring?

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.970
- I think it could.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.040
We know now that
evolution can happen

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.810
within a few
generations provided

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:10.890
that the strength of
selection is strong enough.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.062
We don't know whether
that's the case now.

00:21:13.062 --> 00:21:14.520
To answer that,
what we really need

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.350
is temporal
sampling, so not only

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.330
sampling along a
spatial gradient,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.660
but sampling the same locations
at repeated time intervals.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.300
And we just haven't
done that yet.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.470
- And yes, related to
that, that's a question

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.610
I had in mind.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.900
So the temperatures now are
just so extreme in all parts

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.310
of the countries.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.692
You would predict that that's
going to have some impact.

00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:41.150
You just don't know
what the impact

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.560
is because-- that's right.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.200
So the idea is to baseline
these white clover, so to speak.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.370
And then go after them after
extreme weather changes

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.150
or, I mean, is there
a biorepository

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.260
with all this information?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.930
Where do you keep
this information?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.590
- Where do we keep the data on
the white clover specifically?

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.070
Well, right now it's being held
primarily by our collaborators

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.370
or in our freezer at the
University of Toronto.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.710
To get a better sense
of how quickly some

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.090
of these populations
can respond,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.040
it would require going
back into the field,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.410
collecting more tissue
from these populations,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.120
and doing that over
enough years that we

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.340
could get a sense of
what is the change

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.000
in the frequency of hydrogen
cyanide from one year

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.150
to the next.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:24.650
- Right.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.560
So you would have some data
on the impact of moisture

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.950
and humidity on that phenotype.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.800
- Yeah, but really
right now only

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.300
from remote sensing or
whatever regional variables

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.610
that we could get access to.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.920
One of the downsides of
satellite data, of course,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.830
is that it's only
part of the picture.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.497
It's only environmental data.

00:22:47.497 --> 00:22:49.080
I suspect that some
of the things that

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.890
are driving these patterns are
actually species interactions,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.860
changes in the amount
of insect damage

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.510
as you move from
outside to inside

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.540
the city, which we know is
more important at southern

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.630
latitudes, and could explain
some of these stronger clines.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.360
But of course, you can't get
insect-plant interactions

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.380
from satellite data.

00:23:10.731 --> 00:23:12.480
And so hopefully I
could convince somebody

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.165
to pay to send me down there
and collect some of that data.

00:23:16.165 --> 00:23:17.040
- Well, that's great.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.920
I'm going to close it to the
five-minute question round,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.450
and then we're
going to open it up

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.810
to a full Q&amp;A, 15 to 20 minutes.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.530
And I invite all the
speakers back up, please--

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.030
Sriram, Alicia, Katie.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]
