we're going to talk about a classic

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
we're going to talk about a classic
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.430
we're going to talk about a classic
problem in mathematics this problem is

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
problem in mathematics this problem is
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.840
problem in mathematics this problem is
400 years old

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
400 years old
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.519

it's about sphere packing the question

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
it's about sphere packing the question
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.830
it's about sphere packing the question
is what is the best way to pack spheres

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
is what is the best way to pack spheres
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930
is what is the best way to pack spheres
and by best I mean what is the densest

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
and by best I mean what is the densest
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.240
and by best I mean what is the densest
way of packing spheres and it's thought

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
way of packing spheres and it's thought
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.660
way of packing spheres and it's thought
that the best way of packing spheres is

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670
that the best way of packing spheres is
 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.179
that the best way of packing spheres is
74 point zero five percent so if you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
74 point zero five percent so if you
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250
74 point zero five percent so if you
were packing a container it would be 74

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
were packing a container it would be 74
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620
were packing a container it would be 74
percent for now it's been thought that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
percent for now it's been thought that
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109
percent for now it's been thought that
is the best way of packing spheres for

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
is the best way of packing spheres for
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.500
is the best way of packing spheres for
four hundred years and it was finally

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
four hundred years and it was finally
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.370
four hundred years and it was finally
proven in the 1990s however the referees

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
proven in the 1990s however the referees
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870
proven in the 1990s however the referees
when they looked through the proof

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
when they looked through the proof
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.470
when they looked through the proof
thought they were 99 percent certain

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
thought they were 99 percent certain
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510
thought they were 99 percent certain
that the proof was right so that's kind

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
that the proof was right so that's kind
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970
that the proof was right so that's kind
of slightly unsatisfying so then they

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
of slightly unsatisfying so then they
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670
of slightly unsatisfying so then they
started a a 15-year project to really

started a a 15-year project to really
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170
started a a 15-year project to really
make sure that this is correct and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
make sure that this is correct and
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.119
make sure that this is correct and
they've rewritten the proof in a formal

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
they've rewritten the proof in a formal
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.830
they've rewritten the proof in a formal
mathematical language which allows a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
mathematical language which allows a
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900

Raleigh of all people so Otto Raleigh is
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300
Raleigh of all people so Otto Raleigh is
very famous in Britain but he's an

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
very famous in Britain but he's an
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.249
very famous in Britain but he's an

over a puddle so Elizabeth the first

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
over a puddle so Elizabeth the first
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690
over a puddle so Elizabeth the first
could walk over a puddle he invented the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
could walk over a puddle he invented the
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179

potato and other lies very famous in

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
potato and other lies very famous in
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190
potato and other lies very famous in
Britain I know and he wanted to know the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
Britain I know and he wanted to know the
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.219
Britain I know and he wanted to know the
best way of packing his cannonballs on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
best way of packing his cannonballs on
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.060
best way of packing his cannonballs on
his ships so he asked his mathematician

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
his ships so he asked his mathematician
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.990
his ships so he asked his mathematician
because everyone should have a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
because everyone should have a
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.580
because everyone should have a

Harriot

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
Harriot
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620
Harriot
so he started looking through the best

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
so he started looking through the best
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890
so he started looking through the best
ones packing cannonballs so perhaps one

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
ones packing cannonballs so perhaps one
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020
ones packing cannonballs so perhaps one
of the obvious ways of packing spheres

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
of the obvious ways of packing spheres
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450
of the obvious ways of packing spheres
would be something like this which is a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
would be something like this which is a
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030
would be something like this which is a
pyramid shape well with our triangle

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
pyramid shape well with our triangle
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980
pyramid shape well with our triangle
base so a tetrahedron he sees people

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
base so a tetrahedron he sees people
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749
base so a tetrahedron he sees people
stacking oranges or something in the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
stacking oranges or something in the
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.819
stacking oranges or something in the
supermarket that we one way of doing it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
supermarket that we one way of doing it
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980
supermarket that we one way of doing it
but another obvious way of packing

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
but another obvious way of packing
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.709
but another obvious way of packing
spheres would be a square base pyramid

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
spheres would be a square base pyramid
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569
spheres would be a square base pyramid
let's try that let's try that instead

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
let's try that let's try that instead
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.480
let's try that let's try that instead
break this apart let's try and make a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
break this apart let's try and make a
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.929
break this apart let's try and make a
square base pyramid juice a couple of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
square base pyramid juice a couple of
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.889
square base pyramid juice a couple of
extras here we go now it's obvious where

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
extras here we go now it's obvious where
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540
extras here we go now it's obvious where
to fill the next layer because we're

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
to fill the next layer because we're
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.190
to fill the next layer because we're
going to fill these dimples

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
going to fill these dimples
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.080
going to fill these dimples
here so let's do that so we can fill

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
here so let's do that so we can fill
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420
here so let's do that so we can fill
these holes with our next layer of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
these holes with our next layer of
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.089
these holes with our next layer of
Spears I'm gonna put that one there

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099
Spears I'm gonna put that one there
 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.330
Spears I'm gonna put that one there
let's put this one here let's put this

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
let's put this one here let's put this
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.229
let's put this one here let's put this
one here and if we're lucky we should be

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
one here and if we're lucky we should be
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.240
one here and if we're lucky we should be
able to crown this with our last one

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250
able to crown this with our last one
 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.820
able to crown this with our last one
like that so we get a square pyramid so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
like that so we get a square pyramid so
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.199
like that so we get a square pyramid so
that's another way of doing it perhaps

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
that's another way of doing it perhaps
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.550
that's another way of doing it perhaps
another obvious one would be with a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
another obvious one would be with a
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.410
another obvious one would be with a
hexagonal base so we'll get a look at

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
hexagonal base so we'll get a look at
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.880
hexagonal base so we'll get a look at
that too so let's try and make a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
that too so let's try and make a
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.380
that too so let's try and make a
hexagonal base so I'm gonna have a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
hexagonal base so I'm gonna have a
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.150
hexagonal base so I'm gonna have a
central one there let's make a hexagon

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
central one there let's make a hexagon
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.300
central one there let's make a hexagon
around the center and then for the next

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
around the center and then for the next
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.949
around the center and then for the next
layer we would fill in those obvious

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
layer we would fill in those obvious
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.589
layer we would fill in those obvious
dimples so that would be one there

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
dimples so that would be one there
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.670
dimples so that would be one there
perhaps one there perhaps let's do one

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
perhaps one there perhaps let's do one
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160
perhaps one there perhaps let's do one
there and I could crown this off with

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
there and I could crown this off with
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.350
there and I could crown this off with
another one but what I wanted to show

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
another one but what I wanted to show
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.699
another one but what I wanted to show
you and this is what Thomas how it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
you and this is what Thomas how it
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.610
you and this is what Thomas how it
noticed is that all those packings are

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
noticed is that all those packings are
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.289
noticed is that all those packings are
actually equivalent that all the same

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299
actually equivalent that all the same
 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.300
actually equivalent that all the same
and they all have the same density as

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310
and they all have the same density as
 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.130
and they all have the same density as
well which is going to be this seventy

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
well which is going to be this seventy
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.110
well which is going to be this seventy
four point zero five percent so you

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
four point zero five percent so you
 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.490
four point zero five percent so you
might be able to see that the hexagonal

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
might be able to see that the hexagonal
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.250
might be able to see that the hexagonal
packing is the same as the tetrahedron

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
packing is the same as the tetrahedron
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750
packing is the same as the tetrahedron
twine it's the same kind of a packing

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
twine it's the same kind of a packing
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.740
twine it's the same kind of a packing
layer-by-layer

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
layer-by-layer
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.240
layer-by-layer
that this is less obvious I wanted to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
that this is less obvious I wanted to
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.309
that this is less obvious I wanted to
point out this is also the same as the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319
point out this is also the same as the
 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.890
point out this is also the same as the
square base pyramid but it's tilted on

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
square base pyramid but it's tilted on
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.250
square base pyramid but it's tilted on
its side

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
its side
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.960
its side
look there can you see that square there

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
look there can you see that square there
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.780
look there can you see that square there
so that square would be the square base

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
so that square would be the square base
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.090
so that square would be the square base

that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.930
that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
slice up this pyramid into a box I'm

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
slice up this pyramid into a box I'm
 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.660
slice up this pyramid into a box I'm
gonna cut a horizontal line across the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
gonna cut a horizontal line across the
 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.850
gonna cut a horizontal line across the
top layer I'm gonna cut a horizontal

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860
top layer I'm gonna cut a horizontal
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.220
top layer I'm gonna cut a horizontal
line across the bottom layer so I've cut

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230
line across the bottom layer so I've cut
 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.690
line across the bottom layer so I've cut
them in half and now I'm going to cut

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700
them in half and now I'm going to cut
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.420
them in half and now I'm going to cut
four vertical lines so now I've created

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430
four vertical lines so now I've created
 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.960
four vertical lines so now I've created
a box and that box if you repeat it will

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970
a box and that box if you repeat it will
 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.880
a box and that box if you repeat it will
give you the whole packing so now I want

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890
give you the whole packing so now I want
 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.470

to know the density of the spheres

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
to know the density of the spheres
 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.210
to know the density of the spheres
inside that box

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
inside that box
 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.210
inside that box
well that box contains exactly one

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220
well that box contains exactly one
 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.540
well that box contains exactly one
sphere we've got half a sphere from the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550
sphere we've got half a sphere from the
 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.000
sphere we've got half a sphere from the
top and then from the bottom layer I'll

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010
top and then from the bottom layer I'll
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.680
top and then from the bottom layer I'll
cut it in half and then I cut it in

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690
cut it in half and then I cut it in
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.250
cut it in half and then I cut it in
quarters so I've got four eighths of a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260
quarters so I've got four eighths of a
 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.740
quarters so I've got four eighths of a
sphere so altogether that would make one

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
sphere so altogether that would make one
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.050
sphere so altogether that would make one
complete sphere so what is the volume of

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
complete sphere so what is the volume of
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.360
complete sphere so what is the volume of
one sphere well there's a formula for

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
one sphere well there's a formula for
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.370
one sphere well there's a formula for
that so that is 4 PI over 3 well R cubed

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380
that so that is 4 PI over 3 well R cubed
 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.200
that so that is 4 PI over 3 well R cubed
but let's just say it has radius 1

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210
but let's just say it has radius 1
 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.240
but let's just say it has radius 1
because there's no reason why not so I'm

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250
because there's no reason why not so I'm
 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.460
because there's no reason why not so I'm
just going to say it's 4 PI over 3 so

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470
just going to say it's 4 PI over 3 so
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.680
just going to say it's 4 PI over 3 so
that'd be the volume of the sphere now

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690
that'd be the volume of the sphere now
 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.780
that'd be the volume of the sphere now
the box that I've made well we've cut it

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790
the box that I've made well we've cut it
 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.120
the box that I've made well we've cut it
across and vertically and so on it would

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130
across and vertically and so on it would
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.270
across and vertically and so on it would
have a base of 2 by 2 so it'd be an area

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280
have a base of 2 by 2 so it'd be an area
 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.920
have a base of 2 by 2 so it'd be an area
4 and then we times that by the height

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930
4 and then we times that by the height
 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.050
4 and then we times that by the height
with a bit of Pythagoras you can work

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060
with a bit of Pythagoras you can work
 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420
with a bit of Pythagoras you can work
out that the height is root 2 so the box

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
out that the height is root 2 so the box
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.080
out that the height is root 2 so the box
would have a volume of or root 2 so now

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090
would have a volume of or root 2 so now
 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.850
would have a volume of or root 2 so now
to find out the density we're going to

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860
to find out the density we're going to
 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.770
to find out the density we're going to
divide the volume of the sphere by the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780
divide the volume of the sphere by the
 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.990
divide the volume of the sphere by the
volume of the box so if we divide

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000
volume of the box so if we divide
 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.820
volume of the box so if we divide
through you might be able to see we're

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830
through you might be able to see we're
 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.110
through you might be able to see we're
going to get a cancel out here with

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120
going to get a cancel out here with
 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.760
going to get a cancel out here with
these fours the density is going to be

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770
these fours the density is going to be
 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.570
these fours the density is going to be
PI over 3 root 2 and that figure is

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580
PI over 3 root 2 and that figure is
 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.510
PI over 3 root 2 and that figure is
something like zero point seven four

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520
something like zero point seven four
 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.100
something like zero point seven four
zero four eight and so on and that is

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110
zero four eight and so on and that is
 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.990
zero four eight and so on and that is
where our 74 point zero five percent

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000
where our 74 point zero five percent
 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.060
where our 74 point zero five percent
figure comes from there's the density of

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070

these obvious packings

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
these obvious packings
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.670
these obvious packings
and it might seem obvious that that

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680
and it might seem obvious that that
 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.110
and it might seem obvious that that
would be the best way of doing it I

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
would be the best way of doing it I
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.830
would be the best way of doing it I
think so

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
think so
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.080
think so
I think it's obviously the most dense

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090
I think it's obviously the most dense
 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.230
I think it's obviously the most dense
but proving it's the most dense that was

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240
but proving it's the most dense that was
 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.090
but proving it's the most dense that was
actually quite difficult so one of the

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100
actually quite difficult so one of the
 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.549
actually quite difficult so one of the
first people who tried to take on this

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559
first people who tried to take on this
 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.559
first people who tried to take on this
and see if they could prove that this

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569
and see if they could prove that this
 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.039
and see if they could prove that this
was the best was Gauss gauss one of our

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:46.049
was the best was Gauss gauss one of our
 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:48.739
was the best was Gauss gauss one of our
great mathematicians his name comes up a

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:48.749
great mathematicians his name comes up a
 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.629
great mathematicians his name comes up a
lot in these things and what he did show

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639
lot in these things and what he did show
 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.209
lot in these things and what he did show
was that this was the best packing the

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219
was that this was the best packing the
 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.999
was that this was the best packing the
most dense packing if the structure is

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009
most dense packing if the structure is
 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.089
most dense packing if the structure is
regular but he didn't show if it was

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099
regular but he didn't show if it was
 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.399
regular but he didn't show if it was
always the best so maybe there's an

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409
always the best so maybe there's an
 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.409
always the best so maybe there's an
irregular packing that would be better

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419
irregular packing that would be better
 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.859
irregular packing that would be better
than this that is possible so this was

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:06.869
than this that is possible so this was
 

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:08.989
than this that is possible so this was
still an open problem it actually became

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:08.999
still an open problem it actually became
 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.999
still an open problem it actually became
a very famous problem it became one of

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009
a very famous problem it became one of
 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.239
a very famous problem it became one of
David Hilbert's problems which was a set

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:14.249
David Hilbert's problems which was a set
 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:16.159
David Hilbert's problems which was a set
of problems for 20th century

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169
of problems for 20th century
 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.219

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229
mathematicians it was his 18th
 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.249
mathematicians it was his 18th
eventually though it was proven in the

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259
eventually though it was proven in the
 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.179
eventually though it was proven in the
1990s by guy called Thomas Hales with

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189
1990s by guy called Thomas Hales with
 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.389
1990s by guy called Thomas Hales with
Samuel Ferguson and what they did is

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:29.399
Samuel Ferguson and what they did is
 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.609
Samuel Ferguson and what they did is
they slightly changed the way we were

00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:31.619
they slightly changed the way we were
 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.459
they slightly changed the way we were
thinking about this so I'm going to try

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:34.469
thinking about this so I'm going to try
 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.709
thinking about this so I'm going to try
and show you what they did I'm trying to

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:36.719
and show you what they did I'm trying to
 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.509
and show you what they did I'm trying to
give you the gist of the idea would be a

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:38.519
give you the gist of the idea would be a
 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.519
give you the gist of the idea would be a
bit hand waving but we're going to try

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:40.529
bit hand waving but we're going to try
 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:43.279
bit hand waving but we're going to try
our best so imagine a sphere packing in

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:43.289
our best so imagine a sphere packing in
 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:45.259
our best so imagine a sphere packing in
three-dimensional space it's going on

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:45.269
three-dimensional space it's going on
 

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.389
three-dimensional space it's going on
infinitely and imagine it's as full as

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:47.399
infinitely and imagine it's as full as
 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.339
infinitely and imagine it's as full as
possible as well so there aren't gaps

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:49.349
possible as well so there aren't gaps
 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:51.379
possible as well so there aren't gaps
that are big enough to fit any extra

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389
that are big enough to fit any extra
 

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.999
that are big enough to fit any extra
spheres in so this is as full as

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:53.009
spheres in so this is as full as
 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:53.479
spheres in so this is as full as
possible

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:53.489
possible
 

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:57.139
possible
now each sphere is defined by its center

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:57.149
now each sphere is defined by its center
 

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.689
now each sphere is defined by its center
so instead of a problem of packing

00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699
so instead of a problem of packing
 

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.009
so instead of a problem of packing
spheres you can think of it off the

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:01.019
spheres you can think of it off the
 

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.859
spheres you can think of it off the
problem of points in space so like a

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:03.869
problem of points in space so like a
 

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:07.309
problem of points in space so like a
network points in space each sphere had

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319
network points in space each sphere had
 

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.859
network points in space each sphere had
a radius of one then these points would

00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:09.869
a radius of one then these points would
 

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:12.679
a radius of one then these points would
have to be at least two units apart so

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:12.689
have to be at least two units apart so
 

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:13.879
have to be at least two units apart so
what they did is they started looking at

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:13.889
what they did is they started looking at
 

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:16.159
what they did is they started looking at
the local structure near a given sphere

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:16.169
the local structure near a given sphere
 

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:17.659
the local structure near a given sphere
I'll show you the sort of thing I mean

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
I'll show you the sort of thing I mean
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.299
I'll show you the sort of thing I mean
if we had say one of the hexagonal

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:20.309
if we had say one of the hexagonal
 

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:22.429
if we had say one of the hexagonal
packings let's do that let's say we have

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:22.439
packings let's do that let's say we have
 

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:24.109
packings let's do that let's say we have
this Center sphere here the local

00:08:24.109 --> 00:08:24.119
this Center sphere here the local
 

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:25.999
this Center sphere here the local
structure to that would be these six

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:26.009
structure to that would be these six
 

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:28.129
structure to that would be these six
Spears going around the equator there

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139
Spears going around the equator there
 

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.869
Spears going around the equator there
would be three spheres at the top and

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879
would be three spheres at the top and
 

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.089
would be three spheres at the top and
three spheres below it so that would be

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099
three spheres below it so that would be
 

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.799
three spheres below it so that would be
the local structure around that

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:33.809
the local structure around that
 

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.919
the local structure around that
hexagonal packing now they would give

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:36.929
hexagonal packing now they would give
 

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.319
hexagonal packing now they would give
the local structure a score now that's

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:39.329
the local structure a score now that's
 

00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:40.519
the local structure a score now that's
just a number there's a technical

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:40.529
just a number there's a technical
 

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:41.899
just a number there's a technical
definition for that and they would give

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:41.909
definition for that and they would give
 

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.110
definition for that and they would give
it a number now if each local structure

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120
it a number now if each local structure
 

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.169
it a number now if each local structure
has a score less than the hexagonal

00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:48.179
has a score less than the hexagonal
 

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:50.540
has a score less than the hexagonal
packing score then they've proven the

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.550
packing score then they've proven the
 

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.129
packing score then they've proven the
conjecture so that means that the

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:52.139
conjecture so that means that the
 

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:52.920
conjecture so that means that the
hexagonal pack

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:52.930
hexagonal pack
 

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.290
hexagonal pack
would be the densest packing so now the

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:55.300
would be the densest packing so now the
 

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.110
would be the densest packing so now the
question was is there a local structure

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120
question was is there a local structure
 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.810
question was is there a local structure
that has a score greater than the

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:00.820
that has a score greater than the
 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.130
that has a score greater than the
hexagonal packing is there a

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.140
hexagonal packing is there a
 

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.530
hexagonal packing is there a
counterexample so what they did is they

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.540
counterexample so what they did is they
 

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.840
counterexample so what they did is they
created a list of five thousand

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:06.850
created a list of five thousand
 

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.050
created a list of five thousand
potential counter examples eventually

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.060
potential counter examples eventually
 

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.730
potential counter examples eventually
they actually whittled that down a bit

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:11.740
they actually whittled that down a bit
 

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.560
they actually whittled that down a bit
to about 100 and then they just checked

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:13.570
to about 100 and then they just checked
 

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.150
to about 100 and then they just checked
them they just checked them one at a

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160
them they just checked them one at a
 

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.850
them they just checked them one at a
time to see the score and if each one

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:17.860
time to see the score and if each one
 

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.790
time to see the score and if each one
has a score less than the hexagonal

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800
has a score less than the hexagonal
 

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.560
has a score less than the hexagonal
packing you can dismiss it and

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.570
packing you can dismiss it and
 

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.570
packing you can dismiss it and
eventually they were able to dismiss all

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:24.580
eventually they were able to dismiss all
 

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.720
eventually they were able to dismiss all
of 100 of these potential counter

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.730
of 100 of these potential counter
 

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.550
of 100 of these potential counter
examples which means there are no

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560
examples which means there are no
 

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.370
examples which means there are no
counter examples and that proves the

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.380
counter examples and that proves the
 

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.290
counter examples and that proves the
conjecture that means that the hexagonal

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.300
conjecture that means that the hexagonal
 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.710
conjecture that means that the hexagonal
packing is indeed the densest packing

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720
packing is indeed the densest packing
 

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.340
packing is indeed the densest packing
possible 74 point zero five percent and

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.350
possible 74 point zero five percent and
 

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.900
possible 74 point zero five percent and
it was a series of papers throughout the

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:42.910
it was a series of papers throughout the
 

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.630
it was a series of papers throughout the
90s and the theoretical stuff is

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640
90s and the theoretical stuff is
 

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.070
90s and the theoretical stuff is
traditional mathematics and then when

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.080
traditional mathematics and then when
 

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.449
traditional mathematics and then when
they started checking through these

00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:48.459
they started checking through these
 

00:09:48.459 --> 00:09:50.730
they started checking through these
counter examples that was what was done

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:50.740
counter examples that was what was done
 

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.250
counter examples that was what was done
by computer and this is why they were

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.260
by computer and this is why they were
 

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.579
by computer and this is why they were
slightly unsure if the proof was 100%

00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:56.589
slightly unsure if the proof was 100%
 

00:09:56.589 --> 00:09:59.100
slightly unsure if the proof was 100%
correct because he can't check the

00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.110
correct because he can't check the
 

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.260
correct because he can't check the
computers working really so that's why

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.270
computers working really so that's why
 

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.170
computers working really so that's why
they started this project this 15-year

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:04.180
they started this project this 15-year
 

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.090
they started this project this 15-year
project it turned out to be where they

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.100
project it turned out to be where they
 

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.910
project it turned out to be where they
wanted to formulize the proof so they

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920
wanted to formulize the proof so they
 

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.199
wanted to formulize the proof so they
turned to their proof into this

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:10.209
turned to their proof into this
 

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.990
turned to their proof into this
extremely formal mathematical language

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000
extremely formal mathematical language
 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.690
extremely formal mathematical language
which was formal enough that a computer

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:15.700
which was formal enough that a computer
 

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.680
which was formal enough that a computer
can automatically check it I think

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:19.690
can automatically check it I think
 

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.000
can automatically check it I think
that's pretty efficient actually and

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.010
that's pretty efficient actually and
 

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.070
that's pretty efficient actually and
because I know people have tried to do

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.080
because I know people have tried to do
 

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.990
because I know people have tried to do
this experiment early so if you were

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000
this experiment early so if you were
 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.380
this experiment early so if you were
transporting grain or something that's

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:28.390
transporting grain or something that's
 

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.600
transporting grain or something that's
like a sphere and you just let it

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:30.610
like a sphere and you just let it
 

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.990
like a sphere and you just let it
loosely settle down I think you get

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000
loosely settle down I think you get
 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.949
loosely settle down I think you get
naturally something like 64% so clearly

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959
naturally something like 64% so clearly
 

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:40.140
naturally something like 64% so clearly
if you make a structured packing like

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.150
if you make a structured packing like
 

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.370
if you make a structured packing like
this you're getting something much

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:41.380
this you're getting something much
 

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.380
this you're getting something much
better than that so the conjecture was

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.390
better than that so the conjecture was
 

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.569
better than that so the conjecture was
finally proven which means that seventy

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:45.579
finally proven which means that seventy
 

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:47.850
finally proven which means that seventy

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560
densest packing of spheres including all
 

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.680

possible regular packings all possible

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:52.690
possible regular packings all possible
 

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.960

irregular packings and it has some

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.970
irregular packings and it has some
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.360
irregular packings and it has some
rather surprising applications as well

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:57.370
rather surprising applications as well
 

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.150
rather surprising applications as well
so it can be applied to if you're

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160
so it can be applied to if you're
 

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.680
so it can be applied to if you're
looking at the structures on atoms

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:01.690
looking at the structures on atoms
 

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.199
looking at the structures on atoms
surprisingly I think it can also be used

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:04.209
surprisingly I think it can also be used
 

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:06.370
surprisingly I think it can also be used
