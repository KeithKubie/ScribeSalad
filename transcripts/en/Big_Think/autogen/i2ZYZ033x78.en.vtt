when you get into the astronaut corps

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340
when you get into the astronaut corps
 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.639
when you get into the astronaut corps
there are two things that you have to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
there are two things that you have to
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.660
there are two things that you have to
demonstrate to fly on a either a shuttle

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
demonstrate to fly on a either a shuttle
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.870

or a a Space Station mission and they

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
or a a Space Station mission and they
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.100
or a a Space Station mission and they
are the ability to go into this you know

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110
are the ability to go into this you know
 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.800
are the ability to go into this you know
this 300 pound suit and do something

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
this 300 pound suit and do something
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.930
this 300 pound suit and do something
called space walking and the way that

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940
called space walking and the way that
 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.370
called space walking and the way that
you train for that is you get in this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
you train for that is you get in this
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160
you train for that is you get in this
white suit that's pressurized and you go

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
white suit that's pressurized and you go
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.189

and creating the space station under

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789
and creating the space station under
 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.239
and creating the space station under
underneath the the pool deck there was a

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249
underneath the the pool deck there was a
 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.399

shuttle so that's how you demonstrate

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179
shuttle so that's how you demonstrate
 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.489
shuttle so that's how you demonstrate
that and and when I have my chance to

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499
that and and when I have my chance to
 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.579
that and and when I have my chance to
train in that environment I had an

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589
train in that environment I had an
 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.379
train in that environment I had an
accident where I lost all my hearing and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389

got into the astronaut program then you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
got into the astronaut program then you
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490
