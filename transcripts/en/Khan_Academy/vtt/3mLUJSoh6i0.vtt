00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.250
Let's continue with the
30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.640
So just review what we just
learned, or hopefully learned--

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.910
at minimum what we just saw,
--is if we have a 30, 60, 90 --

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.380
and once again, remember: this
is only applies to 30, 60, 90

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.560
triangles --and if I were to
say the hypotenuse is of length

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.320
h, we learned that the side
opposite the 30-degree angle,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340
and this is the shortest side
of the triangle, is going to be

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.270
h over 2, or 1/2 times
the hypotenuse.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.240
And we also learned that the
longer side, or the side

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.810
opposite the 60-degree side,
is equal to the square

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.840
root of 3 over 2 times h.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.640
So let's do a problem where
we use this information.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.370
Let's say I had this
triangle right here.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010
It's a 90-degree triangle;
let's say that this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.690
is 30 degrees.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750
And we could also figure out
obviously if that's 30, this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.040
is 90, that this is
also 60 degrees.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.510
And let's say that the
hypotenuse is 12.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.300
The length is 12 and we know
that this is the hypotenuse

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.980
because it's opposite
the right angle.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.630
What is the side right here?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.840
Well, is the side opposite the
60-degree angle, or is it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.910
opposite the 30-degree angle?

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.460
It's the 30-degree angle
that opens into it, right?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.650
I drew this triangle a little
bit different on purpose.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.050
The 30-degree angle opens up
into this side, and it's

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.060
also the shortest side.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.360
We learned that the side
opposite the 30-degree angle is

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.680
half the hypotenuse, so the
hypotenuse is 12;

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.860
this would be 6.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
And this side, which is
opposite the 60-degree side, is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.730
equal to the square root of 3
over 2 times the hypotenuse.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.690
So it's the square root of 3
over 2 times 12, or it's just

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.150
equal to 6 square roots of 3.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
Another interesting thing is,
of course, the longer

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.600
non-hypotenuse side is square
root of 3 times longer

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.270
than the short side.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.810
I don't confuse you too much.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.660
Let's do another one.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.800
Let's say this is 30 degrees--
it's our right triangle --and I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.390
were to tell you that this side
right here is 5, what is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.900
the length of this side?

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.750
Well first of all let's
figure out what we have.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.390
5 is which side?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.540
So if this is 30 degrees,
we know that this is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.990
going to be 60 degrees.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.010
So 5 is opposite the 60-degree
side, and x is the hypotenuse.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.840
Since x is opposite the
90-degree side, it's also

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.010
the longest side of
the right triangle.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.910
So we know from our formula
that 5 is equal to the square

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.940
root of 3 over 2 times the
hypotenuse, which in

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.850
this example is x.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.240
And now we just solve for x.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.770
We can multiply both
sides by the inverse

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.865
of this coefficient.

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:19.710
So if you just multiply 2 times
the square root of 3-- can

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.030
ignore this --we get 10 over
the square root of three here.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.140
And, of course, this 2
cancels out with this 2.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.667
This square root of 3 cancels
out this square root

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.970
of 3 is equal to x.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.510
And now if you watched the last
couple of presentations, you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.690
realize that this could be the
right answer, but we have a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.660
square root of 3 in the
denominator, which people don't

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.980
like because it's an irrational
number in the denominator.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.690
And I guess we could
have a debate as to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.010
why that might be bad.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.870
So let's rationalize
this denominator.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.150
We say x is equal to 10 over
the square to 3; to rationalize

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.750
this denominator we can
multiply the numerator and the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.910
denominator by the
square root of 3.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.670
Because as long as we multiply
the numerator and the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.280
denominator by the same thing,
it's like multiplying by 1.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.790
So this is equal to 10 square
roots of 3 over square root of

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.996
3 times square of 3;
well that's just 3.

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:16.212
So x equals 10 square
roots of 3 over 3.

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.870
That's the hypotenuse.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.990
I know I confused you.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.920
And, of course, if this is 10
square root of 3 over 3--

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.600
that's the hypotenuse --we know
that the 30-degree side-- this

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.820
is 30 degrees --we know the
30-degree side is half of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.430
that, so it's 5 square
root of 3 over 3.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.100
Anyway, I think that might
give you a sense of the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.230
30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.980
I think you might be ready now
to try some of the level two

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.080
Pythagorean Theorem problems.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.600
Have fun.
