00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.058
&gt;&gt; So the normal allele makes you susceptible

00:00:02.058 --> 00:00:04.509
to malaria, but the mutant allele deforms your red

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.390
blood cells and gives you Sickle Cell Anemia.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.860
Neither one of those sounds like a good option.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.836
&gt;&gt; It's true, but the compromise is actually having one of

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:16.343
each. A little resistance to malaria and minimal symptoms of anemia.

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:18.690
&gt;&gt; So being heterozygous gives you the advantage.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.330
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's exactly what

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.300
geneticists call it. The heterozygote advantage.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.150
&gt;&gt; So, we, ideally, we all want

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.870
one of each.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.920
&gt;&gt; Well, it really depends on where you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.530
live. You tell me. Which of the following

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.300
genotypes do you think would be most advantageous

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.620
if you lived in a region without malaria?
