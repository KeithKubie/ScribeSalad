[ Silence ]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.140
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.660
My name is Georgette Dorn and I'm
the head of the Hispanic Division

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.310
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.180
It is very, very nice to
welcome everybody to the library

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.580
which the home of the biggest
Latin American collection

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.250
in the world actually.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.770
We have 170 million items of
which 14 million pertain to Spain

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.260
and Latin America in
the Iberian world.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.010
We also are the home of
[inaudible] Latin American studies

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.170
which is an online and in print
bibliography published here

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.640
since 1936.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.680
Also the home of the
[inaudible] tape

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.820
where we have 750 recorded
authors since 1943.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.130
And as of two years ago we have
100 of them online available

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.380
on the Hispanic Division's webpage.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.320
It is my pleasure to
welcome Dr. Michael Francis.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.640
He received his Ph.D.
in history in 1998

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.730
from the University of Cambridge.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.350
Between 1997 and 2012 he taught at
the University of North Florida.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.250
In '12 Dr. Francis was
named the Hough Family Chair

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.610
of Floridian studies
at the University

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.310
of South Florida in St. Petersburg.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.070
In 2016 he was appointed Chair
of the Department of History

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.020
and Politics at University of
South Florida, St. Petersburg.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.580
Dr. Francis has received
more than two dozen national,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.740
international awards including
a four year appointment

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.260
as research fellow of the American
Museum of Natural History, New York

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.370
and the J. Kislak fellowship
at the Library

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.200
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.650
He served on the St. Augustine
450th commemoration commission

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.760 position:56%
and is curator of the traveling
museum exhibit, Imagining La Florida

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.760
on Ponce de Leon and the Quest
for the Fountain of Youth.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.320
Dr. Francis has written
and edited five books

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.140
and numerous book chapters
and articles.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.240
His most recent book
published in 2015 is entitled,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.810 position:56%
St. Augustine, America's First City.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.510
With us, Dr. Francis.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.390
[ Audience Applause ]

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.350
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Thanks
so much Georgette and thank you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.480
for coming on a beautiful day.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.950
Walking over here and I thought
it's a gorgeous spring day.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.590
Everyone's going to
want to be outside.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.520
So we're going to do this indoors.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.660 position:56%
The last time I was here I think the
discussion, the talk was really all

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.040
about anniversaries
and commemoration,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.340
historical commemorations because
Florida went through a series

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.400
of these commemoration moments
really almost consistently

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.270
since 2013.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.940
There was one commemoration
after another.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.060
And so today I'm going to
talk about a new project.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.930 position:56%
A project that we've been working on
at the University of South Florida,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.890
St. Petersburg and with partners
in Spain and in other places

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.280
in the United States that
I'd like to share with you.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.180
So thank you to the Hispanic
Division, to [inaudible]

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.610
and Georgette for inviting me
here today and for the University

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.100
of South Florida Foundation and
Julie Gillespie and Julie Perrelli.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.280
I'd really like to thank and
point out this is a project

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.470
that historical research is
often a rather solitary affair.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.100
We like to sit in archives
by ourselves

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.880
in quiet doing our research.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.480
And this is really a project

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.330
that from the very beginning has
been a collaborative endeavor.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.010
It's a project that has really
brought in a team of scholars

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.640
from different disciplines,
different institutions

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.010
and of course it's a way.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.670
It has been a project that
I've had wonderful success

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.480
with some phenomenal graduate
students at the University

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.680
of South Florida who are
working on this project with me,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.470
Rachael Sanderson, Hannah Tweet
and Trevor Bryant in particular.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.410
But we have a whole team
of graduate students

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.910
who have been working on this.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.690
As I said Florida has experienced
these commemoration moments

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.720
since 2013.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.980
The first of course centered
around this individual.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.390
What you see here is Juan
Ponce de Leon's signature.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.130
And in Florida in 2013 commemorated
the 500 year anniversary

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.570
of something related related
to Juan Ponce de Leon.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.650
It was still quite a
mystery as the year unfolded,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.910
what is it that we're commemorating
and what exactly did he do

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.860
and why are we commemorating this?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.080
And often the answer especially

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.930
in the political sphere
was well we need

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.530
to tell everybody that we're old.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.540
That we're first.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.050
They love first's and oldest
even when first aren't first's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.650
and oldest are not oldest.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.880
And so there was this
whole discussion.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.540
I don't know if you
followed the debate,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.440
sometimes a rather heated
debate that unfolded in Florida

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.480
over where did Ponce land?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.070
And different communities fought.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.600
There were newspaper articles,
battles back and forth

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.170
about where Ponce landed.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.730
So I guess the real takeaway

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.240
in 2013 was no one
agreed where Ponce landed.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.430
And he did something, we're old.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.430
So that was the takeaway I suppose.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.730
Two years later the City

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.090
of St. Augustine commemorated
its 450 year anniversary.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.750
And of course you have
to have cake I guess

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.500
when you're celebrating
historical anniversaries.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.210
This is the day of the
anniversary, September 8, 2015,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.390
marked the 450 year commemoration.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.200
What was striking about that
in a way when I reflect back

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.380
on that moment, the highest
ranking political official

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.320 position:56%
to attend the 450th, the actual day,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.830
the 450th was Florida's
Secretary of State.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:18.630
So it still didn't I guess generate
a kind of national interest.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.460
Now of course ten days later the
Royal Majesties of Spain arrived,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.090
King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.730
And then lots of people came
to St. Augustine ten days

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.260
after the actual anniversary.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.940
He's, this is King Felipe VI.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.930
He's 6'6".

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.260
I'm getting there I
hope one day to be 6'6".

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.040
I'm standing behind him so
it makes me look shorter.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.210
In any case they came and of course

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.930
that attracted a great
deal of interest.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.600
And I remember speaking with the
city manager during that visit

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.480
and shortly thereafter and he
really posed this question.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.290
Now that the anniversaries
have passed,

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.610
now that there's been national
and international attention.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.740
The Royal Majesties
of Spain have come

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.540
to commemorate this
moment, where do we go?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.030
What's next?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.950
And sometimes it was a
little disheartening.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.470
I remember reviewing a national
history textbook not long ago.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.060
I won't mention the state.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.220
It begins with M and
ends with chusetts.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.890
But it was a national
history text that was going

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.580
out to junior high school
students around the country.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.830
And one of the chapters was on
the colonization of North America.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.330
And the chapter began
with Jamestown.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.400
And I thought what
are we doing wrong?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.830
The first people of African descent

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.340
in the textbook came
to Virginia in 1619.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.840
So that's only off by 106 years
of the first recorded person

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.860
of African descent, Juan
Garrido who was part

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.300
of Ponce de Leon's 1513 expedition.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.310
So maybe there's something we
can do a little bit differently.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.380
And what we've, what we're
starting and what we'll launch

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.660 position:56%
in the fall is a center, digital
center for colonial Florida history.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.640
And it's really built on projects.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.760
A whole series of projects that
preceded this one, that are working

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.460
at the same time as this one.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.360 position:56%
Of course the Spanish website Pares,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.350
if you're not familiar
with this site.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.820
It's an absolutely remarkable
website of documents and maps

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.920
from a number of almost a dozen
Spanish state archives, digitized.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.190
There are millions of
documents, maps, images,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.980
photographs from the
Spanish civil war,

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:53.060
documents from medieval Spain all
the way up to the 20th century.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.730
And this is something that the
Spanish government's been doing

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.540
since the 1980s.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.630
They were really a pioneer
in terms of digitization,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.310
making this material available.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.820
It's not the most user
friendly website.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.370
Maybe that was a compromise.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.170
We'll make the documents
available but it'll be so difficult

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.100
to navigate that nobody
will find the documents.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.800
And it's pretty close.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.380
It's a challenging one if you
have not used Pares in the past.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.550
But of course it has
some remarkable,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.450
remarkable documents in it.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.180
Just some examples of some
the characters who lived

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.990
in colonial Florida who, about whom
you can research through Pares,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.020
this is a letter written
to King Philip III.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.330
It dates to the 20th
of February of 1600.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:53.000
And it was written by this woman,
Dona Maria who was a Cacica,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.940
Native American, a
Timucua Indian Chief.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.050
One of numerous letters that Dona
Maria wrote to the King of Spain.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.700
And there were responses.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.680
She is a figure that outside

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.340
of St. Augustine is not
particularly well known.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.270
My guess is if this letter were
signed Pocahontas the letter would

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.590
probably be in every textbook,

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.350
fourth grade textbook
in the country.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.840
And yet we know quite
a bit about her.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.350
Documents like a very small trove
of final wills and testaments.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.020
We, it's rare to find
final wills from Florida.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.280
There are only that we've been
able to locate, only about 40.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.760
And there are reasons for that
that I'm happy to discuss later.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.310
But the oldest one that we've
uncovered is a will from 1566,

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.680
one year after St. Augustine
was established in 1565.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.980
Is that better?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.420
There, okay, sorry.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.280
And it's a will from a young
man named Bernard Jansen

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.680
who was from Bremen, Germany.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.790
And poor, couldn't sign his name.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.570
But it's a handful of wills
that will part of this center.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.580
When we finish we'll publish all
of these wills with transcriptions

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.500
and translations of these
final wills from Florida.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.920
And tales of people
like this individual,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.870
whose real name was actually
Darby Glavin, he's Irish.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.830
And the Spanish had no
patience with Darby as a name

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.680
so they just called
him David Glavid.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.260
And David Glavid was,
has a fascinating story.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.880
I mean, know about him in
the English historiography

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.330
that he was one of
the Roanoke settlers,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.910
that Francis Drake took
him back to England.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.210
He was sent back.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.310
And somehow was captured by
the Spanish and was sentenced

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.060
to a life in the galleys.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.350
That's the English
version of the narrative.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.550
The Spanish story is
completely different.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.900
David Glavid ends up
living in St. Augustine.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.840
He testifies that he was a
fisherman off the coast of Ireland.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.980
And the English kidnapped him.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.500
Took him to Roanoke against
his will, stole his boat.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.880
And he ended up at Roanoke,
went back to England with Drake.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.610
And then Queen Elizabeth
II sent him back.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.660
When he arrived in
Puerto Rico he ran away.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.280
And he later joined the
Spanish, lived in St. Augustine.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.000
He was a merchant and a
soldier in St. Augustine.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.590
He was the guy you would
go to to get stuff.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.950
If you wanted textiles
from Asia, you wanted some.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.180
David Glavid was the merchant
who could acquire those goods.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.840
Or somebody like Luisa Menendez.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.920
We know lots of stories like
this from Mexico and Peru.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.830
As a young girl she was
taken captive by the Spanish.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.390
She was probably at the time
between the age of eight and ten.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.850
She ended up living in
a Spanish settlement

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.390
in Florida called Santa Elena.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.900
We call today Paris
Island, South Carolina.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.490
And she was a domestic servant
in the home of St. Augustine,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.500
St. Augustine's founder's
wife, Dona Maria de Solis.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.740
She then ends up marrying a Spanish
solider whose 20 years her senior.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.350
And she lives certainly from
what we can document well

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.720
into the early 17th century.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.920
Of course the AGI then contains
all kinds of information

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.610
about food stuffs and supplies that
went from Spain to Florida or Cuba

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.380
to Florida, other places
with those supplies.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.870
This is simply an inventory of
food stuffs that went to Florida

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.370
with the Menendez 1565 expedition.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.610
So there's all this
material available.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.990
It's not material you would
really publish by themselves.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.850
And what I'm going to frame

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.650
for you is the idea we have
for this digital center.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.160
For us it really began with a
project that I did with a couple

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160 position:56%
of graduate students at the
University of North Florida and then

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.310
at the University of South Florida
to digitize the parish records

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.050
in St. Augustine, Florida.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.520 position:56%
And these records date back to 1594.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.260
They're the some of
the oldest documents

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.550
in the United States
about the United States.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.730
And they're parish
records, baptisms, deaths,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.300
confirmations, marriages.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.410
And we started a project
to digitize 6,000 pages

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.630
of the colonial parish records.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.320
And this was the team.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.930
We did it for, I think our
budget was something like $5,500.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.200
And we digitized all
of these documents

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.170
which are now available online.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.900
You can see on the left
that's Jane Landers

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.580
from Vanderbilt University
who's written extensively

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.160
about Africans in Florida.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.230
And then my two graduate
students on the far right

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.370
and Jane's team in between.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.950
And this is what some of
these records look like.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.460
This is one of the early
marriage records from 1594.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.010
We do have the first
recorded baptism

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.870
of anybody of African descent.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.790
And this was a record from 1595.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.140
All right, this should be
much more readily available

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.130
to a broader audience
than it has been.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.210
And that's part of the idea.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.840
And of course some of
them look like this.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.800
So desperate need of restoration
some of these documents.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.720
They were shrink wrapped in
the 1920s, the early records

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.770
which is not good for
long term preservation.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.170
But that's what they look like.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.360
Now of course we've done
this and we've put them up.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.880 position:56%
And one of the things I constantly
hear from teachers is well wonderful

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.090
that you did that but how
are we supposed to use this?

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.010
How is it going to
be more accessible?

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.910
How are people who
maybe don't know much

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.630
about that early Florida history,
how are they going to use this?

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.140
And it makes perfect sense.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.270
This is just a two line passage
that appears on the very front page

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.140
of a 17th century book of baptisms
within those parish records.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.050
Now the handwriting
is not 17th century.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.070
And before it was shrink
wrapped somebody

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.250
in his infinite wisdom
took a black marker

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.030
and wrote the year 1640 question
mark on the original document.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.690
But the handwriting's
actually 18th century.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.700
And when I first looked at
it, you know, the first word

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.880
that probably jumps out you
is the word diablo, devil.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.830
I thought why is somebody writing
devil on the first opening page

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.170
of 17th century book of baptisms?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.340
And the text reads
simply, my dear Lord,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.810
not even the devil could read this.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.530
The writing is so bad I can't
make out a single word in it.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.550
So I teach Spanish, 16th century
Spanish paleography program

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.490
at the University South
Florida, St. Petersburg.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.170
So when students come in the
first day I lock the door

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.020
and then I show them this.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.850 position:56%
And even those who think it's
paleontology then get really scared.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.010
And when they realize
no, it's paleography.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.840
We're going to learn how to read
16th century Spanish handwriting.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.090
And I say not even, I say look,
bear with me for eight months

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.670
and you will learn a skill that
the devil himself does not possess.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.250
And then they get excited.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.780
Say all right, I'll stick
with this Spanish paleography

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.850
for the eight months.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.740
And some do it for
two or three years

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.970
and become really quite
accomplished paleographers

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.560
for 16th century Spanish.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.080
The projects we're going
to launch in the fall,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.230
really the most important project
at least in terms of the amount

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.680
of work we put into it so
far is the prosopography.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.420
And if that word or that term's
not familiar just think of it

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.590
in terms of collective biography.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.320
If you were to ask for example,
take the [inaudible] expedition,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.640
if you were to ask well what could
you say about the typical profile

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.000
of one of the conquistador's
Soto expedition?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.060
What do we know about
where they were from?

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.360
Their ages?

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.660
Marital status?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.180
Previous military experience?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.160 position:56%
Have they been in the Indies before?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.300
Do they come from certain
parts or are they concentrated

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.320
in certain parts of Spain?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.640
In other words the study of figures

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.310
about whom we don't know
a great deal and many

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.590
of them did not leave
written records.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.230
So for the last oh I guess seven

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.130
or eight years I've been collecting
data on every single person I come

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.900
across who lived in Florida
between 1513 and 1821.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.920 position:56%
Yes, that's as exciting as my social
life is to be keeping this database.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.850
And the database now has well
over 10,000 people in it.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.600
In the next five years we
hope to double that number,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.290
have more than 20,000
people in that database.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.160
And then some of the other
projects I'll outline quickly

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.970
for you as I go through.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.830
We do hope to bring in as
many institutional partners

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.670
as we can with this project.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:02.810 position:56%
And of course my interest really is,
although all of these are important,

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.500
the research opportunities I think
that this will bring for students

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.630
and for other faculty I
think is quite exceptional.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.610
And then of course this
collaborative endeavor,

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.910
the nature of this.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.160
And already we have some
partners, some important partners.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.810
Many in Spain and some
here in the United States

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:27.230
and Francisco Gitard [assumed
spelling] is here from Madrid.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.530
He works in Malaga for the
Institute Onelta [phonetic].

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:36.450
And all of the technological things
that we want to do I just drop

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.350
at his door and say make
this happen and he says okay.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.030
We'll make that happen.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.880
I started because I was intrigued

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.520
when Pedro Menendez
established St. Augustine in 1565

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.610
within the first three
years he and the captains

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.900
under his authority established
15 different garrisons

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.660
in the southeast.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.280
You can see really from the visual
in fact one of his plans was

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.410
to establish a garrison in the
Chesapeake Bay area which failed.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.730
But that was his ambition
to have garrisons that ran

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.680
up the Atlantic seaboard, a couple
of strategic points in the Gulf.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.900
And then what his vision was was
to build a series of garrisons

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:23.240
into the interior that eventually
connected his deep water port

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.340
around Hilton Head,
present day Hilton Head,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.420
South Carolina, with
Zacatecas, Mexico.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.200
In other words the vision was
to move that silver overland

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.230
to a deep water port and
Pedro Menendez [inaudible]

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.210
of course would be
governor of this region.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.940
A very ambitious plan,
obviously a plan that failed

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.120
for a number of reasons but failed.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.880
And so within by 1570 there are
really only two garrisons left,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.400
Paris Island, South Carolina,
the settlement at Santa Elena

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.970
and St. Augustine, Florida.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.010
And St. Augustine after 1587,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.540
St. Augustine's the
only one that survives.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.370
It's the only one of these
early garrisons that survives

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.990
until the late 17th century when
the Spanish go back to Pensacola.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.790 position:56%
I was always interested in who were
the people who went to these places.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.670
Who were the people who joined the
Menendez expedition after 50 years

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.420
of failed expeditions into Florida
beginning with Ponce de Leon?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.930
One expedition after another
with the same outcome.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:32.620
Menendez knows perfectly well there
isn't gold or silver or emeralds,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.460
maybe some pearls in Florida.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.220
So how's he able to recruit people?

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.120 position:56%
And in particular for his expedition
he recruited over 2,000 individuals.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.530 position:56%
The expedition that followed him the
following year also included more

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.170
than 2,000 individuals.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.860
These are two of the largest
expeditions to leave Spain

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.920
for any part of the
Indies in the 16th century

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.460
and they were expeditions
to Florida.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.210
So we wanted to get a sense
of who these people were.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.820
Especially when you look at the
kinds of professions that you see

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.110
in the manifest of professions

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.810
that Menendez recruited
for the expedition.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.060
Twenty one tailors and ten
shoemakers, a couple of rope makers

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.540
and locksmiths and silversmiths,
a hat maker, 117 laborers.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.880 position:56%
And then this one's my favorite, at
one point I hope we find out exactly

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:32.230
who he was [inaudible], a master
beer brewer was on this expedition.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.550
When you look at that
list those are the people

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.540
that in every single textbook
refers to as conquistadors.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.430 position:56%
Those are the conquistadors, the
hatmakers and shoemakers and tailors

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.720
and all of the professions
that in the end are required

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.260
for permanence, for settlement.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.580
And so we wanted to
track those occupations

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.420
and who these people were and
what brought them to Florida.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.050
So at present we have for the
Hernando de Sota expedition we have

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.780
about 845 people in
the database for that.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.730
The Pedro Menendez de Aviles we
have almost 700 in that database.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.500
The Sancho de Archiniega
expedition, this is an expedition

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.800
about which there's
almost nothing written.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.530
A few references in the
secondary literature

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.320 position:56%
but there's almost nothing published

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.460
on the Sancho de Archiniega
expedition.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:28.010
That was the expedition with over
2,000 people on it from 1566.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.770
And we've now found
almost all of them.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.150 position:56%
So that's the one we're going to use

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.900
to launch the center
site in the fall.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.990 position:56%
And then a couple of the settlements
and eventually we'll catch

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.830
up the Diasisin [phonetic]
records and be able to include all

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.290
of those Diasisin records
in this project.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.710
So very briefly in terms
of the Sancho de Archiniega

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:55.930
at present we've identified 1833
people who went on that expedition.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:00.830
We know the place of origin
for 84% of those people.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.440
We know that at least
85 were non-Spaniards.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.900
This number will probably
creep up to closer to 150

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.360
by the time I finish research in
Spain this summer because most

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.410
of mariners and the ship owners

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.920
and ship captains were Flemish
or Portuguese or German.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.520
They're not Spanish.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.980
So that number's going to
increase quite dramatically.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.740
We will have a whole series of
infographics on this center site

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.750
where you can see a breakdown in
terms of the contemporary regions

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.170
where people were from and
be able to do this for all

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.050
of the expeditions to
see the differences

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.640
between the regional breakdowns.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.740 position:56%
Infographics like this where you can
see percentages of people who came

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.760
from Andalucia and, you know,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.910
3% of the Archiniega expedition
was made up of Portuguese.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.520
And the Portuguese are often
overlooked in the story.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.620
Again these kind of infographics

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.090
where you can see different
regions and, you know,

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.490
who were the 12 Catalans?

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.020
And the 28 people from Valencia who
came on this expedition in 1566?

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.670
And just for students to be able
to see a contemporary map and see

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.620
that the breakdown of
individuals who participated

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.920 position:56%
in this expedition included
Greeks, Northern Europeans, Flemish,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.890
Italians, French, Portuguese,
North Africans.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.940
One person from Florida who was a
native chief, we don't know much

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.210
about him, we don't
know where he was from.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.290
But he was taken at some point.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.220
Was baptized with the name
Pedro, was given honorific of Don

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.570
which was standard for
all Cacicas at the time.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:48.380 position:56%
And he was sent back to Spain
likely lived a life with Franciscans

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.650
or Jesuits, was taught Spanish.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.610
And he went back on this
expedition to serve as a translator

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.110
and as a guide, breakdown
of the foreigners.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.660
What was really striking when
we collected the data was

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.380
that when you look at the
makeup of this group they come

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.840
from 665 different places.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.480
And this was surprising.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.740
We thought we'd find
smaller networks of people

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.280
who were well connected
from childhood, who brought,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.470
came together to establish
these companies.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.110
And what we're finding is
something strikingly different

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.410
where almost 1/3rd

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:33.210
of them represented the only
individual from their town.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.080 position:56%
So it raises some really interesting
questions about these networks

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.790
and recruitment in Spain.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.780
And now that we have the names and
where people were from we can start

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.640
to look at these questions
form the Iberian side,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.600
from Spain and Portugal.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.080
Greece is a little bit more
difficult but other places

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.710
and see what drew people to these
expeditions in the 16th century.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.510
And what were these networks

00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:00.910
that could quite quickly pull
together 2,000 individuals

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.020
to go on this expedition.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.890
We know that most so
far come from Seville.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.670
But what I can do now
with students who suffer

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.520 position:56%
through the paleography program is
send a student for example to places

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.740
like Samota [phonetic] and
look through parish records

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.850
and notary records in Somota to
find out more about the individuals

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.860
that we've identified
from those locations.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.600
This is something that keeps
me up at night and did,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.240
and kept me up at night
when I was working on it.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.800
I didn't include Fernandez,
now Fernandez

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.310 position:56%
and Hernandez were used
interchangeably in the 16th century.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.040
So if you add Hernandez and
Fernandez there are probably

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.280
about 105 people on the expedition

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.730
with the last name
Hernandez or Fernandez.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.860
Many of them probably about
40 have the first name Juan.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:56.120 position:56%
So deciphering, trying to figure out
do I have the right Juan Hernandez

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.650
or when you see another one
in a document how do you know

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.180
which one Hernandez
or Fernandez that is?

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.390
And you see that, you know, we
have 52 Lopez's and 48 Martin's

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.920
and this will something that
will continue to be a challenge.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.030
Occupations, we've identified
52 different occupations so far

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.330
of the people who came

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.080
on that expedition including
20 musicians and 7 priests.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.240
We have the backgrounds
of some of the priests

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.740
who served on the expedition.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.330
These six individuals in St.
Augustine were contracted

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.640
by the crown to service
professional fishermen.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.090
That was their job.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.930
They were paid a salary.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:40.290
They were given a great big fishing
net and said your job is to fish

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.010
for the crown and that's
what you will do.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.570
I don't know why you have a
Garcia Mendez from Cordoba.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.750
Cordoba doesn't strike
me as the best place

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:54.240
to recruit a professional fisherman
but there he is, Garcia Mendez.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.170
The barbers, those who performed
minor surgeries in addition

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.100
to tasks that barbers did.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.540
We know the names of
those individuals

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.830
and where they were
from, the carpenters.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.260
Literacy rate is very
difficult to track

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.200
for this expedition
but we're now at 11%.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.500
We're getting closer.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.450
It's still not statistically
meaningful the way we hope it will

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.910
be when we get closer to
30, 40, 50% literacy rates.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.580
The image for 16th century Florida

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.570
in the secondary literature
is very much,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.990
well this is a marginal
borderland of a borderland.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.070
A place nobody really wanted to go

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.910
and certainly a place nobody
really wanted to stay.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.760
And the people who went to
Florida were often kind of dregs

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.890
of Spanish society and they
said well you go to Florida.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.190
It's lovely.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.520 position:56%
You know, they're working on Disney,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.590
the beaches are perfect,
weather's nice.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.610
And so the sense was that you
wouldn't find very many highly

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.910
educated individuals,
etc. What's emerging

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.890
from the prosopography is very
much a profile that's similar

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.360
to what we find elsewhere in the
Indies where you get this kind

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.460
of middling group of people,
semi-literate with a combination

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.850
of people who had a
formal university education

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.390
who stayed in Florida.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.540 position:56%
And then of course you look at ages.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.260
And this is where things
get really interesting.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:28.100 position:56%
And this is where as a historian
and anybody who questions the nature

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.880
of written documents and how
should we read these documents?

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.730
When we first did the
numbers I realized wow,

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.330
the people who really colonized
Florida are my students.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.400
And then I thought sometimes,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.890
oh the people who colonized
Florida are my students.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.190
And no, it's good.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.200
I trust them.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.290
The number, look at the highest
number here, 20 year old.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.060
And of course one of the
mandates in the documents,

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.470
one of Archiniega's mandates

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:03.650
from the crown was you must
recruit 1,500 men, unmarried,

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.910
and you cannot recruit
anybody under the age of 20.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:15.950
So I suspect that a number of these
people fall into the 19, 18, 17,

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:22.010
16 year old category and
are simply saying I'm 20.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.600
Here's my ID.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.030
And I'll show you what their ID
is because we have for Florida

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.100
about 400 physical
descriptions of people

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.090
from the 16th century
which is extraordinary.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.110
When you think of how rare it
is to find physical descriptions

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.940
for people, we have
about 400 so far.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.660 position:56%
So you could be somebody like Pedro
[inaudible], tall, dark and handsome

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.710
with two scars on his
face and forehead.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.400
And one of the things that
emerges out of these documents

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.980
in the 16th century is that
people were selling licenses

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.910 position:56%
under the table as you might expect.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.590
So Pedro [inaudible] might
stop in at a bar in Cordoba,

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.020
find somebody who looks
rather tall, dark and handsome

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.370
and say have a few drinks because
you're only missing a couple

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.010
of scars and then you can be me.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:16.800
And lots of these licenses were
circulating under the table.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.070
And people were coming to the
Americas as somebody else.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.750 position:56%
And so then poor Antonio Garcia that
shows up a little later and wants

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.150
to be tall, dark and handsome
gets to be round and fat

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.300
with a big nose, unfortunately
for him.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.610
Francisco Marten [assumed spelling]
would have a difficult time selling

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:36.510
his license because he had
one eye and a scar next

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.600
to his left eye from a knife wound.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.240
I expected to find a lot
more evidence of people

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.920
who had survived small pox.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.460
And to date of all of the people

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.640
for whom we have physical
descriptions they're only five

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.890
that we've identified
who have any evidence

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.950
of pox marks having
survived an epidemic.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.800
If you've been following the news

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.940
in St. Augustine they've recently
uncovered some human remains

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:09.180
underneath the parish church, what
was the parish church from 1572

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.270
into well more than a
century of this [inaudible].

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:21.810
And with the database, they're
doing DNA analysis on these bones.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.650
They found 20 separate
individuals in this recent,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.760
these recent excavations.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.220
It is not outside of
the realm of possibility

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.300
that we could name
these people by name.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.680
When we connect the database
where people were from,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.060 position:56%
who they were with the DNA evidence.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.890
We're also going to
do a whole series

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.710
of digital reconstructions
for Florida.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:49.050
This is magnificent map of
St. Augustine from 1764.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.610
After the Seven Years' War
when Florida was transferred

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.420
to British rule and the
British controlled Florida

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.160
for 21 years after this.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.550
And this was a map that was
commissioned by the crown basically

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:07.010
to plot all of the properties in
St. Augustine for compensation.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.570
Because what happens in
1764 is every single person

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:17.690
in St. Augustine except for four
families, everybody else leaves.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.480
The whole city's abandoned.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.900
Most go to Cuba, some go to
Campeche, some go to Vera Cruz,

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.850
very few returned to Spain.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.190
And the city's basically abandoned.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.410
What this map, the originals
in the Naval Museum in Madrid,

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:36.070
what this map shows is
the size of each property,

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.880
who owned the property and the
building material that was used

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.080
to construct the residences
of those properties.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.700
So on this one for example what we
can plot and it'll be much more,

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.590
look a lot better than this.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.220
This is just an idea of
what we're trying to do.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.840
All of those pink circles
represent properties in 1763

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.140
that we're owned by women.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:04.690
These are all female property
owners from St. Augustine.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.140
Here, well just the breakdown
of the building materials.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.460
And Tabby which is a vernacular
concrete made from oyster shell,

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.530
coquina stone and wooden board.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.290
And we see that most the buildings
were stone or cement constructions,

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.330
tabby stone constructions
in St. Augustine.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.730
So the idea is to create this
digital recreation of St. Augustine

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.600
on the eve of abandonment.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.230
All of these properties
are properties

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:34.530
that we've confirmed were owned
by free blacks in St. Augustine.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:38.690
And we know where a lot of them
were from from the parish records.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.920
We know that runaway slaves
were moving from as far north

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.220
as New York, Philadelphia, most
obviously from the Carolinas,

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.120
trying to make their
way to Spanish Florida

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.990 position:56%
in the late 17th and 18th centuries.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.070
For a lot of them we know their
ethnic backgrounds for the people

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:02.750
of African descent, those who were
Congolese, Carabali, Mandinga.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.990
With maps instead of simply putting
maps on the center site we're going

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.670
to do a lot more animation
because again there's

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:13.530
so much incredible detail
that's lost to people

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.010
who aren't familiar with the maps.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:22.390
So this is a map of the southeast,
the Gulf and Florida from 1544.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:26.400
This is a map from right after
the Hernando de Sota expedition.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.700
And there's Tuscaloosa.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:33.310
All of these are Indian towns.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.490
It's the only map I know
from the 16th century

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.520
that plots Native settlements
in North America.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.150
I can't think of another one
that plots all these settlements.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.480
And you get some text that's lost.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.040
This text here says
[inaudible] which is

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:54.400
in present day New
Mexico, [inaudible].

00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.520 position:56%
From [inaudible] to this point there
are great herds of cattle, 1544?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.850
Great herds of cattle?

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.070
And of course this is what
the Spanish are talking about.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:11.200
For the Spanish the buffalo or
bison was simple a hairy cow.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.350
And Native Americans do
exactly the same thing.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.440
The horse in Mexico is not
some magical mystical creature.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.220
It's a deer from Castile.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.520
It looks like a deer.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.820
It's a little different.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.120
And the Spanish do the same thing.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.510
This early interaction with
nouns is really fascinating.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.810
So, all of these maps will have
transcriptions, translations,

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.980
explanations, annotations.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:42.500
The technical team thinks that they
can build a something like an OCR

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.800
to read 16th century
Spanish paleography.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.020 position:56%
I have my doubts but then
Francisco looks at me and just says,

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.560
oh bless your heart, you
16th century dweller you

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.490
who we will be able to create
something that will be able

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.700
to read 16th century documents.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.390
What we're thinking of it
initially as something to use

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.470
for museum visitors in Florida,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.880
children who can take 16th
century letters from documents

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.040
from Florida and write their names.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.210
What would you name look
like in 16th century Spanish?

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:22.480
And my evil plot is that eventually
all of these students are going

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.120 position:56%
to start writing notes to each other

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.150
in classrooms using 16th
century paleography.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.150
And I'll get hate mail
from teachers.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.720
But then the sinister plot

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.610
that everyone will learn 16th
century Spanish will slowly

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.370
become realized.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.950
And so that's the initial
plan with this.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.490
Last summer I found the provisions
for the Archiniega expedition

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:50.970
for every single day for every
single person on that expedition.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.700
So teachers who teach about
nutrition and could compare

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.400
for example the long term
implications of a diet

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.820
on a Spanish expedition
versus what English or French,

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.630
other expeditions look like
in terms of food stuffs.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.790
And my wife actually plated these.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.920
These are the actual amounts.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.820
We took the amounts and plated
them except for the bread.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.220
They did, we couldn't
fit that in a picture.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:23.070
It's, it'd be a big garbage can
of your daily rations of hardtack.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.940
They ate a lot of hardtack.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.530
But this was the monthly ration
for olive oil and vinegar.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.680
Friday of course you got some rice.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.800
And then garlic was
only for the elite.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.690 position:56%
They said we'll give you some garlic
but distribute it with great care.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:41.250
In other words only the
important people get garlic.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.640
Does this look like a lot of wine?

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.940
&gt;&gt; No.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.260
&gt;&gt; Does it now?

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.020
This was the daily wine ration

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.600
for every single person,
every single day.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.870
Now of course they have to careful
with water and water spoiling

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.170
and this is what they're drinking.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.340
And this is what you would get
for your daily ration of wine.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.670
We're going to do all kinds of
visuals associated with this.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:13.210
The site hasn't been designed but
this is kind of the general idea

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.910 position:56%
of what we want it to be able to do
with the different areas of interest

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.660
in terms of the research.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.490
The tutorials for people to
use it and the infographics,

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.060
the list of collaborators

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.260
and the advisory board
that we'll put together.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.180
And the last thing I want to show
you is one of the ideas that we'd

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.160
like to do is populate the site
with a series of short videos.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.530
These will be videos
about men and women

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.400
of different ethnic
backgrounds who lived

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.820
in Florida between 1513 and 1821.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.080
Mainly stories about people who
are not particularly well known.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.530
And so we did one and I want to
show that to you as an example

00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:03.030
of the kinds of productions that
we will use to populate the site.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.720
And this is a story that's
really actually if I come back

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.500
to this image here, this is a
story that centers around this map.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.380 position:56%
It's a map that dates to about 1605.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.820
And it was a map that was, the
name of it was simply this is

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.750
where we need to move the fort.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.480
The plan, King Philip III's
plan was get rid of the garrison

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:31.520
in St. Augustine and move everyone
closer to present day Miami.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.450
And next to that fort on the
map is just a couple of words.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:42.610
It says Vocas de Miguel Mora,
the mouths of Miguel Mora.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.590
And I never knew who
Miguel Mora was.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.520
And it bothered me for
years and years and years.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.710
And then last summer I found him.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.260
Not him exactly because he
lived in the 16th century.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.200
But I found his story.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.920
And why this region
ended up with his name.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.460
And so we decided to tell
this story of Miguel Mora

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.290
which tells a little bit the
early history of Spanish Florida

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.510
and the story of Miguel
Mora himself.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:25.630
[ Music ]

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.080
In the year 1605 an anonymous
mapmaker drafted a rather crude map

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.220
of the Florida peninsula.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.890
Of the maps many curious features.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.810
Perhaps the most striking is a name

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.020
that appears along the
southeastern coastline next

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.140
to purposed new Spanish fortress.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:49.450
It reads Vocas de Miguel Mora,
the mouths of Miguel Mora.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:53.280
The fort was never built but for
the next two centuries mariners

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.260
and mapmakers continued to
refer to the area by his name.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.290
But who was Miguel Mora?

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:06.470
The story takes us back
40 years to the year 1565.

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:12.210
On March 15 of that year Pedro
Menendez de Aviles signed a private

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:17.570 position:56%
contract or [inaudible] with Spain's
King Philip II outlining the terms

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.300
of a new conquest expedition
to Florida.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.700
An experienced mariner,
merchant and military commander,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.230
Menendez quickly began to recruit
colonists for his new venture.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.910
While many of them came
from Northern Spain,

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.410
Menendez's forces included
men and women from other parts

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.030
of the Spanish peninsula as well
as Portugal, Flanders, Greece,

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.810
North Africa, France and Italy.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:46.500
Almost 2,000 people joined the
expedition including sailors

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.920
and soldiers, artisans and
craftsmen, slaves and free blacks

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.950
and more than two dozen women.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:58.620
One of the recruits was a young man
from [inaudible] in Southern Spain.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.920
His name was Miguel Mora.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.120
But just 11 days after
Menendez signed his contract,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.800 position:56%
King Philip II learned that a
French garrison had been established

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.290
in La Florida under the
command of Renee de Laudonniere.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:17.320
Indeed Laudonniere's men had built
a fortress along the southern banks

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.890
of the River May, present
day St. John's River.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.510
They call it Fort Caroline.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.910
Even more alarming for the
Spanish crown were rumors

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:30.760
that a large French fleet was
about to set sail for Florida.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.680
Menendez's colonization
efforts would have to wait.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.170
The French settlement would
have to be destroyed first.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.310
And men like Miguel Mora
would have to fight for it.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:48.210
On June 29, 1565 Menendez's fleet
departed from Southern Spain.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:53.630
Ten weeks later on September 8
Menendez stepped ashore 40 miles

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:56.220
south of the French Fort Caroline.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.190
There he established
his first settlement

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.020
which he named St. Augustine.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:05.620
A week later Menendez assembled a
force of 500 men to march overland

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.550
to attack the French fort.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.400
It was a bold decision.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.240
A fierce storm, perhaps a
hurricane battered Menendez's men

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.350
as they made their way north
through marshes and swamps.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.610 position:56%
Led by two Florida Indians the
Spanish troops reached Fort Caroline

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:28.860
in the early morning hours
of September 20, 1565.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.240
Among the first Spaniards
to lead the assault

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.580
on Fort Caroline was Miguel Mora.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.800
The Spanish victory
was swift and decisive.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.380
And soon thereafter Menendez
began his ambitious enterprise

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.830
to colonize the American Southeast.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:48.150
For Miguel Mora, his
Florida adventure was

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.020
about to take an unexpected turn.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:55.630
In 1566 during one of his voyages
along the Florida coast Miguel

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.660
Mora's ship wrecked
in a terrible storm.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.180
He and several survivors
were taken captive

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.870
by the Tekesta Indians
near present day Miami.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:09.530
Mora spent 10 months in captivity.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:13.500
&gt;&gt; There I was, naked, no
stockings and fearful for my life.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.020
Worried that I would be
sacrificed by those Indians.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.560
Dying of hunger and a captive
for a period of ten months.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.860
Miguel Mora.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: After 10
months in captivity Mora and several

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.390 position:56%
of his companions managed to escape.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.780
He then joined Spanish expeditions
to [inaudible] and Carlos.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.670
Before returning once
more to Tekesta,

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.150
the site of his 10 month captivity.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:42.700
In 1568 the Spanish abandoned the
Takesta settlement along with many

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.750
of the other early garrisons.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:49.890
Miguel Mora sailed to
Cuba and then to Spain.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.440
He would never return to Florida.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.300
Yet for more than two centuries
after his departure the shoals

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.160
and mouths near present day
Biscayne Bay carried his name.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.830
The name of a Spanish soldier

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:08.510 position:56%
in captive whose Florida experiences
have long since been forgotten.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:21.850
[ Music ]

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.250
So this fall we're going
to launch our center

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.520
for Colonial Florida
digital history.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.150
We're still playing with the name.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:32.940
And the hope is that 5 years
from now, 10 years from now,

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:38.760
15 years from now we won't
have national history textbooks

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:44.710
that begin the whole story of
colonization of the Americas

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.150
and begin with Jamestown.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:49.710
But instead cover this more
than one century period

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.650
that has been largely overlooked
in the national narrative.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.900
And with that I thank you
for coming and I'm happy

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.010
to answer any questions
if you have any.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.810
Thank you.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:05.190
[ Audience Applause ]

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:06.670
Yes?

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:11.630
&gt;&gt; So in Florida do
they teach the history?

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.990
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis:
In fourth grade.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.290
In fourth grade.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.580
Now there are some teachers
in high school who find ways

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:26.020
to weave Florida history into
classes in language arts,

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.150
social studies in general
or world history.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.010
But for the most part the
history, the Florida history

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:38.350
that students get in Florida is the
history they get in fourth grade.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:43.330
And so, you know, and
it's not just in Florida.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.310
I gave a talk a few years
ago at Spain's equivalent

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.790
of the National Geographic Society.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.130
So an audience, a well-informed
audience in fact

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.780
and after the talk a
gentleman came up to me

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.010
and said thank you so
much for that talk.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:00.680
I had no idea that Florida
was a Spanish colony.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:09.690
So maybe there are
other ways, you know,

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:13.840
we can get people interested
in this early history.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.050
You know, we'll do, we'll have
to do a lot of reconstructions.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.830
Because of course the, for example
the Franciscan Mission Trail

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:23.080
in Florida predates the
California Mission Trail

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.570
by more than a century.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.770
But the buildings themselves
are not there.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:32.300
So the only way to do those kinds
of reconstructions is digitally.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.300
And we, there's been
some phenomenal,

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.700
there's ongoing archeological work
in Georgia and South Carolina,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.240
in Alabama, places that were
part of these early expeditions

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.310
and settlements and missions.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.470
You know, the Jesuit mission
at Chesapeake Bay, you know,

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:53.890
these are things that I
think the best way to present

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:58.530
that material now is through
digital media and not, I mean,

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.040
people have been writing
these stories.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.360
They're not really
new to historians.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.040
That we've known about the missions
and about this early history

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:11.170
for well over a century of
people writing about it.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.420
Popularly it's not well known.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.220
And we hope that this will be
a way that through animations

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:25.030
and infographics and video
that people get onto the site

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.070
and then find it a little bit
like Alice in Wonderland's world.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.240
And get into the rabbit
hole and dig deeper

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.870
and deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:33.590
And that's the plan.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.590
So we'll have transcriptions
and, you know,

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.170 position:56%
learn more about Miguel Mora or the
Franco Spanish struggle for Florida.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.320
So it will be a combination
of things that we'll assign

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.900
to different PIs, experts

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.720
in at certain archeological
sites for example.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.510
Other people interested

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.720
in prosopography, we'll
get them involved.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.210
We'd love to do a section on
Spain and the American Revolution

00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:01.860
in Florida where there
were English colonies,

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.030
East Florida and West Florida.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:11.260
So there this 13 colony
business is in fact not accurate.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.020
And a lot of loyalists of course
flee to East and West Florida.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.100
So we'd like to have
those elements in there

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.920
with again all kinds of visuals.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.860
And podcasting, we're going to do
some podcasting for this as well.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.450
Yes?

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.120
&gt;&gt; Why [inaudible]
missions survive in Florida

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.030
like they did in California?

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.890
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Well
because they built the missions

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.640
from material that didn't
survive over the test of time.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.070
They were waddle and dob
constructions with thatch roofs.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.930
And then of course the
main reason why so many

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:49.170
of the missions don't exist were
they were destroyed by the English

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:54.420
and their allies as they came in
from the Carolinas and Georgia.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.500
The early 17th century, late 17th

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.750
and early 18th centuries
those missions were sites

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:04.290
where of massive slave
raiding expeditions

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.430
from English settlements
to the North.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.160 position:56%
So they were absolutely devastating.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.880
And so when the Spanish
left Florida in 1764

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:20.140
when they returned 21 years later
the missions don't come with them.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:24.530
That's it, that whole mission
trail that existed starting

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.640
from the earliest established
mission which was 1587.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.970
Just outside of St. Augustine.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:34.450
What is now the Fountain of
Youth Archeological Park.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.560
And the mission grounds
that are right next to it.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.560
That is the oldest
established Franciscan mission

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.330
in the continental United States.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:49.250
Places like Cumberland Island
had Franciscan missions.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.600
So the whole story really
goes up the Atlantic seaboard

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.830
and into North Carolina
and what is now Tennessee.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:53:01.200 position:56%
And we think this is a good way to
weave all those narratives together.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.480
And eventually weave it
into a Jamestown narrative.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.450
Yes?

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:16.940
&gt;&gt; I'm very impressed with
the quality of the visuals

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.470
for example the last video.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.750
Are you working with I don't
know like the art department or?

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.120
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis:
Francisco [inaudible].

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.660
His team, his team.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.520
But, and the thing to remember
he was almost embarrassed

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.820
to send me that.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.190
He said this is, this
is not what we can do.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.560
When we really get going
and we have the resources

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.270
which we're building right now.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.780
And so this was something they
did in what, how many days?

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.080
&gt;&gt; Five days.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.380
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Five days.

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.830
&gt;&gt; Do you have animators
and artists and [inaudible].

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:50.170
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: So they're
going to do that element to it.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.470
They will be involved.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.970
And they have, we have all these
partners who are coming into works

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:59.050
in Spain and Seville,
Cordoba, [inaudible], Madrid,

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.000
museums and other institutions.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.750
Because this is a project that
doesn't work with one person.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:09.160 position:56%
You know, it's a big, it's a
massive team collaborative endeavor.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.800
And Tampa Bay History Center has
just donated the rights to use all

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.680
of their colonial maps which
include some manuscript maps

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.140
from their collection,

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.880
the Tom Touchton collection
which is fabulous.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.730
And so what we'll do is just
simply add animation to those maps

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.500
to make them more accessible.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.420
Transcription, translation,

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:34.170
in some cases we'll animate
the maps themselves, you know,

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:37.830
the Drake attack on St.
Augustine is perfect for that.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:41.450
The [inaudible] map is ideal
for something like that.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:45.260
&gt;&gt; Will you [inaudible] digitize
those maps or [inaudible]?

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.380
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Yea,
we've digitized a number of them.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.950
So the Tampa Bay History
Center, those are all digitized

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:53.470
in very high resolution tiffs.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.500
So we'll have all of those.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.700
We are working with some
archives, I can't really say

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.830
until we get the MOUs
in place for those.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:07.330
But our team then would go in
and redigitize their collection.

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:11.780 position:56%
And in exchange for redigitizing the
collection they'll let us use those

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.210
maps on the site at no cost.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:19.050
Which is wonderful.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:23.140
It's a great deal for them and
it's also a good deal for us.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.640 position:56%
You know, it's saddens me, you know,
when you see these incredible maps

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.880
and then you show them
say to a Florida teacher

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.000
and they say I've never
seen that map before.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.300
I've never seen that one.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.600
I've never seen that one.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.900
I've never seen that one.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.200
So they're making up maps
from the Colonial period

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.650
when they don't have to.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:42.090 position:56%
And many of them don't even bother
to look at the incredible repository

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:49.070
of maps here from, you know,
low resolution jpegs to tiffs

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:51.220
that they can just download.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.780
And so, you know, we need
to somehow get that word

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.090
out a little bit better
that this material is here

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.130
and there's a lot of it.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.970
And for Florida there
are millions and millions

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.040
and millions of pages of documents.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.740
I mean, we're just
scratching the surface.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.950
Yes?

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:18.740
&gt;&gt; You know, I was sort of struck
by the, by where non-Spaniards

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.410
of the expedition came from.

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:26.640
And I get a sense or a
hint that's an indication

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:31.500
of Spain's global position because
it seems to, a lot of it seems

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.440
to coincide with the
Holy Roman Emperor.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.740
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Yes.

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.040
&gt;&gt; And I, the empire.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.240
And I don't remember how
many Spanish kings were

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.240
in effect also Holy Roman Emperors.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.230
J. Michael Francis: Well in
this period it's just one.

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:44.570
It's just Carlos Jesus.

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:47.910
Charles I and then Charles
IV Holy Roman Emperor.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:57.980
And so from, Spain of course is
present in Italy, is, you know,

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.000 position:56%
Italian merchants have been
setting up, moving their merchandise

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.970
from the Indian Ocean and Asia into
Spanish ports like [inaudible].

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:11.350 position:56%
So in [inaudible] for example in the
16th century there's a large Greek

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:17.640 position:56%
and Italian community of Florentines
and Genoese and Venetians

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:23.740
and Greeks living in
[inaudible] at that time.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.610
So that, the world
of these mariners,

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:33.000
so many of these non-Spaniards
were people in the maritime world.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.750
And they're circulating in
ways that we'd love to plot.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:42.570 position:56%
You know, we want to start to see
the movement of Flemish sea captains

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:47.260
who then become commissioned by the
Spanish crown to send provisions

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.330
and captain ships to different
parts of the Americas.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.590
And so we want to build that
database of those people.

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:57.750
And in fact do some geoplotting

00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:00.500
and plot the movements
of people over time.

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.590
I've read and I don't know if this
is true but certainly a number

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:09.110
of historians have repeated it and
I'm just as guilty of repeating it.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.740
But the word is that
Pedro Menendez Aviles

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:16.600
who founded St. Augustine crossed
the Atlantic Ocean 50 times.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:22.820
Now this is, it's hard to fathom.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.370
How many people really have
crossed the Atlantic 50 times

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:27.780
in an airplane?

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.720
Let alone in 16th century ships.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.530
He once sailed from St.
Augustine to the Canary Islands

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:40.010
in a small chalupa and
made that trip in 18 days.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:42.910
So if we could plot them over time

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:45.380
and Francisco's team
would do a timeline,

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.680
you could plot an individual's
life and that movement.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.320
And that's one of the things that
we want to incorporate into this.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:57.460 position:56%
Because I think anybody who works on
Colonial Latin American history one

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:03.750
of the first things that is so
striking is how much people moved.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.330
People who were in Italy, in
Flanders, in different parts

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:11.620
of Spain, in New Spain, in
Peru, Northern South America

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.910
and had networks of people in
the movement of that information.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:19.060
And lots of people have
written about this.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.930
We'd like to try to find ways
to visualize that movement

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:26.570
so that it becomes very clear
to those who look at it.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.230
And say wow, I didn't realize
there was this kind of movement.

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:34.230
And plot Menendez's
movement over his life.

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:36.030
So.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:40.050
[ Pause ]

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.520
Wonderful.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.820
Thank you.

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.120
Yes.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:47.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you Michael.

00:59:47.460 --> 01:00:00.250
I'm sorry I missed part
of the [inaudible].

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:07.410
I'm sure this was fascinating
[inaudible] Spanish embassies.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:11.900
I'd like to offer support
[inaudible] should you need our

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.200
assistance [inaudible].

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.730
And even enlarge it to other states

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:19.920
because I understand this
is restrained to Florida.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.990
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Well
it's beginning with Florida.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:26.970
What we hope is that this could
be an example for a different way

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:32.740
to do digital history
and digital humanities.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:38.200
And that other places would say
yeah, we want to do something

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.270
like this for Texas,
California, New Spain, Cuba.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:46.860
You know the prosopography
it's one of the problems

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.510
with doing prosopography
is it's enormously,

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.780
enormously time consuming.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:58.560
And it's not something you'd
really have a doctoral student do

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.310
because unless you wanted
that doctoral student

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:05.680
to spend 15 years doing
that project.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.860
But if it were in smaller
parts and we could farm

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.740
out those smaller pieces
then that could work.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.190
I would love to see the kind of
prosopography that we've done

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:17.250
for Florida for other
parts of Spanish America.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.460
And right now it's
really quite limited.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.080
And especially if you were to
compare it to the work they've done

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080
in England which is incredible,

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.470
the prosopography for
Anglo Saxon England.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:33.050
They're all sorts of incredible
sites on prosopography in England

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.780
because they've spent so
much time working on that.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.560
And we just don't have the
equivalent for Spanish America yet.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.630
&gt;&gt; I was going to say
when you say Florida,

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:46.300
what's your [inaudible] definition.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.890
I understand West Florida ran
all the way to the Mississippi.

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.250
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis: Yes and of
course West Florida doesn't exist

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.780
until after the British arrive.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:59.490
So Florida in the 16th century, I'm
taking the very loose definition

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:01.480
of what the Spanish
refer to as [inaudible]

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.570
which extended all the way
up the Atlantic seaboard.

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:05.870
You could make a case

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:09.880
that it included even
Newfoundland even though in many

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.830
of the maps they start to
refer to that area once you get

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:17.670
up into New England as the
Province of Cod [inaudible].

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.480
And you see the, this is
the land of [inaudible]

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.020
where they would cod fish.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.100
But the Spanish saw that all as
part of the provinces of Florida

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.670
and it extended into the
interior until you arrived

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:33.940
at some unknown place

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.160
that eventually marked
what became New Spain.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.250
&gt;&gt; I was going to say
when you mentioned cod,

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.970
the fisheries attracted
Spanish fishermen

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.750
from an early, early period.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.400
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis:
Oh absolutely.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.770
&gt;&gt; It was the cod.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.800
&gt;&gt; J. Michael Francis:
Yea, absolutely.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.070
In fact it would not
be at all surprising

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:53.370
if there were cod [inaudible]

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.770
and French cod fishermen before
Columbus fishing off those

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.070
grand banks.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:59.000
But, you know, we don't
have the documents for it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.380
They were certainly fishing there

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.350
in the late 15th century
without a doubt.

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:07.450
And we have the documentation for
that cod fishing in the 1490s.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.750
So probably before then
they were cod fishing there.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.360
So yea, so that would be the
definition in the 16th century.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.770
And then that definition, those
boundaries change over time.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:13.450
And so you could do a timeline
for Florida that would mark that.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.750
You know, you could mark
those geographical divisions.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.050
&gt;&gt; I have an announcement.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.350
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
