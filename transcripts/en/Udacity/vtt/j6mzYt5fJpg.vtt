00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.410
So let's use these features to implement a profile picture

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.620
taker in our Conference app. I've included the framework for a

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.650
camera control in the Conference app already. You'll need to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.350
fill in the interesting bits here. First, here's the code that

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.200
gets called when the user starts up the camera. And

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.080
right here, you need to fill in the code that asks

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.650
for access to the webcam. Note that we've already set

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.300
up constraints for you. And you have success and error callbacks

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
defined down below. Fill out the code for this function right here, now.
