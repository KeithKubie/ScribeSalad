00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:25.659
and I thought what could they do with
this in part to knowing Greg Sestero and

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669
this in part to knowing Greg Sestero and
 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.729
this in part to knowing Greg Sestero and
Tommy was so and their relationship and

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:27.739
Tommy was so and their relationship and
 

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.149
Tommy was so and their relationship and
stuff where could this go after this and

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:31.159
stuff where could this go after this and
 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.189
stuff where could this go after this and
I actually started to get really excited

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199
I actually started to get really excited
 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.379
I actually started to get really excited
I'm like actually there's there's a lot

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:35.389
I'm like actually there's there's a lot
 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.169
I'm like actually there's there's a lot
of potential here with this set up like

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:38.179
of potential here with this set up like
 

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:40.029
of potential here with this set up like
I don't know exactly where they're gonna

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039
I don't know exactly where they're gonna
 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.199
I don't know exactly where they're gonna
go but there's kind of all these

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:41.209
go but there's kind of all these
 

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:43.149
go but there's kind of all these
possibilities and serve all these

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:43.159
possibilities and serve all these
 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.679
possibilities and serve all these
different ways you could look at it and

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:44.689
different ways you could look at it and
 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:46.869
different ways you could look at it and
film it and interpret in everything so

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879
film it and interpret in everything so
 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.899
film it and interpret in everything so
it it actually it when I let it sit for

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:49.909
it it actually it when I let it sit for
 

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:51.399
it it actually it when I let it sit for
a while and I thought about what they

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:51.409
a while and I thought about what they
 

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.379
a while and I thought about what they
could do I just got really excited to

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389
could do I just got really excited to
 

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.679
could do I just got really excited to
see a part - I'm actually like super

00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:56.689

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:02.899
yeah so that's something that's good
 

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.350
yeah so that's something that's good
knowing going in in my opinion it's like

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360
knowing going in in my opinion it's like
 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.019
knowing going in in my opinion it's like
the one kind of spoiler I guess you know

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:08.029
the one kind of spoiler I guess you know
 

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.609
the one kind of spoiler I guess you know
it's kinda like saying you know you see

00:08:09.609 --> 00:08:09.619
it's kinda like saying you know you see
 

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.109
it's kinda like saying you know you see
Star Wars there's gonna be more it's

00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:11.119
Star Wars there's gonna be more it's
 

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:13.659
Star Wars there's gonna be more it's
like you know it doesn't really ruin

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:13.669
like you know it doesn't really ruin
 

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:18.009
like you know it doesn't really ruin
anything but yeah it's it's one of those

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:18.019
anything but yeah it's it's one of those
 

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:20.949
anything but yeah it's it's one of those
films where it's it is taken more

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:20.959
films where it's it is taken more
 

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.299
films where it's it is taken more
seriously but there's definitely a very

00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:22.309
seriously but there's definitely a very
 

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:24.579
seriously but there's definitely a very
comedic edge to it still

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:24.589
comedic edge to it still
 

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:27.519
comedic edge to it still
and there are still awkward moments in

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:27.529
and there are still awkward moments in
 

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.069
and there are still awkward moments in
both some of the performances and the

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:30.079
both some of the performances and the
 

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.899
both some of the performances and the
filmmaking like it's something at least

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:31.909
filmmaking like it's something at least
 

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:33.309
filmmaking like it's something at least
in the version I saw the frame rate

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:33.319
in the version I saw the frame rate
 

00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:35.139
in the version I saw the frame rate
sometimes was a little weird like

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:35.149
sometimes was a little weird like
 

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.059
sometimes was a little weird like
sometimes it'll go in slow-mo and I was

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:37.069
sometimes it'll go in slow-mo and I was
 

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:38.709
sometimes it'll go in slow-mo and I was
just like well why did that go and so

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719
just like well why did that go and so
 

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:41.439
just like well why did that go and so
like not even like super slow-mo like

00:08:41.439 --> 00:08:41.449
like not even like super slow-mo like
 

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:42.639
like not even like super slow-mo like
there's a lot of times like then that's

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:42.649
there's a lot of times like then that's
 

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:44.439
there's a lot of times like then that's
fine but like there's like candles on a

00:08:44.439 --> 00:08:44.449
fine but like there's like candles on a
 

00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:46.509
fine but like there's like candles on a
cake and it shot a little bit in slow-mo

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519
cake and it shot a little bit in slow-mo
 

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.429
cake and it shot a little bit in slow-mo
and I'm thinking why why was that shot a

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:48.439
and I'm thinking why why was that shot a
 

00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:50.379
and I'm thinking why why was that shot a
little bit in slow-mo or they slow down

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:50.389
little bit in slow-mo or they slow down
 

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:52.900
little bit in slow-mo or they slow down
the frame rate or whatever so or sped up

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:52.910
the frame rate or whatever so or sped up
 

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.290
the frame rate or whatever so or sped up
I guess

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.300
I guess
 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.990
I guess
now it just looks slow anyway whatever

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000
now it just looks slow anyway whatever
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.449
now it just looks slow anyway whatever
they did um you know it's something it's

00:08:58.449 --> 00:08:58.459
they did um you know it's something it's
 

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:01.210
they did um you know it's something it's
a hint distracting but because it's also

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220
a hint distracting but because it's also
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.360
a hint distracting but because it's also
kind of this weird abstract way that

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.370
kind of this weird abstract way that
 

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.550
kind of this weird abstract way that
they're shooting it and editing it you

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560
they're shooting it and editing it you
 

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.750
they're shooting it and editing it you
know you could argue that's part of the

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
know you could argue that's part of the
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.420
know you could argue that's part of the
style or if you want just look at as

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:10.430
style or if you want just look at as
 

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.639
style or if you want just look at as
like oh well that was weird goofy

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:12.649
like oh well that was weird goofy
 

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:14.530
like oh well that was weird goofy
filmmaking or that was a mistake or

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:14.540
filmmaking or that was a mistake or
 

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.290
filmmaking or that was a mistake or
whatever this is the duo that you know

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:17.300
whatever this is the duo that you know
 

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.670
whatever this is the duo that you know
kind of is known for that

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680
kind of is known for that
 

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.639
kind of is known for that
so it's in my opinion it's kind of a

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:21.649
so it's in my opinion it's kind of a
 

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:24.250
so it's in my opinion it's kind of a
perfect circle of like all these

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.260
perfect circle of like all these
 

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.569
perfect circle of like all these
different elements of having good

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:25.579
different elements of having good
 

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:27.460
different elements of having good
filmmaking kind of awkward filmmaking

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.470
filmmaking kind of awkward filmmaking
 

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.500
filmmaking kind of awkward filmmaking
and good acting and awkward act it kind

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:29.510
and good acting and awkward act it kind
 

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.079
and good acting and awkward act it kind
of coming together and you know making

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:32.089
of coming together and you know making
 

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:35.639
of coming together and you know making
something that's both really kind of

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:35.649
something that's both really kind of
 

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:38.800
something that's both really kind of
both kind of blatant in what they're

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:38.810
both kind of blatant in what they're
 

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.810
both kind of blatant in what they're
doing but also raises a lot of questions

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:40.820
doing but also raises a lot of questions
 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.940

of the things they're implying or you
 

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.630
of the things they're implying or you
can take out of this you're kind of

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640
can take out of this you're kind of
 

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.550

fascinating film to kind of think about
 

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.760
fascinating film to kind of think about
it's to me it's just the right amount of

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:09.770
it's to me it's just the right amount of

just a right amount of giving you hints
 

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.810
just a right amount of giving you hints
