DAVID KATZ: Hi, I'm David.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.140
I'm a designer, and a
developer, and a founder.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.290
Over the last seven years
I've founded three companies,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.040
and lately I've been
doing a lot of work

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.480
with Google, helping them
with their startup education

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.450
programs.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.110
So this year I've done
talks about startups

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.149
in London, and Tel Aviv,
and in Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.190
Because I have a lot of
exposure to the community

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.360
I talk to a lot of
startups-- every year,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.710
at least 100 startups.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.467
And that really gets my pattern
recognition engines going.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.050
What I want to talk
to you about today

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.675
is something which
might sound obvious.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:37.220
And it's about building
something people want.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.290
You see, most startups fail.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.020
It sort of depends on
how you measure it,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.700
but between 70% and 90% of
startups do not succeed.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.300
And the reason
they don't succeed

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.530
is not because they fail to
build something-- in fact,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.090
most startups build
products, especially

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.890
if they have engineers
on their teams.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.080
The reason that most
startups don't succeed

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.820
is because they build
something people don't want.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.610
You see, startups, they
face incredible friction.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.860
People don't just walk
around waiting for startups

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.870
to release new products.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.320
They're not looking for change.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.407
So if you want people
to use your product,

00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:12.240
you really have to solve
a problem for them,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.590
and you have to do it, I
think, by doing something

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.340
that 10 times better
than the alternative.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.506
You know, doing something
that's a little bit better

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.080
than the alternative
isn't enough,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.800
because people are
resistant to change.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.660
Another reason that
it's really important

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.490
to make something
that's 10 times better

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.220
is that almost always the
first versions of your product

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.690
aren't going to be that great.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.580
So they're usually going to
have bugs that you didn't catch,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.430
and you're usually not going to
be great at communicating them

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.114
well, and what their value is.

00:01:40.114 --> 00:01:41.530
And you're not
going to figure out

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.640
where to get the right
people in, the right users

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.460
and the right customers.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.220
And building something
that's so much

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.170
better than the
alternative really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.570
pushes through all
of these things.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.240
So how do you create something
that's 10 times better?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.410
One way to almost
certainly not do it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.680
is to take a competing product,
and try to match every feature,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.490
and just try to do it better.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.960
If you want to build something
that's significantly better,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420
you usually need to
do something else.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.690
You need a new take on things.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.990
You need a new understanding
of a problem, something

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.475
that your competitors
didn't quite see.

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:13.850
I'll give you one example
which is a product that I built

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.520
called MixTiles, which is
essentially an app for getting

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.630
photos out of your
phone, to your wall.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.670
And this space of online
printing is super competitive.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.230
There's companies
in that space that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.700
are worth billions of
dollars, like Shutterfly.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.060
And they have an incredible
array of features.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.052
And MixTiles, when it launched,
had almost no features.

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:38.260
I'll give you some examples
of things it didn't have.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.937
So you couldn't
crop your photos.

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:41.520
You couldn't even
preview your photos,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.010
and see how they
would look like.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.630
And you couldn't
even pay in the app.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.190
So you had to get, an email,
and then pay through the email.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.680
But what it did let you do
is get photos from your phone

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.070
to your wall.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.290
And that was my theory
of what people wanted,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.110
and that's something that I
think MixTiles made 10 times

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930
better, even though
it didn't have

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.560
all these features like
cropping and payments.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.780
So knowing what problem
you're solving also really

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.870
focuses in the beginning.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.040
Because when I built the
first version of MixTiles,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.090
I knew that the problem
that I want to solve

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.749
is just to get photos from
the phone to the wall.

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.540
And every time I thought
of another feature

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.222
like, should I do cropping,
I just asked myself,

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:22.680
does that help you get photos
from your phone to your wall,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.410
or can you get photos from
your phone to your wall

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.530
without this feature?

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.960
And the answer is yes, even
without a cropping feature,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.470
you could still get photos
from your phone to your wall.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.940
And that's why I didn't build
that feature, for example.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.290
So how do you know?

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.900
How do you know if the
product that you built

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.010
is something that people want?

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.480
There's two great
techniques that I

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.760
want to talk to you about.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.690
The first is a data
driven technique,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.320
an analytics based technique.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.370
And that's measuring
something called retention.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.340
Retention is a
metric that captures

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.530
how people return to use your
product after they were already

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.860
exposed to it.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.090
It's a great metric,
because people only

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.320
return to use something if
it's something they want.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.600
Other metrics, like
number of downloads,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.390
or number of registrations, are
easy to influence artificially.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.660
So for example, if you
get press coverage,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.190
people will download your app.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.506
Or if you advertise, people
will download your app.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.589
But none of that means
that they actually want it.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.269
It just means that you exposed
them to it, and they tried it.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.170
Retention is something that only
works if people want your app.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.870
One simple way to
measure retention

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.620
is something called
30 day active.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.090
It's basically out of the
people that were first

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.090
exposed to your product,
how many of them

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.480
still use it after 30 days?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.670
And if that number is something
significant, like 20%, or 30%,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.720
or really anything
that's not nothing,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.050
then you may have a
product in there, something

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.170
that people really want to use.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.340
Another great mechanism
is customer feedback,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.729
just hearing what people think.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.270
Something that I
love doing is making

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.570
it really easy for my
users and customers

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.350
to send me feedback
through the product--

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.249
so, for example, a button
that says Email Us.

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.540
When you do that, people
start telling you things about

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.937
your product, and you can see if
they love it or if they don't.

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:08.520
What you want to see, though,
is that people love the product.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.302
You don't want to see emails
like, yeah this is pretty nice,

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:12.260
or something like that.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.346
You want people to
be excited about it.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.720
You want them to
tell you stories

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.830
about how you've
solved their problems.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.880
Or you want them to be angry
that something's missing,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.409
because anybody who takes
the time to write you angrily

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.450
that they're missing
something about your product

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.991
is somebody who is
using your product

00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:28.460
and is getting value out of it.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.180
To summarize, what I
wanted to talk to you about

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.120
is building something
people want.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.970
It may sound obvious,
but it's not.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.210
So many startups fail to
build something people want.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.140
And if the one thing
you get out of this talk

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.710
is just focusing on that,
and committing internally

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.350
to try to build something people
want, that's already great.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.690
We've also talked about one way
to build something people want,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.930
which is committing to
building a solution that's

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.950
10 times better than
existing solutions.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.896
Not a little bit
better, a lot better.

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:01.270
The last thing we
talked about is

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.370
how to measure if
you've succeeded.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.330
We've talked about retention,
which is people coming back

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.239
to use your product
again and again.

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:10.030
We've talked about
customer feedback, which

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.410
is people telling you that
they love your product,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.940
or being angry because
it's missing something.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.220
I hope that this
set of tools helps

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.630
you build something people want.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.980
It's something which has
helped me greatly in the past.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.630
That's it.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.430
Good luck.
