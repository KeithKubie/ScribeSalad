00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
Let me officially introduce you to Micah Wiens [oh] hello Ying

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.899
And he just ate a bunch of milk. So he is happily taking a nap

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.469
Micah!

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.369
mmm

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.869
Let's take a step back and jump back a couple of months to March

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.779
2016 and I had noticed that Ying was somehow eating a lot

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.649
Ying eats a lot normally but she was eating more than normal, an abnormal amount and I was so excited about it because

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.259
When we would go out to eat that means like we could order more food than we normally did

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.160
and we actually happened to be traveling in Jordan, and it was exactly the 27th of

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.750
March 2016 and that day we drove to the Dead sea

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.669
But somewhere along the day, I remember we stopped at a convenience store and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.599
I wanted to buy some water and Ying wanted to buy some snacks and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.949
Ying bought something in a box, and I didn't really even look at it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.130
I didn't even know what it was

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.199
I didn't even think twice either because you can always buys like random lotions and cosmetics when we go into convenience stores

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.710
So I didn't even think of anything of it. I just paid and we took our bag we

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.729
Drove and continued on to the dead sea, and we checked into our hotel and right before

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.508
We went to dinner Ying comes out of the bathroom and she says Mark I

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.099
Think I'm pregnant. I remember Ying went back into the bathroom

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.579
she tested the second time just to confirm, came back with a positive result and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.899
both of us were just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.899
thrilled

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.350
Ying and I and our baby

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.780
Just finished taking a 39 day trip around the world we visited nine different cities

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.109
ten if you include Bangkok and just.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.699
[It] Was the night before last night, we flew back from Hong Kong back to Bangkok and today. We have a doctor's [appointment] and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.919
I am really excited to see the ultrasound. It has been about a month and a half since our last checkup and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.490
So we are on our way to the hospital now

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.229
I always drink three or four waters

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.169
I don't think I mentioned this before, but we are having a boy and he is

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.990
800 grams already! The baby is healthy and Mama Ying is healthy.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.759
It's September 29th, and it has only been 2 weeks since the last doctor's appointment checkup

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.190
That we've had but the doctor wanted us to come in again after two weeks because on our last checkup

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.800
The baby had not yet turned, and so everything was okay with the baby and the baby is healthy

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.920
He's healthy, but she wanted us the doctor wanted us to come back to make sure that he turns the last two weeks though

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.830
The baby has really really been squirming around in Ying's stomach you can you can actually just watch Ying's

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.610
stomach just bulge and go up and down. He is squirming around getting ready for the ultrasound. Check out that stomach

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.899
The baby has not yet turned, so the doctor said we should come back in three weeks, and hopefully he will have turned by then

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.400
34 weeks October 19 2016, Ying and I are in our new room

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.860
[haha], It's getting here! That sticks to your stomach

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.490
Since the last time I made a video we have moved into a new house, our previous house

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.409
It was going to get really crammed, and we wanted to our baby to have his own room

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.410
I'm going to set up the baby bed right now

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.200
I think I better quickly look at the instructions to see how to put this together

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.559
I managed to work up quite a sweat putting that together feels pretty sturdy. We just finished with the doctor's appointment and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.299
Unfortunately he still hasn't turned so he's still in the breech position with his head up and his feet down

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.820
So that's a little bit concerning

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.590
And today we have another checkup

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.000
and we've definitely made some progress and some big things have changed, the first thing that I want to share with you is that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.939
well first of all, I am

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.250
Pretty bad with names and I never really I never even really thought

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.930
You know some people how they like love certain names, and how they've been dreaming about

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.869
Naming someone a certain name that they love I have never ever had any of those thoughts

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.479
So we finally came across Micah and what we're thinking is that his first name will be English

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.730
And then his middle name will be Thai

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.439
And then his last name of course will be Wiens and then the second big thing that has changed

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.339
Since the last vlog about the baby two weeks ago. We're gonna have to go outside, but I'm really excited for this one

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.449
It has been over 10 years since the last car that I owned which is back in the U.S. during university

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.209
And then I sold off everything to travel and I came to Thailand in Southeast, Asia

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.240
That's where I met Ying and life changed

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.210
And so this is the first car that I've owned since university which has been maybe

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Yeah, exactly exactly

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.909
nine, nine, ten years ago

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.829
One of the biggest reasons we got this car is because I did not want Ying

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.130
or the baby to be riding around in Bangkok Taxis, and it's just not safe to ride motorbikes and

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.580
And when thinking about having a baby, transportation

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.470
becomes a challenge and so the real best way to get around is by having your own car transportation in Bangkok and

00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:01.389
Also with this vehicle I'm really hoping to get off the beaten path in thailand, so that's hopefully what you can expect in the future

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.960
lots of Road tripping in thailand to come

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.590
There's his face

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.480
And his nose. The doctor said he has some of my same features

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.950
He's pretty tall and quite thin as well kind of like, kind of like me, and then we saw his face

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.989
It's amazing the only

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.610
Difficulty now is that he still hasn't turned so he's still in the breech position, so this is

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.120
starting to get a little bit concerning and the doctor has

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.749
Recommended that we might have to schedule for a c-section

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.540
Good morning, everyone it is November 12th

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.510
2016 and

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.070
Ying woke up this morning

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:50.610
And she said that the baby wasn't really moving like he normally does and she also said that she has a headache

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.779
So she decided to call the hospital to see if we could book an appointment

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.700
And we were hopefully just going to have a quick ultrasound make sure the baby is okay

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.230
We arrived to the hospital, and then they brought us up to the birth unit

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.049
division, and they brought us into a room, checked the heartbeat of the baby is all okay

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.120
And then the doctor came in and took a look at Ying and she said Ying has gone into labor.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.020
Surprise!

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.479
So she said today we need to do an emergency C-section

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:28.530
And by the way when you come into the birth unit you take off your shoes, and they give you some pink Crocs

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.110
Getting ready to go into the operating room

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.060
All right, let's do this

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.619
Oh, for my ears

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.640
All right, I am ready

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.469
That was one of the scariest, but the absolute happiest and most

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.440
Joyous moment of my entire life

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.160
His name is Micah and he is hanging out right there

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.149
Mama Ying has just been rolled into the room

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.920
She is a

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.390
champion! It's about 6:00 p.m. this evening in Bangkok. It has been a long day and a surprising

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.859
kind of shocking, but the most amazing

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.350
Joyous day that I've ever had in my life

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:50.920
I cannot even explain the feeling I had when I was sitting with Ying in the operating room and

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.179
moments, and then somewhere during that

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.429
During that situation. I could all of a sudden hear a baby crying and I got my first glimpse of Micah and

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.820
then holding him for the first time and

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.259
Also a big thank you to the doctors and all the nurses that helped

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:19.479
They I'm so glad they know what they're doing, and also I just praise God for Micah being healthy. He's healthy. He's strong

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:25.150
Ying had, even though we would have preferred to give a natural birth if possible

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.129
it worked out for the c-section, and that's what the safest way and

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.430
The way the doctor recommended so and even we weren't expecting at all to have a baby today

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:44.050
God always has a plan. I am so happy right now, and I cannot even express my

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.190
My joy

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.570
but

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.499
Yeah, it's, it's amazing. It's an amazing feeling

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:01.469
Hi cutie, you smiling? Yeah. Yeah, he's smiling.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:10.799
My name is Ying and he is your daddy. You can see him even when he's asleep, he is practicing his eating

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.880
He's going to be an eater

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.440
I've never been

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440
happier and prouder

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.650
in my life, and I can just like

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.660
I could just sit here and like look at him all the time

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.900
Yeah, it's just the most amazing

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.920
sensational experience

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.020
That I wouldn't trade for anything

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.760
