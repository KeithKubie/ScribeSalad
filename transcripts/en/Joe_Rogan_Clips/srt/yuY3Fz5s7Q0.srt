1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,220
My attention span I think
has been shortened. Yeah.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,900
I'll sit down to watch a movie at home.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,830
I'm mean in 10 minutes I'm reaching for
my phone. Yes. I'm not a heart surgeon.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,080
There's no emergency that
need, you know? Right, right.

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,980
It might be just be checking Twitter
again or concern, you know? Um,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,630
so it's a perfect storm. Yeah. Of
distractions and we now know is,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,240
is addictive. So yeah. How
you turn that around. I,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,350
I mean it feels like there's a little bit
of a movement of people to switch that

9
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,980
stuff off and just read a book
or go for a walk or, but yeah.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,160
You got to have real
discipline. No, I mean,

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,850
you're fighting against our fucking
heroin addiction, man. Yeah. It's crazy.

12
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,730
And everyone else is addicted to oh yeah.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,480
So you're not part of the
conversation if you're not.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,860
I walked into a restaurant the other
night and everyone was looking at their

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,850
phone. No one was looking at each
other. I'm like, I'm in a movie. Yeah.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,590
This is a movie. So I'm posted
public some. Yeah. I mean if,

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,510
if instead of looking at their phones,
if everyone was just looking at the sky,

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,960
you'd be like, oh my God,
there's a real problem. These
people are sick. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,740
Something wrong. You know, if everybody's
just sitting there with our hands open,

20
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,130
like staring up at the sky and sitting
next to each other, you'd be like,

21
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,180
these people are sick. There's something
wrong. They need help. Instead they're,

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,250
they're looking at nothing. Yeah. They're
checking their feed over and over again.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,020
Someone's complaining about Captain
Marvel being a woman. Hey. Yeah.

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,420
And all the experts. Are they the
ones getting followed on there? Oh,

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,140
I don't know who in experts, experts in
whatever, you know, the ones who already,

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,880
or are we looking at them?
You know, it should be this,

27
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:30,570
this free flow of information where
you can find out anything in your hand.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,550
What an incredible thing. Yeah. But it's
not that. It's definitely not that well.

29
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,150
I think there's two things.
I think, one we didn't earn,

30
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,430
it is just given to us.
Right?

31
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,810
It's not like we did all the work to
curate all this technology and put it

32
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,180
together and figuring out how
to implement it in our deal. No,

33
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:52,350
we just went to the fucking Verizon
store and picked up a new phone. I mean,

34
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:56,790
that's, that's what most people are
doing. Yeah. And because of that,

35
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:01,110
it's almost like being, um, like a
trust fund kid or something like that.

36
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,970
It's just all given to you. It's
all handed to you all this, I felt,

37
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,340
I feel the same way
sometimes about weapons.

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,910
I feel like the discipline required to
learn how to use one and create it and

39
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:15,841
build it,

40
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:20,190
and then understand the responsibility
of actually using it on a human being.

41
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,120
All that shit's out the window. You just
go to the store and buy it. You know?

42
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,660
There's no requirements of you other
than you never killed anybody yet.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,250
Have you written, driven over anybody in
your car? No. If you're robbed a bank, no.

44
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,750
Okay. Yeah. You beating your wife?
No. Okay. Here, here's a guy. Yeah.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,760
It's fucking strange.
And this as,

46
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,780
as a human being,
the,

47
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,070
the lack of discipline
and accountability that,

48
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:51,071
that we have in this ultimate access to
all these things constantly and many of

49
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,520
them become just massive distractions.
And yeah,

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,720
this in some ways is,

51
00:02:56,721 --> 00:03:00,230
is the utopia that people have dreamed
of during the for generation. Sure,

52
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:03,070
we're free of war. You're not going
to get attacked in your house tonight.

53
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,370
You're not going to starve and you have
everything you could possibly need.

54
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,940
So you'd think we'd become the perfect
human beings in the absence of all those

55
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,440
things that would have
killed us in the past.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
I would have made life hard in
the past. Yeah. And again, that's,

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,060
that's not what we're doing.
Well,

58
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,500
I don't think we operate very
well without legitimate conflict,

59
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,610
without legitimate conflict in terms
of like actual things you need to worry

60
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,460
about. Like I, when I used
to live in the east coast,

61
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:31,360
one of the things that was really
noticeable was that when it snowed out,

62
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:35,380
people were nicer. They help people and
they're broken down the side of the road.

63
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,640
They were nice to each other.

64
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:41,320
There was a sense of vulnerability that
we are all deeply entrenched in this

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,470
winter nature thing and we've got to work
together, otherwise we can't survive.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,820
Yeah.
You know,

67
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,850
and I think that applies to all aspects
of life that when there's no real

68
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,910
danger, people become
extremely frivolous. Yeah.

69
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,010
It's amazing how quickly we
become lazy and complacent. Um,

70
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,150
and actually the flip side of the
negative stuff I was saying earlier,

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,380
some good days I'll come back
from Yemen, Syria, wherever.

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,480
I'll go out and I got a cup of coffee,

73
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,990
coffee and I'll read the newspaper
and I'll donate and I'll think, man,

74
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,590
I'm the luckiest man alive. Yeah.
The flip side, I can do this.

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,490
Cause you do experience these horrific
environments so you can appreciate it.

76
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,150
Yeah. And the fact that we can, you know
what I mean? Within a few hours here,

77
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,330
we could have one of the best meals.
Yeah. Possibly in the world we could,

78
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,320
you know, it's, you know, it's,
that's fitting incredible.

79
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,060
So on good days that you can, you
can, you can appreciate that. Again,

80
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,960
this is you coming from these bad things.
So it puts it in perspective. So yeah,

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,720
I was just trying to try to back you up
and say, yeah, like if you, if you're not,

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,230
if you're not protected from all of that
stuff then you can get to appreciate

83
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,990
the basics. Again, I was on
this trip and Prince of Wales,

84
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:48,400
we camped out on this island.
It rained every day for six days,

85
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,580
seven days. I mean we were
soaked, you're soaked,

86
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:54,280
everything soaked your sleeping bag.
So tent soaked,

87
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:59,281
everything came back
home and it felt so good.

88
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,260
Like I'd never felt the
sun like that before.

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Like the sun was just this like this
magic love glow that the sky was pouring

90
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,230
down on the city. Everything felt
so happy and I realized like,

91
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,430
well you can't really appreciate this
until it's taken away from you. Yeah,

92
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,420
it's taken away from you.
Then you understand what
it is. So then you want to,

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,460
when the kids of today grow up,

94
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,490
what are they going to be
like when everything has
just been at their fingertips

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,190
from day one forever. Forever. No mystery.

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,030
They don't understand
bullshitters either because like,

97
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,500
like when I was a kid, people just a lie
about shit and you really didn't know.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,840
You're like, man, I don't know.
He seems like he's full of Shit.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,530
You couldn't just yet have to go
to an encyclopedia and you know,

100
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,730
and actually read the information. Now you
can go, okay, what year did this happen?

101
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,120
And you pull up your phone kit
though. Fuck Outta here. You know,

102
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,120
people lie about being in the Olympics,
they lied about this,

103
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:56,410
they lied about that.
They'll, yeah, it's um,

104
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,410
it's good in that we have ultimate access
to information for people that use it

105
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,770
and understand what it is and appreciate
it. It is good. But to your point,

106
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,600
if there was a way to actually filter
and say this is verifiable, this, yeah,

107
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,870
this contains seven things,
which are absolutely bullshit.

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,950
We have no doubt about that whatsoever. If
that could exist. Wonderful. But I mean,

109
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,950
Fox, I've tried it. A few
people have tried it, used to,

110
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,190
it still feels like you end up
being described as, you know,

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,280
being on one side of the fight.

112
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,270
I almost feel like we need some
sort of organized discipline,

113
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,410
like maybe like a
mandatory volunteer work,

114
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,050
cleaning up impoverished communities
are mandatory volunteer work doing their

115
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,560
like, but I don't want people
to have to do things like, um,

116
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,810
I'm conflicted on that too, but I don't
want people to have to do that. You know,

117
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,140
like when there's countries that
have mandatory military service,

118
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,390
they seem to have an amazing feeling of,

119
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,470
of patriotism in those countries and
appreciation in those countries because

120
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,410
they actually do have to join the
military for two years or whatever it is.

121
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,760
We don't have that over here.
