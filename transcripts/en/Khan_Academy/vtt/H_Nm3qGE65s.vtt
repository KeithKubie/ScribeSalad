00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:01.723
- [Instructor] The goal of this video

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:04.526
is to get an appreciation
that you could have many,

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:06.231
in fact, you could have an infinite number

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:09.080
of functions that have the same limit

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.317
as x approaches infinity.

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.945
So, if we were to make
the general statement

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.016
that the limit of some function f of x,

00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:17.750
as x approaches infinity,
is equal to three.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.805
What I wanna do in this video

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:20.801
is show some examples of that.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.261
And to show that we can keep creating

00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.290
more and more examples,
really an infinite number

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.813
of examples where that
is going to be true.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.987
So, for example, we could
look at this graph over here.

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:34.000
And in other videos, we'll think
about why this is the case,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.179
but just think about what happens when

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.376
you have very, very large Xs.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:38.960
When you have very, very large Xs,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.825
the plus five doesn't matter as much,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.262
and so it gets closer and
closer to three x squared

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.355
over x squared, which is equal to three.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:47.025
And you could see that right over here,

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:49.176
it's graphed in this green color.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:51.856
And you can see, even
when x is equal to 10,

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:54.374
we're getting awfully close
to three right over there.

00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:56.561
Let me zoom out a little
bit so you see our axes.

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:57.710
So that is three.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.170
Let me draw a dotted
line at the asymptote.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.217
That is y is equal to
three, and so you see

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:05.802
the function's getting closer and closer

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.387
as x approaches infinity.

00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:09.256
But that's not the only
function that could do that,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:10.682
as I keep saying, there's
an infinite number

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:11.940
of functions that could do that.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.015
You could have this somewhat wild function

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.764
that involves natural logs.

00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:18.772
That too, as x approaches infinity,

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:22.142
it is getting closer and closer to three.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.404
It might be getting closer to three

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:26.168
at a slightly slower rate
than the one in green,

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:27.551
but we're talking about infinity.

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.676
As x approaches infinity, this
thing is approaching three.

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:32.504
And as we've talked about in other videos,

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.089
you could even have things that keep

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:35.719
oscillating around the asymptote,

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.527
as long as they're getting
closer and closer and closer

00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:43.286
to it as x gets larger
and larger and larger.

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:45.679
So, for example, that
function right over there.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:46.817
Let me zoom in.

00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:48.317
So, let's zoom in.

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.196
Let's say when x is equal to 14,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.226
we can see that they're
all approaching three.

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.297
The purple one is oscillating around it,

00:01:57.297 --> 00:02:00.706
the other two are
approaching three from below.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:02.573
But as we get much larger,

00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:05.626
let me actually zoom out a
ways, and then I'll zoom in.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:09.122
So let's get to really large values.

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:12.057
So, actually, even 100
isn't even that large

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.968
if we're thinking about infinity.

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.348
Even a trillion wouldn't be that large

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:16.401
if we're thinking about infinity.

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:17.986
But let's go to 200.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:20.954
200 is much larger than
numbers we've been looking at.

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:22.498
And let me zoom in

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:25.380
when x is equal to 200, and you can see,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.770
we have to zoom in an
awfully lot, an awful lot,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.161
just to even see that the
graphs still aren't quite

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.235
stabilized around the asymptote,

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:39.450
that they are a little bit
different than the asymptote.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.358
I really zoomed in, I
mean look at the scale.

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:45.094
This is, each of these are
now 100th, each square.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:46.147
And so we've gotten much, much,

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:47.975
much closer to the asymptote.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:49.156
In fact, the green function,

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:50.659
we still can't tell the difference.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.054
You can see the calculation, this is up to

00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:54.517
three or four decimal places,

00:02:54.517 --> 00:02:56.955
we're getting awfully close to three now,

00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:58.419
but we aren't there.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.975
So the green functions
got there the fastest,

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:02.315
is an argument.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.729
But the whole point of this
is to emphasize the fact

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.493
that there's an infinite
number of functions

00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:11.171
for which you could make
the statement that we made.

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.480
That the limit of the function
as x approaches infinity,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.875
in this case, we said that limit is going

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.814
to be equal to three, and I
just picked three arbitrarily.

00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:26.079
This could be true for
any, for any function.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.764
I didn't realize how much I had zoomed in.

00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:31.488
So let me now go back to the origin

00:03:31.488 --> 00:03:34.411
where we had our original expression.

00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:37.947
So, there we have it, and
maybe I can zoom in this way.

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:39.533
So there you have it.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.416
Limit of any of these,
as x approaches infinity,

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.916
is equal to three.
