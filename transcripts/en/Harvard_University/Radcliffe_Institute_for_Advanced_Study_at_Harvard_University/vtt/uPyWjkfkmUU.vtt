00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.900
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.770
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.130
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.520
and it is a pleasure to
welcome you to today's lecture

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.340
by Professor Michael Kazin.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.840
Here at Radcliffe we are
dedicated to promoting

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.780
new research and inquiry, and
we bring leading scholars,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.710
scientists, artists,
and public intellectuals

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.100
from all of Harvard's schools,
and from around the world,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.110
to share their work
with each other

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.340
and with broad interested
public like you.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.880
Today's talk is part of
our Davis Lecture Series,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.100
established by Kim
and Judy Davis,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.770
to bring prominent
thinkers in all fields

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.570
here to Radcliffe
for public talks.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.530
I am so glad to see Kim and
Judy here with us today.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.400
And I'm grateful to them
for their generous support

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
of the Institute.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.310
Now, today our speaker is
Professor Michael Kazin, who

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.880
will enlighten us on the
very important topic of,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.550
does the left have a future?

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.360
Mike is uniquely qualified
to tackle this question,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
because he is a rare historian
who is just as engaged

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.290
in contemporary politics, as he
is in the politics of the past.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
Almost exactly one
year ago today,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.820
the presidential
election of 2016

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.840
caused many Americans, on
both the left and the right,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.650
to question their assumptions
about American politics.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.470
Even before election
day, the campaign

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.590
revealed deep
divisions, not only

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.710
between blue and red
voters, but within

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.910
the Democratic and Republican
parties themselves.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.070
There are many examples
that illustrate

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.020
these intraparty divides.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.310
But I will remind you of just
one telling anecdote related

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.560
to the Democratic Party.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.740
Only hours before the
Democratic National Convention

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.070
opened last summer,
Senator Bernie Sanders

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.410
spoke to a crowd
of his supporters,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.890
calling on them to support the
party's presumptive nominee

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.710
for president, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.070
Sanders's words were met
with such loud booing

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.320
that he was forced
to stop speaking,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.530
and then adamantly
insist and I quote him,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.460
"This is the real world
that we live in," end quote.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.570
That particular moment spoke
to a dilemma and a divide

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.300
that would continue to
plague the Democrats

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.270
throughout the fall's
presidential campaign,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.150
and that persists as
the party prepares

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.350
for the next presidential
contest in 2020.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.150
Under a Trump
administration, it's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.320
clear what the left
is advocating against.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.280
But what, if anything,
unites a disparate opposition

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.950
that spans from
moderate liberals

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.080
to farther left
and populist wings.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.690
How wide a tent can left-leaning
challengers gather under?

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.150
What should they advocate for?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.970
And what should
their next steps be?

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.090
These questions are likely
what brought so many of you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.290
here today.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.400
And you may feel that you and
other like minded Americans

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.740
are facing an
historic crisis that

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.800
calls for brand new answers.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.790
Or maybe you like the
direction the country is going,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180
and you are here to learn how
to ensure that the left does not

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.820
have a future.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.720
Either way, I imagine that we
will learn from Mike today that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.320
it is far from the first
time that the left--

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.090
or the right for that matter--

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.980
has fragmented, grappled with
challenging internal divisions,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.740
and had its future
survival questioned.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.950
Let me just offer two
historical precedents.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.940
In 1948, Henry Wallace and
his Progressive Party split

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.510
with the Democrats, led by
then President Harry S. Truman,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.020
and advocated for national
health insurance and expansion

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.810
of the social safety
net, as well as greater

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.680
racial desegregation and a more
conciliatory foreign policy,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.690
among other issues.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.440
In that same election, then
South Carolina Governor Strom

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.520
Thurmond, and his
segregationist Dixiecrats,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.590
challenged Truman and Republican
candidate Thomas F. Dewey

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.370
from the right.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.260
Two decades later, in 1968,
profound divisions again

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.600
emerge within the
Democratic Party

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.880
when President Lyndon
Baines Johnson, and later

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.190
his vice president
Hubert Humphrey,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.400
were challenged on the left,
first by Minnesota Senator

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.150
Eugene McCarthy, and then also
by New York Senator Robert

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.290
Kennedy.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.210
And interestingly in
that same election,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.540
George Wallace, a former
Democratic governor

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.840
from Alabama, mobilized
significant support

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.290
from southern and blue
collar Northern Democrats

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.920
for his third party
candidacy for president.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.260
With eerie echoes of today,
Time Magazine in October 1968,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.570
described Wallace's
supporters as, and I quote,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.410
"a coalition of
frustration, " end quote,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.140
who refuse to believe what
they read in the newspapers

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.370
and magazines.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.970
Wallace himself actively
stirred up racial animus,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.940
and frequently railed against
government bureaucrats,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.970
intellectuals, and the press.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.660
I hope I have made my point
that historical perspective can

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.720
be helpful in understanding
the complexities

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.210
of our current political moment.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.290
I say this, not in
support of the old cliche

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.170
that history repeats
itself, but because history

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.940
can suggest new questions and
encourage rigorous analysis.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.670
With that goal in mind,
I am delighted to welcome

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.090
Michael Kazin to the
Radcliffe Institute today.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.764
Mike is a leading historian
of the American left.

00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:00.680
He is a professor in the
Department of History

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.960
at Georgetown
University, as well as

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.570
the editor of Dissent,
a magazine that

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.240
has been influencing
American political thought

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.660
since its first issue in 1954.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.740
Under Mike's leadership, Dissent
has aggressively reached out

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.400
to new audiences,
particularly younger ones,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.620
and it is now
addressing a wide range

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.260
of issues relevant to them.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.690
Dissent magazine under
Mike's leadership

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.150
may, in fact, have
some important lessons

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.300
to teach the American left
as it seeks to redefine

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.540
itself and secure a future.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.410
Mike is renowned for his
extensive research and writing.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.830
One theme that ties his
wide-ranging body of work

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.280
together, is attention
to uncovering

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.300
the coherent ideology of
both the left and the right,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.170
powerfully reminding
us that ideas, not just

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.520
interests, matter in American
politics and political history.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.850
Mike is the author or
editor of 10 books.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.970
He's especially well-known
for The Populous Persuasion,

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.840
An American History, as
well as America Divided,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.990
The Civil War of the
1960s, which he coauthored

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.730
with Maurice Isserman.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.760
Mike's most recent book
entitled War Against War,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.930
The American Fight for
Peace, 1914 - 1918,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.680
examines the often forgotten
resistance to the United States

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.670
entering World War I. And he
is now at work on a new book

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.890
entitled, Making Democrats, From
Andrew Jackson to Barack Obama

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.430
and Beyond.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.880
So here's how this
afternoon will work.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.010
Mike will deliver his
lecture, and there

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.940
will be time for brief Q&amp;A.
We will put a microphone

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.050
in the center aisle.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.200
And if you would like to ask
a question, please come up,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.800
identify yourself, and
then ask your question.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.930
After the final
question, I invite

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.530
you to join us for a reception
next door in the Sheerr Room

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.840
on the first floor of Fay House.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.810
Now, please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Michael Kazin.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.160
- Thanks very much Liz, and
thanks everybody for coming.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.730
I hope to be true to that
wonderful introduction

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.170
and provoke you politically,
as well as historically.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.059
And thanks also, both
to Liz, and to everyone

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.120
at the Institute, who's been
wonderful in organizing this.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.039
This is one of the
best run institutions

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.794
I've ever been associated with,
even in a temporary fashion.

00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:46.210
It's also a great honor to be
here because, as some of you

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.210
know, this is Liz's
last year as dean.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.070
So this is one of the
last Dean's Lectures

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.010
that she'll be presiding over.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.440
And thanks to Liz and
her staff, the Institute

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.260
plays a really significant
role in the intellectual life

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.030
of the Boston area and, I
think, of the nation as well.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.814
Your library is a
first class library.

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:06.730
The fellowship program
is a wonderful program.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.188
And, of course, they sponsor
all kinds of events like this.

00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:12.700
And thanks to Kim and Judy
Davis for helping to support

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.910
the Institute so well.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.786
Does the left have a future?

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.410
Well, before answering
I better perform

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.910
that quintessential academic
move and define my terms.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.270
As US politics moved rightward
over the past four years,

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.690
the term left has
become so capacious

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.680
that threatens to
lose all meaning.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.150
For most conservatives-- and
I think most journalists--

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.090
the left spans everybody from
a moderate Democrat like, say,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.180
Senator Claire
McCaskill of Missouri,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.240
and media outlets like MSNBC,
and the New York Times,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.110
and The Washington Post, to
the black-hooded anarchists

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.620
of Antifa, and the
revolutionary Communist Party--

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.360
a tiny group which still
reveres the thought of Joseph

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.060
Stalin and Mao Zedong.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.030
My definition is a more narrow,
and I think more traditional,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.530
one.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.700
The left comprises
those people and groups

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.770
which advocate-- or have
been strongly influenced

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.280
by-- some form of what
for almost 200 years

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.120
has been called socialism.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.550
Now, socialism is a very
capacious term as well.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.480
There's democratic socialism,
social democratic socialism,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.940
liberal socialism, and
totalitarian socialism.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.420
As often true in his
work, George Orwell

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.080
put the aim of all socialists
of all these varieties

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.780
most succinctly and elegantly.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.535
Here's a very dapper
picture of George--

00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:43.410
very different than most
of the ones you see.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.370
I just chose one that made
him look like a somewhat

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.580
upper class Englishman.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.210
In Homage to Catalonia, that
great book about the Spanish

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.814
Civil War and his
participation in it,

00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:58.980
Orwell reflected, quote,
"What attracts ordinary men

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.990
to socialism, and makes
them willing to risk

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.860
their skins for it, is
the idea of equality."

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.900
Now, of course, there
have been exponents

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.480
of a thoroughgoing equality
who did not identify themselves

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.710
as socialists.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.040
Radical feminists, for
example, anarchists,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.820
some black nationalists,
some left liberals as well.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.620
But when they made--
and make-- a critique

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.310
of unequal conditions
and cultural prejudices,

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.100
and they touched on matters
of political economy,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.100
they sounded quite similar
to what socialists have long

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.270
said about that subject.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.310
So socialism has a drawing
power I think, analytically,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.820
that helps to define
what it means to be left.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.240
Now, few people in or
outside the left today,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.430
especially since
the Great Recession,

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.330
would argue that the cause of
either socialism or equality

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.160
are thriving.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.800
In Europe, for example,
the share of the vote

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.440
won by socialist and
social democratic parties--

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.600
which once governed such
nations as France, Germany,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.920
the Netherlands, and Austria,
alone or in coalition--

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.720
has declined.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.620
And quite precipitously,
as you see,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.887
this graph shows you the
beginning of roughly--

00:12:10.887 --> 00:12:12.470
a little bit after
the great recession

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.089
you see-- whoop,
all the way down.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:17.130
If your stocks looked like
that you'd sell them--

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:24.070
or wish you would
have sold them earlier

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.440
In Scandinavia, whose generous
and culturally tolerant

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.300
welfare states once seemed as
durable as the Arctic ice cap,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.970
a coalition of the left
governs only in Sweden today.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.430
And the Social Democrats
there hold fewer than a third

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.490
of the seats in parliament--

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.470
their lowest percentage
in almost a century.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.730
There are new left
parties emerging

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.050
in some of these nations--

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.190
Podemos in Spain, Jean-Luc
Melenchon's party in France,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.514
the left party in Germany.

00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:54.430
But none of these parties
are close to gaining

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.740
a plurality of votes
in a national election.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.520
In Latin America, nearly
everywhere the vaunted Pink

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.760
Tide that was brought
ashore a decade ago--

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.870
and somewhat earlier by figures
like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.780
Rafael Correa in Ecuador--

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.280
has ebbed away.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.800
It was plagued by
grandiose promises,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.350
ineffective administration,
and low prices

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.080
for the commodities on which
the nations like Venezuela

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.720
and Ecuador continue to rely.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.345
In Brazil, the largest
most important nation

00:13:25.345 --> 00:13:28.360
in Latin America, former
president Lula da Silva--

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.960
the founder of that nation's
once dominant worker's party--

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.030
is leading in polls for
the presidential election

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.220
to be held next year.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.300
But if his conviction for
graft is upheld on appeal,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.480
Lula would likely be
barred from running at all.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.750
In neither Africa,
nor the Middle East,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.090
is there more than a trace
of the third world socialism

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.860
that radicals in
the first world,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.000
like me, once hailed as
the hope of the future.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.730
Where educated young people,
frustrated by a lack of jobs

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.650
and a voice in
their governments,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.410
once looked at socialist
texts for political guidance

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:04.940
and inspiration, many now turn
to a rigorous form of Islam

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.640
that befits what
Pankaj Mishra has aptly

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.030
called the age of anger.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.550
Now after listening to this
dismal survey, some of you

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.035
may be thinking, he's left
out his own nation, as well as

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:18.410
the country from
which the United

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.344
States won its independence.

00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.260
What about these guys?

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:25.120
What about that
surprising vote total

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.060
won by Jeremy Corbyn
and his labor party

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.352
in the past election
in Great Britain?

00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:31.810
What about the
growth of membership

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.610
in the labor party since
he took over its helm

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.640
a couple years ago?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.610
What about the surge of support
for Bernie Sanders last year

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.280
in his campaign, and
the remarkable appeal

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.510
he has to young people
across racial lines.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.750
One poll taken this September
found again, remarkably,

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.700
that Bernie Sanders's
popularity rating--

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.995
approval rating I should say--

00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:53.495
was 75%.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.540
The most prominent democratic
socialists in US history--

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.540
Eugene Debs, Norman
Thomas, all of whom

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.760
ran for president
multiple times--

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.480
never enjoyed anything close
to that level of popularity.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.610
Of course, neither
Thomas, nor Debs,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.144
ever ran for president
as a Democrat.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:14.560
But it's also true that the
largest socialist organization

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.460
in the country--

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.470
Democratic Socialists
of America--

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.200
has gained over 20,000
members since Sanders

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.930
began his presidential
campaign two years ago.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.450
They have about
30,000 members now.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.600
So isn't socialism
undergoing a major revival

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.660
that might give a new meaning
to the special relationship

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.540
between two
English-speaking nations?

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.640
Perhaps this
resurgence will endure.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.620
I hope so.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.290
But before we say that
it certainly will,

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.350
we should recall the
axiom by Antonio Gramsci,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.440
the great Marxist theorist
and Italian communist--

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.100
pessimism of the intelligence,
optimism of the will.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.830
In both English-speaking
countries,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.430
the prospects for the
left remain, for now,

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.260
on an aspirational plane.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.850
Yes, Corbyn and
Sanders are currently

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.740
more popular than the
conservatives who run

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.930
governments in their countries.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.300
But it's not yet clear that
the movements they lead

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.520
would retain their strength,
or grow large enough

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.860
to win a national
election, if either leader

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.660
passed from the scene.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.810
And a left dependant on a
standard-bearer in the '70s,

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.670
is a fragile left indeed.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.799
Corbyn is the unchallenged
leader of his party right now.

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:24.340
He will undoubtedly remain so
until the next general election

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.700
of Britain.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.790
But Sanders will face a number
of competitors for the 2020

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.030
democratic nomination, who
will seek in different ways

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.860
to dilute his strong
social democratic brew.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.140
They know the meld of pro-growth
centrism and social liberalism

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.280
that Barack Obama rode into
power twice, still appeals

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.080
to a majority of
Democrat voters--

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.180
and probably a majority
American voters.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.720
And it's probably more palatable
to the electorate at large,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.345
than the embrace of socialism.

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.470
Even though when Bernie
Sanders defined socialism--

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.100
which he did at a long speech
at my university at Georgetown

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.660
last year--

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.820
he said, what does
socialism mean?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.656
It means what Franklin
D. Roosevelt supported.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:05.280
It means what Lyndon
Johnson supported.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.990
It means what Martin
Luther King, Jr. supported.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:12.500
He didn't reference Karl Marx,
Leon Trotsky, Fidel Castro,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.230
or even Jeremy Corbyn.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.568
So why has the left declined
in the 21st century?

00:17:19.568 --> 00:17:20.859
The main causes are well-known.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.736
And there are many
wonderful teachers

00:17:22.736 --> 00:17:24.319
of history and
political science here,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.680
who could give much better
lectures about this topic

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.562
than I can.

00:17:28.562 --> 00:17:30.020
Governments and
parties of the left

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.930
got blamed for initiating,
or cooperating in,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.090
policies of austerity,
that made it

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.820
difficult for ordinary citizens
in their countries to rebound

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.820
from economic hardship.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.440
Fear of immigrants
and refugees courses

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.940
through the native-born
working class populations,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.852
both in Europe and
the United States.

00:17:47.852 --> 00:17:49.310
The left on both
sides of the ocean

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.140
also unwittingly took
on the image of what

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.010
the French call,
la gauche caviar--

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.950
a tendency shaped and dominated
by self-confident cosmopolitan

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.410
men and women with degrees
from elite universities

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.220
like this one.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.380
They appeared more
passionate about the rights

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.140
of racial, religious,
and sexual minorities,

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.120
than about protecting
the jobs, and increasing

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.410
the wages of their
traditional constituency--

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.180
the working class.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.567
It's not a good thing, I
think, that there are probably

00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:17.150
more left-wing
activists in Cambridge,

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.774
than there are in
all of West Virginia.

00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:23.580
A stark reminder of this divide
occurred in the recent election

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.607
in Germany.

00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:27.440
It was in the poorest
parts of the country--

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.120
old industrial areas with
the fewest immigrants,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.730
mostly in the former east--

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.740
where the far right alternative
for Germany did best.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.370
The parallel with the
white working-class voters

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.650
in the so-called rust
belt, who provided

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.890
Donald Trump's
margin of victory,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.360
is both obvious and painful.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.460
So is the decline of the
big industrial unions,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.650
like the one this
guy used to run--

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.320
John L. Lewis-- he didn't
usually dress like that,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.200
but he was down in the mines--

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.209
which had social
democratic agendas.

00:18:58.209 --> 00:18:59.750
The United Mine
Workers, for example,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.475
had a health care plan which
covered all members for free.

00:19:04.475 --> 00:19:06.850
These unions-- which once
represented millions of working

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.530
people of all races--

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.200
when the reigning metallic
tropes in the Midwest

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.230
referred to steel, chrome,
iron ore, and coal--

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.230
and not rust-- have
declined so precipitously,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.630
that they basically
have no real influence

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.760
in American politics anymore.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.170
One anecdote about this.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.320
1988 election-- Michael
Dukakis, former governor

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.300
of this great state
of Massachusetts,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:35.780
won West Virginia by
five percentage points.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.930
Michael Dukakis-- for all his
virtues, not the kind of person

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:44.390
you'd think of as a working
class hero kind of figure.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.080
Donald Trump won West Virginia
this year by 42% of the vote.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.500
And Dukakis and Trump both
won their largest margins

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.759
in the southern part
of West Virginia, which

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.550
were then coal counties,
and now are mostly

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.050
former coal counties.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.880
Now despite the
rhetoric of Donald Trump

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.550
and his protectionist
allies in both parties,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.600
the number of industrial
workers is not going to go up.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.755
It's only going to go down with
robotization and other forces.

00:20:11.755 --> 00:20:14.650
Still, at a time when the
left and the institutions it

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.560
took so much to build during
the middle of the 20th century--

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.200
what historians call
the New Deal Order--

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.820
has clearly failed
to advance a vision

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.599
for native-born
working class people,

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.890
it's not surprising, I think,
that many of those people

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.690
have shifted their
allegiances to more

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.750
defensive-- even reactionary--
causes and institutions.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.540
So is the left doomed
to continue along

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.450
a long downward path to
marginality-- if not oblivion?

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.870
Does it have a future
worthy of living up

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.550
to the positive
meaning of that term?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.890
I won't keep you in
suspense any longer.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.090
Does the left have a future?

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.280
My answer is yes, but--

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.050
you probably expected that--

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.610
each has equal weight.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.130
Neither word should
stand by itself.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.640
Yes, the left has a
future, because its ideas

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.280
have a strong appeal in a
world in which capitalism,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.080
as an economic
and social system,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.150
has failed to deliver on
its promise of a fairer,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.360
more secure existence for
the majority of the world's

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.740
population who, by any
rational definition,

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.210
remain working people.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.280
In fact, since the
Great Recession

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.210
even though left parties--

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.280
especially in
Europe-- have declined

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.540
in their percentage of the vote,
left ideas about the economy

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.570
have gained popularity, even
as the organizational left

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.015
has declined.

00:21:29.015 --> 00:21:30.390
Notice in this
country how little

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.330
support there is-- outside
the conservative movement--

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.700
for cutting taxes on
the rich, or opposing

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.560
a raise in the minimum
wage, or leaving

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.650
sick, uninsured
Americans to their fate.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.415
So yes, the left has a future.

00:21:42.415 --> 00:21:44.460
It's dream of equality
of conditions,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.720
of a decent quality
of life for everyone--

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.160
regardless of their birth or
race or region or gender--

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.100
continues to inspire millions of
political activists, especially

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.660
young ones, who can--

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.720
and will-- preach
that secular gospel

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.510
to anyone willing to hear it.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.850
In the middle of the last
century, Karl Polanyi,

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.814
the Hungarian leftist
intellectual--

00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:05.480
who some of you have
heard of and read--

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.380
he put forth a
vision that, I think,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.660
in many ways still
animates the left--

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.705
and should animate
more of the left.

00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:22.010
Karl Polanyi called for what
he called a decommodification

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.880
of goods and services that every
person needs, and regardless

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.780
of income, should be considered
their natural right to have--

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.969
health care, housing,
education, basic transportation.

00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:34.510
They should also
have the opportunity

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.080
to work at a job
that will assure

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.050
a decent standard of living.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.027
After World War II,
the most advanced

00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:42.360
social democratic governments
did a good deal to fulfill

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.670
that agenda for their people.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.770
They aimed, as
Polanyi put it, quote,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.110
"to transcend the
self-regulating market

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.680
by consciously subordinating
it to a democratic society--

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.990
to make society a distinctively
human relationship of persons."

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.699
Despite electoral woes
of left-wing parties,

00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:02.490
most citizens in Europe,
the United States,

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.010
and elsewhere demonstrate
in opinion polls--

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.830
and in their opposition to
deregulating corporations

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.270
and starving the welfare state--

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.000
a persistent warmth
about the particulars

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.640
of Polanyi's vision, even if
they've never heard of Polanyi.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.230
As long as that
remains the case,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.330
the left will have
an essential role

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.670
to play and a vital
argument to make.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.380
The only decent
society is one that

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.380
practices equality,
protects free expression,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.790
and forces a sense of
solidarity among its members.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.910
However, the but-- just
as important as the yes.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.310
The fate of a left
that not just endures,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.560
but grows through
the next few decades

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.320
depends, in part, on
what direction it takes.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.660
Of course, it depends a lot
on what happens in the world.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.177
All the feasible options have as
many pitfalls as possibilities.

00:23:51.177 --> 00:23:53.135
Now what I want to do in
this part of the talk,

00:23:53.135 --> 00:23:57.950
is to lay out three main paths
I think the left might follow--

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.710
all of which have their
contemporary defenders

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.850
in this room, perhaps.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.550
I'll confine myself to the
left in the United States,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.280
whose history and
current politics

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.802
are no better than
those of other nations.

00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.310
But what I say, I think, has
implications for other lefts

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.890
as well, including some of the
ones I outlined very quickly

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.230
at the beginning of the talk.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.337
After all we live,
perhaps, in a time that--

00:24:20.337 --> 00:24:21.670
more than any time in the past--

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.530
is a period when no
powerful ideology

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.230
stays within national
boundaries for long.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.080
There was no Fifth
International,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.100
nor may there ever be one.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.670
Still, both economic realities
and electronic communication

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.200
make it possible
to build the left--

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.540
or right for that matter--

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.700
that either wants, or is
able to develop separately,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.770
from his counterparts
in other nations

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.060
I'll discuss only the
options for a left that

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.400
would be rigorous in
its defense of democracy

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.030
and civil liberties.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.426
There are the left in
the world, certainly--

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:55.800
and there have
been in the past--

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.430
often ones that controlled
large countries, even empires,

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.830
like the Soviet Union.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.680
But if an undemocratic left--

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.830
a revived Leninist
one or worse--

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.360
has a bright future, it's not a
future I want to be a part of,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.730
and I would oppose it with all
the strength my fingers could

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:12.720
muster on the keyboard.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.900
The first option is a left
that self-consciously pursues

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.320
a course that has often--
in the United States--

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.880
brought on a measure
of success in the past.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.200
A perpetual gadfly--
a movement that

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.842
is as much a cultural
force as a political one.

00:25:32.842 --> 00:25:34.800
I wrote about this aspect
of the left's history

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.330
in a book several
years ago called,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.080
American Dreamers, How
the Left Changed a Nation.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.870
This left included
various figures.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.180
Here are some of them--

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.480
and a book by one of them.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.820
Radical abolitionists
like Frederick Douglass,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.210
utopian socialists like Edward
Bellamy, the feminist radicals

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.660
Margaret Sanger and Emma
Goldman, pro-communist artists

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.440
like Paul Robeson
and Woody Guthrie,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.644
cartoonists like Dr. Seuss,
and my favorite book by him.

00:26:06.644 --> 00:26:08.810
Today's most prominent
figure in this cultural left,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.040
perhaps, is Ta-Nehisi
Coates, in many ways.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.540
Whenever he writes
an essay, it gets

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.200
discussed by hundreds
of thousands of people--

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.990
if not millions.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.490
The left they were
part of certainly

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.974
wanted to create a more
egalitarian society.

00:26:26.974 --> 00:26:29.140
And with the partial exception
of the abolitionists,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.010
all of them were open
to socialist ideas.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.600
But they all did far
better at helping

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.580
transform the nation's moral
culture, what Gramsci called

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.980
the common sense society--

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.140
how Americans
understand what is just

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.900
and what is unjust, in
the conduct of daily life

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.960
and public affairs.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.330
That's no small
thing, by the way.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.300
Leftists who articulated these
visions of a better future did

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.100
much to initiate
what became common--

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.947
if still controversial--
features of our national life,

00:26:59.947 --> 00:27:01.780
including the advocacy
of equal opportunity,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.860
equal treatment for women,
ethnic and racial minorities

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.940
and homosexuals, the acceptance
of sexual pleasure unconnected

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.300
to reproduction, a media and
educational system sensitive

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.170
to racial and
gender oppression--

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.070
and which celebrates what we
now call multiculturalism--

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.220
and the popularity of novels and
films and songs with a strongly

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.070
altruistic anti-authoritarian
point of view--

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.980
Woody Guthrie.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.500
But to define one's ambitions
to achieving such change is

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.610
the texture of daily life, is
also an unintentional admission

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.280
that one probably cannot
achieve the transformation

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.560
of egalitarian social
and economic policies.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.590
And not to achieve such
policies can make the other more

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.260
cultural gains seem
hollow, and not

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.314
really reach a majority
of Americans in the way

00:27:47.314 --> 00:27:48.230
they live their lives.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.335
Consider, for example,
a contemporary example.

00:27:56.335 --> 00:27:58.460
The current presence of
two of the largest and most

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.680
progressive unions
in the nation--

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.310
Service Employees Union--

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.530
Mary Henry, and the American
Federation of Teachers--

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.060
Randi Weingarten.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.910
Both women are proud lesbians.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:10.750
They talk about it.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.500
They're not ashamed of it.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.440
They were elected despite it--
or because of it-- but mostly

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.660
despite it, for some of
their members certainly.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.660
These are some of the
largest and most important

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.350
unions in America today.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.940
However, the Supreme Court
could soon hand down a ruling

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.890
in the case of Janus
versus AFSCME, that

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.920
would make it far difficult
for these leaders,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.710
and any other official of
a public employees union

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.471
to retain, much less
expand, their memberships--

00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:37.970
to have the political
influence that

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.740
comes with having numbers
and power at the workplace.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.600
So there's one of victory,
but equality, one could argue,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.560
is farther away than ever.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.390
Put bluntly, what good
is it for, let's say,

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.080
a transgender person to win
the right to use the bathroom

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.140
of their choice, if they cannot
also get a job that ensures

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.870
them a living wage, and know
the government will assure them

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.130
affordable and
reliable health care,

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.340
whether or not they have a job.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.410
So the second
option for the left

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.590
has a self-evident response
to that rhetorical question.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.450
A good society would provide
those benefits to everyone,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.380
while continuing to
advance the gains

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.180
made by those whose
politics are shaped

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.360
more by identity than class.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.220
This alternative would
be an aggressive form

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.640
of social democracy, not the
watered-down, business-friendly

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.970
version put forth by the likes
of Francois Hollande in France,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.210
or Tony Blair in
Britain, or even

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.410
Barack Obama, whose
liberalism was

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.135
quite similar to
the policies put

00:29:37.135 --> 00:29:39.010
forth by those figures
and their counterparts

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.990
elsewhere in Europe.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.490
It would be a social
democracy whose

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.430
exponents embraced
Polanyi's vision

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.830
and worked hard
to implement it--

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.310
a vision of lasting economic
security, the fulfillment

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.760
of Franklin D. Roosevelt's great
speech about the four freedoms,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.040
and of Lyndon Johnson's hope
for a Great Society that

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.330
would actually abolish poverty.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.950
This kind of left
would not propose

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.410
to do away with the private
ownership of existing

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.020
businesses, or the
opportunity for entrepreneurs

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.670
to start new ones.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.820
Labor unions would
be protected by law.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.550
They would even have some say
in how their businesses are run.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.490
But workers would not own their
businesses, their factories,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.960
or their offices.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.110
To quote John Judis, a friend of
mine and a very fine left-wing

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.920
journalist, "Within these
parameters families don't have

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.080
to fear going hungry,
losing their home,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.660
losing health insurance, and
being unable to send their kids

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.810
to decent schools, just because
someone's job is automated,

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.810
or the company made
bad investments--

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:43.535
decommodification of all
those necessities of life.

00:30:43.535 --> 00:30:45.910
This would be a society a lot
like those in Scandinavia--

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.701
at least before the
fear of new immigrants,

00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:48.760
many of them Muslim--

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.980
gave rise to right-wing
parties in those countries

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.180
that bar non-citizens who
don't share Nordic roots

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.070
from enjoying the generosity of
the welfare state-- or at least

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:01.090
try to bar those non-citizens.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.880
This kind of true social
democracy may sound plausible.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.000
The market survives, but
it's highly regulated.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.980
Taxation is truly progressive--

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.650
no loopholes for rich people
who can hire clever accountants

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.600
and lawyers.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.390
And it's the option for the
left that Bernie Sanders

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.610
has promoted pretty
much explicitly.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.190
And then his popularity--
if it continues to grow--

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.750
may compel other liberal
Democrats to embrace as well.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.310
It's an expression of
what Michael Harrington,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.974
one of the founding
leaders of DSA--

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:34.390
Democratic Socialists
of America--

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.730
who wrote a lot for
my magazine, Dissent,

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.221
called the left-wing of the
possible-- a wonderful phrase.

00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:42.970
But this robust strain
of social democracy

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.180
also has its weaknesses.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.172
Yes, but--

00:31:47.172 --> 00:31:49.380
When the heights of the
economy are in private hands,

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.450
politicians-- even
those on the left--

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.120
have to be careful about
regulating or taxing businesses

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.110
too stringently, lest
those businesses cut back

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.470
on hiring, and investing,
and move their production

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.450
to other countries--

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.350
which, of course, with
cyber production is possible

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.260
much more easily than
it ever was before.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.930
So social democracy in
one country, or even

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.040
several countries, could run
into the same basic problem

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.160
as did socialism in one country
that Joseph Stalin tried

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.770
to implement with
his tyrannical--

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.360
almost genocidal-- rule.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.160
Even when the USSR had close
allies or satellites in China,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.190
North Korea, Eastern
Europe, Mongolia,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.330
it could not sustain a
separate state socialist order

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.160
to satisfy the demands
of its citizens.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.420
And welfare states face
an analogous problem,

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.900
I think, in a world
where every nation is now

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.480
part of a global
capitalist market,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.620
and most its key industries are
part of a global supply chain.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.750
The solution to this
dilemma, one could argue,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.140
is the third and final option I
want to outline for you today.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.570
Not social democracy, but
true democratic socialism.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.760
This was the option
that Marx and Engels

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.700
called for and predicted
would come to pass

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.670
with scientific accuracy.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:13.423
It's what Eugene Debs and his
fellow leaders of the Socialist

00:33:13.423 --> 00:33:16.610
Party of America
wanted a century ago,

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.790
when that party was at its
historical zenith of influence

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.040
and size.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.990
Leftists who advocate
this kind of future

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.742
argue much as those
earlier leftists did.

00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:27.200
We've seen a revival,
in some ways,

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.290
of what historians would call
second international socialism.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.265
That is the time when--

00:33:31.265 --> 00:33:32.640
before the Bolshevik
Revolution--

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.890
when there are all these
democratic socialists parties

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.450
in the world, many of
them doing quite well.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.270
Two leaders of DSA, Joseph
Schwartz and Bhaskar Sunkara,

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.060
who's the editor of the journal
Jacobin, a fellow journal

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.830
on the left--

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.110
higher circulation than mine--

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.050
recently wrote this
way about this dream

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.870
of democratic socialism, "We
can't have real democracy

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.330
without economic democracy.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.170
Corporations are
private governments

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.790
that exercise tyrannical power
over workers and society."

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.070
"To embrace socialist
democracy," they write,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.050
"is to believe that
any decision that

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.540
has a binding effect
on its members

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.449
should be made by all
those affected by it."

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.699
That means in a democratic
socialist economy,

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.770
workers would hire
their managers,

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.310
and those managers would be
only responsible for building

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.679
a content and egalitarian
and productive firm.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.035
This is in some ways
an attractive vision.

00:34:26.035 --> 00:34:27.409
It would establish
a social order

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.530
organized in practical ways
to serve the common good.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.210
Common good-- that
term would not

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.150
be just a throwaway line in this
kind of society in a campaign

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.699
speech.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:42.020
But the obstacles to
achieving democratic socialism

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.639
are quite formidable--

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.159
perhaps even more
formidable than to achieving

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.679
social democracy.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.670
First of all, one has
to ask a question.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.270
Who supports this
kind of left today?

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.659
What intuitions exist to
promote it and to fight for it?

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.880
How would it encourage
the kind of innovation

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.544
that has resulted
under capitalism,

00:35:00.544 --> 00:35:02.210
in a gradually rising
standard of living

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.830
for most people
in the world, even

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:09.710
as the gap between the majority
and the small elite at the top

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.590
has grown wider.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.548
But nevertheless, the
standard of living itself

00:35:12.548 --> 00:35:14.570
has increased--
fewer people dying

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.939
of hunger, fewer people dying
of preventable diseases,

00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:17.480
and so forth.

00:35:20.258 --> 00:35:26.870
Now, if leftists had convincing
answers to those questions,

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.270
we would probably know them.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.550
But Schwartz and
Sunkara in their essay--

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.370
which is quite
stirring in many ways--

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.370
devote just one sentence to how
such a future might come about,

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:41.000
and this is what they say, "We
would need a militant labor

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.400
movement and a mass socialist
presence strengthened

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.440
by accumulated
victories, looking to

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.920
not merely tame but overcome
capitalism," end quote.

00:35:50.295 --> 00:35:51.670
I can't think of
a single country

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.940
in the world which has a left
that fits that description.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.640
So in today's United
States, perhaps

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.400
sadly, it's thus akin to
the lyrics of John Lennon's,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.990
Imagine, but without one
of the most popular artists

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.532
in the world around
to sing its virtues.

00:36:05.532 --> 00:36:07.240
So at least for now,
democratic socialism

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.904
resembles the left
wing of the impossible.

00:36:10.904 --> 00:36:12.320
Whichever option
the American left

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.000
pursues, it will
have to find a way

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.940
to solve several
difficult dilemmas it

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.850
wrestles with today.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.574
And don't worry, at the end--

00:36:18.574 --> 00:36:19.490
which I'm getting to--

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.981
I'll talk about options,
possibilities, some hopeful

00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:23.480
things.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.430
Let me mention three of the
most important dilemmas,

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.570
each widely debated
on left today.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.782
First and foremost, race.

00:36:33.782 --> 00:36:36.240
As we know all too well, racial
inequality and conflict are

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.710
now-- and have always been--

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.600
central facts of US history.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.280
Recall that at least
10% of American men,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.100
north and south, were
casualties of the Civil War--

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.550
which President Drew Faust
has written eloquently about.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.860
That war, its legacy,
the battle over slavery--

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.660
that cause and continue to whirl
our politics and our culture,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.760
as the current debate
over Confederate monuments

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.430
and the memory of Robert
E Lee certainly attest.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:06.260
Now since the 1920s, the left
has often played a really

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.660
vanguard role-- to use
an old left phrase--

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.840
in combating racism
and racial inequality.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.682
One of the best things the
Communist Party ever did--

00:37:14.682 --> 00:37:16.140
Henry Wallace's
campaign, which Liz

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.280
mentioned in her introduction--

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.904
Henry Wallace refused
to speak in front

00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:21.020
of segregated audiences
even in the South, which

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.186
meant he didn't get to speak
very much in the South.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.240
But if you make a priority of
fighting racial inequality,

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.860
it poses an obvious problem--

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.959
how to unite Americans
of different races,

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:37.000
if you're busy defending
the rights and interests

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.190
of a minority of Americans.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.950
Now, in most European nations
with relatively homogeneous

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.100
populations, the left
was able to appeal

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.670
effectively to class identities
and resentments alone.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.190
At least, they were until
the expansion of immigration

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:56.020
from Africa and the Middle East
made that much more difficult.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.060
But the US left has
never been able to make

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.300
a credible argument that all
working class people share

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.730
the same lot and
the same grievances,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.990
because it hasn't been true.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.192
This is no less a problem today.

00:38:08.192 --> 00:38:10.400
As Bernie Sanders showed in
his presidential campaign

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.700
last year, a politics focusing
on attacking finance capitalism

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.910
and proposing universal
social programs--

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.210
Medicare for All, $15
an hour minimum wage--

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.280
can win millions of votes.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.090
But Black Lives
Matter activists--

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.970
some of whom have been on
demonstrations like this--

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.680
protested that Sanders
was saying little

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.580
about racist policing
and incarceration.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.670
Some argue that neglect
of those issues--

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.370
so important to young activists,
and African-American activists,

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.460
and those who support
them generally--

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.100
might have cost him the
support of enough black voters

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.670
to defeat Hillary Clinton
for the nomination.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.250
Whether or not that's
correct, the charge they made

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.140
underlines a larger dilemma.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.900
If leftists make fighting
racism their top priority,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.830
they may find it hard--
if not impossible--

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.550
to gain support from white
working class people, who

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.970
refuse to feel guilty about
their attitudes or behavior,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.220
but might be won over
to a broader appeal

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.350
to their economic interests.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.600
However, to take
the latter course

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.990
can be underplaying the ongoing
injuries of racial inequality

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.420
and muting those
who protest them.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.180
That's why it's a dilemma.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.500
A second dilemma for
leftists of all stripes,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.270
except the more sectarian ones--

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.610
what are you going to do
about the Democratic Party?

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.490
Liz talked a lot about
that in her introduction.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.400
Since Franklin Roosevelt
was elected in 1932,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.190
national Democrats have clearly
been a more progressive force

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.830
on nearly every issue than have
their Republican opponents.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.590
When Democrats dominated
American politics

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.350
from the 1930s to
the end of the 1960s,

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.180
they represented a
weaker equivalent

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.120
of the social democratic
parties of Western Europe.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.490
As in Europe, they could
count on the loyalty

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.620
of most working class voters
from all regions of the nation.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.410
As the head of the
Radcliffe Institute

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.290
wrote brilliantly
in her first book,

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.250
Making a New Deal, these
working class Americans--

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.650
both black and white--
made the New Deal

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.350
through a common and popular
culture and union activism,

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.567
as much as Democrats
made it for them.

00:40:10.567 --> 00:40:12.400
And over the years,
despite their criticisms

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.810
and misgivings, most leftists
have swallowed their doubts

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.670
and voted for most
Democratic candidates,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.410
in both state and
federal elections.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.660
But since the 1960s,
Democrats have not

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.210
endorsed more than a few
items on the left's agenda--

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.615
either domestic or foreign.

00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:31.240
Given the realities of American
politics in a more conservative

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.820
era, if they did so
they feared being

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.490
relegated to minority status
for a long time to come.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.080
Still, I firmly believe
that all leftists

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.870
should be Democrats--
capital D and small d.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.620
Despite needing and
getting campaign funds

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.530
from Wall Street and
executives in Silicon Valley,

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.954
the Democrat Party is
also an institution

00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:53.370
that's quite open
to participation

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.890
by individuals and groups
at nearly every level--

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.620
from county committees,
to campaign staffs,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:03.017
to elections of delegates,
to the quadratic convention.

00:41:03.017 --> 00:41:04.850
That means there are
plenty of opportunities

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.370
to nudge the party to the left.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.550
And most of the organizations
that work for liberal causes--

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.930
which include a lot of
leftists in them as well--

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.580
from the Sierra Club, to
the AFL-CIO, to the NAACP,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.630
to MALDEF--

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.550
routinely endorse
Democratic candidates,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.550
if only because the
alternative is far worse.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.950
They understand that
the lesser evil is also

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.875
the only party they have.

00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:31.000
But if one wants to advance
either social democracy

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.095
or democratic
socialism, throwing

00:41:33.095 --> 00:41:36.970
your lot in the Democrats has
obvious disadvantages as well.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.060
If you run a left-wing
primary campaign and lose,

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.940
then you face pressure to
back the winning candidate--

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.200
or incur blame if
he or she loses.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.660
And division and conflict
become inevitable,

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.260
as is still happening around
the Democratic Party today

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.432
after the 2016 election.

00:41:54.432 --> 00:41:55.890
This is particularly
a problem now,

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.750
because Democrats are out of
power in the federal government

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.110
and in most of the states.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.620
The party has come to resemble
what my friend, Todd Gitlin,

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.350
calls a massive dumbbell--

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.130
both demographically
and regionally.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.890
It's strong among
well-educated professionals

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.110
at one end of the
dumbbell-- like most

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.720
of us in this auditorium--
and among black, Latino,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.999
poor, and working class
people on the other end.

00:42:18.999 --> 00:42:21.040
And the only states that
vote reliably democratic

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.190
in presidential elections--
and most senatorial races--

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.240
are those on the East
Coast and the West Coast--

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.389
another dumbbell.

00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:31.680
When he was running for
president as a Socialist Eugene

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.560
Debs declared, I'd rather
vote for something I want

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.240
and not get it,
then for something I

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.515
don't want and get it.

00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:41.140
But a century later,
with conservatives

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.430
in command of the
Republican Party,

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.880
with the Republican Party
in charge of the government,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.550
the alternative is
not that simple.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.430
What do you do when the choice
is between a candidate who

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.044
gives you some
things you want, who

00:42:53.044 --> 00:42:55.210
is running against a candidate
opposed to everything

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.536
you cherish?

00:42:56.536 --> 00:42:58.410
In Debs's day things
were somewhat different.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:01.410
Socialists were as strong
in Oklahoma and Ohio,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.100
as they were in New
York and California.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.681
They elected
hundreds-- thousands

00:43:05.681 --> 00:43:08.180
actually-- of local officials
in every region of the country

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.759
except the deep south.

00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:12.050
But the vote for a third
party in the left today-- say,

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.960
the Green Party--

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.150
is just a way of helping
the right-wing party win.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:22.177
It's political malpractice--
a form of self-abuse.

00:43:22.177 --> 00:43:24.010
The third dilemma for
the future of the left

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.580
involves nothing less than
the future of the planet.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.414
The urgency to
curb climate change

00:43:29.414 --> 00:43:31.330
is one of the few causes
that unites everyone,

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.190
from moderate Democrats to
revolutionary Socialists.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.900
But until-- or unless--
most of the world

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.260
adopts renewable
non-carbon forms of energy,

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.790
serious solutions
to climate change

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.430
will mean limits
in economic growth.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.290
And since the left began--

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:49.145
at the beginning of Industrial
Revolution 200 years ago--

00:43:49.145 --> 00:43:50.520
it has depended
on growth to make

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.130
it possible to fight for,
and win, increases in wages,

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.950
improvements in
living conditions,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.410
and modest
redistributions of wealth.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:01.440
Depressions increased
resentment by the have-nots

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.200
against the haves, that's true.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.810
But only when the economy begins
to recover, or is booming,

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.020
are lefts able to build
mass organizations

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.840
and make positive changes in
the lives of ordinary people.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.360
Today many working people
fear that environmentalists--

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.070
most of whom lead
comfortable lives--

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.720
want to do away with
jobs that produce

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.600
or use massive supplies
of fossil fuels.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.350
This helps drive
support for Republicans

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.100
in several key states,
like West Virginia.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:31.300
Climate change march
in Washington recently.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.000
And leftists answer
to that is to play up

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.509
the promise of green
industries in the future.

00:44:39.509 --> 00:44:41.050
But they have little
to offer someone

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:44.500
working today on an oil
rig, or building a pipeline.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.750
In many cases, it happens
to be a union member.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.000
So to quote a very famous,
very undemocratic leftist

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.340
who took power in Russia
almost exactly 100 years

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.010
ago this week,
what is to be done?

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.740
Let me conclude by
mentioning three guidelines I

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.200
think essential to any viable
future democratic American

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.700
left.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.594
First of all, institutions
matter profoundly.

00:45:10.594 --> 00:45:12.760
Lefts everywhere are quite
good at mounting protests

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.460
that raise issues which
get effused to a wider

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.371
public debate.

00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:21.560
The Indignados in
Spain back in 2010

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.950
did this to help spawn the
Occupy uprising in the United

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.620
States in the fall of 2011.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.520
Both groups made
economic inequality--

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.810
the 1% versus 99%--

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.441
impossible to ignore.

00:45:32.441 --> 00:45:33.940
Black Lives Matter
has done the same

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.070
for police killings
of unarmed black men.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.100
But none of these insurgencies
has much of a visible presence

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.630
today.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.735
So leftists have to build
new institutions, or join--

00:45:44.735 --> 00:45:46.110
or urge others to
join-- the ones

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.210
already exist, whether
unions, immigrant rights

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.760
groups, older organizations
like the ACLU,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.485
local democratic parties.

00:45:53.485 --> 00:45:54.985
Unlike groups like
Indivisible, that

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:56.560
have sprung up to
oppose Donald Trump

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.690
and his Republican
enablers, these

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:01.930
have to be equipped to last
beyond the next election,

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.790
and not rely solely
on social media

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.280
to mobilize and educate people.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.600
Women and men of the left--

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.250
more I think than
their counterparts

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.960
on the right and
center, who tend

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.570
to put their faith in leaders--

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.840
looking for the next
Reagan all the time--

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.480
have to learn to
trust one another

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.240
through hours and
hours of debate

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.140
and months of common activism.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.730
You can't build
that kind of trust

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.820
with a series of
tweetstorms, or meetups,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.340
or one-shot demonstrations.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.710
Second, leftists need
liberals just as much

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.080
as liberals need leftists.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.960
In US history, the only periods
when significant rapid progress

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.630
was made towards greater
equality and expanded

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.550
democratic rights,
occurred when a growing

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:45.300
left abetted liberal politicians
and a liberal state--

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.490
not without tension and
misgivings of both sides,

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.400
of course.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.670
This is true of the Civil
War and Reconstruction,

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.870
of the Progressive era, of
the 1930s and World War II,

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.420
and the 1960s.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.430
Now the left, as we know, has
never been as large or powerful

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.640
in the United States as it has
been in most other industrial

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.164
and post-industrial countries.

00:47:05.164 --> 00:47:06.580
It's never come
close to capturing

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.780
even a share of federal power.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.960
Yet it has, at times, been
large and powerful enough

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.480
to create and lead
social movements.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.230
The shift in the policies
of the state leftward--

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.450
and one example of that is this
relationship between this man

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.861
and the President of
the United States.

00:47:23.861 --> 00:47:25.360
We have a national
holiday dedicated

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.040
to a man who called
himself, in private,

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.570
a democratic socialist--

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:29.800
not Lyndon Johnson--

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.100
Martin Luther
King, Jr. But to do

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.190
that they had to pursue an
inside/outside strategy.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.340
To build a movement
of their own, as King

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.440
and his allies of course did,
while also making alliances,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.820
however contentious, with men
and women who were able to win

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.600
state and national office.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.400
And for the foreseeable future
that's going to mean liberals.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.360
Third, empathy is mandatory.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.270
Leftists need to speak and act
like people who believe they

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.872
can convince a
majority of Americans--

00:47:59.872 --> 00:48:01.580
one hopes a large
majority of Americans--

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.490
to support their views, and
would trust them to change

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.160
the nation in ways that
will benefit them--

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.746
not just us.

00:48:08.746 --> 00:48:10.370
That requirement goes
beyond advocating

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.540
universal social
programs and canvassing

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.060
of voting for politicians who
can actually win elections.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.360
It means coming to terms with
who those people really are.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.730
As progressive journalist,
Michael Tomasky,

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.430
wrote recently in The
Daily Beast, quote,

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.530
"These people in
middle America have

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.684
very different sensibilities
than elite liberals--

00:48:29.684 --> 00:48:31.100
and he could have
added radicals--

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.260
who live on the coasts.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.620
They tend to attend church
more regularly, own more guns,

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.244
don't feel self-conscious
lowering the flag."

00:48:40.244 --> 00:48:42.160
Tomasky could have added,
as a group they also

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.040
are poor and less educated,
with fewer chances of markedly

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.820
improving their economic
well-being any time soon.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.120
Of course, racial and nativist
fears and animosities endure--

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.040
one reason why white
people in red states

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.600
vote consistently
and overwhelmingly

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.100
Republican today.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.551
Still the injuries of class--

00:48:58.551 --> 00:49:00.550
wonderful term that Richard
Sennett and Jonathan

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.440
Cobb wrote about in a book
mostly based on Boston working

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.350
class people in the old 1970s--
was the injuries of class

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.760
are more routine and fester
longer in the red states

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.340
than they do in
most blue states.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.230
A left that cannot
empathize with these people,

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.720
that persists in mocking and
dismissing their religion

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.680
and their patriotism, is a left
that will never achieve either

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.770
a social democratic, or its
democratic socialist ambitions.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.930
Neither will be able
to help liberals win

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.710
a durable electoral mandate.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:32.150
Bertolt Brecht declared,
change the world--

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.850
it needs it.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.950
But to do so we have
to persuade people

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.740
who disagree with us now,
that the change that's needed

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.860
will be good for them,
as well as good for us.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.200
For the left there is
no more vital task--

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.600
or in despicable reign
of Donald Trump--

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.840
none that is more urgent.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.340
Thank you.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.880
- Thank you.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.960
I'm Wendy Kaminer.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.640
I have a quick question.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.390
You've made a case for
pragmatism basically.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.900
Vote Democratic.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.660
Settle for some
of what you want,

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.200
instead of collaborating in
the destruction of everything

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.300
that you value.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.750
I don't see much of a thirst
for pragmatism on the left,

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.380
especially among younger voters.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.770
I certainly don't remember
much of a taste for pragmatism

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.960
when I was young, among people
who were politically active.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.570
And I'm wondering if you do?

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.251
And how do you
address that problem?

00:50:41.251 --> 00:50:41.750
- No.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.989
Great important question.

00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:47.280
Pragmatism is, of course,
philosophically, as you know,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.350
is about consequences of actions
being the most important thing,

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:53.974
not the ideas themselves.

00:50:56.879 --> 00:50:58.670
Today I was having
lunch with some students

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:02.610
that the Institute put
together, and I was

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:03.860
asked a very similar question.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.120
And I was thinking back to when
I was a student at Harvard,

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.180
co-chair of SDS during the
Harvard strike, and talk

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.431
about being unpragmatic.

00:51:12.431 --> 00:51:14.180
Now we wanted to stop
the war, but we also

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:18.140
wanted to bring down the whole
system as quickly as possible,

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.494
and didn't really care too
much about how we did it.

00:51:21.494 --> 00:51:23.660
And I don't think we brought
Richard Nixon to power.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.760
He was in power
already by early 1969,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.640
but we certainly didn't
help George McGovern

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.650
very much in 1972.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:35.900
Anyway, I'm more
optimistic about--

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.180
partly because I work
with people on Dissent--

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.700
about-- where is the person
who asked me the questions?

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.280
I want to look at you
while I talk to you.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.030
I think they really didn't
like Hillary Clinton at all,

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.280
but they ended up voting for
her-- at least the people

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.840
I know.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.990
They realize that socialism
won't be built in a day.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.930
And they don't talk about
revolution very much.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.780
Bernie Sanders
has-- our revolution

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.640
is his web site and
his book-- but he

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.130
means that obviously
rhetorically, not

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.970
let's put together an
army and smash the state.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.060
And so I think it's a battle.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.290
Because obviously
when young people--

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.520
anybody really-- becomes
radical and comes

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:22.160
to a sense of-- my god the whole
world is unequal and terrible

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.750
and we need a
decent society, then

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.744
you want to get there
as quickly as possible.

00:52:25.744 --> 00:52:26.660
I think it's a battle.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.840
It's a battle within DSA,
this organization which

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.930
has grown so much.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:32.000
there's a battle in
the Democratic Party,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.458
to some degree, of
how you do that.

00:52:33.458 --> 00:52:35.810
And politics is about
compromise, on the left

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:37.050
as well as in general.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:40.850
And so I guess I'm more
optimistic than you

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.530
are, in part, because I think--

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:47.900
when I talk to my people on
the editorial staff at Dissent

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:51.320
in New York, and when I
talk to left-wing students

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.870
at Georgetown and
elsewhere, they

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.024
understand yes, we have
to vote for Democrats.

00:52:56.024 --> 00:52:57.440
Though they argue
with some people

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.940
who don't agree
with them, but still

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.481
there's a sense
that there really

00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:02.980
is no alternative-- though they
hate there's no alternative.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.890
Now some people
argue, oh, we have

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.130
to build a third party
as soon as possible

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.463
because there is an alternative.

00:53:06.463 --> 00:53:09.800
So that's a lot of the debate.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:16.130
But in some ways, 40 years or
so of basically conservative

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.500
dominance of the discourse
in our politics--

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.020
not necessarily the
government at all times--

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.030
I think is a sobering thing.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:27.440
Back in 1960s when I was
20, 21 years old and trying

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.924
to do as much damage
to Harvard as possible,

00:53:31.924 --> 00:53:33.590
we were coming out
of a liberal period--

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:36.170
out of a period
of when we thought

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.250
all things were possible.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.260
That was part of what gave rise
to the movements of the '60s

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.430
and helped to understand.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:41.930
And for us, liberals
were the enemy.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:43.763
Because they were
fighting a war in Vietnam,

00:53:43.763 --> 00:53:46.940
which was a terrible war--

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.870
leading the war in Vietnam.

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.280
So that's a long
rambling answer to--

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.940
it could be worse.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.540
And I think there's an
argument to be made there.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.420
And inevitably,
it's a good thing

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.832
that people have utopian ideas.

00:54:01.832 --> 00:54:03.290
Let's do away with
all the prisons.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.706
Let's do away with
all the police.

00:54:04.706 --> 00:54:08.670
That's a debate in DSA,
for example, right now.

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.910
But at the same time, people
who say that, I think,

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.730
would be quite
willing to have fewer

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.880
prisons, and fewer
non-violent criminals in jail,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.190
and better jails.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.972
And so back in the '60s when
we talked about revolution

00:54:22.972 --> 00:54:25.430
we really meant it, though we
had no idea how to get there.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.850
- Jay Gleeson.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.800
War Against War is a
really interesting book,

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.460
because in part it
calls attention--

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:34.960
- What book?

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.710
I'm sorry.

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:36.655
- War Against War--

00:54:36.655 --> 00:54:37.290
- Thank you.

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:40.540
- is an interesting book, partly
because it calls attention

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.610
to how little is left of
the anti-war movement,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.500
especially since you were
on the Cambridge Common

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.370
in the moratorium
and in the SDS.

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:49.990
But when you look--

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.450
there was rarely
a peep of protest

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.900
when Obama was bombing
seven different countries.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.090
Clinton's foreign
policy could have

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:59.530
been written by Dick Cheney.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:03.230
Even Bernie Sanders didn't
like discussing foreign policy.

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:07.030
So we're at a point where you
say that leftist and liberals--

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.100
which are two different groups--

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.310
need to come up with
a foreign policy that

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.690
solves the problems
of the world,

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.600
rather than adding to them.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.430
But you don't get any
more specific than that.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:20.350
Liberals obviously
are very comfortable

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.440
with a unipolar world
there with imperialism.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.530
Leftists are generally
anti-imperialists.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.800
So how do you reconcile
those different positions?

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.660
Someone like Obama
believes very firmly

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.550
in American
exceptionalism, which leads

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.505
to a lot of these problems.

00:55:35.505 --> 00:55:36.880
Part of the problem
with the left

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.190
has always been
factionalism, especially when

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.660
it comes to foreign policy.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.562
Where do you go with that?

00:55:42.562 --> 00:55:43.520
- It's a good question.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.550
And thanks for reading
my book, even if you

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:46.950
don't agree with all of it.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.560
Since Vietnam I think the
left, with some exceptions,

00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:01.040
like anti-apartheid supporting
the left-wing governments,

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.309
and supporters in Nicaragua,
El Salvadore-- solidarity

00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:04.850
movements-- has not
known really what

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.230
to say about foreign policy.

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.510
And that's even more true
since the Cold War ended.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.540
And even more true
since 9/11 in many ways.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.389
Michael Walzer, my
former co-editor--

00:56:13.389 --> 00:56:15.680
a very great political theorist
who I studied with here

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.550
at Harvard and then co-edited
the Dissent with him--

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.690
says, for the left, the
default foreign policy

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:24.262
is a good domestic policy.

00:56:24.262 --> 00:56:25.970
I think it has something
to do with that.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.049
Because Bernie
Sanders has said--

00:56:28.049 --> 00:56:29.840
it wasn't that he had
a bad foreign policy,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.256
good foreign policy-- he didn't
have much foreign policy--

00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:34.250
he hardly said anything
about foreign policy.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.829
So I don't agree that
Barack Obama was just

00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:38.870
as bad as George W. Bush.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:45.710
But it's certainly
true that leftists--

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.780
there is no countries
in the world

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.420
they identify with, the way
some leftists identified

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.600
with the Soviet Union
or China or Cuba.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.480
Even Scandinavia is
less of a shining

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.510
light for Social Democrats
these days, as I suggested.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.846
So that's a problem.

00:57:01.846 --> 00:57:03.470
Because going back
in American history,

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.303
the Socialist Party
identified very strongly

00:57:05.303 --> 00:57:07.520
with the Socialist
Party of Germany--

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.984
the SPD back in Debs's day.

00:57:10.984 --> 00:57:15.000
And that, of course, fell
apart after World War I.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.690
So I wish I could tell
you how to do that.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.700
Part of the problem is
that Americans, I think--

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.140
it's not just leftists who think
that the best foreign policy is

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.690
a good domestic policy-- most
Americans feel that same way.

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.190
I wouldn't say most
Americans are isolationists,

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.457
but most Americans really
only care about the world

00:57:33.457 --> 00:57:35.540
if the world's going to
attack them and hurt them,

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.639
as with terrorism.

00:57:36.639 --> 00:57:38.180
And so how do you
make that argument?

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.070
I'm afraid-- I hate to
say I'm pessimistic--

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:44.630
I'm afraid it will take a
crisis, perhaps like the Iraq

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.250
war again.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:47.687
I think the one
issue Americans do

00:57:47.687 --> 00:57:49.520
care about, which is
an international issue,

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.420
is climate change.

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.075
And I think in
some ways, talking

00:57:52.075 --> 00:57:53.450
about how climate
change can hurt

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.980
poor people in
the world more, is

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:57.240
one way into making Americans
care more about that.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.880
But let's face it.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.850
Most citizens of most
countries of the world

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:04.230
don't really care that much
about the foreign policy

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.750
of their nations, unless
it's not working very well.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.540
As long as it's
working well then

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.870
we let it go, because they
feel it doesn't really

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.280
involve their interests.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.446
But thanks for the question.

00:58:18.954 --> 00:58:20.370
- Hi, Professor
I'm Emily Dreyfus.

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:22.090
Thank you so much.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.230
You mentioned some ways forward.

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.990
And those included that
we need-- on the left--

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:34.387
to have empathy and include that
in all of our public discourse.

00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:35.970
One thing I didn't
hear you talk about

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:40.680
was money and how we on the
left can organize and fund

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.670
such organization.

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.750
And I'm thinking so much lately
about how the right seems

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:50.190
to have so much organized
money behind it and that

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:53.430
whether or not we understood the
power of all of that funding.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:57.900
It really has given them an
intense power that we lack,

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.870
possibly because we're
more factionalized.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.040
And I just wondered
do you think that--

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.470
I'm sure we have
a future-- but do

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:08.280
we have a chance to actually
beat that side if we

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.840
don't have such an organized
and well funded central system?

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.340
- Yeah.

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.040
That's a good question.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.170
I deal with this all
the time at my magazine,

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.980
because we have a budget
that's probably a little more

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:25.080
than the salary of a tenured
Harvard law professor,

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.390
but maybe--

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.400
I don't want to assume--

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.760
but we're constantly
trying to raise

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.230
money just for that,
through grants,

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.400
and different kinds
of subscription deals,

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.875
and that kind of stuff.

00:59:40.875 --> 00:59:43.500
I think obviously the difference
between the right and the left

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.130
is that the right's in favor
of unregulated capitalism

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:49.419
and we're not.

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.960
I mean there's a good reason
why the Kochs give so much money

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.970
to the right-- because
the people they give

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.250
to want to help the Kochs,
as well as they have a more

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:58.190
general libertarian worldview.

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.500
I don't want to be
unfair to the Kochs.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.030
They do have beliefs
as well as interests.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:08.820
But I think that's
part of the reason why

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.810
the decline of unions
is so much of a problem

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.580
for, not just liberals,
but leftists too,

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.240
because unions used to
fund a lot of campaigns--

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.989
and still do when they
still exist and are strong.

01:00:20.989 --> 01:00:23.030
Every time we've ever
canvassed for a candidate--

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:24.720
not every time, a lot of times--

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.680
we meet in union halls.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.660
At least we used to,
not so much anymore.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.020
And of course they--

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.420
probably still the single
most important contributor

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.894
to democratic campaigns
are labor unions.

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:37.810
I don't know for sure.

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.930
I think there have to
be imaginative ways

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:45.370
to put together some
crowdsourcing, funding.

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:47.070
Maybe if you join
an organization

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.720
you have to agree to give
a certain amount of money.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.310
I'm not sure.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:49.950
I'm not sure.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.685
And there, of course,
are sympathetic people

01:00:52.685 --> 01:00:54.810
with lots of money like
Tom Steyer, who right now I

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:58.589
think is pursuing the quixotic
aim of impeaching Donald Trump,

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:00.630
rather giving money to
candidates like he should.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.410
But anyway, if your listening to
me, Tom-- you're probably not--

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.130
But you need some
more of those people.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.159
One of the reasons why
I think the Democratic

01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:10.200
Party is the only party--

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.367
if Bernie Sanders had
gotten the nomination

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:14.200
he would have had a
hard time raising money.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.207
You could say, oh, people
would have given small amounts.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:18.040
And they would have.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.270
That's certainly true.

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.290
But that's not enough
to go against the ads

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.870
that the Republicans would
have run against him,

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:28.670
and will run against him if he
gets the nomination in 2020.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.670
I won't tell you what
those ads are going to be,

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.400
but you can imagine.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.590
You've got to counter those
ads, and that takes money.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.770
I dearly wish we could
get away from that.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:42.280
My friend, Miles Rapoport,
is in the crowd here.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.645
He was a leader--

01:01:43.645 --> 01:01:46.660
is still a leader-- in trying
to change our horrible campaign

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.370
finance system.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.040
But as far as I know
that hasn't happened yet.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.540
He's a founder of
Demos and helped

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.670
to really try to put
a lot of good ideas

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.660
about that out there.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:59.550
So I think we have to try to
change that system actually.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:02.440
That's really the best way to
do it, at least for elections.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.514
For other movement, activity--

01:02:04.514 --> 01:02:06.180
that's somewhat easier
to fund I think--

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.437
doesn't need as much money.

01:02:07.437 --> 01:02:08.411
Thank you.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.270
- Jonathan Martin--

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:15.150
I appreciated a lot of
what you had to say,

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:19.230
but I wonder if the claim
that voting for a third party

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:22.230
is political malpractice
is far too sweeping.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.910
After all, Bernie
Sanders himself

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:25.980
emerged from a third party
movement in Vermont--

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.771
- In Vermont, yeah.

01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:31.080
- --which has exerted leverage
to push the Democratic Party

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.670
to the left in Vermont.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:36.270
There is a history of third
parties affecting policy,

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:39.910
even if they only win a
small portion of seats,

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:42.300
which I'm sure you're aware of.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.460
On top of that, major
parties don't last forever.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.710
There's a history of the
Republican Party starting out

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:47.820
as a third party.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.310
And finally, there are many
state legislative elections

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.440
where there's only one
party running in about 40%

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.120
of state legislative elections.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.510
In that case the spoiler
dynamic doesn't even exist,

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:00.204
and third parties could
be a viable choice.

01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:00.870
What about that?

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.036
- Well that's very well put.

01:03:02.036 --> 01:03:04.290
And I certainly should
have put caveats in there.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.260
I didn't want to talk too
long about any one part

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.960
of the subjects of my talk.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.320
No, it's certainly true,
especially in very strongly

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.880
blue areas, perhaps like
Cambridge, like D.C.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.840
where I live--

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.630
where Hillary Clinton
won 93% of the vote--

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:24.450
New York City, New York State,
the Working Families Party--

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:27.240
which you might know is able
to run their own candidates.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.290
But also there's a law in New
York very few states have,

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:32.790
where they can fuse the general
election with the Democrats.

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:37.200
So they don't actually run the
risk of electing a Republican.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.244
Historically, third parties
have often served a great role.

01:03:40.244 --> 01:03:41.910
The great historian,
Richard Hofstadter,

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:44.662
said, third parties
are like bees.

01:03:44.662 --> 01:03:45.870
They sting and then they die.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.970
And that was true of
the People's Party.

01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:48.870
It was not true for
the Republican Party.

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.100
It was true of the People's
Party and the Socialist

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:50.891
Party in many ways.

01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:55.410
Even the Progressive
Party of Henry Wallace,

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.368
and the Progressive Party
of Robert La Follette

01:03:57.368 --> 01:03:59.610
early in 1924.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.290
But I'm talking about
today's politics--

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.090
I'm talking about the
future of the left--

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.940
and here I think there is such
a difference really on most

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.460
issues-- and I would argue this
despite people talking about

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.110
neoliberalism and so forth--

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.410
between national
Democrats at least,

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:17.610
and national Republicans,
on really important issues

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:20.290
of reform, and regulation,
and health care,

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:23.880
and on and on, that if you
run a third party for national

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.694
elections, or in most states I'd
say-- not Vermont, necessarily,

01:04:27.694 --> 01:04:30.110
where I think the Democrats
have basically stopped running

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.510
a candidate against
Bernie anyway--

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:38.040
then I think you do make it much
more easy for the other side

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.790
to win.

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:44.410
Jill Stein won enough votes
in Pennsylvania, Michigan,

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.100
and Wisconsin-- if those people
had voted for Hillary Clinton--

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.141
to elect Hillary Clinton.

01:04:48.141 --> 01:04:49.664
Now obviously, a
lot of those people

01:04:49.664 --> 01:04:51.830
would not have voted for
Hillary Clinton-- whatever.

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.621
Or they wouldn't voted
at all if Jill Stein

01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:54.630
wasn't on the ballot.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.210
But still, I think,
what's the point

01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:00.090
of having Jill Stein
running for president when

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:01.270
the Green Party--

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:05.010
if the Green Party was a party
with the kind of membership

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:09.150
and press and entree to
different populations

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.069
that the Socialist
Party had 100 years ago,

01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:12.360
then I might think differently.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.140
But it doesn't.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.510
And to build that kind
of party, I think--

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.856
as I said, I think you
can build a stronger

01:05:17.856 --> 01:05:19.230
left within the
Democratic Party,

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:23.430
and don't have to worry about a
more pure radical party, which

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:28.260
can run the risk of doing
what Ralph Nader did in 2000.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.440
So, we'll disagree.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.196
It depends where, is my point.

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.070
I agree with you about
legislative elections.

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:35.569
Yeah.

01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:36.372
- Hey.

01:05:36.372 --> 01:05:37.830
So I noticed that
you didn't really

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:41.280
mention any contemporary
leaders or groups aside

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.460
from Bernie Sanders who,
as you point out, will be--

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:43.960
- And DSA.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:49.146
- --close to 80, DSA, and Black
Lives Matter, and Indivisible,

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:50.770
which you've raised
some concern about.

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:55.170
So do you see any leaders,
or any organizations

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.030
at the national or
state level, that could

01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:58.530
lead this kind of resurgence?

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:00.770
Or do you think there's
just a total vacuum?

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:02.145
- I think it will
be a coalition.

01:06:02.145 --> 01:06:04.271
It won't be one
group or one leader.

01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:05.770
Which is probably
good in some ways,

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.679
because people have to
learn to work together.

01:06:09.679 --> 01:06:11.220
And, of course, part
of the problem--

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.860
it's more with liberals
than leftists--

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.357
is that-- I talked about
conservatives always looking

01:06:16.357 --> 01:06:17.190
for the next Reagan.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.140
In some ways,
liberals are always

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.682
looking for the next Obama,
or before that, John Kennedy--

01:06:22.682 --> 01:06:25.140
someone like that who will lead
them out of the wilderness.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.470
Eugene Debs said-- he has
great quotations-- he said,

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:30.220
if I could lead you
out of the wilderness,

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.090
I could lead you
right back again.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.520
And so I think we should be
suspicious of politicians,

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.800
especially the ones who
want to run for president.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.770
You got to be a little crazy
to run for president, I think--

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.389
given the powers you'll have.

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.430
But I think it'll be a
coalition of these groups.

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.680
That's why I was talking
about some of these dilemmas.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.857
Because leftists who
stand on one side

01:06:48.857 --> 01:06:50.940
of the dilemma or another,
have to figure out ways

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.370
to cooperate with one another.

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.234
I'm a member of DSA.

01:06:54.234 --> 01:06:55.900
I think that's an
important organization

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.691
if you consider yourself
a socialist of one

01:06:57.691 --> 01:06:58.590
kind or another--

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.320
democratic one kind of another.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.850
I'm to the right, probably,
of a lot of the people in DSA.

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.350
But then, I'm almost
70 years old so

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.200
that would stand to reason.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.340
But find yourself
an organization

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.950
and fight within it,
and work within it.

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.840
Because in the end, it's
about institutions and putting

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.710
institutions together.

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:23.169
And elections obviously
draw people's attention,

01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:25.710
but it's what you do before the
election that really matters,

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:26.420
of course.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.134
- But there's a
number of threats

01:07:29.134 --> 01:07:31.050
of primary challenges,
and primary challenges,

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:33.175
happening on the Democratic
side in these midterms.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:36.057
So are any of those candidates--
has anyone stood out to you?

01:07:36.057 --> 01:07:37.140
- Oh, specific candidates.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.240
- Yeah, anybody.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.410
- Trying to think.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.930
I'm trying to think of Senate
races and gubernatorial races.

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.390
There was a guy in Virginia
who lost the primary--

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:51.132
Tom Perriello-- who had won
in a pretty red district

01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:52.340
for Congress, you might know.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.040
And he lost the primary
to a guy who's basically

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.802
a liberal, Ralph Northam.

01:07:56.802 --> 01:07:58.319
And he lost by 11 points.

01:07:58.319 --> 01:08:00.110
And Perriello had some
of the same problems

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.152
that Bernie Sanders had--

01:08:01.152 --> 01:08:03.276
everybody who doesn't care
about Virginia politics,

01:08:03.276 --> 01:08:04.770
you can look at
your phones now--

01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:09.760
because he didn't really have
much appeal to black voters,

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.522
especially older black voters.

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:12.980
He didn't have much
to say to them.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.780
He didn't try that
hard, unfortunately.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.095
And he mostly ran against how
terrible Donald Trump was.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:18.970
Part of the problem--

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.245
I didn't say this explicitly,
but it should be assumed

01:08:21.245 --> 01:08:23.870
in almost everything I've said--
you got to find candidates who

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:28.069
can say something-- who
can sum up their vision--

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.600
and I would say a
more radical vision--

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.149
succinctly and powerfully.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.790
And Bernie Sanders
could do that.

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:36.740
But most people who are
in Democrat primaries

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.180
are not very good at it.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.972
So I'm trying to think
of another candidate that

01:08:41.972 --> 01:08:42.850
comes to mind.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.109
But the fact that no
candidate does come to mind

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:46.754
is itself, perhaps, clear.

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:48.170
And you know, part
of the problem,

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:50.200
too, is to win
elections as Democrats,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.350
you have to make a lot of money.

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:54.890
And one of the best things
Bernie Sanders did, I think,

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:58.729
is that he got some young people
on the left to run for office.

01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:01.160
I have a student right
now who's 19 years old,

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.340
and he worked for Bernie
Sanders last year.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.590
And he's going to run for
state Senate in Connecticut,

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.740
in some district that
some older Republican has

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.180
held for a long time.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.380
And basically, this Republican
hardly bothers to campaign,

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.439
and people keep
electing her anyway.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:20.420
And my student is 19 years old.

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.830
He'll be 20 by the time
the election or something.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.500
And who knows
who's going to win?

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.104
But that's a great sign.

01:09:26.104 --> 01:09:28.020
And I think we need more
people whose names we

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:33.741
don't know to run for office
on more left-wing platforms.

01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:36.630
Thanks.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.609
- Hi, Professor.

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:39.080
I was wondering,
are you following

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.260
contemporary developments of
the left in other countries?

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.060
And how do you read
them in the context

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.830
of what's happening in the US?

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.829
And do you think solid ideas
could be built across nations?

01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:50.120
- Yes, that's a great question.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.479
I mentioned some of that passing
at the beginning, of course.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.820
And partly because--
a lot because--

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.780
I edit Dissent.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.959
We run articles about
lefts in other countries.

01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:01.250
We just had a couple of
probably controversial articles

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.060
about Catalonia
independence, for example,

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.340
which is not just the left.

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.310
But, of course, Catalonia in
Spain has always been the more

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:09.200
left-wing part of Spain--

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.060
at least the last
hundred years or so.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:18.970
And we run articles on the
left in different countries--

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:21.150
more in Europe, traditionally,
than other countries.

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:24.100
But we're branching out to
run more in Latin America,

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.440
for example, and
India, and China,

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.090
where there needs to be a left.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.881
Of course, even though
the government calls

01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:35.220
itself still
socialist-- socialism

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.030
with Chinese characteristics.

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:39.750
So yeah, international
solidarity is important.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.600
Michael Walzer has a new
book coming out next month,

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.190
or the month after, called,
The Left and Foreign Policy,

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:49.315
a lot of which he published
in Dissent, originally.

01:10:49.315 --> 01:10:51.731
And his foreign policy-- as
an answer to the gentleman who

01:10:51.731 --> 01:10:53.310
asked me about
foreign policy before,

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:55.320
I should have mentioned
it when he asked me--

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.260
is people on the left should
support people like them,

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.510
in effect, in other countries.

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:01.968
That's the best
kind of solidarity.

01:11:01.968 --> 01:11:02.920
And I agree with that.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.529
I don't think that's
the whole thing.

01:11:04.529 --> 01:11:06.570
If Bernie Sanders gets
the Democratic nomination,

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:10.390
he's going to have to say
what to do about the Pentagon.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:14.430
He's not going to be able to
avoid that little question.

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:19.669
But I think it is important
to study and identify

01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:21.210
people on the left
in other countries

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:23.070
and make connections with them.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.400
We have on Dissent very good
connections with a Polish new

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.333
left group called [POLISH]--

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:34.500
excuse my Polish--
which is mostly young,

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.830
leftist intellectuals, like
people who work for Dissent.

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.450
That's the obvious kind of
thing we're going to do.

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:45.020
And we just got a nice grant--
or we're about to get a nice

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.610
grant from the group
I will not name--

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:50.550
to put together a big conference
about Democratic Socialism

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:54.030
in Latin America, which will be
in New York City about a year

01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.180
from now.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.640
So yes, obviously.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.370
But, of course,
that's not necessarily

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:02.370
going to help build the
left in this country.

01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:05.970
But it certainly gets
Americans out of their idea

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.796
that America's the
center of the world--

01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:10.420
whether a bad center
or a good center--

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.628
but nevertheless, the center.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.030
So thanks for the question.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.650
- I'm Heather Ramoff, and
thank you for your talk.

01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:23.840
I particularly like the
idea that a unifying

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.190
goal of the various factions
of the left is equality.

01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:31.130
I'm concerned with
economic equality,

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:36.440
and see monopolies as a barrier
to achieving economic equality,

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.250
particularly monopolies
of the commons in nature.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.360
And I just wonder--

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.310
- Especially in what?

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:45.170
- The monopolies of
the commons in nature--

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:47.510
mineral reserves,
clean air, clean water,

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:49.560
those kinds of things.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.930
And I just wonder if you
have any thoughts or ideas

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:58.094
of how we most effectively
could address monopoly

01:12:58.094 --> 01:12:58.760
in this country.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.060
Thank you.

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:00.601
- Well you know one
of the things I--

01:13:00.601 --> 01:13:03.410
if I give a more general lecture
about left in American history

01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:06.710
I would have mentioned-- but
anti-monopoly was probably

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:11.000
the most common tendency
that united different kinds

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.690
of leftists in American
history, beginning--

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:16.130
well some would argue
with the [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.120
to the second bank
of the United States,

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.917
but certainly after the Civil
War during the Gilded Age.

01:13:21.917 --> 01:13:23.000
Populists talked about it.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.125
Socialists talked about it.

01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:25.440
Anarchist talked about it.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440
Antitrust reformers, of
course, talked about it.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.332
- They don't talk
about it now very much.

01:13:29.332 --> 01:13:31.040
- Well, people are
starting to, actually.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.810
At least where I am in D.C.
There are people--Elizabeth

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:38.270
Warren talks about
it, your senator--

01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:40.490
not a socialist, but
certainly a left liberal,

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:42.090
so the anti-monopolist, I think.

01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:49.040
And a lot of this scandal
about the Russians

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.160
putting all this stuff
on Facebook and Twitter

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.680
during the last election
to try to sway the vote

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.360
gets people thinking
about that as well.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.270
The problem, as
always, with making

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:02.510
that argument is
monopolists also

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:05.560
deliver a lot of
stuff people want.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.980
When I'm working
on a new book, I

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.240
must say the first
thing I think about when

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.800
I think about buying a book that
was published 100 years ago,

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.984
is I look on Amazon.

01:14:11.984 --> 01:14:13.400
Because all those
great secondhand

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.284
dealers can sell it
to you real cheap

01:14:16.284 --> 01:14:17.700
and deliver it
right to your door.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.950
- Get royalties on those
secondhand book [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:23.200
- Well 100 years ago-- you're
not getting royalties anyway.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.030
But no it's a real problem.

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:28.970
As always you need
an alternative.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.570
You just say, OK, how can I
get all the stuff from Amazon

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:37.110
without Amazon doing it?

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:38.700
And that's always the question.

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:41.010
This is a question right
back to the Progressive era.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.551
Woodrow Wilson and
Theodore Roosevelt

01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:44.942
argued about new freedom
versus the new nationalism.

01:14:44.942 --> 01:14:47.150
And Roosevelt wanted more
regulation of corporations,

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.650
and Wilson, at
least rhetorically,

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:52.380
wanted to break
up the monopolies.

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.689
But I think it's something that
really has to be focused on.

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:57.980
But, of course, it's-- again,
as anything in politics--

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.050
it's got to be based on
grievances people have.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:01.670
It can't just be
based on, big is bad.

01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:03.253
That doesn't convince people.

01:15:03.253 --> 01:15:04.239
Thank you.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.550
- My name is Jitendra Singh.

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.710
My question has to do
with-- it's actually

01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:17.660
a variant of a question that
was asked a little while ago.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.030
It has to do with
the fact that here we

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:28.850
are in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
a reliably blue state.

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:33.320
And in order for us
to have any impact

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.100
on the national political
scene, we really

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:43.250
have to build alliances
with people and groups that

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:48.830
are outside of here in order
to really be effective.

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.800
And so my question
has to do with who do

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.440
we build such alliances with?

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.450
And is there a leader--

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:59.120
or a set of leaders
for that matter--

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.400
who can help marshal the
tremendous amount of energy

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.990
that we have here towards
making a difference?

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.700
- Yeah.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.140
When people ask me questions
like that my first impulse

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.890
to say, hey, I'm just historian.

01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:22.500
Let me tell you about the past.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.080
I wish we had him around--

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080
not him-- King.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.340
I think he was
probably the greatest

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.880
leader of the left in
American history in many ways.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:37.490
But all I can say
is, look, I think

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:41.060
you need to get involved in
whatever issue or institution

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.720
you feel the most passionate
about, and make sure

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.260
that institution
can grow, and can

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.615
make more of those
connections and coalitions.

01:16:51.615 --> 01:16:53.490
And everyone has their
own way of doing that.

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.880
I think one of the reasons
unions were so important--

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.730
and can still be
important, I hope,

01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:01.100
in the future-- is because
they are about what people do

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.050
every day at their workplace.

01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:06.020
You don't have to say, oh, I
think I'll leave work and go

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:09.200
to a meeting which is about
something that is not really

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.112
about my daily life,
but about what's

01:17:11.112 --> 01:17:13.070
happening in South Africa--
which is important,

01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:14.870
but not going to
have much effect.

01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:18.890
I think politics does
begin where people live.

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:20.450
And yet, it doesn't stop there.

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:23.440
And I think you've got to--

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.820
I don't know what you do,
and who your friends are,

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.820
and what institutions
you are already

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:30.110
a part of-- but I
would figure out

01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:34.470
which institution,
what group of friends,

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:38.580
could best link up with
people in other states

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:42.407
who work on either that
issue or that campaign.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.740
I'm just giving you methodology.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.948
I'm not giving you an answer.

01:17:44.948 --> 01:17:48.060
But if I were a politician
I'd say, vote for me.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.881
But I'm not a politician.

01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:50.380
- Thank you.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.540
- So I think we have a signal
that's the last question,

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.040
right?

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:54.440
- Yeah.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.000
- Yeah.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.247
So anyway, it's been great.

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:57.830
Thank you very much
for your questions

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.780
and for your attention.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.930
