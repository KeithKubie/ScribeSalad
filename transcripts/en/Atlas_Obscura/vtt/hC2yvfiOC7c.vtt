00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.967
 In a history of science museum in Florence, Italy

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:06.467
 is the middle finger of our modern age 

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.567
 I’ve been lucky enough to actually go to this museum 

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.066
 and it is incredible 

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.000
 in there among the armillary spheres 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.800
 and the lodestones and the antique telescopes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.367
 there is a literal piece of humanity 

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:24.567
 a middle finger 

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.200
and it is kept in a little shrine like a saintly relic 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.066
 but this is not a piece of a saint 

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.700
 it is a piece of an enemy of the church 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.333
 it is part of a heretic. This...

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.300
 Is Galileo’s middle finger 

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:48.467
 It took a while for Galileo’s skeleton to age into something worth collecting 

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.066
 sort of like a, like a fine wine 

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.266
 so it wasn’t until 1737 or 95 years after he died 

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.467
 that one Anton Francesco Gori went and decided that 

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:02.967
 he need to collect a few pieces of Galileo Galilei

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.300
 Now this wasn’t without a president 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.700
 there was a long tradition of preserving venerated individuals in Catholicism 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.967
 Except this was a little different 

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:16.567
 Anton Francesco Gori was not a religious fanatic 

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.800
  He was a Galileo groupie 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.433
 What he did is he snapped of three fingers 

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.600
 and a few other bits which we get into later 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.500
 he took his thumb, his index finger, and his middle finger 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.266
 is this your index finger? 

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.633
 He was taking scientific relics 

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:35.533
 These were the fingers that Galileo used when he adjusted his telescope 

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:40.266
 He was in essence creating the first scientific saint 

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.066
 Oftentimes Galileo is portrayed as being versus the church 

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:48.166
 It was Galileo and the church in this pit match against each other 

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.900
 It was a little more complicated than that 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.100
 his theory that the earth did in fact revolve around the sun 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.433
 and not the other way around 

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.734
 and the church actually said “OK, that’s fine” 

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.100
 “but you just, you gotta represent both sides of the argument" 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.500
 so Galileo did this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 but the guy who represented the church in it’s geocentric position 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.367
 did such a terrible job 

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:13.967
 that when the book was published 

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.200
 people basically thought the Galileo had punked the pope 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.767
 After this the Pope who was already paranoid 

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:21.433
 and worried about looking weak 

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.867
 came down and sentenced Galileo to house arrest 

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:27.967
 basically for the remainder of his life 

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:33.567
 But it doesn’t mean that Galileo ever truly abandoned his faith 

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.033
 ultimately whether Galileo’s middle finger is 

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.200
 pointed up at the heavens 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.001
 where he saw the beauty of god in math and physics 

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.266
 or out to the church 

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.767
 who condemned him for his scientific views 

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.900
 is really for the viewer to decide. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.100
 His thumb and other finger were also taken 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.700
 and they actually weren’t discovered until 2009 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.467
 when they were seen on an auction block 

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.166
 and someone put it together and was like 

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:05.734
 “I feel like these are the other two fingers that have been missing" 

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:06.967
 so they have been reunited 

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.367
 as has a tooth 

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:13.300
 and if you are on a Galileo corpse tour of Italy 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.100
 you should go to the university of Padua 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.867
 because they’ve got his vertebrae
