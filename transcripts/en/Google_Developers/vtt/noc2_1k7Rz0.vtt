[CHEERING]

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:08.020
SUNDAR PICHAI: Good morning.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.300
Welcome to Google I/O.
Computing is evolving again.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.330
So we are focused
on driving the shift

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.820
and applying AI to
solving problems.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.300
Today we are announcing a new
initiative called Google Lens.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.000
Google Lens is a set of
vision-based computing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.350
capabilities that can understand
what you're looking at

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.610
and help you take action
based on that information.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.930
At Google, we are bringing
our AI efforts together

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.720
under Google.ai.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.120
It's a collection of efforts
and teams focused on bringing

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.065
the benefits of AI to everyone.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.440
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Last year at
I/O, we introduced the Google

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.550
Assistant, and today
I'm excited to announce

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.965
that the Google Assistant is
now available on the iPhone.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.590
RISHI CHANDRA: We're
announcing support

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.910
for proactive assistance
coming to Google Home.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.890
ANIL SABHARWAL: Suggested
sharing, shared libraries,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.490
and photo books,
three new features

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.145
built from the ground up
with AI at their core.

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.250
SUSAN WOJCICKI:
The future of media

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.710
is a future of
openness and diversity.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.510
DAVE BURKE: Seriously,
two billion active devices

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.870
is incredible.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.911
STEPHANIE SAAD CUTHBERTSON:
I'm happy to announce

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.495
that we're making the first beta
release of O available today.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.036
SAMEER SAMAT: I'm
excited to give you

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:20.920
a sneak peek into a
new experience we're

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.710
building for entry-level
Android devices.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.290
Internally, we
call it Android Go.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.750
CLAY BAVOR: VR and AR,
two different flavors

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.770
of what you might call
immersive computing, computing

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.020
that works more like we do.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.520
SUNDAR PICHAI: It'll take
all of us working together

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.280
to bring the benefits of
technology to everyone.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.160
That's our hope.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.870
Let's do it together.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.790
Thanks for your time today
and enjoy Google I/O.
