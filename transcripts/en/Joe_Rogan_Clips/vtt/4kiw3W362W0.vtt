WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.020
Yeah.
It just,
it though the hole.
I mean,
the,
the newer thing is very,

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.370
it's very interesting.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.010
It's very interesting because you're watching a professional look,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.550
cast a web like nice and slow,

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.540
nice and slow with the full force of the FBI against you.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.470
And if the they it against her rod just don't,
like I said,
they'll do,
you know.

7
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.730
Yeah.
It's creepy.
Well,

8
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.940
Jamie said they opened up the government today to distract from the fact that

9
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.670
Roger Stone got arrested.
Most likely.
I think you're right.

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.840
I think that's a good assessment,
I guess.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
I mean,
Trump's the final target,
so,
um,
but yeah,
he's gonna,

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
he's gonna threaten stone wood,
you know,
he's like 66.
Yeah.

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.210
Threatens them with 10 years.
He's probably gonna.
Yeah.

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.630
He's kind of said enough to fucking make them sing,
but he's such a,

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.040
like Dershowitz says they don't just sing.
They,
they,
uh,
they actually,
uh,

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.650
how to Dershowitz put it.
They actually,

17
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.320
and I'll come up with the lyrics they create.
They don't just sing.
Yeah.
You know,

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.680
what do you think is going to happen to Trump if you had to guess

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.390
as far as this investigation?
Nothing really pass out the coffee over here.
Ah,

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
thank you.
Yeah.
Thanks brother.
Why do you think nothing's going to happen?

21
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.430
You don't say,
well,
that's not true.

22
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.760
I shouldn't say that because only because I think morale is pretty fucking evil

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
and we'll come up with something.
Well,
you know what?

24
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.800
Impeachment at the,
at the worst,
but where's the high crimes and misdemeanors?

25
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.240
What?
Well,
if there was obstruction of justice,
if there was collusion,

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.890
if there was any sort of,

27
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.290
if they can prove that there was some sort of concerted effort to undermine

28
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.410
democracy.
Yeah.
Which I don't think,

29
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.040
I don't think they'll get to get them.
Even with Roger Stone,

30
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.740
they're not charging him with collusion of conspiracy,

31
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.530
just lying and covering up.
They don't,

32
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.760
they don't have them put collusion and conspiracy.
They're lying,
covering up the,

33
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.440
uh,
interactions with Russians.
Right.
So what it is,

34
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.990
I guess that would be malicious angle.
Yeah.
