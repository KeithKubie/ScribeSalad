00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.269
Vsauce!

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.269
Kevin here.

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's get inspired by Pee, Light, Meat, Snack.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.190
The sound of running water may make you want
to pee because of a conditioned association

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.000
with running water and going to the bathroom.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.670
Not just with the sound of peeing itself but
the flush of the toilet and washing your hands

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.730
- and it might not just be sounds - placing
images of waterfalls above urinals has proven

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.869
effective in helping shy bladders.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.509
The standard red meaning stop and green meaning
go on traffic lights comes directly from railroad

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.509
signals.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.560
Although green initially meant caution and
white meant go.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.510
That system changed because of an incident
in which a red lens fell out making a red

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.420
light look like a white light and causing
a terrible crash.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.600
These colors go back further to industrial
equipment featuring red light for stop and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.600
green while it was running - but red has been
thought of as a danger signal for thousands

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.820
of year because it's the color of blood.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.539
People often describe exotic meat like snake,
frog, and alligator as all tasting like chicken

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.009
possibly due to evolution.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.070
Chicken and birds in general are widely believed
to be direct descendants of dinosaurs, sharing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.079
a common meaty ancestor with modern snakes,
lizards and turtles called diapsids.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.639
Chicken also has a bland taste because of
a lack of fat and the type of muscle is fast

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:29.049
fiber allowing these chicken-tasting animals
to make short fast movements.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.689
Eating popcorn at the movie theater is commonplace
because during The Great Depression in the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.259
U.S. movie theater owners needed a new way
to make money.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.439
They added snack sales like the cheaply available
popcorn to supplement lower attendance and

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.619
ultimately stay in business.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.590
Roaming popcorn vendors gained popularity
in 1885 and they often setup near crowds like

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.530
outside of a movie theater.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.069
So minus the "ight" slap in an "and" minus
the "m" and what we're left with is a peel

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.829
and eat snack.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.950
Such as the orange.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.750
A citrus fruit which was named orange two
hundred years before the color orange was

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360
named orange.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.610
Before that linguists believe that people
referred to this color simply as yellow-red.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.110
And as always - thanks for watching.
