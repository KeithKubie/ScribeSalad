1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,980
How do I get the desire
to have discipline?

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,810
How do I get the desire
to have discipline?

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,980
I keep getting asked
this type of question.

4
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:22,390
How do I get disciplined or how do I
want discipline or how do I maintain

5
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:27,340
discipline? And the answer,
it's, it's a simple answer,

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,970
but obviously it's not easy.

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,890
And there's all all kinds of little
tricks and methods that people talk about

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,350
and you know, they have
some merit, you know,

9
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,050
maybe they do work these,
these things, you know,

10
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,200
do the little things people
say and wake up early.

11
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:52,201
I say that and write things down and take
cold showers and to tell everyone what

12
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:59,410
you're going to do. So broadcast
it and make promises or,

13
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:04,360
or make bets with, with your friends of
something that you don't want to lose.

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,290
And those things, those
ideas, they're, they're cool.

15
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:12,730
I'm sure they're going to have some
impact and if they work for you, that's,

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,880
that's awesome. But,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but the fact of the matter is that the
reason discipline is hard to maintain is

18
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,010
because it is hard to maintain.

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,750
That's what makes
discipline hard. It's hard.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,620
And if you hear me claim that
discipline is easy for me,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,050
then straight up, that's
just my ego talking.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,060
That's what that is because I'm

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,560
unfortunately just as human as everyone
else and it is a work to maintain the

24
00:01:56,221 --> 00:02:01,080
discipline. That's what it
is. Work holding the line,

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,220
maintaining the standard,

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,320
giving no slack, none.
That's the discipline,

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,680
that's the discipline and it is hard.

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,550
And if there's one thing I would
say that does make it easier,

29
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,460
it's to envision what it
feels like when you're done,

30
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,930
what it feels like after you've worked
out or you've held the line on your food

31
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:41,741
intake or you've pushed through some
monotonous project that you have to do in

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,950
all those things. When
they're done, they feel good

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,770
and contrary to that,

34
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,160
invision what you will feel like later.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,640
Do you let the discipline
slack, you know the feeling,

36
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,050
feeling weak and deed and you
know that you're falling behind.

37
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
So get to know those two different types
of feelings and ask yourself which one

38
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,670
you want to feel in 10 minutes

39
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,400
or in a half an hour. When,

40
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,080
when the thing is done, when
the discipline has blend,

41
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,063
implemented,

42
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,050
remember what that feels like,

43
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:45,250
and then remember that those
minutes and those hours,

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
they turn into weeks and months and years
and holding the line in those critical

45
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:56,911
minutes will put you in an infinitely
better place physically and mentally if

46
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,930
you maintain the discipline.

47
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,470
So work through the weakness,

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,550
fight through the
temptation. Hold the line,

49
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,520
hold the line, maintain the discipline.

50
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,770
It is not easy,

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,160
but it is worth it

52
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,970
because yes,

53
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,040
because discipline equals freedom.
