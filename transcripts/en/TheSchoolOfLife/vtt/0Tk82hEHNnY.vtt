00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
In well-meaning attempts to boost our confidence ahead of challenging moments,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.740
people often try to draw our attention to our strengths:

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.460
our intelligence, our competence, our experience.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360
But this can – curiously – have some awkward consequences.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.460
There’s a type of under-confidence that arises

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.420
specifically when we grow too attached to our own dignity

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.540
and become anxious around any situation that might seem to threaten it.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.020
We hold back from challenges in which there is any risk of ending up looking ridiculous

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
which comprises, of course, almost all the most interesting situations.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.820
In a foreign city, we might grow reluctant to ask anyone to guide us to the nice bars,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.940
because they might think us an ignorant, pitiable, lost tourist.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880
We might long to kiss someone

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.600
but never let on out of a fear that they could dismiss us as a predatory loser.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.560
Or at work, we don’t apply for a promotion,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.200
in case the senior management deems us delusionally arrogant.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.980
In a concerted bid never to look foolish, we don’t venture very far from our cocoon,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.040
and thereby – from time to time at least – miss out on the best opportunities of our lives.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.460
At the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.780
We imagine that it might be possible, after a certain age, to place ourselves beyond mockery.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.220
We trust that it's an option to lead a good life without regularly making a complete idiot of ourselves.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.240
One of the most charming books ever written in early modern Europe

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.680
is called 'In Praise of Folly'

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
by the Dutch scholar and philosopher, Erasmus.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.240
In its pages, Erasmus advances a hugely liberating argument.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.740
In a warm tone, he reminds us that everyone, however important and learned they might be, is a fool.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.100
No one is spared, not even the author.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.600
However well-schooled he himself was,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.660
Erasmus remained – he insists – as much of a nitwit as anyone else:

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.300
his judgement is faulty,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.100
his passions get the better of him,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.720
he is prey to superstition and irrational fear,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.240
he is shy whenever he has to meet new people,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.480
he drops things at elegant dinners.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.900
This is deeply cheering,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.940
for it means that our own repeated idiocies don't have to exclude us from the best company.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.360
Looking like a prick,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.900
making blunders and doing bizarre things in the night doesn’t render us unfit for society;

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.880
it just makes us a bit more like the greatest scholar of the northern European Renaissance.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.320
There’s a similarly uplifting message to be pulled from the work of Pieter Brueghel.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.440
His central work, 'The Dutch Proverbs,' presents a comically disenchanted view of human nature.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.080
Everyone, he suggests, is pretty much deranged:

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.320
here’s a man throwing his money into the river;

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.720
there’s a soldier squatting on the fire and burning his trousers;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
someone is intently bashing his head against a brick wall;

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.760
someone else is biting a pillar.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.880
Importantly, the painting is not an attack on just a few unusually awful people--

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.900
it’s a picture of parts of all of us.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.020
Brueghel’s and Erasmus’s work proposes that the way to greater confidence

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.940
isn’t to reassure ourselves of our own dignity--

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.780
it’s to grow at peace with the inevitable nature of our ridiculousness.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.580
We are idiots now,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.280
we have been idiots in the past,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.420
and we will be idiots again in the future...

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.500
and that's OK.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.480
There aren’t any other available options for human beings to be.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.860
Once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.680
it really doesn’t matter so much if we do one more thing that might make us look a bit stupid.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800
The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.540
The individual we asked directions from in a foreign city might regard us with contempt.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.780
But if these people did so, it wouldn’t be news to us--

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.320
they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago:

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.020
that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are a nitwit.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.480
The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially removed.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.680
A fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.640
We would grow free to give things a go by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.900
And every so often, amidst the endless rebuffs we’d have factored in from the outset, it would work:

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.420
we’d get a kiss, we’d make a friend, we’d get a raise.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.780
The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.400
before heading out for the day,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.880
that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.780
One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter very much at all.
