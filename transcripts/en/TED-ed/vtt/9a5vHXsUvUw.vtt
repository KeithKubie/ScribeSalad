00:00:13.823 --> 00:00:15.533
Try to measure a circle.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.438
The diameter and radius are easy,

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:18.432
they're just straight lines

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.141
you can measure with a ruler.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.682
But to get the circumference,

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:24.268
you'd need measuring tape
or a piece of string,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.517
unless there was a better way.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.684
Now, it's obvious

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.620
that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.237
along with its diameter,

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.357
but the relationship
goes further than that.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.918
In fact, the ratio between the two,

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.212
the circumference divided by the diameter,

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:41.041
will always be the same number,

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.289
no matter how big
or small the circle gets.

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:46.588
Historians aren't sure when or how

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.300
this number was first discovered,

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:50.131
but it's been known in some form

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.082
for almost 4,000 years.

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.630
Estimates of it appear
in the works of ancient Greek,

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:56.664
Babylonian,

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:57.417
Chinese,

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.384
and Indian mathematicians.

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.313
And it's even believed to have been used

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:03.340
in building the Egyptian pyramids.

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:04.921
Mathematicians estimated it

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.499
by inscribing polygons in circles.

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.147
And by the year 1400,

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:13.375
it had been calculated to as far
as ten decimal places.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.921
So, when did they finally
figure out the exact value

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:17.751
instead of just estimating?

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.010
Actually, never!

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:21.602
You see, the ratio

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.112
of a circle's circumference
to its diameter

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.873
is what's known as an irrational number,

00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:28.374
one that can never be expressed

00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:31.547
as a ratio of two whole numbers.

00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.088
You can come close,

00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:35.616
but no matter how precise the fraction is,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.365
it will always be just a tiny bit off.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.678
So, to write it out in its decimal form,

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.679
you'd have an on-going series of digits

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.660
starting with

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.601
3.14159

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:47.693
and continuing

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:49.421
forever!

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:51.445
That's why, instead of trying to write out

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.728
an infinite number of digits every time,

00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:57.669
we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:59.598
Nowadays, we test the speed of computers

00:01:59.622 --> 00:02:01.615
by having them calculate pi,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.354
and quantum computers have been able

00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:06.827
to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits.

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:08.090
People even compete to see

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:09.795
how many digits they can memorize

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.626
and have set records for remembering

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.130
over 67,000 of them.

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:16.899
But for most scientific uses,

00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:19.719
you only need the first forty or so.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.927
And what are these scientific uses?

00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:25.273
Well, just about any calculations
involving circles,

00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:27.077
from the volume of a can of soda

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.028
to the orbits of satellites.

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.852
And it's not just circles, either.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.244
Because it's also useful
in studying curves,

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:36.823
pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:37.696
like clocks,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.242
electromagnetic waves,

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.950
and even music.

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.199
In statistics, pi is used in the equation

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:46.577
to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve,

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.704
which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:50.222
of standardized test scores,

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.382
financial models,

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:54.422
or margins of error in scientific results.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:55.751
As if that weren't enough,

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.753
pi is used in particle
physics experiments,

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:01.435
such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.207
not only due to its round shape,

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.295
but more subtly,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.565
because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move.

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.725
Scientists have even used pi

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.232
to prove the illusive notion

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.867
that light functions as both a particle

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.201
and an electromagnetic wave,

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.116
and, perhaps most impressively,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.646
to calculate the density
of our entire universe,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.230
which, by the way,

00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:26.413
still has infinitely less stuff in it

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.937
than the total number of digits in pi.
