00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.910
&gt;&gt;Well, good morning or good afternoon depending
on where you are.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.290
We have three of us here from India, Pakistan,
and Bangladesh.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.040
My name is Rahul Bajaj.
I'm a member of Parliament, member of our

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.980
house which is called Lok
Sabha in India.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.320
And Chairman of the Bajaj Group, including
companies like Bajaj Auto

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.570
which manufactures motorcycles.
We are here in Davos, freezing temperatures

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.870
from 5 degrees below to
14 degrees below centigrade.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.809
We three are good friends.
And especially Mr. -- sorry.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.420
Mr. Dawood and I have known each other for
more years than I remember.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.489
Maybe he'll tell you when he speaks.
Maybe 15 years, maybe 20 years.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.920
And we are all from this part of the world.
It's a continent, which India Pakistan and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.300
Bangladesh.
We were one country, we are three countries,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.210
we'll remain three
countries.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.440
But the people of these countries, as far
as I'm concerned and perhaps

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.259
my good friends are concerned, are one.
We're brothers, sisters.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.420
This is what we have been for centuries.
In 62 years, they separate us.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.780
And our strength will come from working together.
Independent people, independent countries,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.020
but working together
economically, politically.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.660
There have been some difference in the past
for various reasons whether

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.404
or not good reasons.
We'll not get into that.

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:27.200
There's no question of who is right, who is
wrong.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.259
We will all like to work together economically,
socially and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.159
politically.
And once we start doing that, I hope and I

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.740
believe that my friends also
hope that, I think there's no power which

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.410
can prevent South Asia --
We don't want to be become a military power,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.369
no.
But an economic power, a humane economic power.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.760
We will have courts with social justice.
We will have growth, what you call inclusive

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.590
growht so this poverty,
the immense poverty in our three countries

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.719
would be substantially
reduced, if not eliminated.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.310
And we will be proud to be Indians, Pakistanis,
and Bangladeshis.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.970
But we will hold our heads still further high
 -- not out of arrogance,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.069
but out of pride, and say we are Indians,
we are Bangladeshis, we are

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.530
Pakistanis.
And the world will slowly starting respecting

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.290
us during the last few
years, really stand up -- not salute us.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.450
But say hi, how are you?
And soon it is to come from that people from

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.690
the West, from the
developed world would like to come and work

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.840
in India and even settle
down and retire in India.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.720
To all of you, and my thanks to all you of
for listening to us.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.200
Thank you very much.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.370
&gt;&gt; You have heard my friend Rahul Bajaj speak.
This is my turn, my name is Fazle H. Abed.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.200
I have been working in rural development in
Bangladesh for 38 years,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.020
working in education, health, rural development,
and poverty

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.140
elimination.
And over the last 7 or 8 years, I've been

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.870
working in Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Southern

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.940
Sudan, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.120
Because I think the way of getting people
out of poverty, we have done

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.599
some good effective work in Bangladesh.
And some of it could be replicated in other

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.470
countries.
Not only in South Asia but also we can contribute

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.750
to Africa.
So I think that whatever we know, we want

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.890
to share with others.
And Africa, not being very fortunate in their

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.530
leadership and lacking in
institutions, we can help them in providing

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.239
institutions so that they
can also come out of poverty.

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.629
Because there is a -- there are a lot of energetic
people, very

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.860
entrepreneurial people in Africa too.
And we are trying to help them.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.390
And my next job is going to be working in
Haiti to reforestate it, to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.409
start a bank which will provide financial
services to small and medium

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.610
enterprises.
So I hope that all of us from South Asia will

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.659
be proud to be able to do
something for less fortunate people in Africa

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:30.759
and in Haiti.
So I hope that we can [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.220
&gt;&gt;My name is Hussain Dawood.
I'm Chairman of the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.470
Fund, Chairman of the
[INAUDIBLE] Business Initiative and Chairman

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.750
of [INAUDIBLE] Corporation
and [INAUDIBLE] Limited.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.800
And also the Dawood Foundation.
It's my privilege to address you today.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.910
And we have had an opportunity here to explore
the viewpoints that have

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.630
been expressed, and I would like to say that
we too would like to say

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.130
that we too would like to be partners in development
of our

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.110
subcontinent.
And what we're trying to do is to develop

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.930
the education standards
within Pakistan, so that based on that we're

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.770
able to address some of
the critical issues which our country faces,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.280
which is particularly the
difficulty we are having today in acts of

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.110
terrorists.
We, I believe firmly that the solution to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.910
that lies in education.
We need a long-term solution and education

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.130
is that long-term solution.
And for that reason we are establishing [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.850
a which hopefully
with produce responsible entrepreneurs who

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.139
will come back into society
and try to develop and contribute towards

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.190
the realization of that
vision.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.260
Thank you so much for giving me the option
to say a few words.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.260
