00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.653
(light instrumental music)

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.391
- [Voiceover] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.891
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.676
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:25.093
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.255
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.338
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:34.905
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.483
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:39.566
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.055
We shape the future

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:45.555
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:50.118
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:52.901
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.568
and how we got here.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.016
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.099
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:17.985
(electronic music)

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.167
Summarizing today would be a task

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.974
I'll leave for someone else,

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:46.891
but I will make a few observations.

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:51.888
Because, in fact, there
is some communality.

00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:55.623
I hope you're feeling a little
bit of communality here.

00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:59.769
And one of the questions that
has been driving this field,

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.303
this sort of cell and molecular field,

00:02:02.303 --> 00:02:04.220
but also, convergently,

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:07.221
human evolution in general

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.273
is this expansion of the brain.

00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:11.447
And quite remarkably,

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:14.697
I think we are beginning to have models

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:19.973
and an understanding
of how that can happen.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.415
In this field that is emerging

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.552
of cellular and molecular anthropology

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:27.538
is gonna be the driver that allows us

00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:29.672
to get the tools to do that.

00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:31.672
Now, there's a couple ways

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.680
that we're learning that, you've heard.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.478
One is through a very detailed
cellular understanding.

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:41.691
And while these two speakers,

00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:43.854
Wieland and Arnold,

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:46.843
talked about it seemingly
with different terminology,

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:49.675
really very much the
same story is emerging,

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:51.575
that we have these apical

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.492
or the inner stem cells

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:56.014
and the outer stem cells.

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:57.726
And it's really that outer population

00:02:57.726 --> 00:02:59.130
that's the expanding population.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.244
This is a real discovery.

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.626
This is a real understanding

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:05.512
that allows us to really put some details

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:07.095
to what's going on.

00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:11.048
Further, even within that population now,

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:14.721
we know genes that are
driving this proliferation

00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.054
and are remarkably involved.

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.467
I think there's, obviously,
much more to be learned,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.909
and Frank, certainly,

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.420
in this whole field of brain evolution,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.567
people wonder whether there
is certain area of the brain

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.289
expands because it's needed

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.638
and you get more complexity.

00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:35.047
Or does the whole brain expand

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.388
and then different areas get connected

00:03:37.388 --> 00:03:40.456
and show the specificity once
the expansion has occurred.

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.428
I don't think we really
know the answer to that,

00:03:42.428 --> 00:03:45.261
but certainly Frank showed us how,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.311
in addition to the features
of the expanded brain,

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.224
the connectivity is really a feature

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:53.722
in the identification of
molecules that are important

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:55.680
or genes that are important for that.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.097
And the nature of that change is crucial.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.979
With this idea of how does this happen,

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.062
what are the drivers that
are making this happen,

00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:16.263
again, an amazing communality here,

00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:18.081
thinking about duplication

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.380
and the genes that are
associated with that duplication

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.416
at least being part of the story

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.333
with regards to what is

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.913
responsible for this happening.

00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:30.832
And even the timing of this is,

00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:32.999
I think, quite remarkable.

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:37.926
I think the final link in this, for me

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:39.926
is the actual phenotype.

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:44.147
How are these morphological features

00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:48.305
relating to the identity
of the unique features

00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:51.663
of what it means to be a human.

00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:55.750
This is where, probably,
what we've learned today,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.208
at least, and we're learning a lot more,

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.375
is the risks that we face.

00:05:00.688 --> 00:05:03.045
The expansion of the brain

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:05.989
and becoming human is not
just the wonderful aspects

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.846
of our ability to do things
that other species can't,

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.056
but also the dangers.

00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:14.635
And so we hear glioblastomas,
we hear about autism,

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:18.051
we hear the other risks of expanded brain.

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:20.423
But also the other side of this story,

00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:23.558
we've heard about this
in our meetings before,

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:26.554
are synesthesia and other features

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:28.049
that are unique to human

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:29.741
that are out there that
are also a consequence

00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.062
of the expanded genome.

00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:33.121
So while we have,

00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.454
and I am missing, obviously,

00:05:36.845 --> 00:05:39.773
a lot of the key features
of what's going on.

00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:42.674
One thing I will end with is

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:45.424
we've talked about this right now

00:05:46.322 --> 00:05:47.830
are looking at the common features

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.682
that are driving who we are

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.143
or human evolution,

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.520
and a feature that we
have to sort of consider,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.437
and we heard it from
Joanna and also from Evan,

00:06:00.002 --> 00:06:04.028
is this diversity that's a key feature.

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.442
I think that's gonna be
sort of a common theme

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:07.833
as we get larger samples,

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.149
we get larger model systems,

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.966
will play into that

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.540
and try to understand the
importance of diversity,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.265
which we haven't had a
chance to really talk about

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:17.564
why we need diversity in a population

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:20.489
for the sustaining evolution

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:23.393
but also sustaining population.

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:25.393
So, that's my attempt at

00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:29.668
providing for you a
little bit of a structure

00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:31.427
to what we've obtained.

00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:35.309
And I admit to it being underestimated.

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:36.695
Now, we do have some questions,

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:39.782
and I'd like to end the talk

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:43.776
picking out just a few things
that allow the speakers

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:46.202
to elaborate on a few points,

00:06:46.202 --> 00:06:49.717
and some of it hopefully they'll...

00:06:49.717 --> 00:06:51.755
I'll start with this one nice statement

00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:54.586
from one of the audience saying,

00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:57.092
"All of you have created
fabulous modern art,

00:06:57.092 --> 00:06:59.444
"certainly on par with Frank Stella.

00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:03.145
"When and where is your first
art exhibition going to be?"

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:04.628
(laughter)

00:07:04.628 --> 00:07:06.385
There are actually some texts out there,

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.552
but I think an art exhibit

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.000
of scientific art would be a fun thing,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.833
and maybe we should think about

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.069
doing that here in San Diego.

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:16.016
Collecting art and having an installation

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:18.039
of some sort about science.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.466
You've been thinking about that already?

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.696
Okay, good, good.

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:25.379
A couple questions, one I'll take

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.077
because it addresses two people,

00:07:28.077 --> 00:07:30.744
and it's a reasonably sharp one.

00:07:31.856 --> 00:07:35.638
"When ORGs and BRG clones become neurons,"

00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:38.266
and this is actually for
Wieland and for Arnold,

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:41.029
"Do we know how they
decide which layer to go to

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.613
"or how they get there
since they can't necessarily

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:47.560
"follow the glial precursors
or the glial patterns?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.170
"If not, is there any other way

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.969
"or working hypothesis how that happens?"

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.044
So, you wanna come up,

00:07:55.044 --> 00:07:57.794
Wieland and/or Arnold?

00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:02.587
Let's see how similar their responses are.

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:05.257
You can rephrase it anyway you want.

00:08:05.257 --> 00:08:07.424
- Sure, just to clarify a little bit.

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:08.611
The neurons, do, indeed,

00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:10.668
migrate along a glial scaffold.

00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:13.905
The deeper cortical
layers appear in humans,

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:15.310
and probably other primates,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.351
to migrate along those
ventricular radial glia,

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:20.000
very much like Pasko's
model from 30 years ago.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.656
Or, for example, how it
happens in the mouse.

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.648
Those neurons that are
born in the second half,

00:08:24.648 --> 00:08:26.309
which are the upper
cortical layer neurons,

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:30.248
they actually, generally, hop
from one fiber to another.

00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:32.139
This is actually something
that Pasko reported

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:34.023
in EM images,

00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:35.368
electron microscopic images

00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:37.589
that he made about 30 years ago,

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.345
where he showed the leading fiber

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:41.673
of the neuron, actually,

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:44.033
moving over another fiber

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:45.123
a little distance away,

00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:46.310
while the trailing process

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.408
remained on the original fiber.

00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:49.863
So, the notion that neurons

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.783
can actually hop from fiber to fiber,

00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:53.891
is something that Pasko was aware of.

00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.785
We think that has to
happen at the later stages

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.714
more than the early stages.

00:08:57.714 --> 00:08:58.792
Which has a few predictions.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:00.534
One of them is that there
may be more dispersion

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:02.389
among clonally related cells

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:03.853
in the upper cortical layers

00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:06.264
and the deeper cortical layers.

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:08.354
And the other feature I didn't emphasize,

00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:10.189
is that it's been known by work

00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:12.795
from Henry Kennedy and Colette DeHay

00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:15.252
that the upper cortical layers of primates

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:17.475
have a higher density of pyramidal neurons

00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:19.329
than in other species.

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:22.138
And that's thought to be a super granular

00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:24.741
feature that's primate specific.

00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:27.153
And that discontinuous
glial scaffold I showed you,

00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:29.729
I think, leads into maybe an explanation

00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:31.511
for how that happened.

00:09:31.511 --> 00:09:33.049
So, I think that is a difference between

00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:34.706
primates, at least, and other species,

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:36.323
having to do with the way that neurons

00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:38.573
get to their final targets.

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:46.206
- I can only 100% agree
with what Arnold said.

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:48.140
And maybe one small addition.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.025
Which is that unpublished work suggests

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:53.446
that the extracellular matrix,

00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:55.912
makes fibrils in particular
in the cortical plate,

00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:57.250
and that may also contribute

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.555
to this hopping that Arnold

00:09:58.555 --> 00:09:59.972
was referring to.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:02.932
- Okay. Thank you guys.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:10.127
- There's another question for Dr. Livesey

00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:12.127
on "Is there significant

00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:16.522
"human variation in
total number of neurons

00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:18.355
"between individuals?"

00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:22.567
- There's a famous comedy
television show in the UK,

00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:24.291
which has comedians running
up to the microphone

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.409
in response to quick questions.

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:26.466
This feels a bit like that.

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:28.843
Anyway, the short answer is no.

00:10:28.843 --> 00:10:30.148
But this is true of you.

00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:32.274
If you look across any species, humans,

00:10:32.274 --> 00:10:34.448
although we go on and on about difference,

00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:35.718
we're all actually very similar.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.104
The same way that most mice,

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:38.256
we fall within a range.

00:10:38.256 --> 00:10:39.636
It's when you drop out of that range,

00:10:39.636 --> 00:10:41.081
that's when you get into pathology,

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:43.895
like things like micro (inaudible).

00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:46.093
- About, "Could Zika virus be

00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:48.510
"used to treat glioblastoma?"

00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:51.527
- The short answer is yes.

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:52.909
There are two recent papers

00:10:52.909 --> 00:10:54.379
that actually make that point.

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:56.052
One from a group in the UK,

00:10:56.052 --> 00:10:57.576
another from the US,

00:10:57.576 --> 00:10:58.636
showing that Zika virus

00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.600
actually does infect progenitor cells,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.100
or tumor initiating cells in glioblastoma.

00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:06.251
And can destroy them similar

00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.565
to the way it destroys progenitor cells

00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:11.148
in the developing human cortex.

00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:14.247
The potential,

00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:15.296
there are several problems with that,

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:17.037
or complications.

00:11:17.037 --> 00:11:17.870
One of them is,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.703
that our work and others,

00:11:18.703 --> 00:11:21.507
seems to suggest that
astrocytes in adult brain

00:11:21.507 --> 00:11:23.531
are extremely susceptible
to viral infection

00:11:23.531 --> 00:11:25.484
with the Zika Virus.

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:28.225
So, although you deliver the
virus directly to the tumor,

00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:30.427
you might be able to get rid of

00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:32.836
preponderance of some of the tumor cells,

00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:33.669
the risk would be that

00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:35.343
you'd also be able to get rid of

00:11:35.343 --> 00:11:37.066
quite a number of your normal astrocytes.

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:38.766
So, I'm not sure that's gonna be

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:39.893
a therapeutic approach,

00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:41.162
but, indeed,

00:11:41.162 --> 00:11:43.448
the virus it has a tropism for those

00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:44.925
cancer initiating cells,

00:11:44.925 --> 00:11:46.444
just like it does

00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:50.444
in the fetally derived
progenitor cells as well.

00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:57.192
- So, Joanna, "Can
genetic analysis predict

00:11:58.035 --> 00:12:01.410
"how much of the Neanderthal genome

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.993
"each of one of us is carrying?

00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:08.036
"Or how would you do that?"

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:10.673
- So, from genetic analysis, clearly,

00:12:10.673 --> 00:12:14.115
we can look at and predict how much

00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:16.611
of Neanderthal genome is
in each of our genomes.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.278
But the question is,

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:20.615
I think also interesting,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.535
can we predict how much of our looks

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:27.505
are due to (laughs) that interbreeding.

00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:29.232
So I think we are getting interested

00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:31.139
in that question.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:32.520
Since we're all walking around

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.319
with Neanderthal introgressions.

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:35.704
And could we all look

00:12:35.704 --> 00:12:37.600
at the impact of those introgression

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.433
on facial morphology, for example.

00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:44.449
And, try to, essentially

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:45.965
make the connection, again,

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.096
between the genome and the phenotype.

00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:51.843
So we are interested in
that question, very much.

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:53.378
- Thanks.

00:12:53.378 --> 00:12:57.088
Well, I'll end on this one, for Evan.

00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.725
"Are the syndromic
conditions you've mentioned,

00:12:59.725 --> 00:13:03.892
"dependent or independent on
consanguineous marriages."

00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:10.207
You can take any direction
you want to go with.

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:11.533
- So the answer is no.

00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:13.124
So, a consanguineous marriages are ones

00:13:13.124 --> 00:13:15.173
where you require
inbreeding to, essentially,

00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:17.096
result in a genetic disease.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.237
And because these mutations are happening,

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:21.721
as you guys are sitting
here making sperm and egg,

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:25.021
well some of you are making sperm and egg,

00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:26.287
they're happening all the time,

00:13:26.287 --> 00:13:28.195
simply as a consequence
of our architecture.

00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:30.153
So, all those kids that I showed,

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:32.482
they effectively have one normal copy,

00:13:32.482 --> 00:13:34.402
and one deleted copy.

00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:36.655
And in most cases, they're
not inheriting them,

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:38.681
they're just spontaneous big mutations

00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:41.969
that are happening in very
hot regions of our genome

00:13:41.969 --> 00:13:44.789
because of the duplication architecture.

00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:46.741
- So that brings us to the conclusion

00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:47.574
of this symposium.

00:13:47.574 --> 00:13:49.611
I'd like to thank all the speakers

00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:51.299
for an incredible journey

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:53.040
into the complex world

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.437
of the genetic architecture,

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:57.970
and cellular events that
lead to these things

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.179
between our ears,

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:01.117
that allow us to

00:14:01.117 --> 00:14:03.255
try to understand what's happening.

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:04.994
I thank you all for the questions,

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:06.888
and for still being with us here.

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.342
And I hope everybody online

00:14:08.342 --> 00:14:11.268
who followed the
symposium also enjoyed it.

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:14.055
Remember, you can catch these symposia

00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:15.110
in about two months,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.675
they will be edited and available

00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:17.828
to be viewed and shared

00:14:17.828 --> 00:14:20.660
with people you think might
be interested in them.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.518
Thank you very much,

00:14:21.518 --> 00:14:22.944
thank all the speakers and the audience.

00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:23.777
(audience applause)

00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:27.610
(dramatic instrumental music)
