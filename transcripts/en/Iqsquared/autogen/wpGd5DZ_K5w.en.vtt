00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.559
then so I'll just very briefly state
them in that I hope will set us up for a

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569
them in that I hope will set us up for a
 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.830
them in that I hope will set us up for a
discussion the first is that we have I'd

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840
discussion the first is that we have I'd

resilience yes this is the most

00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800
resilience yes this is the most
 

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.110
resilience yes this is the most
important concept in the book and so

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120
important concept in the book and so
 

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.820

groups those spaces actually because the
 

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:31.050
groups those spaces actually because the
unit's because this university generally

is so is so problematic having no spaces

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:33.700
is so is so problematic having no spaces
 

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.550
is so is so problematic having no spaces
of safety in that space of where you can

01:20:34.859 --> 01:20:34.869
trigger warning as like a cosseting
 

01:20:34.869 --> 01:20:36.569

trigger warnings used yes I'm gonna I'm

01:21:11.429 --> 01:21:11.439
trigger warnings used yes I'm gonna I'm
 

01:21:11.439 --> 01:21:14.129
trigger warnings used yes I'm gonna I'm
gonna bring Jonathan in and to end with

01:21:14.129 --> 01:21:14.139
gonna bring Jonathan in and to end with
 

01:21:14.139 --> 01:21:16.709
gonna bring Jonathan in and to end with
him is there anyone here who has a

Chris hello hi so I'm a student at

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800
Chris hello hi so I'm a student at

Chris hello hi so I'm a student at
statistics and last week we learned

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840
statistics and last week we learned
 

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.619
statistics and last week we learned
about spurious correlation and as a

01:21:46.619 --> 01:21:46.629
about spurious correlation and as a
 

01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:49.109
about spurious correlation and as a
social scientist no doubt you've do you

01:21:49.109 --> 01:21:49.119
social scientist no doubt you've do you
 

01:21:49.119 --> 01:21:51.600
social scientist no doubt you've do you
also use statistics when you've in your

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:51.610
also use statistics when you've in your
 

01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:55.259
also use statistics when you've in your
papers and so these phenomenon of the

01:21:55.259 --> 01:21:55.269
papers and so these phenomenon of the
 

01:21:55.269 --> 01:21:57.060
papers and so these phenomenon of the
rise of overprotection

01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:57.070
rise of overprotection
 

01:21:57.070 --> 01:22:00.540
rise of overprotection
and the rise of psychological problems

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:00.550
and the rise of psychological problems
 

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:01.339
and the rise of psychological problems
in young

01:22:01.339 --> 01:22:01.349
in young
 

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:04.169

what is a statistic of significance that

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:04.179
what is a statistic of significance that
 

01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:07.140
what is a statistic of significance that
leads you to conclude the causality

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:07.150
leads you to conclude the causality
 

01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:09.870
leads you to conclude the causality
between these two phenomenons like other

than just correlation so on that

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:14.530

question we are very careful you're
 

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.649
question we are very careful you're
right that most most studies of human

01:22:19.649 --> 01:22:19.659
right that most most studies of human
 

01:22:19.659 --> 01:22:22.200

experimentally so it is correlational so

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880
experimentally so it is correlational so
 

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.979
experimentally so it is correlational so
in the book we're very careful about

in the book we're very careful about
 

01:22:25.989 --> 01:22:28.350
in the book we're very careful about
that we draw on research that at least

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360
that we draw on research that at least

that we draw on research that at least
tries to look at time lag so if

01:22:30.569 --> 01:22:30.579
tries to look at time lag so if
 

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:32.700

broader question of the question we were
 

01:22:56.290 --> 01:22:57.540
broader question of the question we were
here to address which one of the

90 minutes together what do you think do
 

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.229
90 minutes together what do you think do
you think that freeze that trigger

helping them you've heard two people say
 

01:23:10.659 --> 01:23:13.379
helping them you've heard two people say
that they're generally helpful and at

01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:13.389
that they're generally helpful and at
 

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:14.729
that they're generally helpful and at
least we're generally on the side that

talked to a lot of clinical

01:23:20.069 --> 01:23:20.079
talked to a lot of clinical
 

01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:21.899
talked to a lot of clinical
psychologists about trigger warnings

01:23:21.899 --> 01:23:21.909
psychologists about trigger warnings
 

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:22.890
psychologists about trigger warnings
you're absolutely right

01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:22.900
you're absolutely right
 

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.450
you're absolutely right
that they're very rare they're not used

01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:24.460
that they're very rare they're not used
 

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.370

in the future but you're right they have
not been common on campus yet but it's

01:23:36.299 --> 01:23:36.309
not been common on campus yet but it's
 

01:23:36.309 --> 01:23:37.919
not been common on campus yet but it's
an empirical question whether they help

that is an empirical question to be
