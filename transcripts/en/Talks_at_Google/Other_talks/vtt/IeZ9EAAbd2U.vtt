ADAM ALTER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.650
Thank you for having me.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm very, very happy
to be here today.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.080
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to talk a little bit

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.190
about the book and some
of the research that I

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.110
discuss in the book.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.040
I'm going to sample a little
bit from each of the three

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.360
sections in the book.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.340
And then I'm going to leave
plenty of time for questions.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.560
So if you have any questions,
you can store them up.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.230
If they're burning questions and
you have to get them out,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.530
and you think that they will
clarify what I'm saying, I'm

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.880
also happy to take questions
earlier on before

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.560
the end of the talk.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.565
So I'm pretty flexible
from teaching.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.720
I'll take them whenever
they come.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.870
So the title of the book is
obviously a bit opaque if you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.630
don't know what drunk
tank pink is.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.130
So I'm going to explain what the
title means in a minute.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.760
But I want to start first by
talking about the subtitle,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.860
the bit after the "Drunk Tank
Pink." It's "Unexpected Forces

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.790
that Shape How We Think,
Feel, and Behave."

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.990
So, the basic idea here is
that there are lots of

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.840
metaphors for the human mind.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.540
I'm just going to use this
one for the moment.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.660
And, the way we often think
about the mind is there's a

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.440
small part of it, just as with
an iceberg, that it is above

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.770
the surface of conscious
awareness.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.020
And we have pretty good access
to that part of it.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.870
When someone asks you a question
and you respond, that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.430
response obviously is
a direct reply to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.990
whatever they asked you.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.550
That is all above the surface
of conscious awareness.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.220
But there's a ton of stuff going
on below the surface.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.580
And this book is about that
stuff below the surface.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.610
So I'm interested in focusing
on that huge chunk of the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.620
iceberg below the surface of
conscious awareness, the stuff

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.830
that we don't have access to
via direct introspection.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
And that's what this
book is about.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.990
So what I've tried to do in the
book is I try to say here

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870
is this edifice of iceberg.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.380
How can we populate it
with information?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.270
What is actually making our
minds what they are and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.440
forming our decisions and our
thoughts and our actions?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.620
And how can we say this little
chunk of the iceberg, what's

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.300
causing that?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.830
It's these things.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.620
And so I'm trying to explain
what that iceberg is.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.180
And I go through in the book a
whole lot of different forces

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.895
that are shaping us that
make the iceberg what

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:07.540
it happens to be.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.680
So just to move away from that
metaphor, I'm going to tell

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.310
you now more about the title.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.620
Drunk tank pink is
actually a color.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.280
And it's this very bright bubble
gum, Pepto Bismol,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.410
amoxicillin color that reminds
people of their childhoods

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.560
when they were taking
horrible medication.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.770
And the origin of
the color is--

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.190
it's about now 40 years old
since it was first identified.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.560
There were two researchers
in Canada.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.470
And they were very curious about
how they could improve

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.390
behavior in classrooms,
reduce truancy rates.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.530
And so what they did
was they went to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.440
classrooms all around Canada.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.650
And they started to paint those

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.260
classrooms different colors.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.660
And it was an exercise
in exploration.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.990
They weren't really sure which
colors would be most effective

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.380
and which ones would perhaps
be less effective.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500
They had lay theories about
which ones would work and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.600
which ones wouldn't.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560
And so they painted different
classrooms different colors.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.650
And they measured the effects
on the students.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.420
Were they better behaved?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.270
Were they smarter?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.590
Did they seem to give better
contributions?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.810
It was reasonably
unscientific.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.920
It wasn't done with a very,
very careful hand.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.810
But I think it was a useful
enterprise because it started

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.030
a new movement.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.510
And what they found was that
blue is pretty good sometimes.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.880
It pacified people a little.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.840
It reminded the kids of
the sky and the ocean.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.170
Green reminded them of nature.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.220
Yellow made them a little
bit more vibrant.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.970
It's hard to know exactly
whether all that stuff is

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.840
true, whether the researchers
expected to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.240
see that in the students.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.060
But one thing they found that
they were pretty certain of

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.810
was that this color pink
lulled the students and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.610
pacified them.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.170
And they were much
better behaved.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.540
They were more quiet, a little
bit more thoughtful.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.420
And so they became more curious
about this color pink.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.650
And instead of investigating all
the colors further, they

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.430
thought, let's try to do a
more careful scientific

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.120
exploration of what this color
pink does to people.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.530
And so in one of the
experiments, a researcher,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.210
Alex Schauss, wanted to see
whether he could make strong,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.510
adult males weaker, pacify them
with this color pink,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.260
simply by using a color.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.920
So what we did was he ran an
experiment with this tool,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.180
which is called a handgrip
dynamometer.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.620
It sounds like a tool
of Scientology.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.339
But it's simply a device that
measures how hard you grip

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.600
with your hand.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.170
And so what he did was
he had a group of 153

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.950
healthy male subjects.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.300
They walked into the room.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.370
And he held up the piece of
cardboard in front of them.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.760
And half of them saw the blue
cardboard first, half saw the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.210
pink cardboard first.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.110
But what he did was he said to
them, I want you to stare at

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.380
this cardboard for a minute.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.000
And they stood staring
at the cardboard.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.910
And then he said, I want you
to grip this dynamometer as

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.400
hard as you can.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.450
And he measured how much force
they could exert with their

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.350
hands after staring at
the pink cardboard.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.360
And then after doing that they
did it again, this time with

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.270
the blue cardboard.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.430
And you can see why he needed
to counterbalance which one

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.920
they saw first because you're
obviously generally weaker

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.870
after doing it once.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.740
And the results were
pretty striking.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.276
So what he found was that of
the 153, 151 of them, or

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:05.000
98.7%, were stronger after
looking at the blue cardboard

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.260
rather than the pink cardboard,
which is a pretty

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.340
striking result.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.410
All they're doing is staring
at a piece of cardboard.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.390
And we're constantly exposed
to a world of color.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.100
And this suggests that with
the right color, you can

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.320
engineer behavior, or at least
tweak behavior in certain

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.500
directions.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.870
And so this was a
striking effect.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.230
And he took this effect
on the road.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.670
And he started to
talk about it.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.480
It gained currency.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.820
He was on American talk shows.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.800
And one of the things he found
was that people in the prison

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.020
industry-- not industry--

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.660
the prison guards were very
interested in this effect.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.650
So one of the things they were
very curious about was how

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.380
they could pacify
the prisoners.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.180
And so he came across two people
who were working at a

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.040
naval prison in Seattle named
Baker and Miller, and that's

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.980
where the color's other name,
Baker-Miller Pink, comes from.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.960
And what they did was they
painted the inside of one of

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.800
their drunk tanks, which is
where the name comes from,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.090
this bright pink color.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.790
And they reported that over
the following nine months,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.240
there was not a single person
who emerged from that chamber

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.260
still aggressive, even though
when they threw them in there,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.410
they were aggressive.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.090
And so putting them in this
drunk tank pink colored cell

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.740
for 15 minutes, they argued,
completely pacified them.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.630
And it also gained currency
in other arenas.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.890
So one other thing that happened
was coaches at a

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.470
number of football teams at a
number of colleges decided

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.280
that they would paint
the visiting

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.950
locker rooms this color.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.210
And so you can obviously
understand

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.920
what they were thinking.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.430
The reasoning was that by
painting the visiting locker

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.780
rooms this color, you would
pacify your opponents.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.850
And at halftime, they
would sit in there.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.760
They would have gone in ready
for the next half.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.260
They will come out, obviously,
a lot weaker.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.300
And that's how the
theory went.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.800
The NCAA wasn't impressed.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.510
And they mandated for a little
while that you had to paint

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.760
both locker rooms
the same color.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.160
And so they had to paint
these white.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.860
But, it turns out that the
University of Iowa still has

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.870
one locker room that's
painted this color.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.060
You can see it's not
just the paint.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.060
It's the color of everything--
the lockers, the

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.010
urinals, the carpets.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.600
So this is the origin
of drunk tank pink.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.450
And it's the opening anecdote
that I discuss in the book.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.700
And the whole book is
about these cues.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.170
So color is just one of the
nine cues that I talk

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.140
about in the book.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.630
I'm going to touch on a few
others here today just to give

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.090
you a sense of what populates
the book and what I think

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.200
populates that range of forces
that shape how we think, feel,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.070
and behave.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.150
I'm going to talk about them
in three different ways.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.460
The first is the stuff that just
resides inside our heads,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.540
the information in our
heads that shapes us.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.180
I call this the world
inside us.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.370
The next thing I'm going to
talk about is the world

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.920
between us.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.350
So, the fact that we're a social
species is actually

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.450
very important for all
sorts of behaviors.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.620
And I'm going to talk about how
the interactions we have

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.000
with other people influence
our behaviors.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.610
And then at the end, this is
where color would come in.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.210
I'm going to talk about the
physical world, or the

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.340
world around us.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.360
You can see these cues get
broader and broader and

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.770
broader as we go out from
the narrow ones, the

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.950
world inside us.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.740
So starting with the world
inside us, I'll talk a little

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.900
bit about the effect of names.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.760
And, in the world of cognitive
psychology and social

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.270
psychology, some experiments
have been done to look at how

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.620
we feel about different letters
of the alphabet.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.410
And it turns out that if I ask
all of you to look at this

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.630
array of letters, just think
about whether you have some

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.530
favorite letters there.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.470
It's not a question you're
asked very often.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.470
There's not a lot of content in
letters for you to latch on

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.910
to so that you feel that you
like one more than the other.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.980
Maybe you like one shape
more than the other.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.890
But one fairly robust piece of
evidence suggests that we are

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.650
50% more likely to circle the
letters that are associated

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.270
with our names, especially
the first letter.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.830
So me, as Adam Alter, I'm very
likely to circle A. And I do

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.720
feel a strange kinship
with the letter A.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.420
And this is true across a whole
lot of the different

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.940
countries and languages
and alphabets.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.540
It doesn't just have to be done
with the English alphabet

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.660
or the English language.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.490
And it's been shown pretty
robustly across a whole lot of

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.870
different alphabets
and groups.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.550
But of course, we do more
than just name people.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.900
We also name things
like hurricanes.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.990
So if you look at these two
images here, these are

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.860
Hurricane Katrina and Rita from
the very devastating 2005

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.310
Atlantic hurricane season.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.220
And the way we identify
hurricanes as a matter of

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.090
convenience is we go down the
alphabet and we pick different

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.050
names for them.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.600
And what we used to do before
this, before the 1950s when

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.850
the Weather Service got
involved, we used to just say

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.350
this is hurricane latitude
this, longitude that.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.890
And it was very hard to
keep track of them.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.130
And so we now use these names
as a matter of convenience.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.670
And, one of the questions in
this book that I ask is, does

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.010
it matter what we name
these hurricanes?

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.100
Based on the fact that we know
that people are attracted to

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.870
their initials, does
that matter?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.220
So another way of putting this
is, if you had two hurricane

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.180
relief teams that you were
putting together made up of

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.740
celebrities, would it matter
whether the green group was

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.970
the team that was trying to
raise funds after Katrina or

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.760
after Rita?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.390
Or whether you chose the blue
group to raise for one or the

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.070
other, should that matter?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.440
And if you look at these
celebrities, if you think

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.190
about them, can anyone notice a
difference or something that

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.320
marks the green team as one
group and the blue team as

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.020
another group?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.990
K versus R names, which is
especially true for Kevin

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.310
Kline and Ryan Reynolds.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.740
So all the people in
the blue group

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.060
happened to have R names.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.720
And all the people in the green
group have K names.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.900
And it turns out that this
actually does matter.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.390
So there's some pretty good
evidence that after Hurricane

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.150
Katrina, people whose names
began with K donated about 2.5

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.230
times more to that charity than
they did to any other

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.700
charities that weren't
K related.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.630
And the same for Rita.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.530
In fact, it was an even
stronger effect--

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.670
3.6 times more to Hurricane
Rita relief than to non-R

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.300
hurricane relief.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.605
Now, we should be able
to use that.

00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:58.980
That implies all sorts of
interesting things.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.890
One thing it implies is that
we should consult the

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.430
demographic makeup, or the
name makeup in the US, to

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.150
decide how to name
our hurricanes.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.910
We shouldn't be doing
this randomly.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.260
So if you look at the way names
are distributed in the

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.280
population of the US now, what
you find is that some letters

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.060
are more represented
than others.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.270
So there are many more J names
and M names and A names and R

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.290
names than there are O names
or V names or Y names.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.430
And so that suggests that we
should perhaps be naming our

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.750
hurricanes a little
bit differently.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.310
And I'll explain why that is.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.340
The other thing we could do is
perhaps take some letters out

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.060
of our loop.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.550
And instead of naming hurricanes
Oscar, Olga, and

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.840
Omar as we do every few
years-- these are from

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.500
different hurricane lists that
cycle through each year--

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.740
perhaps we should leave the
letter O out altogether.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.340
And if you look at this year,
this is the list of hurricane

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.740
names that we'll be going
through, from Andrea to Barry

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.680
to Chantal.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.550
You can see it's 20 different
names picked from the

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.090
different letters
of the alphabet.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.070
And that's going to be true
for all the other years.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.460
We have six different lists
that we cycle through.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.040
And if you focus on this list
this year, let's try and work

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.940
out whether this is
an optimal list.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.230
Is this how we should
be naming our

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.450
hurricanes this year?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.000
If people identify with their
initials, perhaps they also

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.580
identify with their names.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.560
And so the same principle
should work.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.620
And so if we look at these names
and do the same thing,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.190
we look at how common these
names are in the population--

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.200
I'm representing the commonness
of these names by

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.240
how large the font is.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.730
So Karen and Melissa and Jerry
are quite common as names go.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.110
Andrea is pretty common.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.980
But a lot of the other names
here are completely

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.320
underrepresented.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.600
So if people are going to
donate more to hurricane

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.660
relief charities when the
hurricane happens to share

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.540
their name or their initial,
than perhaps we're not doing

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.820
this as well as we could.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.680
And you could optimize
this better.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.880
So one thing you could do, I've
now changed the scale of

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.610
that slide.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.430
This is on the same scale as
this newly rescaled slide.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.360
These names are the best names
we could pick for each letter,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.610
the most common names with
each letter in the US

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.630
population.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.480
So if what we're trying to do
is maximize the number of

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.120
people who see these names and
think something, it drives

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.400
into to give a little bit more,
we could be doing much

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.110
better than the names that you
have on this current list.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.950
We could take these names,
and we would tap into the

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.460
sentiments of many, many more
people in the American

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.920
population.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.820
And in fact, if you look across
the last 12 or 13 years

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.430
at the 27 most damaging
hurricanes and how much relief

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.680
they attracted, what you find
is that the actual donations

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.180
were around $10 billion in
the relief aid funds.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.950
If you remove this name-letter
effect-- this tendency for

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.460
people to be drawn to their
initials and to give more--

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.580
had that effect not operated,
people would have only given

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.880
about $9.5 billion.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.260
So we would have had about
$500 million less in aid

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.720
donation than we actually had.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.110
If we'd optimized this and
picked exactly the right

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.266
names, we would have attracted
an extra 7%, or $700 million.

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:03.120
This is a completely cost
free innovation.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.130
It's not even an innovation.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.670
It's just a matter of changing
the names of these hurricanes.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.860
It costs the government
nothing.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.260
The National Weather
Service doesn't pay

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.530
much to change names.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.320
We know that this year the
Weather Channel has started

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.400
naming winter storms.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.820
They've started naming
them terrifying names

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.800
like Nemo and Sandy.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.860
And of course the storms are
devastating, but the names are

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.440
sort of picked reasonably
randomly.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.220
And the suggestion here is that
if you really want people

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.450
to engage with these names, you
should obviously pick the

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.490
names a little more carefully.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.790
So this is just one effect.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.650
The question is, what should
you look for in a name when

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.050
you're picking names?

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.460
This is a slightly different
stream of research, but it's a

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.340
pretty common question.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.680
How should I name
things myself?

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.890
The first factor that's very,
very important is the fluency

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.930
of the name.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.720
How easily can you pronounce
the name?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.890
There's a lot of research
that's been

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.360
done on this question.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.240
So the test we give people to
determine how fluent a name is

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.770
we ask them, imagine that
you're at the Oscars.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.330
You've opened the envelope,
and you're about to

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.560
pronounce this name.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.880
How easy or difficult
is that for you?

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.280
Another way of thinking about
it is that this is known as

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.980
the 191 variants of
Catherine test.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.080
So it turns out there
are a lot of

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.870
variations in the name Catherine.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.530
These are some of them.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.280
And some of them are easier
to pronounce than others.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.040
So we have, for example,
Katrina is

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.790
pretty easy to pronounce.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.420
This is also pronounced Katrina,
but it's not as easy

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.900
to pronounce based on
what you're reading.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.730
This is also Katrina.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.020
Very, very difficult
to pronounce.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.900
And so these are different ways
of writing the same name.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.400
And the argument here is you
could just pick the simplest

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.430
name, and that would be the
best name to go with.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.560
And this actually does matter
in the real world.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.480
This stuff does matter.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.290
And I've run some analyses
looking at law firm

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.150
partnership.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.470
How long does it take people to
rise up the ranks in a law

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.530
firm to become partner?

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.480
And what I'm showing you here
is how long it's been since

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.530
these people graduated
from law school.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.800
And obviously, one of the big
things people want to achieve

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.530
is partnership as quickly as
possible for obvious reasons.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.950
If we separate all the lawyers
in my sample, a number of

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.330
thousands of lawyers, into those
who had disfluent names

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.930
determined by the Oscar test
and those that had fluent

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.530
names determined by the same
test, after three years, none

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.490
of them are partners yet.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.500
None of them were prodigies
to that extent.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.320
But after eight years, you
find there's a gap.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.540
The fluently named lawyers have
become partners slightly

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.220
more quickly.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.280
After 12 years, that
gap persists.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.450
But after 16 years the gap is
closed, which suggests that

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.630
there's no difference
in ultimate ability.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.900
It's not like the disfluently
named lawyers will never

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.620
become partner.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.630
But they become partner much
more quickly when they have

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.790
fluent names.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.270
And so that's what
this suggests.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.120
We control for a whole
lot of factors.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.590
One of the questions people
have is, maybe it's about

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.300
out-groups and foreignness and
ethnicity and stuff like that?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.350
And you can control for that.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.520
So if you get the pictures of
all of these lawyers from the

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.430
web, you can just pick the
people who have Anglo names,

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.430
who are white skinned,
who are male.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.970
So take the absolute in-group,
and you find that the effect

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.290
persists even when you just
look at those groups.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.579
And so these names have serious
implications for

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.560
various real-world behaviors.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.240
Here's another one.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.940
We looked at some financial
stock performance data.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.349
So on this vertical axis here,
you have the expected change

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.290
in price based on the modeling
that we did after just one

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.870
day, when the stock has been
trading for only one day.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.820
And on the x-axis, on the
horizontal, you've got how

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.390
easy it is to read the company's
name, from very,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.370
very easy to very difficult.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.480
I'll give you some examples
of those in a second.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.830
But this is what you can expect
from the data, that if

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.130
you name your stock with a very
easy name, you can expect

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.130
a bump on average of 14%
after just one day.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.120
If you name it with a very hard
name, you can expect the

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.860
price of the stock to
decline by 15%.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.560
And you can see this
continuum.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.950
It's a pretty powerful
effect, just by

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.040
choosing a different name.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.450
And we control for as many
different things as we can to

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.060
isolate this fluency
construct.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.190
And the effect, as you can
see, is pretty powerful.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.060
And here are two examples.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.810
Capital American, that was
one of the easiest

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.600
to pronounce names.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.950
That rose by 17%.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:16.850
And this Hungarian
telecommunications company--

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.840
I'm not going to try
and pronounce it--

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.790
is bust.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.220
It doesn't exist anymore.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.880
It didn't really take in
the American market.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.970
Of course, there are home
biases as well.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.130
We know when we invest in stocks
that we have a strong

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.820
preference for the
home stocks.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.680
We prefer those to the
foreign stocks.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.130
So that's operating as well.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.060
But even if you take out the
Hungarian telecommunications

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.980
company and you just focus on
American stocks, you find the

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.920
same effect for domestic
stocks.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.170
So this fluency construct
really matters.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.080
And it makes people feel better
about these stocks.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.870
We could talk more about the
mechanism if you have

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.830
questions about it, why this
happens, what is the

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.690
psychology behind it.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.730
But people feel better
about these stocks.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.350
They perceive greater value.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.390
And I could talk
more about that

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.940
afterwards, if you're curious.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.310
Another thing to look
for in names is the

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.050
symbolism in the names.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.100
So, this is from a classic
study run in the 1930s.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.210
If I said to you one of these
shapes is a maluma, which one

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.160
do you think is a maluma?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.740
Just call out left or right.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.000
OK.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.720
So almost everyone or everyone
agrees that maluma is the

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.840
curvy shape on the left.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.540
Takete you probably think of
as the shape on the right.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.960
Bouba is the shape
on the left.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.110
Kiki is the shape
on the right.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.470
We have a match in our minds
between the sound that a

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.500
particular word makes and
how that should look.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.380
If I ask you to do it the other
way around, and I said

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.450
draw a bouba for me or a kiki
or takete or a maluma, you

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.450
will draw shapes that
are like this.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.270
I have a friend who named his
child, her middle name is

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.400
Maluma because he wanted people
to see her as warm and

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.130
round and sweet and feminine.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.980
So people actually do
use these effects.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.050
And these also have major
implications as well.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.040
This is something else in
addition to fluency you should

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.210
look for in a name.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.410
So, Takete is seen as a more
masculine name then Maluma.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.640
And there's a hypothesis known
as the Portia hypothesis which

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.850
suggests that--

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.880
Portia was a lawyer in "The
Merchant of Venice" who had to

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.570
dress up as a man so that she
could appear before the court.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.490
And it's very sad that
these effects exist.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.700
But, some researchers looked at
the rise of lawyers to the

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.920
position of judge in
South Carolina.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.480
And they looked at every name
of all the female judges and

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.530
all the people who hadn't
become judge, as well.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.760
And they wanted to look at
whether there was an

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.110
overrepresentation of female
judges with masculine names.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.720
And it turns out there is.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.280
So you can classify every single
name according to how

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.890
masculine or feminine it is.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.650
So if 99% of people with that
name happen to be male, that's

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.260
a very male name, obviously.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.060
And so you have names like Tom
where that's the case and

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.260
Jennifer where that's
the case.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.040
But then you have some names--

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.180
Leslie, Kim--

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.030
where you have, obviously,
people who have that name,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.990
some of them are male and
some of them are female.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.770
And the Portia hypothesis
suggests that people take this

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.030
very seriously when they make
judgments, that even the name

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.480
you choose, the masculinity or
femininity of that name, can

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.710
shape how quickly or whether
you become a judge in the

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.810
legal system.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.240
So there are many more female
judges with male names, or a

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.070
disproportionate
number of them.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.360
This is also true
commercially.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.300
If you look at a lot of
companies-- and actually

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.510
Google falls under
this banner.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.050
I'll explain why in a second.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.300
The ka sound, the hard ka, from
Kellogg's and Coca-Cola

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.480
and Cat and Costco, and the same
explosive sound, the ga

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.230
sound in Google--

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.350
this applies to that sound as
well-- those hard sounds also

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.190
have the same sort of
masculinity as takete, or the

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.370
strength associated
with those names.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.480
And what you find is that if
you look at the top 200

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.350
companies--

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.170
this is an analysis done quite
a while ago-- but if you look

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.340
at the top companies, these are
the companies out of the

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.260
top 200 that have--

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:00.080
so I think it's about 38 of them
have that hard K sound at

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.530
the beginning of their names and
a lot more have that sound

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.770
in their names.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.970
And if you look at all the words
in general, or names in

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.500
general in the English language,
only 7% of all names

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.970
and 4% all words begin
with that sound.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.000
So there's an overrepresentation
of these ka

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.520
words or ka names in, well,
high-performing companies.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.500
In fact, Eastman, when he
created the company Kodak,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.790
decided to name it Kodak.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.280
The apocryphal tale is that he
named it Kodak because the

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.490
sound was mimicking the sound
of the shutter, that he

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.000
thought it went "kodak" when
you snapped the shutter.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.070
It turns out he actually just
really liked this hard

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.970
beginning and hard end.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.330
He thought that Kodak sounded
powerful and dominant.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.880
And he picked for that very
reason that name.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.940
So that's just a sampling
from the first section.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.920
I'm going to zip through the
second section very quickly

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.970
now and talk a little bit about
stuff that doesn't just

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.770
reside in our heads
but also how we

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.340
interact with other people.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.440
And that's the world
between us.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.610
I'm just going to give you
one quick example here.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.240
This is Vladislav Tkachiev.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.130
He's a chess grandmaster.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.470
He's also one of the world
champions at blitz chess,

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.510
60-second games of chess.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.160
And his 2009 world
rank was 58.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.450
He's a very impressive
chess player.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.800
But he also is known, and
better known, because

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.120
sometimes he turns up to matches
drunk and has fallen

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.140
asleep on occasion
during matches.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.070
And also, he's known as the
playboy of chess because he

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.470
created the World Chess
Beauty Contest.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.470
And he decided that all female
chess players who are

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.530
grandmasters should submit
photos of themselves into a

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.660
beauty contest.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.500
And one question some
researchers had on the back of

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.780
this is, does this
actually matter?

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.280
I mean, it's offensive,
obviously, but does it matter?

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.960
Does it matter if you
are an attractive

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.000
female playing chess?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.920
Does that change how people
play against you?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.950
This is Carmen Kass.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.230
She was the model for Christian

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.990
Dior's J'Adore perfume.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.410
She also happens to
be one of the best

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.740
chess players in Estonia.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.360
And she was the head of the
Estonian Chess Federation.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.070
So the question is, when you're
playing Carmen Kass, if

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.710
you're a hot-blooded
heterosexual male, does it

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.800
matter that you're playing
Carmen Kass rather than

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.620
someone else who's making
the same moves,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.840
the identical moves?

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.640
Now, these people
playing against

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.750
Carmen Kass are experts.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.240
They are very, very good
chess players.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.540
They don't make moves
randomly.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.260
They've thought a lot about
the moves they're making.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.600
And they've probably
come across similar

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.980
games in the past.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.700
They're very advanced players.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.620
And they also should
be hyper-rational.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.700
They should be about as rational
as humans are.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.500
But some researchers looked at
how people react when they

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.390
play against these players who
are more or less attractive.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.030
These are not images
that I created.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.500
This is from the website
Hot or Not.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.950
And you can take an average of
all the faces that get low

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.060
ratings and high ratings.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.550
And that's what you get.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.390
The question is, would it matter
playing chess against

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.710
these different people?

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.200
And the research shows that if
you look at all the games

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.100
among grandmasters from '97 to
2007, this effect applies to

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.960
heterosexual males who are
playing against women.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.840
You find that when they play
against the slightly less

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.120
attractive players, you get many
more conservative draws.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.650
They play a more conservative
game.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.820
They're a little bit
more careful about

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.840
what they're doing.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.640
Their moves are not quite
as risky or extravagant.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.840
But when they play against an
attractive woman, they make

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.010
many more risky moves, both
their opening moves, their

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.720
opening gambit, they tend to
select a much more risky one--

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.390
almost as though in evolutionary
terms they're

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.010
trying to impress the woman
who's in front of them with

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.530
their daring.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.220
But then they end up losing
many more games.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.220
You also find that the moves--
so not just the opening

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.450
gambits but also the moves
throughout the game and the

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:42.480
outcomes of the games-- they
tend to win in a spectacular

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.650
fashion or to lose, to bomb,
in a spectacular fashion.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.240
And people have commented that
it's striking to watch my

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.310
friend play this game.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.360
He's never played a game
like that before.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.180
And often, that happens when
he's playing against a very

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.560
attractive female.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.430
And there's a lot of research
showing the same thing, that

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.250
we are swayed by the people
around us in all sorts of

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.600
unexpected ways.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.570
So even the most rational of
us can be swayed by the

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.660
people around us.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.750
So that's focusing a little bit
on the world between us.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.350
There's a lot more to that.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.500
But I want to quickly jump over
to the world around us.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.720
This is where color comes in.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.490
I'm going to look at a different
cue, though, instead

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:17.710
of looking at color.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.920
And that's the power of nature
to be a barrier between us and

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.560
some stressor.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.020
So there's some fascinating
research that was conducted at

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.210
Paoli Memorial Hospital in
Lancaster in Pennsylvania.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.930
And this was a group of people
who were recovering from

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.110
gallbladder surgery in the
late '70s and early '80s.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.040
And there were 24 of
them in each group.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.880
And they were basically
very similar people.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.310
There wasn't much to
distinguish them.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.090
They were similar in terms of
their smoking history, their

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.130
exercise history,
their weight.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.590
Other health indicators
were very similar.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.240
So for example, if you take
patient 24 from each group,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:57.950
they were matched.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.680
Each one was yoked to
someone similar.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.980
So we have a male who's about
24 or 25, smokes a similar

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.090
number of cigarettes,
doesn't exercise.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.550
And each of these you
could match up.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.560
So going into this procedure,
there's no difference.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.180
This is a map of the hospital
from above.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.130
And what you have here
is the rooms.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:20.640
And the rooms look out onto this
area in a courtyard in

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.820
the hospital.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.810
So these are the rooms where
people recover from

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:24.690
gallbladder surgery.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.210
And they're randomly assigned
to different rooms.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.190
They get the same treatment
from the same doctors, the

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.940
same nurses.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.390
There is no real difference
except where they

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.070
happen to be located.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.050
What's kind of interesting,
though, is some of these rooms

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.410
happen to look out directly onto
a stand of trees, whereas

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.140
the other ones look out
onto a brick wall.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.230
And you can see how
that would be.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:46.180
So group one, these look
out onto a brick wall.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.355
And group two, these look out
onto a stand of trees.

00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:51.070
It's the only difference
between these rooms.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.180
Everything else is the same,
except the view.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.660
So this is effectively what they
see out their windows.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.620
And the researchers wanted to
know-- and this is a paper

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.720
published in the journal
"Science"--

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.910
does the presence of nature
through the window, the image

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.480
of nature, change how these
people recover?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.460
And it does.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.700
It has remarkable effects.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.290
And I'm just going to focus on
a couple of the dimensions.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.220
If you look at the recovery
period days two to five,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.030
that's typically where people
are struggling the most,

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.450
because the anesthetic has
completely worn off, and they

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.370
haven't yet fully recovered.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.290
You find the people in group
one who were looking at the

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.750
brick wall needed about six and
a half doses of very heavy

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.100
pain medication.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.020
People in group two needed
only three doses.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.670
No difference going in.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.790
The only difference
is the view.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.360
The same is also true
about how long

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.830
they stay in hospital.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.520
So it does take some
time to recover.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.140
But by the time you get to day
six, you find that a gap

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.560
starts to open up.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.250
The people who were looking
at nature seem to

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.050
recover more quickly.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.850
And that continues on throughout
days six, seven,

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.460
eight, and so on.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.040
By day eight, half of the
patients who are looking at

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.100
this view, this beautiful view,
have-- well, it's not

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.760
even a beautiful view, it's
just a couple of trees--

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.190
half of them have left.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.030
They've recovered.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.100
Whereas the group looking at the
brick wall, many of them

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.130
are convalescing in
the hospital.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.800
And so on so that by day 10
you've still got six patients

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.380
from group one who are
in the hospital

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.610
staring at a brick wall.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.650
If anyone wants to get out
quickly and is motivated to

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:18.970
leave, it's those people.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.400
And yet the presence of nature
through the window was enough

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.015
to accelerate the recovery
of these other patients.

00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:26.170
Now, this is a small-scale
study.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.650
This isn't thousands
of patients.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.750
But there have been many,
many replications.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.390
I'll talk about just
one of them.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.970
Actually, I won't have time to
talk about it now at length.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.550
But there's another one looking
at what happens to

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.230
children who have difficult
childhoods, either because

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.540
they're bullied or because they
have trouble at home.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.150
And it turns out that those
who have very difficult

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.560
childhoods and endure a lot of
stress, one barrier that makes

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.030
them capable of coping with that
stress is whether there

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.780
happens to be, incidentally,
some nature around, whether

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.390
they play sports
in green areas.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.300
And some very careful
analyses were done.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.180
And the researchers showed, for
example, that the ones who

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.795
lived in a home with lots of
pot plants, who happened to

00:30:05.795 --> 00:30:08.970
live near greenery rather than
an urban concrete environment,

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.250
were much more likely
to still be OK.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.000
They were happier about
themselves.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.580
They had higher self-esteem.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.650
They succeeded at school just
because there appeared to be

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.920
some natural environment
around them.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.260
So nature is a very powerful
buffer against stress.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.730
Another effect in locations
that I think is really

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.330
interesting is the
effect of noise.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.380
Does anyone recognize this?

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.260
This is New York City.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.230
It's a part of Manhattan.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.490
It's the only place where a
large interstate freeway goes

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.600
through-- a highway goes
through Manhattan.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.480
Does anyone recognize that?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.650
Yeah.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.540
It's the George Washington
Bridge where it comes into

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.810
Washington Heights.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.430
And this is I-95, obviously
one of the busiest, most

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.170
densely packed highways
in the US.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.710
And the question was, for people
who happen to live near

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.650
this highway, what's the
effect on these people?

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.580
And the area that I've circled
in red here, there's a series

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.290
of tall high-rise buildings.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.150
They're all identical.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.390
And they happen to be situated
directly on top of the

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.500
freeway, known as the Bridge
Tower Apartments.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.200
These are the apartments
from the side.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.170
And they're about
32 stories high.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.120
And one thing you can do is you
can measure the sound, the

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.180
level of sound, the ambient
sound, at each of these

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.170
different levels.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.310
So you find, for example, that
obviously there are different

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.230
levels as you go up because it
gets softer as you go higher.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.310
At the first level, if you
happen to live on the ground

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:42.740
floor, the background noise is
86 decibels, which is about

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.370
what you'd expect.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.230
You're near a freeway.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.980
It's the sound of a
truck going by.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.440
That's pretty serious noise.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.020
At the eighth level, the sound
drops to 66 decibels, which is

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.460
obviously quite a lot lower.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.690
It's a logarithmic scale.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.075
So it's about 100 times
less sound.

00:31:58.075 --> 00:32:01.050
I think that's right.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:06.270
And it's basically like being
in the presence of a loud

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.475
vacuum cleaner.

00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:11.140
As you go up, at level 20, it's
like being in a crowded

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.370
department store with people
humming and chatting.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.470
And then by level 32, it's
much, much softer.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.460
It's what you'd hope your
home would sound like.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.970
It's only 55 decibels, which is
less than the sound of very

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:27.970
light chatter.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:32.000
So this is a family sitting
around enjoying a fireplace.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.250
And it turns out that there's a
very big difference between

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.840
this first floor and
the 32nd floor.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.480
There's a huge difference in
the amount of sound that

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.370
enters the ears of the people
who live there.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.560
One of the questions the
researchers asked was, what

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.890
does this mean for people who
live there, especially

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.050
if they have kids?

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.450
Does this matter?

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.520
And so what they did was they
approached people who lived on

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.410
these different floors, and
they asked their children

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.130
various questions.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.320
So one of the questions they
asked was, can you

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.940
discriminate between these
different sounds?

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.845
So this child here is asked,
what is the word

00:33:03.845 --> 00:33:04.810
that's being spoken?

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.530
And they heard the word
in their ears.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.100
And the word was either
beer or gear.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.810
And they were asked, which
word did you hear?

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.640
And they would do another
one, robe and rope.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.170
And they went through
a series of these.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.510
And these are the sounds for us
when we hear them that are

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.330
the most confusable.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.840
And they were asked what
word was being said.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.850
Now, most people with great
hearing can achieve this 100%

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.800
of the time.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.520
As long as the diction is clear,
you should be able to

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.240
distinguish robe from rope.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.550
And what they found was that was
true for people who were

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.410
very high up.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.050
These kids did very
well on the test.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.660
They passed with
flying colors.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.980
The kids who happened to live
on the 20th floor, some

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.800
errors crept in.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.620
Kids who lived on the eighth
floor, more errors crept in.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.780
So from 100% down to 95% to
88%, which suggested their

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.418
hearing has been damaged a bit
from living in this area, on

00:33:54.418 --> 00:33:56.640
these different levels with
different ambient noise.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.570
What's more distressing, then,
is a lot of how we learn to

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.260
read is in making fine
distinctions between sounds.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.820
And so what they did was they
gave them reading tests.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.670
And if you standardize the
scores so that the kids who

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.489
lived on the top floor get a
score of 100, the kids on the

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.880
20th floor scored a 93, and
those on the bottom floor

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.350
scored an 87.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.110
This is not about demographics,
that wealthier

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.710
people can afford to
live higher up or

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.710
anything like that.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.139
They made sure that
that wasn't the

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.070
cause of the effect.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.110
And so what you're seeing here
is that just by living on a

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.270
noisier floor of an apartment
block, you can influence how

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.389
well your kids learn to read and
how quickly they learn to

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.570
read, which is a striking
effect.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.110
And what shows that this
effect is due to this

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.179
prolonged or chronic exposure
to noise is that if you look

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.530
at people who'd only lived there
for much less time, for

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.440
less than four years, the
effect goes away.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.750
So if you look at their reading
scores, these kids at

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.040
the top floor scored 100, the
ones on the 20th floor scored

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.900
a 99, and the ones on the eighth
floor scored a 98.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.630
It's about being there
for a long time.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.320
So there is something
you can do about it.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.920
If you're exposed to noise for
a shorter period, the effects

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.590
are less profound.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.320
So in a world of tiger moms
and helicopter parenting,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.210
these are some very simple
interventions that improve the

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.100
lives of children and allow them
to deal with stress more

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.780
effectively than they
might otherwise.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.440
The presence of nature, the
sorts of activities they do,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.550
they engage in.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.040
The absence of noise, if at all
possible, which is tricky

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.620
in Manhattan.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.520
But it does suggest that of the
constellation of features

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.720
or cues that might shape your
decision about whether to buy

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.190
one apartment or another, or
to live in one apartment or

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.540
another, maybe noise should
factor in more than it does

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.490
for a lot of us.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.000
So maybe it's nice to
have a good view.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.830
But also, another benefit of
being higher up is it's going

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.030
to be more quiet.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.200
And that's also an
important factor.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.400
So I've sampled some anecdotes
from throughout the book and

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.130
some studies from throughout
the book.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.560
I started by talking
about names.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.140
It's the world within us.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.780
And I moved on to the
characteristics of other

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.500
people in chapter five.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.800
It's the chess players.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.170
And then I talked a little bit
about locations when I talked

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.460
about nature and the
presence of noise.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.960
There's obviously quite
a lot of other

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.800
stuff in there as well.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.260
Drunk tank pink comes
in at the beginning.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.660
But I talk a lot more about the
effects of colors on all

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.910
sorts of things, like
how well Olympic

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.540
competitors seem to do.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.980
So if you have two competitors
who are equally matched--

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.890
in the Olympics, we randomly
assign them to wear

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.160
either red or blue.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.460
It's just the way the Olympics
approaches this question of

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.140
how to decide what people
should wear.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.800
It turns out those who wear red
win much more often than

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.110
those who wear blue.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.440
And that's especially true when
they're evenly matched.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.450
It seems to tip the hand
slightly in favor of the ones

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.050
who wear red.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.690
And there are a number
of reasons for this.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.300
Referees see people clad in
red as more dominant.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.440
And so when they're awarding
points, they award more points

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.900
to people who wear red.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.510
So that's another one of
the effects I discuss.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.930
Thank you very much.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.180
I'm happy to take questions.

00:36:51.782 --> 00:36:53.032
Yeah.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.780
AUDIENCE: What got you
interested on this path of--

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.540
I don't know what field
you would call this,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.530
but whatever it is?

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.760
ADAM ALTER: Yeah.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.950
So mts background is in
psychology, in social

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.590
psychology and cognitive
psychology.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.350
And those are the fields
where you discover

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.110
a lot of this stuff.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.530
And when I was an undergrad in
Australia, I came across some

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.990
of this research in an intro
to psych class, and I was

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.870
fascinated.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.260
I started working with some
professors there.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.220
I started doing similar research
when I went to grad

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.610
school in the US.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.280
And I think there are two
reasons why I wrote the book.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.140
One is because I find this
stuff intrinsically

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.140
fascinating.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.610
And I think other people
tend to when I

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:33.430
discuss it with them.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.920
And so I thought there
was room to

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.680
describe it more broadly.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.710
But I also think, if you look
at the hurricane example,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.520
there's good reason
to talk about this

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.000
stuff for policy reasons.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.570
Why shouldn't we name our
hurricanes slightly

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:45.970
differently?

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.520
It costs us nothing.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.110
And in so doing, we might
attract more hurricane aid.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.850
It just seems like
a no brainer.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.180
So if we can capitalize on this
stuff, there are no side

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.070
effects to renaming our
hurricanes, really.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.620
Some of the effects are great.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.660
And so from a policy
perspective, there's a lot we

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.370
can do that we aren't doing.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.570
And this book talks about
some of those effects.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.130
So I think it's interesting and
because it has practical

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.380
consequences.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.463
Yeah.

00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:13.636
AUDIENCE: In terms of no
negative effects for the

00:38:13.636 --> 00:38:15.327
hurricane, it could be
a good thing to do.

00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:17.983
But I would wonder what the
effect on people named Sandy

00:38:17.983 --> 00:38:20.640
is when Hurricane Sandy gets
all this horrible press.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.813
And then similarly, if we name
all our hurricanes with

00:38:22.813 --> 00:38:25.490
popular names if that effect
would apply [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.730
ADAM ALTER: Right.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.950
Yeah.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.720
So the question was,
what happens with,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.600
say, Hurricane Sandy?

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.550
Once you happen to be named
Sandy and a hurricane comes

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.390
through that--

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.950
this is true for Katrina
as well.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.020
There are negative externalities
there, that it's

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.230
horrible to be named after
something that was a tragedy.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.700
So one argument there is maybe
what we should do is pick a

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.070
name that's uncommon but with
a letter that's very common.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.860
So since most of the research
focuses on the letters rather

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.250
than the names, maybe we should
pick the least common

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.610
name with the letter
that's most common.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.660
That's one answer.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.140
But you're right.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.440
There are always questions like
that that we should be

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.050
juggling and throwing
into the mix.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.040
It's not obvious that there
are no externalities.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.640
But I think in general in a
lot of these cases, these

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.480
interventions are
so inexpensive.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.830
Another one is in Glasgow,
Scotland, and in parts of

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.480
Japan, they've shown blue lights
on certain parts of

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.820
town that reminded people
presumably of police and of

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.700
being watched, so they behaved
much more honestly.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.990
The same is true with
billboards.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.900
If you put up a billboard with
eyes, a pair of human eyes,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.140
that costs very little.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.530
But it has the effect of
making people feel like

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:28.600
they're being watched.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.640
And there's good evidence to
suggest that they are much

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.790
more likely to behave honestly
when there's a billboard with

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.900
eyes around.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.980
The same is true
with a mirror.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.030
If you happen to open a
cupboard-- if you have a

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.590
cupboard with all your
chocolates, and you're trying

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.310
to keep to a diet, put a mirror
up, because every time

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.680
you open it, you'll be staring
into your soul as you reach in

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.310
and try to grab the food
that you're not

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.430
supposed to be eating.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.170
So you're right.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.560
There are some externalities
and some negatives.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.940
But generally speaking, I think
the positives greatly

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.850
outweigh the negatives.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:56.020
Hi.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.430
Yeah.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.485
AUDIENCE: I'm curious for the
hospital example, how do you

00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:02.870
know that it's a difference
between a beautiful and not

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:03.367
beautiful view?

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:06.349
So for instance, what if you
were looking at a skyline view

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:08.834
that was beautiful and
had shrubbery?

00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:10.822
How do you know it's nature
and not just beautiful

00:40:10.822 --> 00:40:12.820
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.240
ADAM ALTER: You're right.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:13.450
Yeah.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.330
So it could be-- the question
was, how do we know that it's

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:16.240
not just beauty?

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.300
How do we know that it's not
just that one view is nicer

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.230
than the other?

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.850
Like what if you had a really
ugly natural view or a really

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.100
pretty view that's sculpted,
but it's concrete?

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.390
And that's a great question.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.080
And it's not something you can
address without study.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.430
But a lot of other studies
ask the same question.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.730
So in one study, people watched
the most horrific

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.300
video you can imagine
of animals being

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.800
put through an abattoir.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.670
It's a very distressing video,
and it's a propagandist video

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.920
that tries to get people to
eat less meet, obviously.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.940
And they watched this video.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.950
And when they then performed
various mental tasks, they did

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.140
much worse on the task,
as you'd expect.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.190
They were distracted and
a little bit disturbed.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.570
And what they did with other
people was they got them to

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.680
walk through a beautiful natural
environment or a

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.010
beautiful environment or a very
nice environment that

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.130
wasn't natural.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.890
And they found in that
experiment, even though the

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.720
beauty of the two environments
was rated equally highly, that

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.510
only the natural environment
had this positive effect.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.720
And one of the arguments is that
one of the things that

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.610
distinguishes a natural
environment from a built

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.870
environment, even if it's
beautiful, is that a built

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.390
environment is static.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.320
A natural environment, you
have the rustle of wind

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:20.970
through leaves.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.760
You have the movement
of a river.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.150
All of that stuff is critical.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.530
And William James was one of
the first and greatest

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.350
philosophers and
psychologists--

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.850
not the first philosopher,
but one of the first

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.290
psychologists--

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.940
he talked about two kinds
of attention.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.490
And one of his arguments was
that it's this kind of stuff

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.950
that visits on you that you
don't have to deal with.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:42.010
You don't have to dodge cars or
remember things, that your

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.690
attention is grabbed by nature
and the movement of the wind

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.400
through the trees and
all that stuff.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.470
That's a replenishing kind of
attention, whereas it's very

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.070
stressful to have to deal with
the movement of cars and

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.310
dodging traffic and all the
stuff that we normally

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.710
associate with stress.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.680
So there's something about the
kind of attention that is

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.150
drawn out of you from natural
environments that has this

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.110
effect beyond just beautiful

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.620
environments that aren't natural.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.030
Yeah.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.914
AUDIENCE: Just on the naming
piece, have there been any

00:42:08.914 --> 00:42:11.269
studies that looked
at the effect on

00:42:11.269 --> 00:42:13.160
politics relating to voters?

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.780
ADAM ALTER: Yeah.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.020
Actually, in the same paper on
lawyers, I looked at that.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.950
We don't have real datasets.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.300
We haven't looked at real
datasets on that.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.620
But we show that if you give
people names of politicians

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.900
and you ask them to rank them
and rate them and vote on

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.560
them, they like the ones
who have simpler names.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.680
And there's one great
anecdote.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.080
There were some politicians
with surnames Hart and

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.890
Fairchild--

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.900
there's an article on "Slate"
about this-- and they did

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.650
extremely well.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.960
They weren't expected
to do all that well.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.300
And they outperformed.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.050
And they were up against someone
whose surname was

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.070
[? Pachinski. ?]

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.840
And it was hard to pronounce,
a little bit hard to spell.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.930
And there was a whole argument
that part of the problem there

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.580
was that when people were
saying, we should vote for

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.190
[? Pachinski, ?]

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.230
they didn't even know
what to say.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.050
They just said, we should vote
for that candidate who had

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.500
that name that I can't remember
or pronounce.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.450
And that that stuff ends up
mattering, especially for the

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.920
transmission of the name.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.755
So yes, there's been some
research on that as well.

00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:07.372
AUDIENCE: On that note, are
there any studies on people

00:43:07.372 --> 00:43:09.780
with the same name but
[INAUDIBLE] nicknames are,

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.358
whether they're interpreted
differently by others or by

00:43:13.358 --> 00:43:16.830
themselves, this Kat versus
Kate versus Katie or

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.330
something like that?

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.920
ADAM ALTER: I don't know of
much research looking at

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.780
nicknames as a distinct factor
beyond names themselves.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.480
It's an interesting question,
because obviously Kat has--

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.670
or Kate or Katrina--

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.720
has so many associated
nicknames.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.280
It's a good question, which
nickname should you pick?

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.100
I think the main argument,
though, is nicknames are a

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.980
great idea when the name is
especially complex, and you

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.100
can simplify it by giving people
a nickname to use.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.880
And you see that a lot of people
with names that are

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.470
hard to pronounce do this
naturally, anyway.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.500
But beyond the question of
whether one nickname is

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.680
simpler than another, I don't
know about much research

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.270
that's looked specifically
at nicknames.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.100
That's a good question though.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.940
Yeah.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.125
AUDIENCE: This more is for the
colors but works for anything.

00:43:56.125 --> 00:44:00.450
Have they found how much of this
is evolutionary, genetic,

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.630
long-term factor versus more
social, short-term factors?

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:05.070
ADAM ALTER: Yeah.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.800
It's a very good question.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.020
The question was, how much of
this is long-term versus

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.340
evolutionary based on a very,
very long time scale?

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.590
How much of it is just
based on association?

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.570
That's a big question
for colors.

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.540
So with drunk tank pink,
we associate pink with

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.860
femininity, which we haven't
always done.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.150
So pink was a color that we
didn't associate with one

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.700
gender or another until
maybe 150 years ago.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.350
And the question is, would
you have found

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.670
the same effect then?

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.800
There's some evidence
either way.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.650
There's one study, apparently,
that reports that even--

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.600
I'm color blind, and apparently
this effect even

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.230
works on color blind people.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:43.160
So I can't see that pink the
way you all see that pink,

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.820
assuming you're not
color blind.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.800
But it's supposed to have the
same effect, which suggests

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.300
something biological, at least,
beyond the level of

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.870
pure association.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.800
So even if I think it's grey,
it's still doing the same

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.840
thing to me.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.530
But there are other studies
that suggest that if you

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.270
expect pink to make
you stronger,

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.370
the effect goes away.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.000
So maybe it's about
the association.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.720
If you retrain people to have
new associations, a lot of

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.020
these effects go away.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.900
And it's actually a good
question, because it's a

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.080
constant theme in the book
that I talk about.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.380
Some of this stuff is
very low level.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.700
It goes back well into the
reaches of the past of early

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.150
humans and how they interacted
with each other.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.230
But a lot of it is really a
product of the environment we

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.310
live in today.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.470
And a lot of it shows that the
environment we're in today is

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.010
not the one we were over time
molded for or designed for.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.860
And so a lot of these little
errors that creep in and

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.650
biases that creep in are a
product of that mismatch

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.970
between the people we were
molded to be in one

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.100
environment and the fact that we
haven't kept up enough with

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.920
a very rapidly changing
environment.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.820
So I suggest some ways that
we might be able to

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.030
cope better with that.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.926
Yeah.

00:45:42.926 --> 00:45:44.585
AUDIENCE: Is there any data
whether the pacifying effect

00:45:44.585 --> 00:45:46.244
of pink affects men
or women more?

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.280
ADAM ALTER: There are
some results.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.660
And it's slightly stronger with
men than it is for women.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.890
There's one study that shows
that women don't respond as

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:59.380
much, that in general they are
much less sensitive to the

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:06.420
color than men are, which may
suggest, and I guess, that to

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.910
some extent the effect
is about association.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.270
If men think of femininity,
perhaps that then changes how

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.060
they feel when they're gripping
the hand grip,

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.540
whereas women, maybe that it
just loses that effect.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.080
So perhaps it's to some extent
about the association there.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.288
Thank you.

00:46:25.288 --> 00:46:30.108
