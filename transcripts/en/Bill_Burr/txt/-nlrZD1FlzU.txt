Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and ahhh

Speaker 3:          00:00:08       just checking. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on your, hello. This is Susan Blue's team calling. Um, that's a character I see. We still call up a buddy of mine all the time. They pretend to be as casting director and I would just call them up with the worst fucking auditions. Every, hello? This is Susan Bloomstein calling. I have an audition for you with flora feature.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Do you have a problem with being naked around other men in positions that involves you staring at your ankles? If you have a prob, if not, give me a cool stupid shit like that. It was always like, you know, something that I guess would be considered homophobic as instead of just being funny, you know? Is it homophobic to suggest that he would be uncomfortable staring at his ankle? Ankles, I should say.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       and the company of other men. I don't know what's going on. How was your Thursday? Did you get paid today? Huh? Did they write some numbers? On a piece of paper and then you stuck it in a machine and somehow you can get waffles. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       Yeah, man.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       All the money's in the air now. I don't know where it is. Yeah, no safe to say either. Some white dude has all of it. Russian dude, which his guest is a white dude, but white dude means American dude, right? Or English, right? Russian dude or Chinese dude. One of them's got it. Maybe somebody in Singapore. He has all the money, Japanese guy. And of course you've got the fucking Saudi princess. They got something like six people have it all right now. And the rest of us just get pieces of paper with numbers on it. But as long as we believe in it, no matter what they say on TV, no matter how bad they say it's getting, as long as we just continue to fucking believe in it, just keep writing numbers to each other. Right? Next thing you know, I got a shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       You got a Taco? Everybody's happy. Susan Blum, Steen colleague. Um, anyways, uh, so here's what's going on with me last night. Me and the lovely Nia. My beautiful lady, we went down and saw a ag pop. He has a new album out the post pop depression and I'm basically like 90% of Queens of the stone age. Who was backing him up? Uh, John Theatre was not on drums, um, but it was pretty much, I think the rest of the band and Iggy pop out model was fucking amazing show. I'd lucked into these tickets. I was doing a comedy show. I ran into somebody that works for the band. They said, we've got a couple extra tickets. Do you want to go? My freckle stood up at attention and of course I went, I went down there and God damn it, what an amazing show. Silverman opened up, she fucking crushed it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       And I'm Maggie Pot man. There's a bucket list right there. Bucket list. Wanted to go see the guy fucking comes out there, right? He's got it on a sports coat with no shirt underneath that. He's 68 years old. All right. After one song, the code is gone and he's prance around with no shirt on. 68 years old. It was some fucking shit guy. Just doesn't give a fuck. I'm gonna fuck, I'm going to post a picture of the guy. You know what I mean? He's still in great shape, you know? Sure. There's a little less this city issues here or there with the skin, but I mean, other than that, the guy looks like he can do more pushups than I could ever do. I hope I look that good at his age. You know, when he's still got that beautiful Marsha Brady fucking haircut. Gorgeous hair.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Oh God. I was jealous. Um, anyways, the band absolutely fucking smashed it. He was all over the stage. Um, it was, it was fucking incredible, man. It was just, it just an absolutely amazing night. And then me and Nia finished it off as much as I'm trying to get in shape. One of the great things to do out here in Los Angeles is to hit your favorite fucking Taco truck or late night taco spot. Um, it's just the best. And there was one a, I got a buddy of mine cut another comedian for shot who's like a connoisseur of all the taco trucks. I was basically a guy, I went down just east of the fucking one west of the one 10, um, you know, and like Beverly Boulevard, what do you got? And He fucking, he gave me like three taco trucks, like Google mapped all the way back to my house and we ended up stopping off at one and a, Oh fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       I didn't get any Tacos, actually. Got a God damn case of DHEA, which is the classic default White Guy Order at a taco truck. You know. Can I get a chicken case today? Can I get one away? I'll be technically that you said even Mexican is she has changed with chicken. Hell, we do that. Um, it was just a, a, a, a great night. And um, another night where I didn't smoke a cigar. I haven't smoked a cigar since February 16th. And uh, you know, you have a problem with something when you know the exact date, you know of, uh, when you stopped doing it, you know other shit. If you just don't give a fuck, you just like, you want to go to McDonald's? Yeah, no. When's the last time you ate there? Oh, I don't know man. I spent a while. We'll get year. That's when you don't have a price.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       That's, that's when, if there was an issue of addiction, it's just completely out of your fucking life. But I know the exact date was February 16th. I know where I was. I know what I smoked and I know what I felt like when I had it. And I've been thinking about it every fucking day and I'm, I'm trying to go on a little bit of a run here. Cause if, uh, I don't cut the shit out of my life this summer, I will be a four years smoker. Like what the fuck? What am I doing? Um, so, but I've been holding fast with these uh, fast are holding strong, whatever the fucking expression is. I only have two a month. Alright. I two in January, two and a half in February because I started smoking when it wasn't lit well and I've got another one, so I have one and a half that nice. That's not bad. Right? Come on. You guys aren't doctors generally speaking? I should be all right. My Body can handle that. Two and a have fucking days. I mean two and a half, two a month. Once every 14 days. I still fucking stupid. Maybe I'll just go down to one a month. I want to be special occasion guy. I figure I'll smoke one at the rose bowl. Smoke one super bowl Sunday my birthday.

Speaker 4:          00:06:54       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:06:55       what else you got flagged day then. I don't give a fuck about that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       It's a bunch of Jewish holidays in September. I am in show business as a nod to them. That'd be really selfish. Like I give a shit, right? Like I give a shit about, you know, like I'm actually acknowledging another religions. Real reasons I was, I'm just looking for an excuse to smoke a cigar tall. My Jewish brothers and sisters out there and a sign of support. What are you going to deal, Bill? Huh? Make a donation to the museum of tolerance. No, I am going to smoke a Cuban cigar and honor to all of your wonderful contributions to comedy in show business.

Speaker 4:          00:07:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       Like for a year, that would be perfect. Right? There's not a fucking doctor on the planet. They always got it. They always get it. That job is just a rain on your parade. I saw if I went in and say, doc, look, I smoked for a year. Is that bad? And be a getaway. You know, it's, you know, it's not bad, but they always go. Ideally. Yeah. Ideally I'd live in a fucking bubble and I would be breathe perfect fucking air and I would drink clean water and I have, um, a microbiotic what the fuck are you doing doc? You gotta be doing something going in here, taking everybody's blood pressure, all God damn day looking at fucking skin tags. You're telling me you don't have an outlet?

Speaker 4:          00:08:20       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       I dunno. So anyways, having settled that probably smoke word next week, but I liked this month, this month is going good because, um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       you know, I've already like, you know, my, the first two months of the year I really feel like I should, my hands should be shaking as I'm talking about, this is so bad. I want to smoke. I, uh, I had my first one January 1st and then January 8th I had the second one. I was like, fuck, the month isn't even half over and I going to white knuckle at the rest of the way. And then I did it again in February. I smoked more on like the fifth and then one on like this I guess the 16th then I got another two fucking weeks. So now I feel like I'm ahead of the game cause it's like the 10th. If I can just make it to like the 15th,

Speaker 5:          00:09:08       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:10       then I can actually go on a run and do one every week for four weeks. Then white knuckle it through April.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       Oh, it just sucks. How come everything fun fucking kills you. You know, just fucking kills you sitting around Eating Goddamn yogurt by the way. You know, I figured out what was causing the train, not the lead, the fucking station. I became mobilly Parfait, right. And I went down to this shoe shop and they will fucking raving about this. You know, this all natural yogurt with coconut in it. You know all that probiotic has probiotics in it. This is, you know, this isn't negative biotics. This is positive pro. This is proactive biotic. You have two kinds of bacteria within your intestinal tract. Shut the fuck up. I put this stuff in them. I couldn't, I couldn't shit for days. I just kept beating it cause they that down at the juice shack there. Right. They kept telling me how healthy it was and a little did. A little did I know I was building like a fucking wall. You know what sets city? They're in Greece with all, it's the whole city's just a bunch of white walls, you know? That's what I was building in my stomach. Where are you built? I don't know. It's the first thing I thought of. I go fuck yourself. You know, I'd like to see you not shit for three days and try to dance around it and keep it funny. Okay. How did I get this mood? Um, then he was, hold on one second. Hold on. Nancy Reagan died. Everybody,

Speaker 5:          00:10:34       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       she died and a lot of people were really upset about that. You know, she was a great woman. I'll tell you what made her great. Uh, the, the shape she kept herself in, considering her husband had jelly beans all over the fucking place. The fact that she could just say no to those goddamn things, right. Walking around. There's something about being that skinny though. After a while though, it's just like you live for fucking ever, but you just get like a bird person.

Speaker 5:          00:10:59       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       Like if she was my, uh, grandmother, I would have built like a giant bird cage that are hung from the ceiling I just made. I'd make it go in there and perch on it, you know, I'm not opening the door unless you tell me. I'm still in the, well Nancy. All right. I guess I would say grandma Reagan's Greg and um, all right, this one, there's been, this whole podcast has gone off the fucking rails, so too goddamn distracted. Him talking about putting dead first ladies and birdcages. That's not right, is it? He's such a weird fellow that Reagan, some people you talked to, he singlehandedly defeated the Russians. Reality is, didn't he come off the fucking bench and he did. He hit the last three. You know, he the dagger, he put the game away. I would say,

Speaker 5:          00:11:43       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       by tricking them into thinking that we were actually going to have shit up and outer space to stop this shit from coming over here.

Speaker 5:          00:11:51       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       that's a weird

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       thing about trying to bomb somebody from the other side of the fucking world. If you're too lazy to fly over, you got to start. You got to shoot him. Remember Robert Parishes foul shot. You remember the rainbow. That's how you got to do it. You actually got to send it in because of the curvature of the earth. You got to send it fucking up and over. You know what I mean? It's like when you're sitting on the couch and you got a Napkin and you want to throw it into a barrel, but your fucking office chair was right there. You got to go up and over. You know they do that with missiles. Somebody actually figured that out sometimes. Some super fucking intelligent scientist guy, right. As opposed to the really dumb ones that they put in the nuclear programs. Right. Bill, this guy had just sit there and like figure that out.

Speaker 6:          00:12:38       You know, out of our airspace ended the troposphere up into the stratosphere. Whoever the fuck it goes right out to outer space. Reedus the atmosphere without blowing up right on the White House. Nothing but president. Right. They're just sitting there talking shit, what a fucking job. You know, and there's some other psycho, you know, they got cameras in spaces, some shit or somebody flying around with that direct TV satellite on the back of his plane just falling around. Brezhnev and Gorbachev trying to figure out where they're at. So they always have the exact coordinates. That's what it, that's the level of stress like Obama has and all these guys. That's why they age like 90 years. Cause they know the other team, right? They go and Billy Belicheck on a, you know they got cameras on you, right on the top of your fucking head, wherever you go.

Speaker 6:          00:13:34       You know, I'd be all parent. I'd be doing fucking head fakes as I was walking down the hall to the Oval Office. Right. I wouldn't even go in the Oval Office saying, I'm not going in there. I would have, I'd have a double, I'd always be down in the basement, you know. Then years later after I died, you know, all my staff would start fucking coming out talking shit about me. He's a very fearful man for all the bravado during his speeches, he spent the entire eight years of his presidency in the, the, well, we're not allowed to say how far down it goes, but let's just say there's one hell of a basement under that house. Um, do you even think he fucking lives there? There's no fucking way he lives there. He just lives there. You ever seen the White House? It's just right there. You know, he hasn't lived there. I bet there's a fucking, you take an elevator that's just like a, and when Steve jobs used to make those fucking speeches at those nerd fest, right? They go down there, you know, he come out and he's fucking jeans and no belt and he just ah, look at Dan [inaudible] and all the nerds are like, oh God. Oh God.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       I think that's what. Then he just fucking Lee. Nobody knew where he lived. Bye Bye. What is Bill Gates have a more reclusive fucking house. Is The house reclusive bill? Does it, does the house make the choice to be introverted? Whatever. Yeah, he has, he has a fucking house. No one could get to. I can't get anywhere fucking near Bill Gates House. Right. But the White House, you can walk right up to the gate. Right? You can come right up to it. Is this going to put me on a list? Um, I bet. What's his face? I Bet Bill Gates has got a fucking, God damn, you know, remember that stat star wars thing that Reagan wanted to put up for fucking, you know the Robert Parish nuclear warhead rainbow shot from the Kremlin, right? I bet he's got those for like drones. I bet he hates drones. He's all pissed off. How dare you send my technology back there.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       Guy. I think he's an evil motherfucker and that's why it gives away all that money. You know what I mean? It's weird. He's like, he's like the sociopath with a heart of gold. He's kind of like Dexter. Right. But if he was like in the laptop's rather than just cutting up people, but it's only the bad people. I was never able to get past that. Look at you. God Damn you look good. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. What do you mean really? You've got to hitch my wagon to a dog. Fucking totally superficial. All right. You look hot and you better keep looking hard cause I'll tell you right now, I'll go right down to the used car lot and I'll start shopping. Oh yeah, I'll trade gin. I'm not going to trade you in and about. I don't know. You're a classic though. You're one of those those ones that's going to last for awhile.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       You know, I've been treating you well. Changing the fluids every 3000 miles out is gross. Disgusting. I'm well thank you for saying that. I think I feel like I went out to a show last night and had some drinks and ate some late night tacos. Yeah, she did. It was so much fun. Did you talk about the show? Yeah. How about ag? Put confidence of Biggie pop going out. This 68 has more swag than all of you bitches. Why are you checking the listeners? I don't know cause it's funny cause you're hung over and you don't, yeah, I don't mean to attack the listeners. I'm just saying. Yeah, this wacky had out there. It was the whole band and ag of course is legendary. That was a great show. I'm really glad I went. You know, I wasn't feeling up to it but I'm glad it's a great name for an album.

Speaker 2:          00:17:26       200 posts. The Post pop did a post pop depression. Yeah, very good. It was awesome. And the band was all wearing custom YSL for those of you who are in, what is that? Designer clothing YSL. Is he a San Laurel? He Santa Raul. He's in Laurel. Yeah. So they were all wearing custom YSL. Even the roadies, like the crew was wearing like, like trousers and ties from YSL, which is pretty dope. Like Josh looked great in that suit, didn't he? Whenever you say trousers, I think of that Classic Classic Louis C K joke when he used to talk about whenever he does. Yeah. When I would call phone sex, he'd always get that 70 year old woman. I'm taking off your trousers. I think we need to bring Clios water dish in here. Yeah, cause she's laying in the sun. Why don't you go do that cause or grab another mic if you're going to be on this. No I'm not. I just came in today. Say Hi, I'm Jesus. I have to go to the gym. That was one of my favorite dumb jokes of all time. What is it? Gay Horsey. Hey, I'm sorry. Come on. You gotta admit that's funny on some level. Um, all right. So anyways, what was I talking about? Oh, I was talking about Bill Gates Swat in a way. The fucking drugs and having more security than a old town there. Oh, town in the fucking a maze. Home blown. Yeah. Polaroid of the sun.

Speaker 4:          00:19:04       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       she's done one hike and she's done. It's already fucking hot out. He had global warming Nini. You're looking fucking good. All right, Baden.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       go to the gym. Keep it looking good. That's part of your contract. Show me shut up. Um, all right. I fucking hate this whole password thing. You know, for the, I, I figured out what the fuck was wrong with my eye, my iTunes, which is basically, I can't listen to anything that I've downloaded on my fucking laptop because I have too many other devices that have already been accepted by iTunes, so I have to deactivate some other shit. I finally figured that out. I didn't figure it out. I just went on. I went on the Internet. I basically typed in, uh, police. Give me the answer. I went there looking at you to go right back to the sun. Cleo, she fucking loves the Sun. Um, all right. What else did I want to talk about? All the garage gym is becoming a reality. It's be coming out

Speaker 7:          00:20:12       reality. Allie. Allie Audi. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Um, no thanks to fucking rogue fitness. Jesus Christ. What an arrogant Goddamn company that is. I specifically asked that company as a celebrity in my mind to send me a bunch of free shit for my garage so that I could then hype their company to my 40 listeners. And can you believe this? I hope you're sitting down. Can you believe they never got back to me? All right. Well because I'm fucking immature. I got to go vengeance. Now I have to add my vengeance on that company. This is what I'm going to do. I am going to buy all of this shit from them. That's what I'm going to do. And then you know what? When they call me and say, hey, thanks for using it, I'm not going to take that phone call. All they getting out of me is the price they want for their fucking goods. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Does that make any sense? Yeah. I don't know. I just throw it out there. They never get back to me. I was half serious. I don't like, I don't like people giving me free shit cause then they fucking own you on some level anyways. You know. Hey, you know, remember that time I gave you a chin up bar? I mean what the fuck? All right, I'll give you a ride to the airport. Fuck you know, you just, you just, you can't get out of it. You can't get out of it. So anyways, I am going to fucking do this thing up. This is, this is, this is the game plan. I'm getting that rogue fitness thing that collapse. It, it, you can fold back into the wall. I'm getting a workout bench. You know, I'm so excited for that cause I'm so sick of going to the fucking gym and there's always some, there's always somebody on it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       I have somebody who's always benching right. And uh, I can also do squats and I'll be able to do pull ups and then I got my atomic holds and am I gonna put those above where my truck is? I'll just have to pull my truck out, which I know kind of sucks, but it gives a fuck. I'm going to have an a poxy floor put in, right? And then Nia wants an adjustable speed bag over in the corner, which is great cause all I'll have to do is adjust it like twice. And just like the bicycle I bought her, she's never going to use it again. Then I can just lock that fucker into position. Right. We'll get into dated a boarded, a beaded above, right. We're gonna have to put it in a corner. I'm worried about the noise, you know, banging on, you know, blowing out my ear drums.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       Forget about that. Annoying the shit out of my neighbors because everybody out here lives on top of one another. So, um, I figured if I do that and then I'm gonna have those interlocking rubber things underneath all the gym area, I'll have a place where I can skip rope. Right. I can do my pull ups. My only thing is I'm getting rid of my pull up and dip station thing that I have and I'll be able to do the pull ups still, but I won't be able to do dips. So if anybody knows of an attachment that works. I was thinking of just having the handles coming out of the wall. If they make something like that, which would look really weird for some reason. What are the, what is those fucking Porto glory holes? It's like the glory hole of fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:23:20       it's like the glory hole of workout equipment to just have like the dip fucking things just coming out of the wall right now. What have I got? A perverted mind. What the fuck do you want from me? Uh, how long into this fucking thing are we? 23 minutes, Michael Jordan. Alright, here we go. Here we go. Let's, uh, let's read a little bit of advertising. All right. Oh fuck. I didn't talk about self cars. I got the biggest argument with fucking forest shot today. Oh, we will go and we never get an arguments. We would just fucking eat it. He's like a scientist and I'm a dope, so that's just fucking right there. That's just a recipe for, to go off the rails. I brought up forest before and if you're, um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       Um, I think he's a Ted. He's going to be in Nashville soon. I'm sure he has a website. He, uh, he actually, he opens for Jim Jeffries all the time. Um, he's fucking hilarious. Like I would go hiking with somebody who wasn't funny. You know what I mean? It's bad enough when you get to work with a comic that isn't that funny. But if you're going to walk next to him for like an hour and a half though, I'll tell you that's a rough one. You know. All right. Tracker or track are smart cars, smart phones, smart homes. Technology has made everything smart. Abstract too, you know. No, I like everybody says

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       Freddo all right. But losing your stuff still makes Matt feeble feel fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       Tracker

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       makes losing things a thing of the past tracker is a coin size device that locates misplaced keys, wallets, bags, computers, anything in seconds. Just pair tracker to your smartphone. Attach it to anything. Put it on your Dick. Where are my balls? Right next to mine.

Twitter back and forth between Kanye West in a, a dead mouse, a dead mouse, whoever the fuck he says, name I guess card. You took a screenshot and in the fucking screenshot allegedly there was something up there that showed some website where he was pirating the software. That fucking DJ guy. So,

Speaker 4:          00:33:03       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       Oh fuck. I gotta pause this and it says we might have a leak somewhere. Yeah. Jeez Dan, that not too bad. Just a little fucking leak. The jade trap downstairs.

Speaker 9:          00:33:23       Yeah. Never fucking ends. Um, anyways, so Kanye took a screenshot and I guess his dead mouse. Dead Mouse Demo five. How the fuck he say his name? I'm old. I should know how to say it. Um, I guess he made this software that helps you make an album. And evidently Kanye allegedly had a website open where you could illegally downloaded. So he called him out. He goes, you're not making enough money to pay for this software. You gotta fucking pirate my shit. And he just wrote Dick on it. So Kanye comes back with the barrage of Shit just trashing this DJ talking about his mouse head. They got a fan in there. Mike, I'm bring my daughter. She's a big fan of Minnie mouse, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just like, just like a corporation, you know, just, just sending reams of paper over, like on better call Saul, trying to fucking delay it. But nowhere in it did. The man denied that he didn't fall. They fucking didn't steal it as far as I could tell. He just, he just, to me, he immediately capitulation just immediately switched it from you stole my shit to Da, which with your fucking mouse head. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:34:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       I actually wanted to fucking jump into the middle of it to give the DJ help because he kind of was fucking taken the bait. It was just, it's like what a check does. You know what I mean? They're so fucking good at arguing that they fucking, they spin you off like you got them dead to rights and by the time you come through the whole thing you're like, I had a fuck did I lose that? Cause they, they got, you never reacted that shit. He should've just laid back, you know, on the ropes. Let Kanye Punch himself out and then just say yes. So like I said, you stole my shit, you know, and how's it go with the mouse head going to take shifts from so many who wear a leather miniskirt throughout a whole fucking tour. I mean, there was so much shit he could've said back, but he should have stayed in the pocket.

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       I was just like, I was watching that the way I was watching like a comedian and a Heckler, you know? Then I was reading, I was rooting for the, I was rooting for the DJ. There's room for the DJ in that one, provided if that the guy stole. If he didn't, either way it was fucking entertaining, you know, nice Twitter battle then. Nice. Is it funny how I'm not into robots driving cars, but I like a, I like, I like it. I like a good Twitter back and forth. You know, that's the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. I'm, you come some music once again. We always post at the MM podcast. A Twitter feed will always tell you what the music is. Andrew always posted. I don't know what it is. I am an old man. I am just, I am just now trying to update, um, my music.

Speaker 2:          00:36:05       Oh my God. I gotta tell you what I was doing the other day. Holy Shit. I was listening to a, I downloaded all this shit, right? Alabama shakes. Fucking love the new one. That album that they have was to shit. The weekend. I'll listen to that. Actually liked that shit. I got to tell you what was funny though was Ah, fuck. I already forgot his name. Kendrick Lamar. I'm so fucking old. Help me out here guys. I, I don't know anything that's going on with any of these people. Kendrick Lamar, I'm sitting there, I have to admit, I did have this old guy thought and I was embarrassed that I had it. I was listening to his album and I get to this song and he just keeps going. This dick ain't free. Right. And I'm just, and all I could just kept thinking was this one a grammy.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       And I'm not saying it didn't deserve it, but I don't know what the people look like, who fucking vote for the grammys. But the way people complain about it and now they're always giving it to white people. Right. Like the Oscars, I'm imagining it's a bunch of white people in 50s and 60s right. It takes a while. I would think to establish yourself enough to even be considered, you know, to be on that shit. And I'm just picturing all these fucking 50 and 60 year old white people just sitting there and listening to these dick ain't free. Right. And they go like, you know, like they can relate to that on some level going, I had this like connects with me, I'm going to vote with this. You know, they probably just drive down the hood and stand there for 20 minutes and count how many times somebody drives by d eight, three driving by and they are right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       There's enough people listened to it. We've got to give it to them. Um, so anyways, but it is the embarrassing thing I was in, I was, I listened to too. I got to make sure I say his name right. It's Ed. Is it Sheehan? Uh, for fuck sakes belts. You don't know any, I did call him with this guy. He was fucking great. I think he's great. I just don't fuck it. Sharon. Sharon will go share it. And I was listening to his album and I was this, I was listening to that song. One, I was listening to Ed Sheeran, one in, uh, in a Toyota Prius and I was sitting there going, I am enjoying this. Like what happened to me? I used to be, I and I used to fucking listen. I want to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:38:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       But when I really look back at the shit that I used to think was bad, as some of it was bad as stuff, a lot of it, you know, say which people will say about a sensitive fellow like this Ed Eddie here, right. You know, he does dress like a man, unlike the bands that I listened to in the 80s where they came up just full on. Not only did they dress like chicks, they dress like hot chicks trying to hang on. They, they, they were really like the first house, a real housewives when you look back at a lot of it, you know what I mean? Um, I guess still they were still in their prime in their twenties. Um, I dunno. So whatever those are the albums that I was listening to this week. I literally went from 1970 82, you know, I went from like 19, I don't know, late sixties to late eighties was what the Fuck I've been listening to for the last, I don't know how many since I worked in a fucking warehouse in the 80s. And then I immediately went to like 2014, 2015, 2016. And uh, I, I survived. I somehow survived and I actually enjoy the shit so it, um, I dunno, I dunno if it's going to help me.

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       I don't know what the point of it is, but all I know is it's, it's

Speaker 4:          00:39:54       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       I don't know. That's funny to me. This deck eight free Lao of, of the year. Um, I'll listen to it more. I'll try to, I mean, it's going into some really white ears here though. It's probably actually a, uh, it probably says more about him as an artist if I don't get it, you know what I mean? Then if I get it, he probably doesn't want me to get it. Like, I don't want some 48 year old white guy like in my shit. Um, oh, maybe I'm wrong. The fuck do I know. Anyways, fuck off. I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       hey, what's going on? And spelt births the Monday morning podcasts on Monday, June 14th, 2010. How the hell

Speaker 9:          00:41:34       are you? Are you good? Did you have a good weekend? Did you, did you go down to that place with the thing I heard it was nice. What's it nice? It is nice. All that's nice. My son, he had a recital this weekend and we were so nervous. He was all a flustered and more suburban. Talk about shit that nobody cares about because frank was in the back with the garden hose. It froze up over the wedding. So we have to buy a new one of those. So you know, Frank Corsi goes on the Internet and he just starts researching all about those holos houses. Okay. All right. Yeah. I don't know. Can you imagine just these sitting there at the end of a culdesac like that is your fucking reality. Rather than having a wine cellar, I would just have a secret room of fucking porn with Kleenex for me. The rub one out or just sit there crying at what became of my life. I need, can you go out and fix his bicycle? No. Why doesn't he go climb a fucking tree?

Speaker 4:          00:42:42       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:42:43       Jesus Christ. What? What did they do in the 18 hundreds you want to? Why the environment so fucked up? That's it right there buddy. You just don't want to go out. It'd be a part of your kids' lives. I don't. That's why I told you I enjoyed condoms. I didn't enjoy condoms. I just didn't want to bust one in you without one on and now I did. And now look at it. Look at my face sweetheart. Can't you see the misery?

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       Fuck them.

Speaker 9:          00:43:10       Well, he half looks like, Yo, you go fix this fucking bike. I'm not yelling. I'm no, I'm not

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       [inaudible] first testicle. [inaudible] somewhat tunic and dangle master the forest with the [inaudible]. I can show you the trade case files to these guys, to his cohorts, asleep in the chair.

Speaker 10:         00:44:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:44:02       twice. Don't take shit from anybody. Question Mark, Bill. Sometimes you end your podcast with go fuck yourselves and don't take shit from anyone. Well, let me tell you my story. Back in November, a cop pulled me over, roughed me up, was a huge asshole and wrote up every rinky dinky ticket he could.

Speaker 9:          00:44:24       Okay, now wait a minute. What happened? You were just driving down the street and this guy just pulled you over. I need a little bit of the backstory. Here was this guy, did you know, did he get into a big fight with his wife and then took it out on you or we did you say something wise to the guy and he said, all right, I'm not in the fucking mood anyways, let's see if we can figure it out here. At the end of the altercation, I shook his hand, look him straight in the eyes and gave him that look that says, I will see you in court, asshole. I showed up in court this Monday to defend myself. My plan was to stand before that asshole and having him explain his actions to me in a court of law. And Dude, this ain't gonna workout unless she had a witness. I wanted to ask him. Even then, that doesn't work out. I wanted to ask them if twisting my arm so much that I couldn't use it for a few days was justified. I wanted to ask him why he decided that me five, six 175 pounds was a threat to him. Six foot to six foot three 250 that he need to hit me from behind. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:45:28       don't call me an Asshole, but I'm not 100% by in this story. Cause you didn't say what happened before this. This guy just did this. Is this guy like the fucking worst cop ever? I don't know. Here we go. I wanted to, I wanted to know why he needed to demean me while I was handcuffed in the back of the patty wagon. I then wanted to ask him how many excessive force complaints he had against him. The answer is four of shit. So I'm wrong here. I wanted to ask him how his marriage ended. His ex wife has a restraining order against him for domestic violence. Alright, I tap out. You're right. You're right. Sorry. Uh, I wanted to ask him what part of protect and serve did he not understand? I wanted to end the questioning with him explaining how he got caught on a cell phone camera.

Speaker 9:          00:46:13       Assaulting a motorist. You can look up the video on youtube under Milwaukee police. Lambeau driver, l a m B o driver. Here's what sucks in Milwaukee. If the cop that wrote you the ticket, this doesn't show up in court, your case is dismissed and you don't have to pay anything. Well, guess, guess why I told you that the piece of shit didn't show up in court. Ah, that's awful. I need advice. Do I let this all be water under the bridge or do I take this fucker down? I really want justice, but I don't want to be beaten by other cops. What should I do? Um,

Speaker 9:          00:46:52       well I think you just shed some light. Milwaukee police, Lambeau driver. All my listeners will probably look up and watch that. Um, no, this guy sounds like a dangerous guy. Look, you know, this is, this is what I would do if I was going to try to take this dude down. What I would do is, you know what the local news loves doing now. They love showing like youtube videos and they love talking about Twitter and all that type of stuff because they're desperately trying to get the kids in people cause they're losing all this viewership to a, to the Internet. So the fact

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       that you, you have this controversial thing, you have this fucked up law and you have a youtube video of this guy, um, that makes, that's like one of those perfect little pieces, you know, coming up next Milwaukee police officer a little out of line, check out the youtube video that everybody's been talking about, all the lower that you could go that way. Uh, but yeah, I mean you're, you're taking a a, you're definitely going to take a fucking risk.

Speaker 5:          00:48:01       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       you know, so you know, Rodney King died this week and that brought up that whole video and all that type of shit. And I know, you know, the guy just pulled over. That's what you supposed to do. I know. I mean, look, whose kid knew Rodney King was going to get beat down no matter what. I mean, if you've run from the fucking cops, I don't give a fuck who you are. You've got to get beat down. But if you get back up, you charge him a couple of times absent fucking loosely. But you know, there's gotta be a way to take a guy down without giving them 12 fucking skull fractures. You know what I'm saying? It's, I don't know. It's, it's, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       it's a fucking fabulous job and then it's a really dangerous job. If, if the wrong kind of person gets, uh, gets the job, why didn't my phone just go off? Oh, that's right. I gotta do that Shit. So, um, I don't know. Personally, I can't, I can't ever watch that Rodney King thing again. That's like fucking most brutal thing ever. And actually when you watch that, now you go, thank God they got fucking a, what do you call those things? Taser. What do you call? What do you Cleo, what do you call those things? What do they call those things that you, they just, uh, they zap you. Do you guys ever see that one? Um, that one where they, the cop. What the fuck do you call those things? He got tased. He got fucking, is it a taser? Cleo? Why am I so dumb?

Speaker 5:          00:49:29       Ah, fucking love this dog. You know that Cleo? MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       Underrated. Having a dog. It's the best fucking thing ever. Anyways, this, this I got, I got to get you this youtube video. Now that I brought it up. It's a, it's basically, they're doing a demonstration of one of those fucking things. Whatever the fuck you call them. That I just can't think, why do I keep saying it's a taser? I know. It's not a, is it a taser? He got tazed. I don't care. Fuck it. My brain is mush. So anyways, there's one cop gonna Zap another cop to a, the demonstrate it to the class and look, man, I don't give a fuck how much of a man you are. You get fucking Zap with electricity. You're going to make a noise. Most guys go like all raw and they fucking go down a, um, this guy fucking shoots it at the guy. And this dude sounds like he's like ending an opera. He gets, he's like

Speaker 9:          00:50:28       just fucking drunk. He does literally

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       something like that and drops. And I just love how the cop who shoots them tries to act like he just didn't scream out like a little fucking girl. Man. It's hilarious. But uh, but getting back to that, yeah, dude, that's, that's a serious, um, that's a serious thing. And you and you, you know, if this guy really is as bad as you're saying,

Speaker 5:          00:50:55       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:56       the right thing is not to let it go. The right thing is to try and shed some light on it and hopefully that they can get this guy off the force because he's given decent cops a bad name. There you go. So, but your, your worries are definitely a, you know, valid.

Speaker 9:          00:51:16       I mean, considering none of those cops during the Rodney King, none of them got fucking, they got, they got off. He can get off doing that. I mean, Jesus Christ, you know, that dude who shot that kid on that platform and in Oakland that was fucking brutal. He's like, oh, I thought it was my a was my house keys. I didn't realize it was my gun. And he fucking got away with that. I'm not trashing cops, I'm just saying, I'm not saying they're all fucking bad, but I'm just saying it's a, it's practically fucking impossible.

Speaker 5:          00:51:47       Um,

Speaker 9:          00:51:48       it literally, even if you have video, I think you have to have the combination of having video and then you have to be, you have to be a certain level of a wealth and influence because if you're broke, you know, I don't think that they're, that, you know, you, there's no way they're just going to be like, yeah, go fuck yourself. You'd done, you know, and then when you add racism into it, I mean, you're pretty much, it's pretty much game set match, which is fucking unfortunate. So, um, I don't know. I'm talking about society way beyond my fucking intellect, so I'm going to tap out here.

Speaker 4:          00:52:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       Alrighty. Trash. Fucking hair metal. And I'm gonna have fucking angry, uh, psycho cops.

Speaker 4:          00:52:29       I don't really [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          00:52:58       Um, all right. Lights, camera dumped bill. I'm a 29 year old guy and recently broke up with a funny attractive and all around Greg girl. Oh Gee. Why Sir would you do that? You ask. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:53:12       Um,

Speaker 9:          00:53:13       two things. Her Dad was born without teeth and you're worried your baby will [inaudible] if you braid with her or,

Speaker 5:          00:53:20       or a,

Speaker 9:          00:53:22       she has got something going on in the vaginal area, some sort of odor stinky pussy. I don't know. Well, here we go. Well, let me tell you, this girl and I had been dating for about three months and we had a great thing going. She's half Afro Cuban, half Puerto Rican and really sexy. She had a rough upbringing, but I didn't care because she's honest, easy going and not bitchy. Like so many girls I've dated. She was a bit needy, but I didn't mind. Um, we were out at a bar one night having a few drinks and I was feeling pretty good. I was looking at a couple of floozies at the end of the bar and I asked her if she's ever been with another woman. She coyly looked at me and said, yes, good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude, this is a fucking fantasy right here. Fucking red shoe diaries. And then I proceeded with, have you ever been in a threesome with two girls and a guy again? She answered yes. Okay. Kind of slutty, but I'm no saint. While I couldn't stop the, Oh God, you're going to go for the rotisserie question. What's in the box? Ah, here we go. Here we go. Strap yourselves in for this one. Well, I couldn't stop there, so I asked, have you ever had a threesome with two guys?

Speaker 9:          00:54:40       She looked down at the ground and she looked up a bit ashamed, Lee and said yes. Wow. Skank alert. I thought I then asked her one more question. I knew this one could back for where the fuck do you go from here? Like throwing the high heat to Albert Albert pool host. I finally asked, wait, have you ever been in a porn? She then blushed and look me in the eye and said, yeah, I looked at her calmly and was like, oh, but inside I was like, Jesus fucking Christ. Yes. Well, you should, you know those first couple. I mean, you can look at it. Let, let's, let's break this down here. All right. She's been with a, she's had a threesome with another girl and a guy who gets that. That's who gives a fuck right there. All right. You're already knew she banged another guy. All right? But, uh, the fact that she also did it with another girl, that takes a little fucking, uh, that tones down his dick in her pussy. Right? This is how guys think. Women, I'm sorry. All right. That's something that, that's something in the, uh,

Speaker 9:          00:55:54       the credit. Is it the credit bill? Why, why, why do you try to talk accounting? Shit. You're too dumb. All right, that one's all right. The two guys thing. Now you can look the other way on that. Maybe if if it was in another state, but it can't be in the same state because if you run into one of the two guys that fucking, you know, we're high fiving is they fucking banged our, that mean I d I dunno about that one. But then the third one she did a porno. I mean, yeah, no, that's a, you've got to walk away from that or are you have to go to NASA to get tested for the latest fucking STDs, I would think. And then also God knows what's going on. Uh, mentally that you would do that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:56:42       What? I just like sex. No, no, no. There's something going on. Who doesn't like sex? I don't know. Anyways, plowing ahead. See, so she egos. So basically she had moved down to Los Angeles when she was 20. She's now 25 and after a short stint in the military, somehow she got into the porn industry for eight months. She did everything [inaudible]. Fox sucked the whole Shebang. I asked her if I could see her video, but she wouldn't tell me her performer name. It said vehemently that it would be impossible to find her body of work. I asked her why she got into porn and she replies because I wanted some feeling in my life and then he rides down. G is, yeah, dude. Ah, this poor girl. Something happened to her. The thing was she was clean, had a good job and I really liked her and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously, you know, it was funny, there was something you wrote the beginning where I just thought she was going to be good. 29 year old guy, attractive all around Greg girl.

Speaker 9:          00:57:47       Oh, the fact that you said she had a rough brain upbringing, but she was easygoing and honest and not bitchy right there. I was like, that girl's good in bed. It just seemed like a kind of free open person. I don't know. I didn't know if she was going to be that open. Oh Geez. Um, anyways, the thing was she was clean and I have a bla. The sex was great, but I couldn't stop picturing her in some sleazy porno that was probably filmed in some junkyard on labrea. So I went to ask for a friend's advice. Most of my guys were telling me to dumper my gay friends told me it was fabulous and that I should overlook it. I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends because they would automatically reject her and assume I had aids. There you go. Keep your options open. So regretfully I dumped her.

Speaker 9:          00:58:38       I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell her it was because she was a porn star because she would have been ashamed for the rest of her life. And I was happy that she was honest with me. I've done my fair share of sleeves, but this was too much. My question bill was, Bill, my question bill, was it wrong for me to dump or for some decisions she made years ago? Should I have stayed with her? What would have you done? Um, oh, you don't want to know what I would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate. So let's you, you seem like a good person. Um, dude, when you're trying to find the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, you have to have a list of criteria. All right. Sound like you're still young, so there's no reason to compromise. All right? I mean, when you get with somebody like that and you're going to live with them and you will, you get with anybody, you're taking on all of their fucking baggage.

Speaker 9:          00:59:34       All right? You're only three months in and you know, people who go into the porn industry, they're, you know, it's like people would come, comedians were not healthy individuals. Okay. And that is like a specific area that I just, I just, this is just my own personal nonmedical feeling that you're just not a healthy person. Something awful happened and that line, I just wanted to feel something. I mean, something bad happened to her, caused her to wall herself off. I don't even want to try to guess what, but you know, there's nothing wrong with anything that she did personally, you know, technically, and she was honest with it. It all comes down to whether or not you want to deal with it. All right? And if you feel that you know, you want to deal with it and that there was this sort of connection that you just had, this girl had to be in your life, then you're going to have to learn to live with it and get past it. Um, but I would be definitely, I would definitely be concerned with, uh, certain mental issues, um, now like she's insane. And then I would also be concerned with, uh, sexual boundaries, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:01:01       Like would she have any, and could she remain faithful after a while and when you settle into the seven year itch or whatever, and you really start needing to work at the relationship and it's feeling boring and she needs to feel something again, is she going to go back to that leather couch from that show? Martin my n, you know, down on fucking the valley and get banged again. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. That is a, a, that is, you know what, that is beyond my skills. I don't know how to tame that horse. I could tell you that right fucking now. I don't, I have no fucking clue. That's a a, you know what, that's a Dr drew question. That is a classic Dr Drew Question. And that guy, within two seconds we'll get right to the core of it. I would call, I would call in love line, man, if you're out here, call him up.

Speaker 9:          01:01:56       Cause that's a, that's a great one. Um, yeah, I guess you'd have to figure out is, is, has she worked through whatever the fuck she was working through and now she's ready to, I mean, I dunno. Hey, those are some good looking girls down there. And she's like, yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean, if you kept steering in that direction, you'd probably get fucking threesome right there. Um, so there's that, there's that option. The option that you have is if you're with her, like I think that that's, that's a selfish fucking and a shallow reason to stay with somebody longterm.

Speaker 4:          01:02:35       Uh, yeah. Jesus. I don't know.

Speaker 10:         01:03:05       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       red fish markets to police in the corner gun and Phil, you, yes, photos he did for like a breath for the shooter said please don't do that. [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          01:03:33       Um, all right. Beef curtain advice. And for those of you in the states, that's a slang for the WHO, Huh? Beef curtains. Do the math. Think about it. All right, you ready? Okay, here we go. Here's the situation. I have a wonderful girl in my life. Uh, what in one she doesn't know how to fuck. That's what I'm guessing. I'm guessing this is where it's going. I have wonderful girl in my life. Great attitude, humor, big tits, nice ass and a good family. Jesus Christ. Dude, marry this girl. Sure. It seems good for now. But I have one issue. She also has some mean beef curtains and he put in parentheses, Pussy Lips. Just in case I didn't know a, that kind of bugged me. Bug the ever living shit out of me. Whenever we get down to the dirty business. So much a, so to the point I looked up some cosmetic surgery that basically gives the beef curtains a trim job and beauties the vagina. Wow. Dude. Why? All right. Now, before I read the rest of this, if you're going to fucking ask me how to have this conversation, like listen, love, I love you, I love you, I love you family. I love you, your heart, everything. But is there any way you can trim your beef curtains?

Speaker 9:          01:04:51       Maybe you can get away with it cause you've got that cool accent. I don't know. But she has it too, so she's not going to give a fuck. You can maybe pull this off with some foreign chick anyways. Um, so he looks up cosmetic surgery to try on a beautiful vagina. Now I know by now I must sound like a douchebag focusing on the little things. No, cause women do that too. Women focus on little things like that, that that's a serious issue. Dude. Sex is a big fucking thing. But anyways, he says what my thinking is I'm truly gonna pull the trigger. He spelt it that way and keep this woman all the myself for the rest of my life. RNI entitled to have a great looking Vage to look at for as long as our bodies don't wrinkle away. Wow. I know there's a lot of women are fucking annoyed by this one.

Speaker 9:          01:05:43       Yeah. Went by. She a fucking Dick in your wrinkled balls. Why don't you get a face lift for your sack there buddy. I know they're all say that I'm, how can I ever bring this option up to her without, I knew he's going to ask me without completely destroying her feelings or making her hate me for being so pussy conscious. Thanks for the read. Now go fuck yourself. All right. This is a simple one, dude. There is no fucking way you can bring that up to her without absolutely completely destroying her feelings. So you either need to accept this or you have to, you have to let her go. That's it. That's it. I mean, I would think that if you actually truly cared about this girl, now all the chicks are going to be like, oh,

Speaker 11:         01:06:28       I know he had a heart underneath all those c words.

Speaker 9:          01:06:33       Um, if you truly care about this girl, uh, I would think that that wouldn't matter. You know and if she looks the way she, she's saying you saying that she looks, I mean what, what are we talking here? Like how far down these things hanging isn't like you know, I mean if she got him both of them piers could you like do like a, could you like a better, let's say, could you be like the like that Olympic, the fuck is that thing who you're on the rings. Could you do that and still swing your feet up and not hit her pussy and we talking like it's that bad. You know if you did the iron cross would your head be in her pussy? Like how far these things hanging down? Hey now

Speaker 11:         01:07:15       what's the deal with deep gardens?

Speaker 9:          01:07:17       All right dude, there's no way there's, there's no fucking way and don't don't do that to her cause she can't do anything about that. If she had a problem with her fucking vaginal area you would have known by now because she would have been self conscious and she would have brought it up the way. Sometimes girls do about parts of their bodies and they are super self conscious about their bodies because we're so fucking visual. All right. I told you one time when the first girls I ever hooked up with, when I got her shirt off and her bra off, she rolled her eyes and I thought she was thinking that. I was like, oh my God. Like I'm not doing it for like she's rolling her eyes. Like this guy's lame. And I found out later she was self conscious about the size of her breasts. So I totally took it the wrong fucking way. I made it all about me cause I'm self involved. So a Duh. Yeah, don't do that to her. All right. Either you can. That's when you just suddenly have in your head. Either you accept that shit or you move on, but there's no reason to hurt this person because you're a shallow Kent like me. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       All right. Cheers mate. [inaudible] [inaudible].
