00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.712 align:start size:72% position:28%
IT SMELLS LIKE YOU SOLD
YOUR ASS TO THE DEVIL.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.614 align:start size:53% position:47%
That came from
the pits of hell.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.682 align:start position:0%
WELL, HOW BIG IS IT,
HOW LONG IS IT ?

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.317 align:start size:47% position:53%

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.019 align:start position:0%
( laughing )

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:02.421 align:start size:94% position:6%

WHY Y'ALL-- THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:06.492 align:start size:75% position:25%
I GOT A DAMN TWO-BY-FOUR

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.230 align:start size:63% position:38%
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:12.398 align:start size:44% position:56%
Uh-huh.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:15.668 align:start size:66% position:34%

RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:19.705 align:start position:0%
( laughing )

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:23.209 align:start size:50% position:50%
I'M GLAD Y'ALL

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.744 align:start size:94% position:6%
Okay.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.079 size:88% position:56%
YOU'RE PROBABLY JACKING OFF
ON THE STEERING WHEELS, TOO,

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:28.347 align:start size:41% position:59%
DON'T YOU ?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.615 align:start position:0%
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.751 size:88% position:44%
HOW LONG DOES IT LOOK LIKE
IT'S BEEN SITTING IN THERE ?

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:36.689 align:start size:53% position:47%
STEAM IS COMING
OFF OF IT, OKAY ?

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.791 align:start position:0%
STEAM IS COMING
OFF OF IT ?

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start size:31% position:69%

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:46.065 align:start position:0%
IT COULDN'T BE THERE
THAT LONG THEN, HUH ?

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:49.335 align:start size:59% position:41%
I AM TAKING--
IT'S A FRESH TURD !

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.971 align:start position:0%
Okay, what you
need to do...

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:55.408

BACK, AND WE'LL MATCH IT UP.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.642 align:start position:0%
WE GOT A LINE-UP.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
WE'LL MATCH IT UP WITH
THE OTHER TURDS THAT WE HAVE.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.549 size:88% position:56%
WELL, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS
LEARN HOW TO USE A TOILET.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.184 align:start position:0%
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BRING
THE TURD BACK TO ME ?

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.185 align:start size:38% position:63%
NO.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.354 align:start size:50% position:50%
I'M STARTING
TO LIKE IT.

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:09.889 align:start position:0%
You're gonna keep
it as a pet ?

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:12.725
I'M GONNA KEEP IT, 'CAUSE IT'S
A NICE LITTLE-- YOU KNOW WHAT ?

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.161 align:start size:59% position:41%
IT'S A NICE
CONVERSATION PIECE.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.229 align:start position:0%
OKAY, COOL.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.597 align:start size:34% position:66% line:92%
