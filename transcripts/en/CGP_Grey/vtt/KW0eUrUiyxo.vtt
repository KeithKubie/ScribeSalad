00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Before this video loaded you probably watched an ad and/or one will appear right about...

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.460
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.360
now.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.900
How did this exact ad get on this video?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.840
And, what you really want to know, how much money do these things make?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
Okay, there are three players in this game.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.080
Creators who create videos, advertisers who make the ads, and YouTube, who plays matchmaker matchmaker making the match.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.740
Now, unlike old dying media where a dude in a room could place ads on predictable known content at a leisurely schedule,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.240
YouTube doesn't work like that. Can't work like that, because on YouTube, there is no schedule.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.120
At any moment a wild viral video can appear.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.360
On a normal day 65 years' worth of video are uploaded to YouTube,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.680
and people watch a billion hours of video.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.980
It's an endless waterfall of random content that just keeps growing.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.160
Hiring enough humans to categorize all of those videos and match ads to them would be impossible,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.000
This, is a job for bots.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.200
The moment each new video is uploaded, YouTube's bots get to work, looking at the title, the keywords, the captions, the comments, the controversy,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.500
All to make their best guess as to what category it belongs in.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.180
Meanwhile, advertisers tell their own bots what category of videos they want their ads to run against, and what kind to avoid.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.360
And here is where YouTube earns their money: between when you click on a video and when it plays, a YouTube bot holds an auction,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.760
announcing the categories it's guessed the video is in, opening the floor to all interested advertiser bots to place their bids.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.740
The winning advertiser bot is the one with the ad that will most likely make YouTube and the creator the most money at that instant.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.260
But that's not necessarily the highest bidder -- different ads pay in different ways.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.200
For example,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.480
skippable video ads, the advertiser doesn't pay if the viewer skips as soon as they can.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.260
The advertiser only pays if their ad is clicked or watched.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.680
A super high bid means nothing if the ad is super boring.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.900
No clicks equals no dollars for YouTube or the creator.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.020
So, there's a bias against boring: the auctioneer bot will prefer a lower bid for an ad with a higher click rate,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.120
than a higher bid for an ad with a lower click rate.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.720
But boring is in the eye of the beholder,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.000
so in addition to YouTube's bots trying to guess what the video is about,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.160
there are bots that try to guess what the viewer is about.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.300
Looking at their watch history and device and activity to try and guess their age, chromosomes, income, location, and interests.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.120
This information, too, is part of the auction,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.140
and the advertisers can instruct their bots to only bid to specific demographics in specific locations in specific categories,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200
and only up to specific amounts.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.000
So whatever ad you saw before this video didn't plan to be there, it was the result of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.160
bot guesses about the video, and bot guesses about you, and bot bids for your attention at that exact millisecond.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.480
Watch videos from this channel on the device of someone demographically different and you'll see different kinds of ads.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.400
You should try it with this video on at least two or three or four...

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
look watch this video on a lot of different devices.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.980
Anyway,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.940
If you want to know how much advertisers pay YouTube and creators, there isn't one answer.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500
It's all an insta-auction and varies wildly by video category,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.000
the viewers, the time of year, advertising budget, how many auctions are happening at that exact moment,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.040
and how full they are.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.580
It's millions of matches a minute of supply and demand.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.760
Channels with prized demographics may earn five times as much per view as other channels.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.320
But....

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.400
You and I both know there's still some kind of average number.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.340
Something to use as a ballpark, and that's what you want to know.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.280
On average,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.420
this number,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.180
how many Benjamins?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.320
Okay, a reasonable estimate is one view is worth

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.880
one quarter

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.180
one quarter of one penny,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.500
one quarter of one penny, split between YouTube and the creator.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.600
which is the first time a penny has proven too great a measure of value.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.120
So, a better way to think about it is 1000 views generates about $2.50 of advertising dollars.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.260
YouTube then splits that money between the creator and themselves, fifty five - forty five

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.460
About $1.40 for the creator and $1.10 for YouTube.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.500
Or, if you want to think big about it,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.780
every million views is $1,400 for the creator, and $1,100 for YouTube.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.300
again,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.420
On average.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.360
Particular channels might be splitting 50 cents per thousand or 4.50 per thousand.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.720
It all depends on the auction.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.980
So that's how it works.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.460
A Niagara of content, sorted and sold by bots, to bots, for humans to watch.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.760
* background music moves to foreground *

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:34.340
* end slate music *
