00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.530
Here I'm going to actually show you the, focal length and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.160
the field of views using this chart, as we go in forward.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.240
So, the field of view was 120 degrees, in the horizontal,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.850
when we were looking at 12 millimeter lens.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.460
When we move to 24, 74 degrees, 15 millimeter, 40 degrees,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.770
85 millimeter, 24 degrees, 116 millimeter, 17 degrees,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.000
9 degrees field of view for 220 millimeter, and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.220
300 millimeter basically shows 7 degrees, so much closer viewpoint.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.050
Interesting way of looking at how we can go from a focal length of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.620
12 millimeters to 300 millimeters and how the field of view changes.
