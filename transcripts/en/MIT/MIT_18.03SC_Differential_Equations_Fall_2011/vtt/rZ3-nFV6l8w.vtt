00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
y prime and y double prime.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.079
So, q of x times y 
equal zero.

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:15.612
The linearity of the equation,
that is, the form in which it

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:20.152
appears is going to be the key
idea today.

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:25.467
Today is going to be
theoretical, but some of the

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:32.000
ideas in it are the most
important in the course.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.951
So, I don't have to apologize
for the theory.

00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:45.797
Remember, the solution method
was to find two independent y

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:51.613
one, y two
independent solutions.

00:00:51.613 --> 00:01:00.000
And now, I'll formally write
out what independent means.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.238
There are different ways to say
it.

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:07.142
But for you,
I think the simplest and most

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:12.666
intelligible will be to say that
y2 is not to be a constant

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.904
multiple of y1.
And, unfortunately,

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:20.476
it's necessary to add,
nor is y1 to be a constant

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:24.190
multiple.
I have to call it by different

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.095
constants.
So, let's call this one c prime

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:31.389
of y2.
Well, I mean,

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.663
the most obvious question is,
well, look.

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:41.646
If this is not a constant times
that, this can't be there

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:46.454
because I would just use one
over c if it was.

00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:51.049
Unfortunately,
the reason I have to write it

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.673
this way is to take account of
the possibility that y1 might be

00:01:57.673 --> 00:01:59.704
zero.
If y1 is zero,

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:06.221
so, the bad case that must be
excluded is that y1 equals zero,

00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:10.936
y2 nonzero.
I don't want to call those

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.021
independent.
But nonetheless,

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.819
it is true that y2 is not a
constant multiple of y1.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.797
However, y1 is a constant
multiple of y2,

00:02:19.797 --> 00:02:23.968
namely, the multiple zero.
It's just to exclude that case

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:26.872
that I have to say both of those
things.

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:33.121
And, one would not be sufficed.
That's a fine point that I'm

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.468
not going to fuss over.
But I just have,

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:41.257
of course.
Now, why do you do that?

00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:45.159
That's because,
then, all solutions,

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.063
and this is what concerns us
today, are what?

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:56.417
The linear combination with
constant coefficients of these

00:02:56.417 --> 00:03:02.659
two, and the fundamental
question we have to answer today

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.909
is, why?
Now, there are really two

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.030
statements involved in that.
On the one hand,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.012
I'm claiming there is an easier
statement, which is that they

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:24.900
are all solutions.
So, that's question one,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.788
or statement one.
Why are all of these guys

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:33.797
solutions?
That, I could trust you to

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:37.046
answer yourself.
I could not trust you to answer

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:39.950
it elegantly.
And, it's the elegance that's

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.029
the most important thing today
because you have to answer it

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.795
elegantly.
Otherwise, you can't go on and

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:50.666
do more complicated things.
If you answer it in an ad hoc

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:54.538
basis just by hacking out a
computation, you don't really

00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:58.064
see what's going on.
And you can't do more difficult

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:02.185
things later.
So, we have to answer this,

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:05.748
and answer it nicely.
The second question is,

00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:09.796
so, if that answers why there
are solutions at all,

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:14.087
why are they all the solutions?
Why all the solutions?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.811
In other words,
to say it as badly as possible,

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.940
why are all solutions,
why all the solutions-- Never

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.450
mind.
Why are all the solutions.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.308
This is a harder question to
answer, but that should make you

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:34.085
happy because that means it
depends upon a theorem which I'm

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:40.950
not going to prove.
I'll just quote to you.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.822
Let's attack there for problem
one first.

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:56.239
q1 is answered by what's called
the superposition.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:05.000
The superposition principle
says exactly that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.108
It says exactly that,
that if y1 and y2 are solutions

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:12.980
to a linear equation,
to a linear homogeneous ODE,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.325
in fact it can be of higher
order, too, although I won't

00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:19.459
stress that.
In other words,

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:23.330
you don't have to stop with the
second derivative.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.807
You could add a third
derivative and a fourth

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:30.125
derivative.
As long as the former makes the

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:34.392
same, but that implies
automatically that c1 y1 plus c2

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:39.225
y2 is a solution.
Now, the way to do that nicely

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:43.675
is to take a little detour and
talk a little bit about linear

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:46.567
operators.
And, since we are going to be

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:51.166
using these for the rest of the
term, this is the natural place

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:54.800
for you to learn a little bit
about what they are.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.508
So, I'm going to do it.
Ultimately, I am aimed at a

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:02.143
proof of this statement,
but there are going to be

00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:06.000
certain side excursions I have
to make.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.656
The first side side excursion
is to write the differential

00:06:10.656 --> 00:06:15.477
equation in a different way.
So, I'm going to just write its

00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:19.153
transformations.
The first, I'll simply recopy

00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:22.339
what you know it to be,
q y equals zero.

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.444
That's the first form.
The second form,

00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm going to replace this by
the differentiation operator.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.516
So, I'm going to write this as
D squared y.

00:06:35.516 --> 00:06:38.328
That means differentiate it
twice.

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:42.503
D it, and then D it again.
This one I only have to

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:46.593
differentiate once,
so I'll write that as p D(y),

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:50.513
p times the derivative of Y.
The last one isn't

00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:53.837
differentiated at all.
I just recopy it.

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:57.501
Now, I'm going to formally
factor out the y.

00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:02.869
So this, I'm going to turn into
D squared plus pD plus q.

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:07.887
Now, everybody reads this as

00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:13.147
times y equals zero.
But, what it means is this guy,

00:07:13.147 --> 00:07:16.757
it means this is shorthand for
that.

00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:21.502
I'm not multiplying.
I'm multiplying q times y.

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:25.008
But, I'm not multiplying D
times y.

00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:28.915
I'm applying D to y.
Nonetheless,

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.956
the notation suggests this is
very suggestive of that.

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:35.320
And this, in turn,
implies that.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.361
I'm just transforming it.
And now, I'll take the final

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:42.106
step.
I'm going to view this thing in

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:46.148
parentheses as a guy all by
itself, a linear operator.

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:50.037
This is a linear operator,
called a linear operator.

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:54.154
And, I'm going to simply
abbreviate it by the letter L.

00:07:54.154 --> 00:07:58.577
And so, the final version of
this equation has been reduced

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:03.000
to nothing but Ly equals zero.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.849
Now, what's L?
You can think of L as,

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:09.411
well, formally,
L you would write as D squared

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.844
plus pD plus q.
But, you can think of L,

00:08:13.844 --> 00:08:18.514
the way to think of it is as a
black box, a function of what

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:22.709
goes into the black box,
well, if this were a function

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:27.696
box, what would go it would be a
number, and what would come out

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:31.100
with the number.
But it's not that kind of a

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.828
black box.
It's an operator box,

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:38.573
and therefore,
what goes in is a function of

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:41.359
x.
And, what comes out is another

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:44.929
function of x,
the result of applying this

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:48.848
operator to that.
So, from this point of view,

00:08:48.848 --> 00:08:52.505
differential equations,
trying to solve the

00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:57.469
differential equation means,
what should come out you want

00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:00.691
to come out zero,
and the question is,

00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:05.729
what should you put in?
That's what it means solving

00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:08.446
differential equations in an
inverse problem.

00:09:08.446 --> 00:09:11.966
The easy thing is to put it a
function, and see what comes

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.387
out.
You just calculate.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.845
The hard thing is to ask,
you say, I want such and such a

00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:18.698
thing to come out,
for example,

00:09:18.698 --> 00:09:22.095
zero; what should I put in?
That's a difficult question,

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:25.121
and that's what we're spending
the term answering.

00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:28.394
Now, the key thing about this
is that this is a linear

00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:32.769
operator.
And, what that means is that it

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:37.236
behaves in a certain way with
respect to functions.

00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:42.507
The easiest way to say it is,
I like to make two laws of it,

00:09:42.507 --> 00:09:45.991
that L of u1,
if you have two functions,

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.743
I'm not going to put up the
parentheses, x,

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:55.282
because that just makes things
look longer and not any clearer,

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:58.587
actually.
What does L do to the sum of

00:09:58.587 --> 00:10:03.262
two functions?
If that's a linear operator,

00:10:03.262 --> 00:10:08.111
if you put in the sum of two
functions, what you must get out

00:10:08.111 --> 00:10:12.393
is the corresponding L's,
the sum of the corresponding

00:10:12.393 --> 00:10:14.737
L's of each.
So, that's a law.

00:10:14.737 --> 00:10:17.404
And, the other law,
linearity law,

00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:21.282
and this goes for anything in
mathematics and its

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:24.191
applications,
which is called linear,

00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:29.121
basically anything is linear if
it does the following thing to

00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:33.000
functions or numbers or
whatever.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.254
The other one is of a constant
times any function,

00:10:37.254 --> 00:10:41.769
I don't have to give it a
number now because I'm only

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:46.023
using one of them,
should be equal to c times L of

00:10:46.023 --> 00:10:48.455
u.
So, here, c is a constant,

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:51.928
and here, of course,
the u is a function,

00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:55.401
functions of x.
These are the two laws of

00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:58.613
linearity.
An operator is linear if it

00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:03.150
satisfies these two laws.
Now, for example,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.398
the differentiation operator is
such an operator.

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.481
D is linear,
why?

00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:11.406
Well, because of the very first
things you verify after you

00:11:11.406 --> 00:11:15.060
learn what the derivative is
because the derivative of,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.428
well, I will write it in the D
form.

00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:20.541
I'll write it in the form in
which you know it.

00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:23.789
It would be D apply to u1 plus
u2.

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:26.766
How does one write that in
ordinary calculus?

00:11:26.766 --> 00:11:31.093
Well, like that.
Or, maybe you write d by dx out

00:11:31.093 --> 00:11:33.119
front.
Let's write it this way,

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:36.429
is equal to u1 prime plus u2
prime.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:39.130
That's a law.
You prove it when you first

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.034
study what a derivative is.
It's a property.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:45.074
From our point of view,
it's a property of the

00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:48.180
differentiation operator.
It has this property.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.030
The D of u1 plus u2 is D of u1
plus D of u2.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.069
And, it also has the property

00:11:55.069 --> 00:12:00.000
that c u prime,
you can pull out the constant.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.385
That's not affected by the
differentiation.

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:07.979
So, these two familiar laws
from the beginning of calculus

00:12:07.979 --> 00:12:11.929
say, in our language,
that D is a linear operator.

00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:14.831
What about the multiplication
of law?

00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:18.861
That's even more important,
that u1 times u2 prime,

00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:22.811
I have nothing whatever to say
about that in here.

00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:25.874
In this context,
it's an important law,

00:12:25.874 --> 00:12:29.904
but it's not important with
respect to the study of

00:12:29.904 --> 00:12:33.810
linearity.
So, there's an example.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.532
Here's a more complicated one
that I'm claiming is the linear

00:12:38.532 --> 00:12:41.680
operator.
And, since I don't want to have

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.458
to work in this lecture,
the work is left to you.

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:48.370
So, the proof,
prove that L is linear,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.518
is this particular operator.
L is linear.

00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:55.217
That's in your part one
homework to verify that.

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:59.861
And you will do some simple
exercises in recitation tomorrow

00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:06.000
to sort of warm you up for that
if you haven't done it already.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.053
Well, you shouldn't have
because this only goes with this

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:19.225
lecture, actually.
It's forbidden to work ahead in

00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:23.633
this class.
All right, where are we?

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:31.064
Well, all that was a prelude to
proving this simple theorem,

00:13:31.064 --> 00:13:35.599
superposition principle.
So, finally,

00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:42.977
what's the proof?
The proof of the superposition

00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:50.005
principle: if you believe that
the operator is linear,

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:53.718
then L of c1,
in other words,

00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:59.287
the ODE is L.
L is D squared plus pD plus q.

00:13:59.287 --> 00:14:04.957
So, the ODE is Ly equals zero.

00:14:04.957 --> 00:14:07.657
And, what am I being asked to

00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:10.019
prove?
I'm being asked to prove that

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:13.327
if y1 and y2 are solutions,
then so is that thing.

00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:16.432
By the way, that's called a
linear combination.

00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:20.077
Put that in your notes.
Maybe I better write it even on

00:14:20.077 --> 00:14:24.330
the board because it's something
people say all the time without

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.557
realizing they haven't defined
it.

00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:30.000
This is called a linear
combination.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.562
This expression is called a
linear combination of y1 and y2.

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:40.748
It means that particular sum
with constant coefficients.

00:14:40.748 --> 00:14:44.048
Okay, so, the ODE is Ly equals
zero.

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:48.102
And, I'm trying to prove that
fact about it,

00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:52.440
that if y1 and y2 are
solutions, so is a linear

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.645
combination of them.
So, the proof,

00:14:55.645 --> 00:15:00.925
then, I start with apply L to
c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:05.391
Now, because this operator is

00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:10.587
linear, it takes the sum of two
functions into the corresponding

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:13.309
sum up what the operator would
be.

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:17.680
So, it would be L of c1 y1 plus
L of c2 y2.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.814
That's because L is a linear

00:15:20.814 --> 00:15:23.618
operator.
But, I don't have to stop

00:15:23.618 --> 00:15:26.670
there.
Because L is a linear operator,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:31.288
I can pull the c out front.
So, it's c1 L of y1 plus c2 L

00:15:31.288 --> 00:15:36.123
of y2. Now, where am I?

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.441
Trying to prove that this is
zero.

00:15:38.441 --> 00:15:40.969
Well, what is L of y1?
At this point,

00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:43.497
I use the fact that y1 is a
solution.

00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:46.095
Because it's a solution,
this is zero.

00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:50.028
That's what it means to solve
that differential equation.

00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:53.117
It means, when you apply the
linear operator,

00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:55.365
L, to the function,
you get zero.

00:15:55.365 --> 00:15:57.682
In the same way,
y2 is a solution.

00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:02.111
So, that's zero.
And, the sum of c1 times zero

00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:05.460
plus c2 times zero is zero.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.955
That's the argument.
Now, you could make the same

00:16:08.955 --> 00:16:13.396
argument just by plugging c1 y1,
plugging it into the equation

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:15.725
and calculating,
and calculating,

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.929
and calculating,
grouping the terms and so on

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:21.987
and so forth.
But, that's just calculation.

00:16:21.987 --> 00:16:24.244
It doesn't show you why it's
so.

00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:28.102
Why it's so is because the
operator, this differential

00:16:28.102 --> 00:16:32.252
equation is expressed as a
linear operator applied to y is

00:16:32.252 --> 00:16:37.885
zero.
And, the only properties that

00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:46.057
are really been used as the fact
that this operator is linear.

00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:50.478
That's the key point.
L is linear.

00:16:50.478 --> 00:16:57.311
It's a linear operator.
Well, that's all there is to

00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:04.121
the superposition principle.
As a prelude to answering the

00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:07.414
more difficult question,
why are these all the

00:17:07.414 --> 00:17:09.756
solutions?
Why are there no other

00:17:09.756 --> 00:17:12.390
solutions?
We need a few definitions,

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.195
and a few more ideas.
And, they are going to occur in

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:18.975
connection with,
so I'm now addressing,

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:22.634
ultimately, question two.
But, it's not going to be

00:17:22.634 --> 00:17:25.195
addressed directly for quite
awhile.

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:29.731
Instead, I'm going to phrase it
in terms of solving the initial

00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:34.633
value problem.
So far, we've only talked about

00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:39.305
the general solution with those
two arbitrary constants.

00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:43.297
But, how do you solve the
initial value problem,

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:46.525
in other words,
fit initial conditions,

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:51.536
find the solution with given
initial values for the function

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:55.000
and its derivatives.
Now, --

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.359
-- the theorem is that this
collection of functions with

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:12.798
these arbitrary constants,
these are all the solutions we

00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:15.731
have so far.
In fact, they are all the

00:18:15.731 --> 00:18:19.457
solutions there are,
but we don't know that yet.

00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:23.817
However, if we just focus on
the big class of solutions,

00:18:23.817 --> 00:18:28.573
there might be others lurking
out there somewhere lurking out

00:18:28.573 --> 00:18:31.818
there.
I don't know.

00:18:31.818 --> 00:18:39.654
But let's use what we have,
that just from this family is

00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:47.209
enough to satisfy any initial
condition, to satisfy any

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:51.407
initial values.
In other words,

00:18:51.407 --> 00:18:59.242
if you give me any initial
values, I will be able to find

00:18:59.242 --> 00:19:05.124
the c1 and c2 which work.
Now, why is that?

00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:08.497
Well, I'd have to do a song and
dance at this point,

00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:12.267
if you hadn't been softened up
by actually calculating for

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:15.970
specific differential equations.
You've had exercises and

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.211
actually how to calculate the
values of c1 and c2.

00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:23.047
So, I'm going to do it now in
general what you have done so

00:19:23.047 --> 00:19:26.883
far for particular equations
using particular values of the

00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:30.982
initial conditions.
So, I'm relying on that

00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:35.724
experience that you've had in
doing the homework to make

00:19:35.724 --> 00:19:40.724
intelligible what I'm going to
do now in the abstract using

00:19:40.724 --> 00:19:43.482
just letters.
So, why is this so?

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:47.362
Why is that so?
Well, we are going to need it,

00:19:47.362 --> 00:19:49.172
by the way, here,
too.

00:19:49.172 --> 00:19:52.620
I'll have to,
again, open up parentheses.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.620
But let's go as far as we can.
Well, you just try to do it.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:04.000
Suppose the initial conditions
are, how will we write them?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.874
So, they're going to be at some
initial point,

00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.918
x0.
You can take it to be zero if

00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:12.304
you want, but I'd like to be,
just for a little while,

00:20:12.304 --> 00:20:15.307
a little more general.
So, let's say the initial

00:20:15.307 --> 00:20:19.267
conditions, the initial values
are being given at the point x0,

00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:21.886
all right, that's going to be
some number.

00:20:21.886 --> 00:20:25.208
Let's just call it a.
And, the initial value also has

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:30.000
to specify the velocity or the
value of the derivative there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.529
Let's say these are the initial
values.

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:37.523
So, the problem is to find the
c which work.

00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:41.517
Now, how do you do that?
Well, you know from

00:20:41.517 --> 00:20:45.325
calculation.
You write y equals c1 y1 plus

00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:47.925
c2 y2.
And you write y prime,

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:51.919
and you take the derivative
underneath that,

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:56.470
which is easy to do.
And now, you plug in x equals

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.000
zero.
And, what happens?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.099
Well, these now turn into a set
of equations.

00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:08.198
What will they look like?
Well, y of x0 is a,

00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:12.204
and this is b.
So, what I get is let me flop

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:17.422
it over onto the other side
because that's the way you're

00:21:17.422 --> 00:21:21.055
used to looking at systems of
equations.

00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:26.459
So, what we get is c1 times y1
of x0 plus c2 times y2 of x0.

00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:31.733
What's that supposed to be

00:21:31.733 --> 00:21:34.133
equal to?
Well, that's supposed to be

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:37.799
equal to y of x0.
It's supposed to be equal to

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.066
the given number,
a.

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:42.333
And, in the same way,
c1 y1 prime of x0 plus c2 y2

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:46.133
prime of x0, that's supposed to
turn out to 

00:21:46.133 --> 00:21:48.333
be the number, b.

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:51.533
In the calculations you've done
up to this point,

00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:55.200
y1 and y2 were always specific
functions like e to the x

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.666
or cosine of 22x,

00:21:57.666 --> 00:22:01.853
stuff like that.
Now I'm doing it in the

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:06.526
abstract, just calling them y1
and y2, so as to include all

00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:10.635
those possible cases.
Now, what am I supposed to do?

00:22:10.635 --> 00:22:15.469
I'm supposed to find c1 and c2.
What kind of things are they?

00:22:15.469 --> 00:22:19.175
This is what you studied in
high school, right?

00:22:19.175 --> 00:22:23.767
The letters are around us,
but it's a pair of simultaneous

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:26.990
linear equations.
What are the variables?

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.696
What are the variables?
What are the variables?

00:22:30.696 --> 00:22:35.483
Somebody raise their hand.
If you have a pair of

00:22:35.483 --> 00:22:39.793
simultaneous linear equations,
you've got variables and you've

00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:41.206
got constants,
right?

00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:43.820
And you are trying to find the
answer.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.798
What are the variables?
Yeah?

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:47.211
c1 and c2.
Very good.

00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:50.885
I mean, it's extremely
confusing because in the first

00:22:50.885 --> 00:22:54.842
place, how can they be the
variables if they occur on the

00:22:54.842 --> 00:22:57.456
wrong side?
They're on the wrong side;

00:22:57.456 --> 00:23:02.631
they are constants.
How can constants be variables?

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:06.281
Everything about this is wrong.
Nonetheless,

00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:10.949
the c1 and the c2 are the
unknowns, if you like the high

00:23:10.949 --> 00:23:14.854
school terminology.
c1 and c2 are the unknowns.

00:23:14.854 --> 00:23:19.692
These messes are just numbers.
After you've plugged in x0,

00:23:19.692 --> 00:23:23.851
this is some number.
You've got four numbers here.

00:23:23.851 --> 00:23:26.482
So, c1 and c2 are the
variables.

00:23:26.482 --> 00:23:28.859
The two find,
in other words,

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:34.634
to find the values of.
All right, now you know general

00:23:34.634 --> 00:23:39.733
theorems from 18.02 about when
can you solve such a system of

00:23:39.733 --> 00:23:42.708
equations.
I'm claiming that you can

00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:48.062
always find c1 and c2 that work.
But, you know that's not always

00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:52.481
the case that a pair of
simultaneous linear equations

00:23:52.481 --> 00:23:55.371
can be solved.
There's a condition.

00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:59.705
There's a condition which
guarantees their solution,

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:04.849
which is what?
What has to be true about the

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:08.780
coefficients?
These are the coefficients.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.791
What has to be true?
The matrix of coefficients must

00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:18.213
be invertible.
The determinant of coefficients

00:24:18.213 --> 00:24:22.242
must be nonzero.
So, they are solvable if,

00:24:22.242 --> 00:24:25.387
for the c1 and c2,
if this thing,

00:24:25.387 --> 00:24:29.710
I'm going to write it.
Since all of these are

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:34.132
evaluated at x0,
I'm going to write it in this

00:24:34.132 --> 00:24:38.000
way.
y1, the determinant,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.400
whose entries are y1,
y2, y1 prime,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.900
and y2 prime,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.700
evaluated at zero,
x0, that means that I evaluate

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.299
each of the functions in the
determinant at x0.

00:24:54.299 --> 00:25:00.000
I'll write it this way.
That should be not zero.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.925
So, in other words,
the key thing which makes this

00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:08.731
possible, makes it possible for
us to solve the initial value

00:25:08.731 --> 00:25:13.297
problem, is that this funny
determinant should not be zero

00:25:13.297 --> 00:25:16.421
at the point at which we are
interested.

00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:19.865
Now, this determinant is
important in 18.03.

00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:23.310
It has a name,
and this is when you're going

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.594
to learn it, if you don't know
it already.

00:25:26.594 --> 00:25:31.000
That determinant is called the
Wronskian.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.622
The Wronskian of what?
If you want to be pompous,

00:25:34.622 --> 00:25:37.792
you say this with a V sound
instead of a W.

00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:41.641
But, nobody does except people
trying to be pompous.

00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:43.905
The Wronskian,
we'll write a W.

00:25:43.905 --> 00:25:47.075
Now, notice,
you can only calculate it when

00:25:47.075 --> 00:25:49.716
you know what the two functions
are.

00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:53.415
So, the Wronskian of the two
functions, y1 and y2,

00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:56.886
what's the variable?
It's not a function of two

00:25:56.886 --> 00:26:00.509
variables, y1 and y2.
These are just the names of

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:04.740
functions of x.
So, when you do it,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.495
put it in, calculate out that
determinant.

00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:13.349
This is a function of x,
a function of the independent

00:26:13.349 --> 00:26:17.195
variable after you've done the
calculation.

00:26:17.195 --> 00:26:20.675
Anyway, let's write its
definition, y1,

00:26:20.675 --> 00:26:23.240
y2, y1 prime,
y2 prime.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.995
Now, in order to do this,

00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:32.215
the point is we must know that
that Wronskian is not zero,

00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:37.618
that the Wronskian of these two
functions is not zero at the

00:26:37.618 --> 00:26:42.326
point x0.
Now, enter a theorem which

00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:47.159
you're going to prove for
homework, but this is harder.

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:51.992
So, it's part two homework.
It's not part one homework.

00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:55.929
In other words,
I didn't give you the answer.

00:26:55.929 --> 00:27:01.478
You've got to find it yourself,
alone or in the company of good

00:27:01.478 --> 00:27:05.013
friends.
So, anyway, here's the

00:27:05.013 --> 00:27:08.673
Wronskian.
Now, what can we say for sure?

00:27:08.673 --> 00:27:13.431
Note, suppose y1 and y,
just to get you a feeling for

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:16.816
it a little bit,
suppose they were not

00:27:16.816 --> 00:27:20.751
independent.
The word for not independent is

00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:24.228
dependent.
Suppose they were dependent.

00:27:24.228 --> 00:27:28.437
In other words,
suppose that y2 were a constant

00:27:28.437 --> 00:27:33.379
multiple of y1.
We know that's not the case

00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:37.961
because our functions are
supposed to be independent.

00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:42.544
But suppose they weren't.
What would the value of the

00:27:42.544 --> 00:27:46.245
Wronskian be?
If y2 is a constant times y1,

00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:50.651
then y2 prime is that same
constant times y1 prime.

00:27:50.651 --> 00:27:53.735
What's the value of the
determinant?

00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:56.908
Zero.
For what values of x is it zero

00:27:56.908 --> 00:28:01.049
for all values of x?
And now, that's the theorem

00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:06.160
that you're going to prove,
that if y1 and y2 are solutions

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.831
to the ODE, I won't keep,
say, it's the ODE we've been

00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:14.708
talking about,
y double prime plus py.

00:28:14.708 --> 00:28:20.509
But the linear homogeneous with

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:26.849
not constant coefficients,
just linear homogeneous second

00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:29.113
order.
Our solutions,

00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:33.075
as there are only two
possibilities,

00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:37.214
either-or.
Either the Wronskian of y,

00:28:37.214 --> 00:28:39.940
there are only two
possibilities.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.029
Either the Wronskian of y1 and
y2 is always zero,

00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:47.607
identically zero,
zero for all values of x.

00:28:47.607 --> 00:28:51.099
This is redundant.
When I say identically,

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:56.040
I mean for all values of x.
But, I am just making assurance

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.759
doubly sure.
Or, or the Wronskian is never

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:06.037
zero.
Now, there is no notation as

00:29:06.037 --> 00:29:10.962
for that.
I'd better just write it out,

00:29:10.962 --> 00:29:13.296
is never zero,
i.e.

00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:15.759
for no x is it,
i.e.

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:20.555
for all x.
There's no way to say that.

00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:26.000
I mean, for all values of x,
it's not zero.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.870
That means, there is not a
single point for which it's

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.333
zero.
In particular,

00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:43.154
it's not zero here.
So, this is your homework:

00:29:43.154 --> 00:29:45.824
problem five,
part two.

00:29:45.824 --> 00:29:52.740
I'll give you a method of
proving it, which was discovered

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.230
by the famous Norwegian
mathematician,

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:02.326
Abel, who is,
I guess, the centenary of his

00:30:02.326 --> 00:30:09.000
birth, I guess,
was just celebrated last year.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.875
He has one of the truly tragic
stories in mathematics,

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:18.751
which I think you can read.
It must be a Simmons book,

00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:22.432
if you have that.
Simmons is very good on

00:30:22.432 --> 00:30:24.731
biographies.
Look up Abel.

00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:29.976
He'll have a biography of Abel,
and you can weep if you're

00:30:29.976 --> 00:30:34.319
feeling sad.
He died at the age of 26 of

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:37.411
tuberculosis,
having done a number of

00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:41.705
sensational things,
none of which was recognized in

00:30:41.705 --> 00:30:46.343
his lifetime because people
buried his papers under big

00:30:46.343 --> 00:30:49.435
piles of papers.
So, he died unknown,

00:30:49.435 --> 00:30:53.128
uncelebrated,
and now he's Norway's greatest

00:30:53.128 --> 00:30:56.478
culture hero.
In the middle of a park in

00:30:56.478 --> 00:31:03.064
Oslo, there's a huge statue.
And, since nobody knows what

00:31:03.064 --> 00:31:07.990
Abel looked like,
the statue is way up high so

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:13.572
you can't see very well.
But, the inscription on the

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:19.810
bottom says Niels Henrik Abel,
1801-1826 or something like

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.000
that.
Now, --

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.101
-- the choice,
I'm still, believe it or not,

00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:44.347
aiming at question two,
but I have another big

00:31:44.347 --> 00:31:47.377
parentheses to open.
And, when I closed it,

00:31:47.377 --> 00:31:50.334
the answer to question two will
be simple.

00:31:50.334 --> 00:31:53.868
But, I think it's very
desirable that you get this

00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:57.691
second big parentheses.
It will help you to understand

00:31:57.691 --> 00:32:02.514
something important.
It will help you on your

00:32:02.514 --> 00:32:08.066
problem set tomorrow night.
I don't have to apologize.

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:12.676
I'm just going to do it.
So, the question is,

00:32:12.676 --> 00:32:18.123
the thing you have to
understand is that when I write

00:32:18.123 --> 00:32:23.152
this combination,
I'm claiming that these are all

00:32:23.152 --> 00:32:27.342
the solutions.
I haven't proved that yet.

00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:33.000
But, they are going to be all
the solutions

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.760
The point is,
there's nothing sacrosanct

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.003
about the y1 and y2.
This is exactly the same

00:32:41.003 --> 00:32:46.500
collection as a collection which
I would write using other

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.971
constants.
Let's call them u1 and u2.

00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:55.275
They are exactly the same,
where u1 and u2 are any other

00:32:55.275 --> 00:33:00.000
pair of linearly independent
solutions.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.022
Any other pair of independent
solutions, they must be

00:33:05.022 --> 00:33:10.142
independent, either a constant
multiple of each other.

00:33:10.142 --> 00:33:13.812
In other words,
u1 is some combination,

00:33:13.812 --> 00:33:18.448
now I'm really stuck because I
don't know how to,

00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:22.988
c1 bar, let's say,
that means a special value of

00:33:22.988 --> 00:33:28.590
c1, and a special value of c2,
and u2 is some other special

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.585
value, oh my God,
c1 double bar,

00:33:31.585 --> 00:33:36.316
how's that?
The notation is getting worse

00:33:36.316 --> 00:33:38.633
and worse.
I apologize for it.

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:42.307
In other words,
I could pick y1 and y2 and make

00:33:42.307 --> 00:33:45.423
up all of these.
And, I'd get a bunch of

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:48.378
solutions.
But, I could also pick some

00:33:48.378 --> 00:33:51.573
other family,
some other two guys in this

00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:56.686
family, and just as well express
the solutions in terms of u1 and

00:33:56.686 --> 00:33:59.402
u2.
Now, well, why is he telling us

00:33:59.402 --> 00:34:03.378
that?
Well, the point is that the y1

00:34:03.378 --> 00:34:08.134
and the y2 are typically the
ones you get easily from solving

00:34:08.134 --> 00:34:11.542
the equations,
like e to the x and e

00:34:11.542 --> 00:34:15.268
to the 2x.
That's what you've gotten,

00:34:15.268 --> 00:34:18.756
or cosine x and sine x,

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:22.085
something like that.
But, for certain ways,

00:34:22.085 --> 00:34:26.445
they might not be the best way
of writing the solutions.

00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:31.121
There is another way of writing
those that you should learn,

00:34:31.121 --> 00:34:35.243
and that's called finding
normalized, the normalized.

00:34:35.243 --> 00:34:40.000
They are okay,
but they are not normalized.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.669
For some things,
the normalized solutions are

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:44.975
the best.
I'll explain to you what they

00:34:44.975 --> 00:34:48.009
are, and I'll explain to you
what they're good for.

00:34:48.009 --> 00:34:50.679
You'll see immediately what
they're good for.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.652
Normalized solutions,
now, you have to specify the

00:34:53.652 --> 00:34:55.655
point at which you're
normalizing.

00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:58.021
In general, it would be x
nought,

00:34:58.021 --> 00:35:01.359
but let's, at this point,
since I don't have an infinity

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:05.000
of time, to simplify things,
let's say zero.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.846
It could be x nought,
any point would do just as

00:35:08.846 --> 00:35:11.196
well.
But, zero is the most common

00:35:11.196 --> 00:35:13.333
choice.
What are the normalized

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:15.398
solutions?
Well, first of all,

00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:19.245
I have to give them names.
I want to still call them y.

00:35:19.245 --> 00:35:21.809
So, I'll call them capital Y1
and Y2.

00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:25.370
And, what they are,
are the solutions which satisfy

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.507
certain, special,
very special,

00:35:27.507 --> 00:35:31.871
initial conditions.
And, what are those?

00:35:31.871 --> 00:35:37.204
So, they're the ones which
satisfy, the initial conditions

00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:43.005
for Y1 are, of course there are
going to be guys that look like

00:35:43.005 --> 00:35:46.280
this.
The only thing that's going to

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.894
make them distinctive is the
initial conditions they satisfy.

00:35:51.894 --> 00:35:56.573
Y1 has to satisfy at zero.
Its value should be one,

00:35:56.573 --> 00:36:02.000
and the value of its derivative
should be zero.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.384
For Y2, it's just the opposite.
Here, the value of the function

00:36:07.384 --> 00:36:11.205
should be zero at zero.
But, the value of its

00:36:11.205 --> 00:36:14.071
derivative, now,
I want to be one.

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:17.631
Let me give you a trivial
example of this,

00:36:17.631 --> 00:36:21.452
and then one,
which is a little less trivial,

00:36:21.452 --> 00:36:25.881
so you'll have some feeling for
what I'm asking for.

00:36:25.881 --> 00:36:28.747
Suppose the equation,
for example,

00:36:28.747 --> 00:36:33.002
is y double prime plus,
well, let's really make it

00:36:33.002 --> 00:36:36.636
simple.
Okay, you know the standard

00:36:36.636 --> 00:36:39.303
solutions are y1 is cosine x,

00:36:39.303 --> 00:36:41.242
and y2 is sine x.

00:36:41.242 --> 00:36:44.333
These are functions,
which, when you take the second

00:36:44.333 --> 00:36:46.818
derivative, they turn into their
negative.

00:36:46.818 --> 00:36:50.333
You know, you could go the
complex roots are i and minus i,

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.272
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

00:36:52.272 --> 00:36:53.909
blah.
If you do it that way,

00:36:53.909 --> 00:36:56.090
fine.
But at some point in the course

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:59.060
you have to be able to write
down and, right away,

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.181
oh, yeah, cosine x,
sine x.

00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:05.775
Okay, what are the normalized

00:37:05.775 --> 00:37:09.316
things?
Well, what's the value of this

00:37:09.316 --> 00:37:11.039
at zero?
It is one.

00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:15.059
What's the value of its
derivative at zero?

00:37:15.059 --> 00:37:16.590
Zero.
This is Y1.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:22.524
This is the only case in which
you locked on immediately to the

00:37:22.524 --> 00:37:26.066
normalized solutions.
In the same way,

00:37:26.066 --> 00:37:32.000
this guy is Y2 because its
value at zero is zero.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.500
It's value of its derivative at
zero is one.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.162
So, this is Y2.
Okay, now let's look at a case

00:37:39.162 --> 00:37:44.290
where you don't immediately lock
on to the normalized solutions.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.709
Very simple:
all I have to do is change the

00:37:47.709 --> 00:37:49.337
sign.
Here, you know,

00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:54.220
think through r squared minus
one equals zero.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.372
The characteristic roots are
plus one and minus one,

00:37:58.372 --> 00:38:00.935
right?
And therefore,

00:38:00.935 --> 00:38:04.810
the solution is e to the x,
and e to the negative x.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.482
So, the solutions you find by

00:38:07.482 --> 00:38:11.290
the usual way of solving it is
y1 equals e to the x,

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.032
and y2 equals e to the
negative x.

00:38:15.032 --> 00:38:17.103
Those are the standard
solution.

00:38:17.103 --> 00:38:19.709
So, the general solution is of
the form.

00:38:19.709 --> 00:38:23.851
So, the general solution is of
the form c1 e to the x plus c2 e

00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:26.523
to the negative x.

00:38:26.523 --> 00:38:31.000
Now, what I want to find out is
what is Y1 and Y2?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.344
How do I find out what Y1 is?
Well, I have to satisfy initial

00:38:36.344 --> 00:38:38.839
conditions.
So, if this is y,

00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:43.114
let's write down here,
if you can still see that,

00:38:43.114 --> 00:38:48.637
y prime is c1 e to the x minus
c2 e to the negative x .

00:38:48.637 --> 00:38:51.755
So, if I plug in,

00:38:51.755 --> 00:38:56.655
I want y of zero to be one,
I want this guy at the point

00:38:56.655 --> 00:39:00.485
zero to be one.
What equation does that give

00:39:00.485 --> 00:39:04.523
me?
That gives me c1 plus c2,

00:39:04.523 --> 00:39:08.023
c1 plus c2,
plugging in x equals zero,

00:39:08.023 --> 00:39:11.116
equals the value of this thing
at zero.

00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:14.779
So, that's supposed to be one.

00:39:14.779 --> 00:39:19.174
How about the other guy?
The value of its derivative is

00:39:19.174 --> 00:39:24.058
supposed to come out to be zero.
And, what is its derivative?

00:39:24.058 --> 00:39:26.581
Well, plug into this
expression.

00:39:26.581 --> 00:39:32.300
It's c1 minus c2.
Okay, what's the solution to

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.325
those pair of equations?
c2 has to be equal to c1.

00:39:36.325 --> 00:39:39.611
The sum of the two of them has
to be one.

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:42.980
Each one, therefore,
is equal to one half.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.677
And so, what's the value of Y1?
Y1, therefore,

00:39:46.677 --> 00:39:50.291
is the function where c1 and c2
are one half.

00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:55.220
It's the function e to the x
plus e to the negative x divided

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.000
by two.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
In the same way,
I won't repeat the calculation.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.340
You can do yourself.
Same calculation shows that Y2,

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.148
so, put in the initial
conditions.

00:40:10.148 --> 00:40:15.170
The answer will be that Y2 is
equal to e to the x minus e to

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:19.595
the minus x divided by two.

00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:22.234
These are the special
functions.

00:40:22.234 --> 00:40:25.808
For this equation,
these are the normalized

00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:28.702
solutions.
They are better than the

00:40:28.702 --> 00:40:35.000
original solutions because their
initial values are nicer.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.591
Just check it.
The initial value,

00:40:37.591 --> 00:40:40.993
when x is equal to zero,
the initial value,

00:40:40.993 --> 00:40:44.800
this has is zero.
Here, when x is equal to zero,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.473
the value of the function is
zero.

00:40:47.473 --> 00:40:51.199
But, the value of its
derivative, these cancel,

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:54.034
is one.
So, these are the good guys.

00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:57.436
Okay, there's no colored chalk
this period.

00:40:57.436 --> 00:41:01.705
Okay, there was colored chalk.
There's one.

00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:04.411
So, for this equation,
these are the good guys.

00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:07.941
These are our best solutions.
e to the x and e to the

00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:10.117
minus x are good solutions.

00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:12.176
But, these are our better
solutions.

00:41:12.176 --> 00:41:14.529
And, this one,
of course, is the function

00:41:14.529 --> 00:41:18.176
which is called hyperbolic sine
of x, and this is the one which

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.058
is called hyperbolic cosine of
x.

00:41:20.058 --> 00:41:23.058
This is one of the most
important ways in which they

00:41:23.058 --> 00:41:26.176
enter into mathematics.
And, this is why the engineers

00:41:26.176 --> 00:41:28.529
want them.
Now, why do the engineers want

00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:34.973
normalized solutions?
Well, I didn't explain that.

00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:41.359
So, what's so good about
normalized solutions?

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:47.320
Very simple:
if Y1 and Y2 are normalized at

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.706
zero, let's say,
then the solution to the IVP,

00:41:53.706 --> 00:41:59.240
in other words,
the ODE plus the initial

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:07.188
values, y of zero equals,
let's say, a and y

00:42:07.188 --> 00:42:14.000
prime of zero equals b.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.475
So, the ODE I'm not repeating.
It's the one we've been talking

00:42:17.475 --> 00:42:20.210
about all term since the
beginning of the period.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.458
It's the one with the p of x
and q of x.

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.282
And, here are the initial
values.

00:42:25.282 --> 00:42:28.358
I'm going to call them a and b.
You can also call them,

00:42:28.358 --> 00:42:30.581
if you like,
maybe that's better to call

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:34.000
them y0, as they are individual
in the homework.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.669
They are called,
I'm using the,

00:42:36.669 --> 00:42:39.962
let's use those.
What is the solution?

00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:43.789
I say the solution is,
if you use y1 and y2,

00:42:43.789 --> 00:42:46.814
the solution is y0,
in other words,

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:49.395
the a times Y1,
plus y0 prime,

00:42:49.395 --> 00:42:53.400
in other words,
b times Y2.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.227
In other words,
you can write down instantly

00:42:57.227 --> 00:43:00.875
the solution to the initial
value problem,

00:43:00.875 --> 00:43:05.681
if instead of using the
functions, you started out with

00:43:05.681 --> 00:43:12.000
the little Y1 and Y2,
you use these better functions.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.087
The thing that's better about
them is that they instantly

00:43:16.087 --> 00:43:18.934
solve for you the initial value
problem.

00:43:18.934 --> 00:43:22.875
All you do is use this number,
initial condition as the

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:26.087
coefficient of Y1,
and use this number as the

00:43:26.087 --> 00:43:29.664
coefficient of Y2.
Now, just check that by looking

00:43:29.664 --> 00:43:32.000
at it.
Why is that so?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.211
Well, for example,
let's check.

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.308
What is its value of this
function at zero?

00:43:37.308 --> 00:43:40.405
Well, the value of this guy at
zero is one.

00:43:40.405 --> 00:43:44.755
So, the answer is y0 times one,
and the value of this guy at

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.557
zero is zero.
So, this term disappears.

00:43:47.557 --> 00:43:50.949
And, it's exactly the same with
the derivative.

00:43:50.949 --> 00:43:54.046
What's the value of the
derivative at zero?

00:43:54.046 --> 00:43:57.658
The value of the derivative of
this thing is zero.

00:43:57.658 --> 00:44:01.788
So, this term disappears.
The value of this derivative at

00:44:01.788 --> 00:44:06.409
zero is one. And so, 
the answer is y0 prime.

00:44:06.409 --> 00:44:08.497
So, check, check,

00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:11.870
this works.
So, these better solutions have

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.761
the property,
what's good about them,

00:44:14.761 --> 00:44:18.134
and why scientists and
engineers like them,

00:44:18.134 --> 00:44:22.310
is that they enable you
immediately to write down the

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.727
answer to the initial value
problem without having to go

00:44:26.727 --> 00:44:30.502
through this business,
which I buried down here,

00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:35.000
of solving simultaneous linear
equations.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.035
Okay, now, believe it or not,
that's all the work.

00:44:40.035 --> 00:44:46.201
We are ready to answer question
number two: why are these all

00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:50.620
the solutions?
Of course, I have to invoke a

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.292
big theorem.
A big theorem:

00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:56.786
where shall I invoke a big
theorem?

00:44:56.786 --> 00:45:02.227
Let's see if we can do it here.
The big theorem says,

00:45:02.227 --> 00:45:05.034
it's called the existence and
uniqueness theorem.

00:45:05.034 --> 00:45:08.425
It's the last thing that's
proved at the end of an analysis

00:45:08.425 --> 00:45:11.816
course, at which real analysis
courses, over which students

00:45:11.816 --> 00:45:15.324
sweat for one whole semester,
and their reward at the end is,

00:45:15.324 --> 00:45:18.481
if they are very lucky,
and if they have been very good

00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:21.697
students, they get to see the
proof of the existence and

00:45:21.697 --> 00:45:24.328
uniqueness theorem for
differential equations.

00:45:24.328 --> 00:45:27.661
But, I can at least say what it
is for the linear equation

00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:31.034
because it's so simple.
It says, so,

00:45:31.034 --> 00:45:35.344
the equation we are talking
about is the usual one,

00:45:35.344 --> 00:45:39.224
homogeneous equation,
and I'm going to assume,

00:45:39.224 --> 00:45:44.310
you have to have assumptions
that p and q are continuous for

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.896
all x.
So, they're good-looking

00:45:46.896 --> 00:45:50.344
functions.
Coefficients aren't allowed to

00:45:50.344 --> 00:45:55.000
blow up anywhere.
They've got to look nice.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.539
Then, the theorem says there is
one and only one solution,

00:46:03.539 --> 00:46:11.479
one and only solution
satisfying, given initial values

00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:19.119
such that y of zero,
let's say y of zero is equal to

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:24.063
some given number, A,

00:46:24.063 --> 00:46:31.404
and y, let's make y0,
and y prime of zero equals B.

00:46:31.404 --> 00:46:37.922
The initial value problem has

00:46:37.922 --> 00:46:42.255
one and only one solution.
The existence is,

00:46:42.255 --> 00:46:45.883
it has a solution.
The uniqueness is,

00:46:45.883 --> 00:46:51.023
it only has one solution.
If you specify the initial

00:46:51.023 --> 00:46:56.767
conditions, there's only one
function which satisfies them

00:46:56.767 --> 00:47:02.511
and at the same time satisfies
that differential equation.

00:47:02.511 --> 00:47:08.255
Now, this answers our question.
This answers our question,

00:47:08.255 --> 00:47:14.000
because, look,
what I want is all solutions.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.951
What we want are all solutions
to the ODE.

00:47:21.951 --> 00:47:33.199
And now, here's what I say:
a claim that this collection of

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:42.896
functions, c1 Y1 plus c2 Y2
are all

00:47:42.896 --> 00:47:48.293
solutions.
Of course, I began a period by

00:47:48.293 --> 00:47:52.574
saying I'd show you that c1
little y1 c little y2 are all

00:47:52.574 --> 00:47:55.862
the solutions.
But, it's the case that these

00:47:55.862 --> 00:48:00.067
two families are the same.
So, the family that I started

00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:04.730
with would be exactly the same
as the family c1 prime Y1

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.559
because,
after all, these are two

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:11.000
special guys from that
collection.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.978
So, it doesn't matter whether I
talk about the original ones,

00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:19.213
or these.
The theorem is still the same.

00:48:19.213 --> 00:48:22.864
The final step,
therefore, if you give me one

00:48:22.864 --> 00:48:26.681
more minute, I think that will
be quite enough.

00:48:26.681 --> 00:48:30.000
Why are these all the
solutions?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.454
Well, I have to take an
arbitrary solution and show you

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:39.494
that it's one of these.
So, the proof is,

00:48:39.494 --> 00:48:43.838
given a solution,
u(x), what are its values?

00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:48.080
Well, u of x zero is u zero,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.919
and u prime of x zero, zero,

00:48:51.919 --> 00:48:58.080
let's say, is equal to u zero,
is equal to some other

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.277
number.
Now, what's the solution?

00:49:02.277 --> 00:49:07.198
Write down what's the solution
of these using the Y1's?

00:49:07.198 --> 00:49:12.574
Then, I know I've just shown
you that u zero times Y1 plus u

00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:17.767
zero prime Y2
satisfies the same initial

00:49:17.767 --> 00:49:21.958
conditions, satisfies these
initial conditions,

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:24.692
initial values.
In other words,

00:49:24.692 --> 00:49:27.699
I started with my little
solution.

00:49:27.699 --> 00:49:31.890
u of x walks up to and
says, hi there.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:37.357
Hi there, and the differential
equation looks at it and says,

00:49:37.357 --> 00:49:41.116
who are you?
You say, oh,

00:49:41.116 --> 00:49:46.604
I satisfy you and my initial,
and then it says what are your

00:49:46.604 --> 00:49:50.790
initial values?
It says, my initial values are

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:54.418
u0 and u0 prime.
And, it said,

00:49:54.418 --> 00:49:59.441
sorry, but we've got one of
ours who satisfies the same

00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:03.906
initial conditions.
We don't need you because the

00:50:03.906 --> 00:50:09.767
existence and uniqueness theorem
says that there can only be one

00:50:09.767 --> 00:50:13.395
function which does that.
And therefore,

00:50:13.395 --> 00:50:20.000
you must be equal to this guy
by the uniqueness theorem.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.953
Okay, we'll talk more about
stuff next time,

00:50:23.953 --> 00:50:25.686
linear equation next time.
