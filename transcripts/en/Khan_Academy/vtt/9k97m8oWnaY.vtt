00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.140
In the last video, we finished
off with these two results.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.850
We started off just thinking
about what it means to take

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.000
the partial derivative of
vector-valued function, and I

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
got to these kind of, you might
call them, bizarre results.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.230
You know, what was the whole
point in getting here, Sal?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.820
And the whole point is so that
I can give you the tools you

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.840
need to understand what
a surface integral is.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.320
So let's just think about,
let's draw the st plane,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.640
and then see how it gets
transformed into

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.720
this surface r.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.620
So let's do that.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.760
Let's say that is the t-axis,
and let's say that that is the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.240
s-axis, and let's say that our
vector-valued function, our

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.550
positioned vector-valued
function, is defined from s's

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.590
between a and b, I'm just
picking arbitrary boundaries,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.550
and between t being
equal to c and d.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.320
So the area under question, if
you take any t and any s in

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.710
this rectangle right here, it
will be mapped to part

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.890
of that surface.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100
And if you map each of these
points, you will eventually

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130
get the surface r.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.250
So let me draw r
in 3 dimensions.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.770
A surface in 3D.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.090
So that is our x-axis, that
is our y-axis, and then

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.930
that is the z-axis.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.780
And just as a bit of a
reminder, it might look

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.370
something like this.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.570
If we were to, this point right
here, where s is equal to a,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.560
and t is equal to c, remember,
we're going to draw the surface

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.540
indicated by the position
vector function

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380
s, r of s and t.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.230
So this point right here, when
s is a and t is c, maybe it

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.120
maps to, I'm just, you
know, that point!

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.070
Right there.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.540
When you take a and c, and you
put it into this thing over

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.870
here, you're just going to get
the vector that points at that.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.840
So you could say, it'll
give you a position vector

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.170
that'll point right at that
position, right there.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.407
And then, let's say that this
line, right here, if we were to

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:31.570
hold s constant at a, and if we
were to just vary t from c

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.810
to d, maybe that looks
something like this.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.080
I'm just drawing some
arbitrary contour there.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.980
Maybe if we hold t constant at
c, and vary s from a to b,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.210
maybe that'll look at
something like that.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.980
I don't know.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.980
I'm just trying to
show you an example.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.150
So this point right here would
correspond to that point right

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.380
there, when you put it into the
vector-valued function r, you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.420
would get a vector that points
to that point, just like that.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.710
And this point right here in
purple, when you evaluate r of

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.660
s and t, it'll give you a
vector that points right there,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.850
to that point over there, and
we could do a couple of other

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.430
points, just to get an idea of
what the surface looks like,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.390
although I'm trying to keep
things as general as possible.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.730
So maybe, let me do it
in this bluish color.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.350
This, if we hold p at d and
vary s from a to b, we're

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.230
going to start here.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.540
This is when t is d and s is a.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.880
And when you vary it, maybe
you get something like that.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.320
I don't know.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.900
So this point right here would
correspond to a vector that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.430
points to that point, right
there, and then finally this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.600
line, or this, if we hold s at
b and vary t between c and d,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.480
we're going to go from that
point, to that point.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.140
So it's going to look something
like this-- oh, sorry, we're

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.630
going to go from this
point to that point.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.580
We're holding s at b, varying
t from c to d, maybe it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.290
looks something like that.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.200
So our surface, we went from
this nice rectangular area in

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.250
the ts plane, and it gets
transformed into this

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.880
wacky-looking surface.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.920
We could even draw some
other things right here.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.150
Let's say we get some
arbitrary value.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.720
Let me pick a new color,
I'll do it in white.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.430
Or a new noncolor.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.860
And let's say if we hold s at
that constant value and we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.220
vary t, maybe that will look
for something like this.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.690
Maybe that we'll look something
like, well, I don't know.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.180
Maybe it'll look
something like that.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.520
So you get an idea of what
the surface might look like.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.140
Now, given this, I want
to think about what

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.350
these quantities are.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.830
And then when we visualize what
these quantities are, we'll be

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.630
able to kind of use these
results of the last videos

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.160
to do something that I
think will be useful.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.330
So let's say that we
pick arbitrary s and t.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.860
So this is the point, let me
just we pick it right here.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.020
That is the point s, t.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.090
s comma t.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.390
If you were to put those values
in here maybe it maps to, and I

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.850
want to make sure I'm
consistent with everything I've

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.720
drawn, maybe it maps to
this point right here.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.430
Maybe it maps to that
point right there.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.620
So this point right here,
that is r of s and t.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.940
For a particular s and t.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.650
I mean, I could put little
subscripts here, but

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.790
I want to be general.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.070
I could call this a, well,
I already used a and b.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.010
I could call this x and y,
this would be r of x and y.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.820
It would map to that
point, right there.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.090
So that right there,
or that right there.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.500
Now let's see what happens
if we take, if we move

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.790
just in the s direction.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.270
So this is we could
do that as s.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.310
Now let us move forward
by a differential, by a

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.310
super small amount of s.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.830
So this right here, let's
call that a s plus a super

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.150
small differential in s.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.910
That's right there.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.850
So that point.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.430
Let me do that in a better
color, in this yellow.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.320
So that point right there
is the point s plus

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.080
my differential of s.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.550
I could write delta s, but
I wanted a super small

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.560
change in s, comma t.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.490
And what is that going
to get mapped to?

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.380
Well, if we apply these two
point in r, we're going to

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.660
get something that maybe
is right over there.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.570
And I want to be very clear.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:11.190
This right here, that is
r of s plus ds comma t.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.850
That's what that is.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.520
That's the point when we just
shift s by a super small

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.000
differential, this distance
here, you can view as ds.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.400
It's a super small change in s.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.930
And then when we map it or
transform it, or put that

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.180
point into our vector-valued
function, let me copy and paste

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.600
the original vector-valued
function, just so we have a

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.900
good image of what we're
talking about this whole time.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.620
Let me put it right down there.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:51.000
So just to be clear what's
going on, when we took this

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.160
little blue point right here,
this s and t, and we put the s

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.480
and t values here, we get a
vector that points to that

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.560
point on the surface,
right there.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.770
When you add a ds to your
s-values, you get a vector

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.660
that points at that
yellow point right there.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.695
So going back to the results we
got in the last presentation,

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:18.640
or the last video,
what is this?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.967
r of s plus delta s, or r of s
plus ds, the differential of

00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:27.250
s, t, well, that is
that, right there.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.020
That is the vector that
points to that position.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.190
This right here is a vector
that points to this

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.480
blue position.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.760
So what is the difference
of those two vectors?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.430
And this is a bit of
basic vector math,

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.060
you might remember.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.910
The difference of these two
vectors, head to tails.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.830
The difference of these
two vectors is going

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.020
to be this vector.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.450
If you subtract this vector
that vector, you're going to

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.190
get that vector, right there.

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:57.650
A vector that looks
just like that.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.380
So that's what this is
equal to, that vector.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.340
And it makes sense.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.450
This blue vector plus the
orange vector, this vector,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.120
right here, plus the orange
vector, is equal

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.755
to this vector.

00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:09.860
It makes complete sense.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.080
Heads to tails.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.650
So that's what that represents.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.625
Now let's do the same
thing in the t direction.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.020
I'm running out of color.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.800
I'll go back to the pink,
or maybe the magenta.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.610
So we had that s and t.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:32.960
Now if we go up a little bit,
in that direction, let's say

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.360
that that is t, so this is the
point s, t plus a super small

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.910
change in t, that's that
point right there.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.180
This distance right there is
dt, you can view it that way.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.280
If you put s and t plus dt into
our vector value function,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.180
what are you to get?

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.700
You're going to get a vector
that maybe points to

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.390
this point, right here.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.300
Maybe I'll draw it right here.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.690
Maybe it points to this
point, right here.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.660
A vector that points
right there.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.910
So that will be mapped to a
vector that points to that

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.550
position, right over there.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.860
Now by the same argument that
we did on the s-side, this

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.910
point, or the vector that
points to that, that

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.430
is r of st plus dt.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.250
That is the exact same thing
as that right there, and of

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.940
course, this, we already saw.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.800
This is the same thing
as that over there.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.370
So what is that vector
minus this blue vector?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.830
The magenta vector
minus the blue vector?

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.100
Well, once again, this
is hopefully a bit of a

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.960
review of adding vectors.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.600
It's going to be a vector
that looks like this.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.630
I'll do it in white.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.520
It's going to be a vector
that looks like that.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.740
And you can imagine, if you
take the blue vector plus the

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.210
white vector, the blue vector
plus this white vector is going

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.320
to equal this purple vector.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.910
So it makes sense, if the
purple vector minus the blue

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.190
vector is going to be equal
to this white vector.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.330
So something interesting
is going on here.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.020
I have these two, this is a
vector that is kind of going

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.760
along this parameterized
surface, as we changed our

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.590
s by a super small amount.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.700
And then this is a vector that
is going along our surface if

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.030
we change our t by a
super small amount.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.190
Now, you may or may not
remember this, and I've

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.280
done several videos where
I showed this to you.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.500
But the magnitude, if I take 2
vectors, and I take their cross

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.370
product, so if I take the cross
product of a and b, and I take

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.870
the magnitude of the resulting
vector-- remember, when you

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.870
take the cross product, you
get a third vector that is

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.530
perpendicular to both of these.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.030
But if you were just to take
the magnitude of that vector,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:12:04.280
that is equal to the area
of a parallelogram,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.510
defined by a and b.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.290
What do I mean by that?

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:20.940
Well, if that is vector a and
that is vector b, that's a and

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.400
that is b, if you were to just
take the cross product of those

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.290
two, you're going to
get a third vector.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.880
You're going to get a third
vector that's perpendicular

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.660
to both of them, it kind
of popped out of the page.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.560
That would be a cross b.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.050
But the magnitude of this, so
if you just take a cross

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.640
product, you're going
to get a vector.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.210
But then if you take the
magnitude of that vector,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.300
you're just saying, how
big is that vector, how

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.690
long is that vector?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.160
That's going to be the
area of the parallelogram

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.690
defined by a and b.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.650
And I've proved that in the
linear algebra videos, maybe

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.900
I'll prove it again in this.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.690
I mean it's because-- well, I
won't go into that in detail.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.290
I've done it before, don't want
to make this video too long.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.900
So the parallelogram defined by
a and b, you just imagine a,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.400
and then take another kind of
parallel version of a, is right

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.230
over there, and another
parallel version of b

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.950
is right over there.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.980
So this is the parallelogram
defined by a and b.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.910
So, going back to our surface
example, if we were to take the

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.070
cross product of this orange
vector and this white vector,

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.720
I'm going to get the surface
area, I'm going to get the area

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.580
of the parallelogram, defined
by these two vectors.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.760
So if I take the parallel
to that one, it will look

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.800
something like this, and then a
parallel to the orange one it

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.570
will look something like that.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.360
So if I take the cross product
of that and that, I'm going to

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.880
get the area of that
parallelogram.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.620
Now you might say, this is a
surface, you're taking a

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.250
straight-up parallelogram,
but remember, these are

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.170
super small changes.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.410
So you can imagine, a surface
can be broken up into

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.240
super small changes in
parallelograms, or infinitely

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.750
many parallelograms.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.130
And the more parallelograms you
have, the better approximation

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.160
of the surface you're
going to have.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.560
And this is no different than
when we first took integrals.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.690
We approximated the area
under the curve with a

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.600
bunch of rectangles.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.050
The more rectangles
we had, the better.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:28.190
So let's call this little
change in our surface d sigma,

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.660
for a little change, for a
little amount of our surface.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.820
And we could even say that, you
know, the surface area of the

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.580
surface will be the infinite
sum of all of these

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.070
infinitely small d sigmas.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.700
And there's actually a
little notation for that.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:48.750
So surface area is equal to, we
could integrate over the

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.950
surface, and the notation
usually is a capital sigma for

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.080
a surface as opposed to a
region or-- so you're

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.970
integrating over the surface,
and you do a double integral,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.490
because you're going in
two directions, right?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.450
A surface is a kind of a
folded, two-dimensional

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.810
structure.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.310
And you're going to take
the infinite sum of

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.380
all of the d sigmas.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.460
So this would be
the surface area.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.110
So that's what a d sigma is.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.950
Now we just figured out, we
just said, well, that d sigma

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.050
can be represented, that value,
that area, of that little part

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.210
of the surface, of that
parallelogram, can be

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.800
represented as a cross product
of those two vectors.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.550
So let me write here.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.840
And this is not
rigorous mathematics.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.930
The whole point here is to give
you the intuition of what a

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.710
surface integral is all about.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:40.670
So we can write that d sigma is
equal to the cross product of

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.940
the orange vector and
the white vector.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.270
The orange vector is
this, but we could also

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:45.860
write it like this.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.840
This was the result
from the last video.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.460
I'll write it in orange.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:57.960
So the partial of r with
respect to, I'm running out of

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.400
space, with respect to s, ds,
and it's going-- well, d sigma

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.120
is going to be the magnitude
of the cross product, not

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.860
just the cross product.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.705
The cross product by itself
will just give you a vector,

00:16:09.705 --> 00:16:11.930
and that's going to be useful
when we start doing

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.800
vector-valued surface
integrals, but just think

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.360
about it this way.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.400
So this orange vector is
the same thing is that.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.680
And we're going to take
the cross product of that

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.280
with this white vector.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.830
This white vector is the same
thing as that, which we saw,

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.870
which was the same
thing as this.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.900
The partial of r with
respect to t, dt.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.430
And we saw, if we take the
magnitude of that, that's going

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.630
to be equal to our little small
change in area, or the

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.500
area of this little
parallelogram over here

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.280
Now, you may or may not
remember that if you take

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.390
these, so let's just be clear.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.490
This and this, these
are vectors, right?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.480
When you take the partial
derivative of a vector-valued

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.560
function, you're still
getting a vector.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.400
This ds, this is a number.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.810
That's a number and
that's a number.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.600
And you might remember, when
we, in the linear algebra or

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.960
whenever you first saw taking
cross products, taking the

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.850
cross product of some
scalar multiple.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.670
You can take the scalars out.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.870
So if we take this number and
that number, we essentially

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.720
factor them out of
the cross product.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.190
This is going to be equal to
the magnitude of the cross

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:30.280
product of the partial of r,
with respect to s, crossed with

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.750
the partial of r with respect
to t, and then all of

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.370
that times these two
guys, over here.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.820
Times ds and dt.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.920
So I wrote this here, hey,
maybe our surface area, if we

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.830
were to take the sum of all of
these little d sigmas, but

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.880
there's no obvious way
to evaluate that.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.980
But we know that all of the d
sigmas, they're the same thing

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.500
as if you take all of the
ds's and all of the dt's.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.890
So you take all of the
ds's, all of the dt's.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.240
So this is a ds
times a dt, right?

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.570
A ds times a dt, ds times
a dt is right there.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:12.420
If we multiply this times the
cross product of the partial

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.740
derivative, this times this is
going to give us this area.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.940
So if we summed up all of this
times this, or this times this,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.490
if we summed them up over this
entire region, we will get all

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.210
of the parallelograms
in this region.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.280
We will get the surface area.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.870
So we can write-- I know this
is all a little bit convoluted.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.810
And you need to kind of
ponder a little bit.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.830
Surface intervals, at least in
my head, are one of the hardest

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.910
things to really visualize, but
it all hopefully makes sense.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.380
So we can say that this thing
right over here, the sum of all

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.400
of the little parallelograms on
our surface, or the surface

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.250
area, is going to be equal to,
instead of taking the sum over

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.280
the surface, let's take the sum
of all the ds times dt's over

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.430
this region right here.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.740
And of course, we're also
going to have to take

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.750
this cross product here.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.370
And we know how to do that.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.340
That's a double integral.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.440
for going to take the double
integral over this, we could

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.400
call it this region, or
this area, right here.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.460
That area is the same thing
as that whole area, right

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.230
over there, of this thing.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.710
I'll just write it in yellow.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.080
Of the cross product of the
partial of r with respect to

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.550
s, and the partial of
r with respect to t.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.100
ds and dt.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.600
And so you literally just take,
and it seems very convoluted in

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.800
how you're going to actually
evaluate it, but we were able

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.610
to express this thing called a
surface-- well, this is a very

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.710
simple surface integral-- in
something that we can

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.505
actually calculate.

00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:52.720
And in the next few videos, I'm
going to show you examples

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.450
of actually calculating it.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.080
Now, this right here will only
give you the surface area.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.560
But what if, at every point
here-- so over here what

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.970
we've done in both of these
expressions, is we're just

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.780
figuring out the surface area
of each of these parallelograms

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.380
and then adding them all up.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.430
That's what we're doing.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.480
But what if, associated with
each of those little

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.330
parallelograms, we had some
value, where that value is

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:24.030
defined by some third
function f of x, y, z?

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.240
So every parallelogram, it's
super small, it's around a

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.130
point, you can say it's maybe
the center of it, doesn't

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:30.880
have to be the center.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.350
But maybe the center of it
is at some point in

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.970
three-dimensional space, and if
you use some other function, f

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.080
of x, y, and z, you'll get the
value of that point.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.780
And what we want to do is
figure out what happens if

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.610
for every one of those
parallelograms, we were to

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.250
multiply it times the value of
the function at that point?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.450
So we could write it this way.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.230
So this is where, you can
imagine, the function

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.570
is just one.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.960
We're just multiplying each of
the parallelograms by one.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.640
But we could imagine we're
multiplying each of the little

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:09.360
parallelograms by f of x, y,
and z, d sigma, and it's going

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.130
to be the exact same thing,
where this is each of the

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.080
little parallelograms, we're
just going to multiply it

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.510
by f of x, y, and z there.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.880
So we're going to integrate
it over the area, over that

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.120
region, of f of x, y, and z,
and then times the magnitude of

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.660
the partial of r with respect
to f, crossed with the partial

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.900
of r with respect to t, ds, dt.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.390
And of course, we're
integrating with

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.340
respect to s and t.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.120
Hopefully we can express this
function in terms of s and

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.590
t, and we should be able
to, because we have a

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.980
parameterization there.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.090
Wherever we see an x
there, it's really x is

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.510
a function of s and t.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.510
y is a function of s and t.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.530
z is a function of s and t.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.040
And this might look super
convoluted and hard.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.580
And the visualizations for
this, of why you'd want

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.410
to do this, it has
applications in physics.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.510
It's a little hard
to visualize.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.780
It's easier just to visualize
the straight-up surface area.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.140
But we're going to see the next
few videos that it's a little

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.650
hairy to calculate these
problems, but they're

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.740
not too hard to do.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.950
That you just kind of
have to stick with them.
