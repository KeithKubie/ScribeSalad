GUNTHER ROLAND:
One of the changes

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.660
that we made over the
last three or four

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.780
years was to flip the
classroom in 8.13 and 8.14.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.560
Essentially what we found is
that we spend a lot of time

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.300
in class with lectures by the
lab staff which in the end

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.910
seemed to be only moderately
useful in really getting

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.070
the material across.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.960
So what we decided
to do was to export

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.570
the lectures in the form of
videos to the MITx platform

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.980
and replace the time that
we spent on that previously

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.430
with in-class exercises
and class discussions

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.230
to really rehearse some of the
concepts that were introduced

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.020
in the lectures in class,
which also gives us

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.720
a much closer communication
with the students.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.510
And you can find out what
it is that really needs

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.420
to be explored in more depth.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.874
The other thing
that we did is move

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:10.790
the prep questions for
each of the experiments

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.930
also to that platform.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.570
What is important
there is that we

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.150
can give the students
instantaneous feedback

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.030
on whether they got the
question right or not,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.560
and remove the manuals for the
labs onto the same platform

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.420
to have a lot of
that in one place.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.780
And I think, as I
said, the main benefit

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.570
is really that we can use
the time that we free up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.540
in the class for
discussions and exercises

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.790
that are much more effective
than the students sitting

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.470
there and listening
to one of us talk.
