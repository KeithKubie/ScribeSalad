00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:04.509
(electronic whooshing and beeping)

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.848
(gentle, relaxing music)

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.050
- I'm John Campbell,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.070
I'm a philosophy professor
in the department here.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.530
I'd like to welcome you to this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.700
wet and rainy Howison lecture,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.263
thank you for struggling through
the elements to get here.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.093
George Holmes Howison was born in 1834.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.882
When he was 50,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.000
he came from the University
of Washington at St. Louis

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.140
to take the first endowed chair
in philosophy at Berkeley,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.540
and he built the philosophy department.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.270
He was evidently a charismatic
and much loved individual.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.310
On his death, his friends and colleagues

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.190
put together a fund that
is funding today's lecture,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.720
even still, to continue his work

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.280
by bringing the most
influential thinkers of the day

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.600
out here to the rural
wilderness of California.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.520
And we're particularly
grateful to Philip Kitcher

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.110
for having made that long trek here today

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.453
to the rural sublime.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.790
Philip Kitcher is a John Dewey

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.700
professor of philosophy
at Columbia University.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.100
He did his PhD at Princeton,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460
having done his undergraduate work

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.683
at Christ's College in Cambridge.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.740
He began as a philosopher
of mathematics and science,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.290
but then focused on philosophy of biology,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.550
and then on the role
of biological research

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.610
in society and politics,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.290
and then on the role, generally,

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.493
of science in a democracy.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.717
He said, following Dewey,

00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:21.707
"I believe in the need for a
reconstruction of philosophy,

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.567
"so that it will not be

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:26.967
"a sentimental indulgence for the few."

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.950
I think it's fair to say
that his more recent,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.680
I hope it's fair to say,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.570
that his more recent work
has been deeply influenced

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.830
by John Dewey's pragmatism,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.750
including pragmatism about ethics.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.160
And coupled with the pragmatism,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.543
a long standing adherence to
a quite radical naturalism.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.890
He's written a flood
of well-received books,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.720
the two most recent have been

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.960
Life After Faith: The
Case for Secular Humanism,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.133
and The Seasons Alter:

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.703
How to Save Our Planet in Six Acts.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.673
So not a sentimental
indulgence for the few.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.590
He's also written on literature and music,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.399
in particular, on Joyce and Wagner,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.180
and on Thomas Mann and Muller.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.960
So will you please join me
in welcoming Philip Kitcher.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.850
His title today is
progress in the sciences

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.657
and in the arts.

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:33.824
(audience applauding)

00:03:35.383 --> 00:03:36.283
- Thank you, John.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.710
Thank you very much, John,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.563
for that extremely kind
and accurate introduction.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.680
It's a great honor to give
a lecture in this series,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.470
which has over the past
nearly 100 years, I think,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.680
drawn to Berkeley,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.663
to the rural wilderness
of Northern California,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.130
an incredibly distinguished
series of philosophers,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.900
and I feel slightly
humbled to be part of that.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.170
But it's a great pleasure to be here,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.193
and thank you very much for inviting me.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.410
So what I want to talk about today,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.740
and to the philosophy
department tomorrow as well,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.250
is part of a project to save

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.450
what I think of as an endangered concept.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.970
And that's the concept of progress.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.530
Now, many people in the current
world celebrate progress.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.940
Steven Pinker has recently written a book

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.190
about the importance of progress

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.433
of various kinds since the enlightenment.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.890
But many people are also skeptical.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.350
John Gray, for example,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.150
has written a recent book

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.430
in which he questions the
possibility of progress.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.910
He urges us to give up on the idea,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.810
the myth as he thinks of
it, of human progress.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.500
Now, there are many skeptics
about progress around,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.280
some people who think that
it doesn't make sense,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.900
that it serves merely as a concept

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.460
that we use to congratulate
ourselves unwarrantedly.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.560
I'm a friend of the concept of progress,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.320
but I have to also to admit

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.060
that I think that the skeptics

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.600
and the warriors are onto something.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.130
I think that the breezy confidence

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.230
that Steven Pinker sometimes
displays is unwarranted,

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.020
and that this concept
deserves a deeper probing.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.640
And I want to do part
of that probing today,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.300
but in a very restricted set of context,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.990
I want to talk about
progress in two domains,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.820
in the sciences and in the arts.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.440
And let me begin

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.800
by thinking about progress concepts.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.820
Because I think many of the worries

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.580
that people have about progress

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.010
come from not thinking
carefully and precisely enough

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.770
about what a progress concept is.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.040
And I'm going to do
something, graduate students,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.290
this is a throwback to
the dim and distant past,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.100
when people talked about the
logic of various concepts,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.513
and I want to talk about the
logic of progress concepts.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.640
So when you talk about progress,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.450
you focus on something,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.340
I'm going to call that thing, a system.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.960
And you compare two of its states.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.080
And you say, a change has occurred between

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.140
the former state and the later state,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.000
and that change is a progressive one.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.960
And you can do this for
any number of systems,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.030
you could talk about the Catholic Church,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.830
dividing time up according to papacies,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.510
and ask whether the Catholic Church

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.330
is making progress under Pope Francis.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.740
Or you could talk about the
theory of the chemical bond

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.620
and look at it at various stages

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.680
from the 19th century to the present,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.250
and ask whether that
theory has made progress.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.050
Or you could take a child,
or a young musician,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.613
and ask, is this musician making progress?

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.600
And sometimes, it's useful to introduce

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.860
mathematical concepts in doing that,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.930
that's especially so in
a fourth kind of case.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.150
Imagine you have a friend
who's in the hospital,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.530
there's some substance inside

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.640
your friend's body or in the bloodstream

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.810
or something like that,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.980
that is different from what it should be,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.560
perhaps it's too high.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.660
And the doctors chart
your friend's progress

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.400
by looking at the ways in which

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.180
the concentration changes over time.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.860
And if you had measurements
for each time point,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.280
you could, as it were,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.090
talk about continuous,
the continuous changes,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.290
and the intervals in
which progress was made,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.573
and the intervals in
which it was not made.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.260
So that's the first part of
the logic of progress concepts.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.210
The second is that your progress concept

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.530
can be more or less ambitious.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.310
You can set out to compare
any two temporal states

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.310
of the system that you're interested in.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.760
You give me a pair of
years in the history,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.390
let's say of New York City,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.240
and I'll tell you which
one was progressive

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.623
with respect to the other one, okay?

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.030
Or you can be much more cautious and say,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.200
well, I'm actually not really interested

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.370
in making all kinds of comparisons,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.740
I just want to make some
kinds of comparisons.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.150
And I'm particularly interested in

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.360
temporarily adjacent pairs of states.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.010
That's because I often want
to use my progress concept

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.720
in deciding how to go on,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.680
asking myself, would I make progress

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.083
by going in this direction
rather than that?

00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:50.620
And you might then aim for something

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.020
that is locally complete.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.560
That is you can make comparisons between

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.260
all pairs of temporarily adjacent states.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.680
But even if you couldn't have that,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.230
having some ideas about
which were progressive

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.030
with respect to which others

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.333
would still sometimes be very helpful.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.760
The third part of my
logic of progress concepts

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.923
is the most important.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.560
We tend to think of progress in terms

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.510
of narrowing the distance to a fixed goal

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.940
that's set out in advance.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.750
So if you go on a family trip,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.100
and you're going to a particular place,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.570
then you measure your progress

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.420
by the diminishing distance

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.233
of yourselves from that place.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.500
But much progress isn't like that.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.390
There's another concept,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.010
think of it in terms of progress from,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.083
which I'll call pragmatic progress.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.320
Pragmatic progress

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.340
occurs when you solve
some of the problems,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.893
or expand some of the limits
of your current practice.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.470
Okay, think about a technology,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.080
I heartily dislike the
technology of the smartphone.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.823
I don't actually own one.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.963
I refuse to get drawn into this culture.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.610
But the smartphone is not

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.610
oriented towards some platonic
ideal of the smartphone,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.380
glimpsed by those who are lucky enough

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.003
to come out into the light
of Silicon Valley, right?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.580
That's not the way it works.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.110
People make progress with
respect to smartphone technology

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.020
by focusing on the glitches
and the difficulties

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.710
and the limits of current smartphones,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.620
and trying to remove those.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.930
So we get progress from a not progress

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.593
to any long term fixed goal.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.380
Okay, so I've begun in
this rather pedantic

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.090
and sort of analytic philosophical mode,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.360
because I want to draw some morals.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.830
And the first of these

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.470
is that when we think
about progress in a domain,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.060
like the sciences, or like the arts,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.860
the first question we should ask is,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.013
how are we defining the
states of these systems?

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.570
The second question that we might ask

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.770
is whether we're committed to

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.890
finding a progress concept
that will be so ambitious

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.630
that it will allow us to
compare any pair of states.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.840
And the third is whether
we need to talk about

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.453
some long term enduring
goal fixed in advance.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.310
So I'll start with the sciences.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.610
And think about some popular
decisions that people make

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.943
when they talk about
progress in this realm.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.110
The first of these popular decisions

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.430
is that when people think
about progress in science,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.530
they say the things like,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.770
we know more than we used to.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.250
And that leads them to focus

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.360
on a set of propositions that are,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.600
as is sometimes said,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.050
on the books at a
particular moment in time.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.010
We might think of those as
the corpus of propositions

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.723
accepted by the relevant
community at that time.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.530
And then they make a further move

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.480
that progress is teleological,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.240
they think of the sciences
as advancing towards

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.603
some sort of complete truth.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.180
Perhaps it's the complete
truth about nature,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.730
or perhaps it's the
complete truth in a domain,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.690
as cell biologists might want to know

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.453
the complete truth about cells.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.340
I want to suggest that both

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.243
of these things are problematic.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.450
First, as has been familiar

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.400
for at least half a century,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.940
there's far more to scientific practice

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.410
than a simple set of propositions.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.220
The science of a time contains
lots of other things too,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.890
it contains instruments,
techniques, rules of evidence,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.113
and we can make progress
in all of these respects.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.720
But more fundamentally,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.350
the idea of scientific
progress as teleological

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.273
deserves serious scrutiny.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.590
Think about the idea of the
complete truth about nature,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.280
or the complete truth about any

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.313
significant aspect of nature.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.520
As a goal for human inquiry,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.863
that seems absurd.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.073
If Paolo Mancosu were here,
I would ask him whether,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.680
the truth, the whole truth about nature

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.590
might even be too big.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.750
It's not even coherent to think about

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.430
the whole truth about nature.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.630
But even if it is,

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.253
it's not something that we
could ever hope to attain.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.070
So I think there are serious worries about

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.853
these standard ways of thinking
about scientific progress.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.723
And I'll illustrate that by
thinking about this room.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.820
How many truths are there about this room

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.523
for the period of this lecture?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.970
Well, I was originally
trained in mathematics,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.480
and when I think about this,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.020
it's pretty easy to generate an answer.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.670
There's some infinite number

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.300
at least as great as the
power of the continuum.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.430
Why is that?

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.770
Because there are continuum

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.870
many spatial points in this room,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.290
there are continuum many temporal points

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.800
in the interval that
this lecture will last.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.920
And at each of those space time points,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.270
there's going to be

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.060
values of particular physical magnitudes,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.420
and then there are all
the two place relations,

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.690
the three place relations,

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.280
the four place relations, and so on.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.580
You can see you get quite
a lot quite quickly.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.433
Could any human language
express all of those truths?

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.923
If so, which language ought to be chosen?

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.300
How many potential languages are there

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.913
for recording these truths?

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.420
And how many of these
truths are worth knowing?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.153
I hope the answer to the final
question is more than one.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.163
If not, I'm in trouble.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.160
Now, the obvious reply
to what I've just said,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.810
is that that's a distortion

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.823
of the teleological approach
to scientific progress.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.210
We don't want them, this
awful, vast mass of truth,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.270
what we want is a special kind of truth.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.410
We want nature's rulebook,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.890
we want the axioms of
the fundamental theories

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.600
from which we could then derive

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.400
all of the other truths about nature.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.240
Well, in principle, we
could derive all of them,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.300
in practice, we could derive any of them

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.330
that are of interest to us.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.470
So that's what we want.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.740
And once we have that,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.770
we can address any
question that concerns us.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.340
This image of science remains

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.660
extremely popular among journalists,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.680
among academics generally,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.920
and among philosophers outside
of philosophy of science.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.270
They think in terms of
a Newtonian picture,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.940
the kind of thing that Newton
celebrated in the Principia,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.340
where he says, I wish we
could derive all the phenomena

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.073
by ways similar to the

00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:23.283
principles I've shown in
the theory of gravitation.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.810
And scientists in various domains

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.733
have struggled to live up to that.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.720
But it really doesn't work.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.780
And it fails for two reasons.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.853
First of all, there's vertical failure.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.470
If you think of the sciences

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.340
as ordered in some kind
of vertical hierarchy,

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.050
physics could either be at
the top as the highest science

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.480
or at the bottom as the
most fundamental science,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.750
then there's chemistry,
then there's biology,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.400
then there's neuroscience
and there's psychology,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.870
then there are things like
economics and sociology,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.163
and so on and so forth.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.810
The trouble is that you can't get

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.880
from the most fundamental
level all the way up,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.430
because there are junctures

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.500
at which the derivations go astray.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.500
You can't derive all the
allegedly special sciences

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.910
from the allegedly fundamental ones.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.350
You can't, for example, get
genetics out of biochemistry.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.030
But that's less important
than another point.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.660
And that is what I'll
call horizontal failure,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.920
to distinguish it from
the vertical failure.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.690
And that is that universal
principles are rare.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.800
They're welcome when we can find them,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.150
but most of the time in most fields,

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.890
scientists have to settle for
a loose collection of models.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.870
Models that will cover the cases

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.410
that are of most interest to them.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.340
And sometimes no single model will do.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.590
I suspect that in climate forecasting,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.680
we are forever committed

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.930
to using a family of models

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.280
that will partially
agree with one another,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.390
and will partially
diverge from one another.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.900
The moral of my story

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.390
is that science then is
inevitably selective.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.950
Scientists proceed by looking at

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.240
certain kinds of questions about nature.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.240
And that agenda of questions
evolves over historical time.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.490
And we might ask how it's determined.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.570
Most of the time when we
think about a science,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.110
we take it for granted that the scientists

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.100
are asking the right kinds of questions.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.580
They are asking questions

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.570
about the genuinely significant things,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.960
the things that we ought
to be asking about.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.970
And almost all the time, I want to say,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.113
that assumption is completely justified.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.400
But it isn't always justified.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.560
And looking at cases in
which it isn't justified,

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.950
points us in the direction of seeing

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.150
how there's something more fundamental

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.520
about scientific progress
than simply taking for granted

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.670
what scientists actually hail

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.080
as the questions that are significant

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.393
and important to answer.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.140
So, let's go back to
the early 20th century,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.470
and ask a question about genetics.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.010
In 1900,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.910
three scientists
independently rediscovered

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.120
Mendel's laws, or Mendel's rules,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.720
as they were called at the time.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.300
In 1925,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.840
lots of things had already happened

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.390
in the development of genetics.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.040
People had begun to understand

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.650
the relation between
genes and chromosomes,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.490
they had used that to start gene mapping,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.730
they were able to identify

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.200
all sorts of details of gene expression,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080
in particular organisms, in particular,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.833
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.260
All of that was terrific.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.050
And inclines us to say, yes,

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.050
genetics was making fantastic progress.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.640
But it was also doing something different.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.880
The building you see there,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.690
the Eugenics Record Office

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.970
is now Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.680
And in the teens and the 20s,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.940
it was set up to address

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.130
and come to terms with
socially important questions

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.890
about things like feeble mindedness

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.163
and the decline of the race.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.300
Much of this, as was pointed out

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.270
wonderfully and lucidly by
the late Stephen Jay Gould,

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.720
was profoundly socially destructive,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.053
and morally, extraordinarily dubious.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.220
And there was a whimsical side to it too.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.850
One of the genes that was sought

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.340
by the people earnestly involved
in this kind of research

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.350
was a gene for thalassophilia.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.810
Those of you with a little Greek

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.740
will know what thalassophilia is,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.760
it's a condition typically expressed

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.900
in males between the ages of 14 and 18,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.853
that leads them to run away to sea.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.390
Now, that sort of thing we
could take in our stride,

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.520
right, you're locating
genes on chromosomes,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.440
you're mapping genes, you're
doing lots of good stuff.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.470
Yeah, if scientists do a little bit

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.600
of peculiar whimsy on the
side, that's no big deal.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.480
But the genes for feeble mindedness,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.480
all of that attempt to understand

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.150
the genetic determinants of
socially consequential behavior

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.460
was profoundly worrying.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.400
And so it seems to me that
the verdict on genetics

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.400
in the early 20th century has to be mixed.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.770
And it has to be mixed

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.570
because the frame with
which we naturally start,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.510
the frame of saying, well,

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.060
the scientists were asking
the important questions,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.080
that assumption is suspect in this case.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.830
We have to move to a wider frame,

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.130
and we have to ask about the way in which

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.743
the science is actually
embedded in society.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.370
So I want to say that the
sciences make progress

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.793
when they contribute to
the wider human good.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.820
They supply information
relevant to people's projects,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.960
and that information is made accessible

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.830
to those who need it.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.200
When scientists are doing that,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.280
it is right to call

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.670
their answering of those
questions as progressive.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.500
But sometimes, they pose
different kinds of questions,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.050
and if those kinds of questions

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.450
have socially damaging consequences,

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.400
then we should not be so swift to declare

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.830
that the science in
question is making progress.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.260
Some years ago, I tried to embed this

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.840
in an ideal of well-ordered science,

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.230
where I thought of the
common good as determined

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.840
through a process of deliberation

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.020
among representatives of various

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.970
points of view in the population,

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.900
who would try to identify
the questions in a field

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.420
that should be given priority

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.270
after they had informed one
another of one another's needs,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.060
and after they were dedicated
to try to meet those needs.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.740
And then well-ordered
science would also include

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.080
the thought that the
answers to those questions

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.373
flowed out into the general population.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.070
And that gives me

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.070
a pragmatic sense of scientific progress,

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.787
science solves certain kinds of problems,

00:23:24.787 --> 00:23:27.370
and the kinds of problems that it

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.757
should be solving to make progress

00:23:29.757 --> 00:23:32.250
are the problems that

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.883
people need to have answers to.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.280
And that means that what we have

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.170
is a broader sense of scientific progress

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.420
than the one that we started with,

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.603
one that involves certain
kinds of social elements.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.660
All right.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.963
Now I'm gonna turn to
the case of the arts.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.330
Here, we make

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.660
a very simple way of thinking about this,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.910
that dominates our
conversations about the arts.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.400
We think about the state
of any mode of art,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.230
music, or literature, or painting,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.790
in any time period is
consisting in the works

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.143
that are produced during that time period.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.970
And sometimes we think of one
period as superior to another.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.680
Think about English drama
between 1580 and 1620,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.593
and compare that with English
drama between 1620 and 1660.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.860
Well, the first period wins, doesn't it?

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.530
I mean, the first period,
you have Christopher Marlowe.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.010
You have John Webster,
John Ford, Ben Johnson,

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.500
George Peele, John
Fletcher, Francis Beaumont,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.940
to name just a few of the people

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.130
who were around at that time.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.490
And in the second period,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.000
you're probably at a loss to name anybody

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.350
whose plays still survive,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.760
anybody who was active.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.760
Course I cheated, I chose my
periods extremely carefully.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.430
And between 1620 and 1660,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.630
well, the theaters were actually shut down

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.400
for part of that time under Cromwell,

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.780
and that didn't really encourage

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.980
a lot of terrific playwriting.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.730
So I mean, it's a bit of a cheat,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.770
on the other hand, you can see the way

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.423
in which this is supposed to work.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.670
So the popular conclusions are,

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.830
the arts don't make progress at all,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.610
but the sciences, by contrast,

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.390
are the parade case of progress.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.337
Well, we've examined the scientific case,

00:25:34.337 --> 00:25:37.883
and I hope I've shown you
what I think lies behind it.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.363
But it's deeply unfair.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.110
And the unfairness can be demonstrated

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.520
when we look at the
ways in which we define

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.710
those original states for the two cases.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:51.880
In the case of science,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.430
we said that the state
consists of a set of resources,

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.870
propositions and instruments
accepted at that time,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.010
and available for use by the
people who live at that time.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.080
And progress consists in the fact that

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.260
those resources accumulate

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.673
and become better adapted
to the needs of the people.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.900
In the case of the arts,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.130
we defined the state very differently.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.380
We just looked at the works
produced during a time period.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.580
And so in the case of music,

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.320
we might say music doesn't make progress.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.860
Did the music of 2015

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.440
make progress over the music of 1905?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.590
Get serious,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.280
nothing composed in 2015
rivals Debussy's La mer,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.140
or Schoenberg's first String Quartet.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.027
And then there are some pieces by Webern,

00:26:40.027 --> 00:26:42.750
and I can throw in a bit of Desur too.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.990
Or if you incline to popular music,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.500
nothing written in the last decade

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.380
rivals the music of The
Beatles, The Stones,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.510
The Grateful Dead, all those great people

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.670
of the 60s and early 70s,

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.823
you know, get serious about it, okay?

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.717
So, good, let's apply that same standard

00:27:01.717 --> 00:27:03.970
to physics, for example.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.520
No physical discovery of 2015,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.610
see, I chose my dates carefully, again,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.240
rivals what Einstein did in 1905.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.320
Four papers, the one that I've got there

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.840
is the famous paper on special relativity,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.300
but we shouldn't forget the
paper on E equals MC squared,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.300
paper on Brownian motion,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.833
the black body radiation paper, you know.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.300
I think any one of those papers dominates

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.360
pretty much what the physics
community produced in 2015.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.210
So, you know,

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.560
what's sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.720
if we do it one way in one case,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.593
shouldn't we do it the
same way in the other case?

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.640
But the real point of this, of course,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.090
is to get you started
on thinking differently

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.000
about progress in the arts,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.563
not to suggest that progress
doesn't occur in the sciences.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.050
The physics available today

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.180
includes what Einstein
contributed in 1905.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.400
Indeed, practicing physicists

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.640
don't have to go back and read
those early Einstein papers.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.800
They're available in smoother

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.570
and technically more accessible forms

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.653
in the textbooks from
which the physicists learn.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.890
And the music available today

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.310
includes what Debussy and
Schoenberg composed in 1905,

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.280
and what The Beatles and The Stones

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.260
and the rest of them
did in the 60s and 70s.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.580
And so in both cases,

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.460
we might say there's progress,
science and the arts,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.850
and expanding collection of resources

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.283
that help with human lives
and human flourishing.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.050
So what I want to say
about both of these cases,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.170
is that the concepts
of progress that apply

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.340
are local, not global,

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.410
I don't think we can make all comparisons,

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.530
and pragmatic, not teleological.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.200
And in both cases,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.190
what we get is an
accumulation of resources

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.433
that help human beings to live better.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.300
And this also brings to our attention

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.670
something that I won't stress today,

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.220
but I think it's an important point,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.510
that in both instances,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.470
it's an important part of overall progress

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.970
that there should be
institutions and parts of society

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.970
that make those resources
widely accessible.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.030
So the ways in which the sciences

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.660
and the arts flow out into the public,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.900
are also very important.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.530
And without them,

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.780
we might not be as confident as we are

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.270
in talking about the progress of science

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.913
or the progress of the arts.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.470
But we shouldn't stop.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.520
I've only so far scratched the surface

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.130
of both of these domains.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.930
I want to ask what exactly

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.200
the contributions that these domains make,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.410
because maybe there are
residual differences

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.420
when we look more closely at
the kinds of contributions

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.390
made by the arts and by the sciences.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.933
So let's talk about the
scientific contributions.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.530
I usually say when I
talk about this topic,

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.300
you know, if I went out on the street,

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.740
and I asked people on the street,

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.000
what is it that the sciences contribute

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.670
that makes us think of them as

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.070
important parts of human progress?

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.980
I usually say, well,
what you typically get

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.710
is stuff about medicine,
agricultural innovations,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.173
bits of technology.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.050
I suspect that isn't true in Berkeley.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.400
I suspect if I went out
on the street in Berkeley,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.090
I might get a different answer,

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.630
I might get what I'm going
to call the official view,

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.050
that what we actually get from science

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.980
is an increased understanding

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.423
of the universe and its operations.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.940
Ah, it's not all the medicines,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.660
it's not all the new food stuffs,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.276
it's not all of that.

00:31:03.276 --> 00:31:05.760
It's not the bits of technology,

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.020
it's the human understanding that we get,

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.653
that's what's really crucial.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.860
And this was brought home to me

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.370
when I came back from a
run a couple of years ago.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.980
And I ran into a friend of mine,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.417
who's a theoretical physicist who said,

00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:22.215
"You've gotta listen to the radio,

00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:24.097
"gotta listen to the
radio, 10:15 this morning,

00:31:24.097 --> 00:31:27.707
"it's the greatest scientific
announcement of our lifetime."

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.180
He was born in the same year I was,

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.570
so I knew that what he said was false,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.734
since the greatest scientific
achievement of our lifetime

00:31:36.734 --> 00:31:39.540
was made when we were six,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.940
when Watson and Crick discovered

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.470
the molecular structure of DNA.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.120
But I didn't want to
sort of spoil his fun.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.290
And what he was alluding to

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.290
was the detection of gravitational waves.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.240
All right.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.290
That for him, and for his community,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.600
is what's really important
about scientific progress,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.003
the increase in understanding.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.640
Now, when we turn to the arts,

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.683
it seems that these
appear much more nebulous.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.890
And that might be because

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.640
when people think about the
contributions of the arts,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.930
they think, they compare them

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.180
to the practical benefits of science.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.550
So if the everyday view
is the dominant view,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.477
I think one can understand why people say,

00:32:30.477 --> 00:32:32.980
ah, the arts, they don't
contribute as much,

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.100
they aren't as important

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.960
in us accumulating these resources,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.940
the things that are really important

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.140
are the practical stuff.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.400
So I wonder whether the popular comparison

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.330
actually presupposes what
I call the everyday view,

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.440
rather than the official view

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.223
adopted by my friend, the
theoretical physicist.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.330
I want to answer the question,

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.450
what do the arts contribute,

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.480
in a Deweyan pragmatist style.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.960
I want to think about the arts

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.263
as enriching human experience.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.490
And I want to think of this

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.590
as having a number of different dimensions

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.290
of which I'll list three today.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:22.290
First is the intensity of
aesthetic experience itself.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.480
Just the fact of engaging
with a work of literature,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.460
or a work of visual art or a film,

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.660
or a performance of dance,

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.523
or with a building, or
with a piece of music,

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.170
brings us to moments where I think we feel

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:45.150
vitally alive and an intensity that is

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.140
absent quite a lot of
the rest of the time.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.290
So that I think is an
important part of it.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.110
But this isn't,

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.060
these are not simply
isolated events or episodes,

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.350
these are things which
often it seems to me

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.710
recur in our further experience.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.820
So that later experiences that we have had

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.370
are transformed by the aesthetic
experiences of the past.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.900
What, our relation to a particular poem,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.600
our relation to a piece
of music or to a painting

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.303
informs the way that we
have further experiences.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.790
And they interact with one another

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.173
in ways I will want to
try to sketch later on.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.450
And that can lead not simply to

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.610
an enrichment of our experience over time,

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.840
but also, I think, to cognitive gains.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.240
So I'm taking a stand here,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.170
a Deweyan stand on issues in aesthetics

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.270
that often divide theorists.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.695
I'm saying, I'm putting in

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:56.770
my case for pluralism.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.950
That we should not think about

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.780
all individual works of art as valuable,

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.370
in the same way and for the same reason,

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.530
because they may do differently

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.000
on these different dimensions

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.113
of aesthetic contribution.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.000
So I think in the case of works of art,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.130
they give us new cognitions,

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.480
but they don't do it by
informing us directly,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.040
by asserting or arguing with us.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.560
The novels and works of literature

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.893
that argue with us and that are didactic,

00:35:36.286 --> 00:35:39.140
I think in particular of Sartre here,

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.273
rather than Camus,

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.040
seem to me less effective

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.663
than the works that show us things.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.390
But the cognitive contributions

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.780
come from modifying the
ways in which we approach

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.820
other parts of our experience,

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.983
they show us new possibilities.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.890
And I want to say they sometimes

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.690
provide us with new vocabularies,

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.660
they refigure the starting points

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.920
and methods of our discursive reasoning.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.070
When we think about
cognitive contributions,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.730
I think we have a tendency to think

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.910
as if they consisted in
providing us premises

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.100
from which we might then draw

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.890
new and different conclusions.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.570
But I don't think that great works of art

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.260
and literature work that way.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.710
I think they show us things

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.710
that lead us to conceptual revision.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.160
And that is not necessarily

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.670
something that occurs in the moment.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.780
It's something that occurs
through the rebuilding

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.440
of something in our psychology

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.360
that I'm going to call
a synthetic complex.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.170
So think about the ways in which you react

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.730
when you read a work of fiction or a poem,

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.700
or when you listen to a piece of music,

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.520
or when you look at a picture
that really moves you.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.130
You pass through a sequence
of psychological states,

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.860
and those are partly shaped
by your antecedent judgments

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.390
and conceptions and emotions,

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.750
and partly the product of your
apprehension of the words,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.493
the colors and the sounds.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.410
Out of that process

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.780
comes something different.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:19.130
And it's something that unfolds
in your reflection on it,

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.980
and in the interaction between
what has happened to you

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.300
and your further experience,

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.230
that rebuilds the ways in which

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.010
your emotional and cognitive dispositions,

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.340
and your dispositions
to use various concepts,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.633
fit together.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.770
And so you get a restructuring

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.940
of a part of your psychological life.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.560
This happened, I think,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.920
I mean, I will give two very
simple and obvious cases.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.660
This happened for some Victorian
readers of Dickens' novels,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.570
when they read not only

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.250
Dickens' descriptions of
the plight of the poor,

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.800
but also Dickens' vocalizations

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.450
of the reactions of the bourgeoisie,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.410
to the plight of the poor.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.470
People came to see
themselves in those voices,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.820
and they didn't like what they saw there.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.427
And it came famously in
Harriet Beecher Stowe's

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.810
novel Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:22.950
in some ways as a work of literature,

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.090
it's not a wonderful piece of writing,

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.489
but boy is it powerful

00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:32.070
in changing the ways in which people think

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.330
about their social relations with others.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.780
Even if Lincoln didn't say

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.387
to Harriet Beecher Stowe when he met her,

00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:43.360
"So you're the little lady
who started this great war,"

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.113
it's something it seems to
me, he ought to have said.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.130
So I think the same thing goes on

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.240
in our interactions with
bits of science, sometimes.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.010
I think scientific understanding

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.913
can do the same sort of thing.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.420
I think it did that for Richard Dawkins,

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.860
who's written eloquently about this,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.330
and who says, very often,

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.757
you know, "How unfortunate
are those people

00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:12.037
"who are deprived of seeing the world

00:39:12.037 --> 00:39:13.597
"through a Darwinian lens,

00:39:13.597 --> 00:39:15.690
"look at what they are missing."

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.810
And I resonate with that in Dawkins,

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.460
I can see why he says it,

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.150
and I think I can
understand the phenomenon

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.733
to which he is pointing.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.840
But now, I want to ask a question.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.480
We won't have a vote on this.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.300
But when I've asked questions of people

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.100
I've talked to about this
material in the past,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.980
I get a fairly strong reaction.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.380
And that is that most people

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.800
in whom I ask about this,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.087
after they've heard me talk about,

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.750
you know, art and science

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.120
and along these or similar lines,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.940
will say, yeah, actually, for me,

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.680
it's the works of literature I've read,

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.313
it's the music I've heard,
it's the films I've seen.

00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:03.210
That's what's done most for me

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.653
in having an impact for change in my life.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.660
But many people who are deeply immersed

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.820
in the practice of the sciences will say,

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.990
no, it's the sciences.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.690
I don't want to make judgments about this,

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.509
I think there are possibly temperaments

00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:29.077
that lead people into different
areas of work and research,

00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:32.400
and some people may, because
of their temperaments,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.600
be more inclined to pursue courses of life

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.900
that lead the arts to be
more important for them

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.063
than the sciences.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.010
Another question we might ask

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.280
is whether within the sciences themselves,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.430
these artistic reshapings
play a critical role

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.840
at moments of great scientific change.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.230
That's a thesis that Thomas Kuhn,

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.693
who once taught here at Berkeley,

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.100
floated in a book that he wrote

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.210
before the structure of
scientific revolutions,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.283
in his book on the Copernican revolution.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.610
So I'm going to,

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.890
just a moment of subversion,

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.530
a subversive thesis.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.840
If scientific progress is understood

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.300
in terms of the pure benefits
of greater understanding,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.750
maybe the case for progress in the arts

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.170
is stronger than that, for
progress in the sciences,

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.930
because of the phenomenon
to which I've just alluded.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.650
The fact that it seems
that for most people,

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.120
it's works of art that have this

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.913
transformative impact on their lives.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.340
But there's a residual difference,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.360
and this is going to lead me back

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.773
towards the worries with which I began.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.010
Scientific progress, you might say,

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:52.613
is cumulative in ways that
progress in the arts isn't.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.703
And that's because of a phenomena

00:41:54.703 --> 00:41:57.210
that I pointed to earlier,

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.360
that the scientists don't have to go back

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.830
and read Einstein's 1905 relativity paper.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.160
The later stages of a science absorb

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.840
and they build on the
efforts of earlier stages,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.670
whereas the arts, always are looking for

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.053
new ways forward, new forms of creativity.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.997
In the words of Harold Bloom,

00:42:18.997 --> 00:42:23.160
"Poets engage in strong
misreadings of their predecessors."

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.963
They don't, sort of,

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.620
just thrust them into the past,

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.293
they wrestle with them and
come to something entirely new.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.370
Now in changing environments,

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.890
new directions in art,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.783
and sometimes new genres
of art are needed.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.770
The works of literature
that might have satisfied

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.620
one particular generation living

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.920
in a particular kind of world don't speak,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.390
or they don't speak vividly and forcefully

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.093
to people who live later.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.990
And that's because the
environments in which we live,

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.973
physical, social and cultural can change.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.210
So art we might think
of as constantly renewed

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.873
to adapt to the features of the age.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.930
Not all past artworks
lose their significance

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.053
by any means, that's for sure.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.410
In the history of the string quartet,

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.870
the great string quartets
of the 20th century,

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.310
Schoenberg's, Bartok's, Janacek's,

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:31.423
don't make Beethoven and
Haydn and Mozart irrelevant.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.600
But by contrast,

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.130
the words and things that
all the scientists produce

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.530
are often hidden

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.493
by the accomplishments
of their successors.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.550
So nobody would go back
and try to learn chemistry

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:49.913
from Lavoisier's revolutionary book.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.540
Nobody interested in astronomy today

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.910
would pick up Galileo's telescope.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.110
Interestingly though,

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.710
biologists still turn back to Darwin.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.820
Darwin is one of the
great exceptions to this.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.573
Darwin continues to be relevant
to the biology of today.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:16.170
And in this process, there's a change.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.020
And I think Eliot caught this

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.480
in his essay on tradition
and the individual talent.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.307
Where he says, "No poet,
no artist of any art

00:44:24.307 --> 00:44:26.407
"has his complete meaning alone.

00:44:26.407 --> 00:44:28.317
"You cannot value him alone,

00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:29.747
"you must set him for contrast

00:44:29.747 --> 00:44:31.517
"and comparison among the dead.

00:44:31.517 --> 00:44:33.947
"What happens when a new
work of art is created

00:44:33.947 --> 00:44:36.297
"is something that happens simultaneously

00:44:36.297 --> 00:44:39.327
"to all the works of
art which preceded it."

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.720
And that means that there are gains

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.340
and losses with respect to the arts.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.760
And that happened with respect to poetry

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.910
because of the kind of poetry

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.970
that Eliot and his friends wrote.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.230
After Eliot, Pound and Yates,

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.640
Dante, Donne and Tennyson
get read differently.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.640
Dante is somehow elevated,

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.780
he's somehow much more relevant,

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.343
much more important than he had seemed,

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.420
say, to the Victorians.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.910
Donne emerges from being a quirky

00:45:15.096 --> 00:45:17.810
odd figure in the 17th century,

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.120
to being a lively and interesting

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.700
and profoundly relevant poet.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.023
And poor Tennyson,

00:45:25.524 --> 00:45:29.510
the beloved poet of the mid
19th century and beyond,

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.163
somehow sounds lesser than he did.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.200
If you listen to Schoenberg's
third string quartet,

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.300
and then listen to Beethoven's
third Rasumovsky quartet,

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.350
as I once did at a concert in Berlin,

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.200
where they played them in that order,

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.160
the Beethoven sounds

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.070
completely different after the Schoenberg,

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.300
and you can understand why

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.430
the first performance of
the Rasumovsky quartets,

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.140
the musicians protested,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.320
tore up the scores and trampled on them.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.083
I mean, it suddenly sounds
incredibly revolutionary.

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:08.730
So these things, this point
that derives from Eliot,

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.220
I think, raises a possibility,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.240
the possibility of loss.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.470
That you can lose access
to a former work of art

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.463
that might have been valuable for you.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:22.530
And I wonder whether the same can happen

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.523
with respect to the sciences.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.040
But the important theme
that I want to draw

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.380
from this general phenomenon,

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.280
concerns something that I think is

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.030
deeply lying behind the skepticism

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.860
about progress with which I began.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.160
And that's the idea of people somehow

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.840
being at odds with their
own times with the age.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.533
You know, I have already confessed,

00:46:48.533 --> 00:46:50.280
I don't own a smartphone,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.693
so maybe I am one of these people.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.100
I think it makes sense
to say of some people

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.050
that their lives would have gone better

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.150
if they'd lived in earlier times,

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.910
that their temperaments and talents

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.793
are more adapted to those times.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:11.240
And that means that we might think

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.750
that the artistic or scientific resources

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.780
available at a later time,

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.300
do not allow the people living at the time

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.210
to live as well as they would have done

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.270
at some earlier time.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.400
They are less well adapted
than they would have been.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.160
And this means that my comparison

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.610
on which I have been building
throughout this lecture,

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.510
is only one possible way

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.340
of making these comparisons.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.170
There are in fact, two concepts

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.680
that we might focus on in thinking about

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.580
socially embedded notions of progress

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.383
for the arts and the sciences.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.890
The first says, fix the environment.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:54.973
Fix the present.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.490
Ask whether life in this environment

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.090
would go better with the
resources of the past

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.010
or with those of the present.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.110
That's what I've used,

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.540
and I've said, well,

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.900
in the present, typically,

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.370
you have most of the resources

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.900
that you would have had in the
past and a few more besides,

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.220
and in both cases, probably the things

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.090
that are developed in the sciences

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.072
are adapted to the differences

00:48:18.072 --> 00:48:20.890
that have emerged in the present.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.533
So progress comes quite easily.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.083
But ask a different question.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.540
Consider life with the past resources

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.430
in the past environment,

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.260
compare it with life with
the present resources

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.923
in the present environment.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.450
If you do that, you may
not get the same answer,

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.363
you might get different verdicts.

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:46.163
So there are two notions or
two standards for progress.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.140
I want to say that a practice like science

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.140
or art or religion
would make weak progress

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.730
if the developments
between the earlier stage

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.740
and the later stage enable those

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.070
who live at the later stage to live better

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:00.980
than they would have done

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.680
if the earlier form of the
practice had continued unaltered.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.080
That's the notion where
you fix the environment.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.910
It makes strong progress

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.670
if the developments made between

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.700
the earlier stage and the later stage

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.110
enable those who live at the later stage

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.273
to live better than those who
lived at the earlier stage.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.980
The people who are
skeptical about progress

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.963
are skeptical often about strong progress.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.680
And I haven't really responded
to what they say here.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.723
That's because I think
that they have a point.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.800
So I'll conclude, I think
weak progress is very common

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.910
in the histories of both
the sciences and the arts.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.970
I think strong progress often occurs

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.090
in the histories of the
sciences and the arts.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.320
But in both cases,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.290
there may be significant periods

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.713
during which strong progress is not made.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.330
And worries about strong progress

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.517
underlie the common forms of
skepticism about progress,

00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:09.363
and those need to be
addressed and dealt with.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.010
Now, how does it come about

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.430
that strong progress fails

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.870
where weak progress happens?

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.203
The answer lies in a point
I alluded to earlier.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.370
When we focus on individual domains

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:28.690
of human life and human practice,

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:33.530
it's completely possible
for all of them internally

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.723
to make progress.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:41.010
And yet for them not to contribute overall

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.300
to human well being

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.313
because of interaction
effects between them.

00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:53.190
And that suggests that

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:56.290
if you are interested and thinking about

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.730
not simply being a pessimist,

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.600
human progress is impossible,

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.960
but actually trying to
build on those cases

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.470
in which both strong and weak progress

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:08.440
have happened in human history.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.200
And as Dewey wanted,

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.720
make them more systematic and sure-footed,

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.900
then you'd better attend
to this kind of phenomenon.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.770
And for that, you need an account

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:24.970
of how various kinds of institutions

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.320
and areas of human life fit together.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.230
So I want to conclude

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:34.370
with a confession of a
pragmatist meta philosophy,

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.933
this is drawn very largely from Dewey.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.960
And it's this.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.250
Wilfrid Sellars famously says

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.040
that the point of philosophy,

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.300
what philosophy aims to understand

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.420
is how things in the
largest sense of the term

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.930
hang together in the
largest sense of the term.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.573
And that seems to me, right.

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.570
And it's important,

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.920
because in each age,

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.320
philosophy should be in the
business of trying to understand

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.900
how in that age, the
conceptions and the practices

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.040
that the age has inherited,

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.593
fit together and hang together.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.310
And without that,

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:20.280
without that kind of systematic
attempt to understand

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.690
what the various parts and enterprises

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:27.650
in which people engage,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:31.100
do in combination with one another,

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.700
we can't hope to do what Dewey hoped,

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:37.160
which was to make human
progress more systematic

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.490
and sure-footed than it is.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:43.980
This is just the tiniest beginning

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.070
of an attempt to work out a version

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:50.540
of that kind of Deweyan pragmatism

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.770
by focusing on a phenomenon

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.090
that I think is not well understood,

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:58.060
and to which I hope to have
brought a little bit of clarity.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.480
Thank you.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.647
(audience applauding)

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.320
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
I think there's a stark

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.010
distinction that I would
have expected you to draw

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.240
that you didn't draw,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.080
and so I want to question

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.190
whether your pragmatism sort
of commits you to reject it,

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:19.830
and that's just the distinction between

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:22.520
epistemic progress and social progress,

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.770
so it seems like that could be

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.850
deployed to analyze the
eugenics case, right?

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.520
And it seems in general,

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.210
sort of enlightenment picture of science

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.070
would have it that in general,

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:37.300
epistemic progress would
further social progress.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.170
And perhaps in general social progress

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:41.870
would further epistemic progress,

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.060
but they can come apart, right,

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.640
so you can have epistemic progress

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.190
that hampers social progress,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.540
the eugenics case would be a case of that.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.940
And, you know, you could
get all four varieties.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.300
That seems like a natural picture, right,

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.810
and provides a natural
diagnosis of a lot of cases,

00:53:58.810 --> 00:53:59.860
is that a distinction,

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.970
is part of your view
rejecting that distinction?

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.600
- Actually, yes.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.693
And the argument was given,

00:54:10.005 --> 00:54:11.570
but perhaps too quickly,

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.056
and perhaps the argument is confused.

00:54:14.056 --> 00:54:16.250
So let me try again.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.020
What I want to say is that

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:22.220
the concept of epistemic progress itself

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.880
is to be cashed out in terms of

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.720
answering significant questions,

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.420
and that raises the question
of what counts as significant.

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.250
And what I'm then doing is

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.270
tying the notion of significance,

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.860
not only to some picture,

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.620
some model of understanding,

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:48.230
that might be shared
only by a tiny minority,

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:51.960
but to the needs of a
much broader society.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.750
So I'm saying that a concept that figures

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.100
in the notion of epistemic progress

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.900
is itself socially and morally laden.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.960
So that's the way in
which I'm trying to block

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.543
the simple separation you give, right?

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:10.820
I mean,

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.770
if the scientific community
answers the wrong questions,

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.300
however good its answers
are to those questions,

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.370
it's not making progress.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.120
This is sometimes put
in the form of fantasies

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.810
about scientists going off

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.180
and pursuing completely trivial things.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:31.970
But to me, it seems to
me the more forceful

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.470
version of that is when scientists

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:36.810
start addressing questions

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.900
that are not only socially relevant,

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.450
but socially harmful,

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:43.190
and that's the point of the eugenics case.

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:44.900
I mean, interestingly enough,

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.290
the scientific community

00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:51.790
that I am analyzing there,

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:56.790
the community of scientists
from 1900 and 1925,

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.673
wouldn't have

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.563
made the distinction you make, right?

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.030
And we should remember that.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.223
- [Audience Member] Thanks so much,

00:56:13.223 --> 00:56:14.160
that was really interesting.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.320
I just wanted to go back to

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.132
something you said about science

00:56:18.132 --> 00:56:19.640
towards the beginning of the talk,

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.560
when you mentioned genetics between,

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.560
what, 1900 and 1925.

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.826
And you pointed out that
there was sort of progress

00:56:26.826 --> 00:56:29.040
among some measures,

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.743
but not along others, which
seems absolutely right.

00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:35.610
And then you went on to outline

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:38.140
your sort of conception
of well-ordered science,

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.200
where what science should
be up to is contributing to

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.470
the kinds of goods that
would be decided on

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.910
by some ideal rational deliberation

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.300
between scientists and the public,

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.138
I'm not sure of the
details, but something of.

00:56:51.138 --> 00:56:51.971
And it sounded--

00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:53.130
- Perhaps I shouldn't have said that.

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.020
- [Audience Member] It sounded like you,

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.290
one way of hearing what you were saying,

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.150
I don't think this is what you meant,

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.870
but one way of hearing
what you were saying was,

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.430
this is the dimension along
which to measure progress,

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:05.840
namely, is the science doing better

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.740
with respect to contributing
to what would be decided

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.413
at the result of this
ideal deliberative process.

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.260
And one way, I guess
one way of hearing that

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.680
makes it sound kind of teleological,

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.110
you know, like suggesters like the truth,

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.930
that says, look, there's
this thing truth out there,

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:22.330
and we've gotta measure it,

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.770
progresses to whether
we're approaching it.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:27.770
Especially when you build
in the idealization.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:30.420
It starts to sound like
there's this thing out there,

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.840
and we should measure
science as to whether

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.673
we're approaching it.

00:57:35.673 --> 00:57:37.420
Now, I don't think that's
probably what you did mean,

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.110
so the question is, could
you elaborate on it?

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.490
- So actually, I mean,

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.330
I think it may have been
a mistake to talk about

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:48.110
the ideal of well-ordered
science in that context.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:50.170
What I wanted to do

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:52.900
was to give some kind of substance

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.670
to the idea of science
contributing to the common good.

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:59.670
And my way of doing that

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.610
is to envisage what would be,

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.060
this goes back to my
sort of pragmatist views

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.163
about ethics and ethical method.

00:58:09.604 --> 00:58:12.950
That goes back to the
idea that that emerges

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.410
from a certain kind of
engagement with others,

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:18.200
where we take one another's needs

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.180
and wishes and aspiration seriously,

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.570
and seek, using the best
information we have,

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:27.130
an outcome that all of us can live with.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:31.170
Now, that as an ideal

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:33.379
is not intended to be

00:58:33.379 --> 00:58:37.880
a specification of a final
state we could reach.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.350
That as an ideal functions
as a diagnostic tool

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.640
for trying to identify in the present,

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.000
the places that are problematic.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.620
And so what I would want to do

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.010
is suggest that

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:58.010
we make progress of a certain kind,

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.810
which is in a gender setting, say,

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:05.690
by making those kinds of decisions better,

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:09.040
so that we come to do
better at figuring out

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:12.583
what kinds of subjects and questions

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.970
would be pursued in a situation

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:21.580
where people were more
attuned to one another

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.340
and more willing to
deliberate in this way.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.340
And that we then use that

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.540
as a measure of how to assess

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.860
scientific progress more generally.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.770
And I'm being quite
liberal in most of the talk

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.648
about the standard,

00:59:39.648 --> 00:59:41.940
I'm taking it for granted.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.850
I mean, even if the
molecular biologists of today

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.690
are not doing the best
they could possibly do

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.250
at figuring out what the question,

00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:55.133
they're doing pretty well, right?

00:59:56.617 --> 00:59:58.930
And I'm gonna cut them some slack on that.

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:02.460
I mean, I think that actual
scientific communities

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.790
most of the time,

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:08.090
are asking the right kinds of questions.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:12.160
And that if we've moved in the direction

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.320
of having the kinds of scrutinies

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.920
and deliberations around
what kinds of topics

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.123
are best to pursue,

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:25.743
that the public would
rightly endorse them.

01:00:27.108 --> 01:00:28.960
So what I'm suggesting is,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.010
yeah, pretty much everything is fine,

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.937
but there are going to
be these anomalous cases,

01:00:32.937 --> 01:00:35.850
and the anomalous cases show up

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:38.920
when we start thinking
about the common good

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.453
in the terms that I've attempted to.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.613
So I mean, there's a
sense in which there's,

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.180
there's something a little
bit vertiginous about this,

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.900
because the standard that
is used as it were to assess

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:56.900
the contribution to the common good,

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.900
is a standard itself that we
can only apply imperfectly

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:05.773
and with respect to which we
also need to make progress.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.293
More about this tomorrow.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.440
- [Audience Member] So
I wanted to ask about

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.520
textbooks a little bit,

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.100
because this is one place
where the disanalogy

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.603
seems to come out.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.780
So in physics,

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.620
a textbook might explain
an idea in a way that

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.760
everyone thinks is more perspicuous

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.380
than the original presentation by Einstein

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.500
or whoever, the original.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.990
Usually, there's some rough edges,

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.520
there's some conceptual
missteps and things,

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.150
these get cleaned up.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.530
And the textbook gives you the idea,

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.130
the same idea, but better.

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.520
But that's very different
from what happens in music.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.220
So a music professor or
a music textbook doesn't

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.110
rewrite a Beethoven quartet better,

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.820
so that everything essential

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.740
that you were supposed to get
out of the Beethoven quartet,

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.540
you now get in a more perspicuous,

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.473
better, more effective form.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:06.960
Instead, they just tell you

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.672
to listen to the Beethoven quartet.

01:02:08.672 --> 01:02:09.505
- Exactly.

01:02:09.505 --> 01:02:10.723
- [Audience Member] So why,

01:02:10.723 --> 01:02:14.310
I guess I didn't quite see
what your take is on that,

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:15.143
in the end.

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:20.267
- It leads into something about which I'm,

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:26.413
with which I'm struggling,

01:02:27.886 --> 01:02:29.950
and that is the...

01:02:31.272 --> 01:02:33.450
So I'll say another Deweyan thing.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.570
Dewey says, at one point,

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:39.910
that any general philosophical
account of something

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:44.150
is tested in the crucible of
its consequences for education.

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:48.210
And so you've thrust me into
the consequences for education.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.900
Now, in the case

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.810
of the sciences,

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.460
if we are really interested in

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.270
improving understanding,

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:02.790
improving the, as it were,
the transformative effects

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:06.530
that the sciences can potentially give

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.620
in people's psychological lives,

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.400
what we want is just what you described.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.640
Efficient, perspicuous ways of identifying

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:19.060
what's really essential.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.950
In the case of artworks,

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.070
what we want is making those artworks

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.670
accessible to individuals.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.080
And it seems to be a
consequence of my views,

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.120
it's a consequence I accept,

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.520
that education in the arts

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.320
has to be as more complicated,

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.750
and more difficult than
education in the sciences.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.020
And that's because

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.380
in the evolution of our
social environments,

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.330
genres proliferate, styles proliferate,

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.640
and if you're thinking
about a young person,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.350
for whom, you know, there's this

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.763
massive collection of resources,

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.340
how can that person be led to find

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.240
the things that are going to

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.023
have the transformative
effect on him or her.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.990
That suggests that we
actually need to spend

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:15.830
an enormous amount of time

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.360
and think very, very seriously

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.820
about how we do education in the arts,

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.000
whereas education in the sciences

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.090
poses another challenge to us.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.010
I mean, if you're really,

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.750
if you take the transformative
view that I have,

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:35.890
then the emphasis on
education in the sciences

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.360
should be precisely at getting

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.390
this kind of conceptual clarity

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:43.040
with respect to the
fundamental breakthroughs

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.200
and the big ideas in the sciences,

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.320
and also the understanding of
the methods of the sciences.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.760
And it should be much less

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.760
on learning lists of amino acids

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.170
or memorizing diagrams about

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.230
complicated relations within the cell,

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:01.290
and all of that sort of thing.

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:03.140
And I think, at the moment,

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.567
both forms of education

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:09.140
in the affluent countries

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:13.260
suffer from the fact that we think,

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.420
in the scientific case,

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.280
that we should, as it were,

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.020
force everybody through this pathway,

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.220
which is necessary for those

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.730
who are going to want to do

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:27.130
creative work in the sciences to traverse.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.090
And what that has done to
very many young people,

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:32.860
I think, is deaden the
scientific curiosity

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.820
with which they start.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.800
And so I don't know how to do this,

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.580
or I don't know how to
formulate this recommendation,

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.310
but it seems to me important
that up to a certain age,

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:45.800
we should treat all people as if

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.610
they were potentially
wanting to become scientists.

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.110
But then there comes a moment

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.460
at which what we want to do is imbue this

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.270
sort of tremendous sense of,

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:56.780
we wanna retain and imbue

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.500
this tremendous sense of natural
curiosity about the world,

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.410
with the conceptual framework

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:06.333
that will enable the people then to,

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.310
you know, to continue to engage

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.760
with the scientific discoveries

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.320
that will occur in their lifetimes.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.820
In the case of arts, it's different,

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.130
that people will come in,

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:18.770
they will differ in the
kinds of art forms they like,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.040
they will differ in the
kinds of genres they like,

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.710
they will differ in the
kinds of styles they like.

01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:26.770
And individual attention
seems to be needed

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.520
both to take them to the initial things

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.460
that are valuable for them,

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.980
to give them a sense of what it is

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.940
to have that kind of
transformative engagement with art,

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.090
and then to try to broaden
from that to build.

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:42.410
And these tasks, I think,

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.950
are practically enormously difficult.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.470
And it's a consequence of my view

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.070
that they have to be undertaken.

01:06:49.212 --> 01:06:50.060
So I take your point

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.810
as a completely correct observation about,

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.420
but it's an observation about, in the end,

01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.223
about the different needs
of education in these areas.

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.970
- [Audience Member] When
you were talking about

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:13.520
gains and losses,

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.090
I had an association, or I
started a train of thought

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:19.950
that was not really in
what you were saying.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.620
But I started thinking about

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.040
the kinds of dynamic of gains and losses

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.550
that happen in any conversation.

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:29.360
Something said at the
beginning of the conversation,

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.050
appropriate to the beginning,

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:33.760
maybe later on in the conversation with,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.910
it's been superseded
by other insights that

01:07:36.937 --> 01:07:39.330
we've gathered or we've produced.

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.270
And then I started thinking,

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.100
well in the life of a
marriage, think of all the,

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.300
how every time you say
something to your partner,

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.750
it resonates with things you would have,

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.640
the way you would have said that

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.130
at an earlier stage in the relationship,

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.670
or the reasons why you
say it this way now,

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:53.990
and you're using a turn of
phrase that she used before,

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.170
and you're using it now and knowing

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.083
that she'll know that you used it.

01:07:57.083 --> 01:08:00.400
There's this history,

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.100
this thick history that
informs the present,

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.040
and describes a kind of progress,

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.070
or a kind of ongoing

01:08:09.617 --> 01:08:12.630
life of the party, life of the culture,

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.680
because you can scale this up.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.700
And I was wondering if in a
way your idea about art was,

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.100
if that was kind of the
picture you were suggesting,

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.900
that the kind of transformations,

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.000
the kinds of episodes,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.640
that the work of art takes part of,

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.800
the kinds of transformations
that affords you

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.870
are like that, they're
embedded in this conversation.

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:37.360
And this is related to the
educational point of view,

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.773
because in some sense,

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.990
the kind of conversation we do in the lab

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:44.240
is different than we do in the culture.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.900
And one of the things,
imagine our students,

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.330
they're coming late to the party.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:51.130
And there's a lot of talk
that's been going on,

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:53.410
many bottles of wine have been drunk.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:55.700
And we want to sort of
get them to figure out

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.730
how to listen to what's going on now,

01:08:57.730 --> 01:09:00.270
which is a function of
what's been going on.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.270
And that happens very
differently in the context of art

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:03.360
than in the context of science.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.653
- I think that's right.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.090
I mean, one of the points I made about

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:12.030
the Deweyan conception
of the value of art,

01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.000
is that

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:20.240
the work continues to resonate with you,

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.890
and its later impact on you is dependent,

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.890
not only on the changes that
were produced at the time,

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.400
but the way those changes have

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.640
led to further interactions

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.060
in your subsequent experience.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.253
And that, of course, I mean,

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.770
in many cases, the process
of psychological change

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:49.320
that goes on in relation
to a particular work of art

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.453
for an individual can last a lifetime.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.710
It can be like a very
long, enduring marriage.

01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:58.420
So I mean, with respect to Joyce,

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.190
I come back to Joyce
again and again and again,

01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:03.200
and it's always different.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.450
It's always, there's
always new things there.

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:09.660
There's always something that
points me in new directions,

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.480
and that's because of the
ways in which I've grown.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.400
But it's also because of the order

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.360
in which a particular series of

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.090
previous interactions occur.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.630
So I think that's right.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.030
I wonder whether that's entirely absent

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:27.242
from thinking in the sciences?

01:10:27.242 --> 01:10:30.080
I'm not talking now about, you know,

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.730
students coming to understand things,

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:35.223
but I'm talking about in the
life of a creative scientist.

01:10:38.369 --> 01:10:41.250
It seems to me that there's
a lot of room for contingency

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:44.500
built in, in both of these domains.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.630
It's not inevitable that

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.750
once you start down a particular line,

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.060
it has to go in this direction,

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.043
it could have gone quite differently.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
I mean, I think that's one of the things

01:10:59.494 --> 01:11:03.540
that in retrospect is unnerving

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.863
about the general phenomenon of progress.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:11.360
That is when we look back on
many episodes in the past,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.680
that we count, and perhaps
with very good reason,

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.280
as being episodes of progress,

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.350
we realized how easily
they could have gone

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:23.720
in different directions.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.763
So contingency is unnerving, I agree.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.920
- I wonder if \I could follow up

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.303
on Dewey for a moment.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:38.110
The first sentence of art as experience

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.140
is one of the great
sentences in aesthetics,

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.423
it's something like,

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:43.710
the thing that gets in the way of

01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:46.210
framing inadequate theory of art,

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:48.610
is the existence of the
art objects themselves,

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:50.920
on whose basis we frame such a theory.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.200
And his ideas that we think the art

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.470
is somehow intrinsic to
the object or the thing,

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.240
when in fact, the thesis of the book

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.950
is that art is experience.

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:01.190
Art literally is experience.

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.280
He then goes on, and offers
a theory of experience,

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.010
according to which all
experiences are aesthetic.

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.550
Because for him, aesthetic is,

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:12.050
it's a condition on being an experience,

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:13.570
that it has a certain kind of integration,

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.390
a balancing of parts.

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:16.223
So that--

01:12:16.223 --> 01:12:17.950
- So I'm gonna read
Dewey a bit differently,

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.400
because it seems to me that
the dominant in the book

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.480
is a tone of regret,

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.410
that precisely because of the
divorce between everyday life

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:31.603
and the art world, the
world of art objects,

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.520
experience has become
flattened for people.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.520
So Dewey wants desperately
to restore the creative part,

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:44.505
the idea not just of the
individual as a consumer

01:12:44.505 --> 01:12:47.363
of artworks which are produced elsewhere,

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:51.490
but the, as it were,

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:53.740
the interaction with
other people's artworks

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.700
as being an interaction with

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.800
one's production of things oneself.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.380
And that makes the answer
to this earlier question

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.640
about education even more complicated,

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.740
because it suggests that
a part of the development

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.296
of the young person who comes

01:13:11.296 --> 01:13:14.880
to interact fruitfully with works of art

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.750
consists in bringing about the conditions

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.990
where that person can find his or her own

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:22.820
creative work of art.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.220
So I mean, I think,

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.470
yeah, I know that Dewey is inclined

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.150
to sort of go off the end

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.250
and say all experience is aesthetic,

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.780
but that really is quite at odds with the,

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:38.083
I think this very important
theme in art as experience.

01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:54.250
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.920
Yeah, so I was wondering how your account

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.360
would treat two different sorts of

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.060
periods in the development of science.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:08.003
So like, the first being one, in which,

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.180
as the discoveries are being made,

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:15.330
it seems that the common
good is being benefited.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:17.680
Like say, if we take for granted that

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.360
the development of technology
in the 20th century

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:24.230
greatly benefited the
people who lived through it

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:27.793
but accelerated climate change.

01:14:28.725 --> 01:14:31.430
So, you know, a period that then runs into

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:35.510
those sorts of future
worsenings of the common good,

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.360
and then kind of the flip side of that,

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.420
periods in which maybe
we're not asking questions

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.480
that seem like they would be fruitful,

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.550
we're not making
discoveries that are helping

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.530
the common good of our contemporaries,

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:53.250
but eventually, it becomes
clear in retrospect

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:57.260
that we were laying the
foundations for necessary,

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.310
or sorry, we're laying
necessary foundations

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:01.780
for discoveries that would help people.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.440
And I guess a slight sub
question to that second part,

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.910
sorry, this is getting really long,

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:09.350
is because that often
does happen in science,

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:12.060
where we'd start out by asking questions

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.640
that lead us to results that
are completely unpredictable,

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.770
take us in different directions

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:20.470
and could end up
benefiting the common good.

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:23.640
I'm curious what bearing that might have

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.920
on your prescription for trying to model

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.570
asking the right questions, like ones that

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.340
would be democratically
chosen, more or less.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.173
Thank you.

01:15:33.173 --> 01:15:34.950
- Excellent questions.

01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:36.070
There are two questions,

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.720
one is about what what happens when

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.853
we've got these unforeseen,
ghastly consequences?

01:15:43.091 --> 01:15:44.760
And the answer there is, you know,

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.270
it's perfectly justifiable
for people at the early stages

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.760
to think they're making progress,

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.540
and maybe they are making
progress for a while.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.090
But it's not part of my thesis

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:00.970
to suppose that if you go
on doing the same thing

01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:04.500
that is genuinely progressive earlier,

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.630
there can't come a point at which it tips

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:08.990
and goes the other way.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:11.750
So with respect to quite a
lot of environmental issues,

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.490
actually, one could say,

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:16.330
so people engage initially in something

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:18.110
that's genuinely progressive,

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:20.440
they keep doing it,

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.610
and it keeps being
progressive for a while,

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:24.900
but then there comes a moment

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.010
at which they think of
themselves as making progress,

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:30.900
but then they're wrong, okay.

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.650
So that's the way in which

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:34.100
I want to address that kind of case.

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.620
The other case is also I think,

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.800
very challenging and very interesting.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.140
So it is surely the case

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.770
that there are going to be occasions

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:49.780
on which you get unpredictable

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:53.140
in advance benefits from pursuing

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.000
a particular line of investigation.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.310
So let's now put this in the framework

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.080
of people deliberating about, as it were,

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.660
what projects to fund or
what projects to pursue.

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.180
So the flat footed way
of doing this is to say,

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.160
well, you go to the
things that are obviously

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.113
going to meet the needs of
the people here and now.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:19.830
But I want my deliberators
to know some things

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.477
about the history of science too,

01:17:21.477 --> 01:17:23.930
and one of the things I want them to know

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:26.360
is that in the course of
the history of science,

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.010
sometimes the indirect route
has been very important,

01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:33.400
and that sometimes it's
been very good just to let

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.583
people who have apparently
irrelevant questions to ask,

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:40.740
follow their hunches.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:45.200
So I used to always tell my students

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.480
in philosophy of biology that
there were two strategies

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.900
in the early decades of the 20th century

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.900
for coping with human disease.

01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:00.900
One is, let's go do the
genetics of human disease

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.580
right now using Mendel's methods, okay?

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.500
And the other was, let's
think about fruit flies,

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.320
and milk bottles and bananas

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.763
and a tiny little room
in a Columbia building.

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:18.390
That's another thing I
tell my students, you know,

01:18:19.657 --> 01:18:22.310
when Sturtevant was a sophomore,

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:24.250
he discovered gene mapping, you know,

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:26.823
you might consider doing
something like that, too.

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:29.123
But,

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.947
okay, so there are these
apparently irrelevant questions,

01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:37.360
and of course, they lead
back 70 or 80 years later,

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.600
to exactly what the other
school wanted to do.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.490
So there are lessons that we can draw

01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:44.200
from the history of science.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.370
If you actually think of this

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:50.820
as a process in which, you know,

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.850
you do the best you can.

01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:54.760
And part of doing the best you can

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.230
is to take on some ventures

01:18:58.230 --> 01:19:00.680
whose relevance isn't immediate.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.083
Now, of course, you can
always choose wrongly.

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.520
You can always back the wrong people

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.470
who look terribly bright
and excited about some idea,

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.320
and it may lead nowhere.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.910
But it seems to me that
if you were thinking

01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.570
about directions in
which science could go,

01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:18.940
how could you do better than this?

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.570
How could you do better
than attend to human needs,

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:23.070
in the light of all the evidence,

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:25.160
which actually includes the very phenomena

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.640
that you're pointing to?

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.473
I mean,

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.783
I think informed democracy
here is the best we've got.

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:35.713
But it's not perfect.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.447
- There's a question I really
want to ask you, but Hannah.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.520
- [Hannah] Oh, thank you,

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.970
thanks very much for that,
it was really interesting.

01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:54.250
I wanted to go back to the distinction

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.210
that you made at the beginning between,

01:19:56.210 --> 01:20:01.050
I think it was teleological
progress towards a goal,

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:04.820
and pragmatic progress where
you're working from something.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.670
- I think I know what this
question is going to be,

01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.520
but ask it anyway.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.690
- [Hannah] I was gonna say,

01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:11.836
why don't you go ahead and answer it?

01:20:11.836 --> 01:20:15.486
- No no no, why don't
you ask it, and then--

01:20:15.486 --> 01:20:20.486
- [Hannah] Well I first had
a kind of question about the,

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.280
how the distinction works,

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.360
but also how important it is

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.120
to the larger things that you
want to do in this project.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.240
And the kind of question
that's internal to it

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.290
is that when I think about progress

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:40.240
from a problematic situation,

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.270
I think about the notion of a problem.

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:46.770
And on the face of it
a problem is something

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:50.240
that kind of impedes
you from doing something

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.490
that you want to do, or aim to do.

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:59.490
So even though I do get and like the idea

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.810
about a contrast between moving from

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:06.670
and moving to a clearly defined goal,

01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:10.470
it does seem to me that
there's something teleological

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:13.450
built into the idea, even of the pragmatic

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:16.770
progress.

01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:18.530
Was that the question you were expecting?

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:19.540
- Yes.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.140
Yes, and it's a very important question.

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.700
And so I'm glad to have the
opportunity to answer it.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.580
You're right, there's gotta be something

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.730
which we might think of as a local goal,

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:29.893
an end in view.

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.190
Because what I want is
relief from the problem,

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:34.703
so in that sense, I've got,

01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:39.560
but I was a little bit more
careful than I sometimes

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.780
am today because I did say
a fixed long term goal.

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.430
So let me give you an example

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:49.190
that is supposed to warm you
up for seeing the difference

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:52.200
between what we might
think of as local teleology

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.073
or local,

01:21:54.886 --> 01:21:56.620
you know, local goal directedness,

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.000
and what I was calling teleology,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.853
in the having a fixed
long term goal sense.

01:22:03.727 --> 01:22:05.103
Okay, so I,

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:09.610
a pretty poor gardener these days.

01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:13.650
And I look at my flower
bed, and it's dreary,

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:15.850
and it's full of weeds,

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.680
and I wanna do something about it.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.670
And I have a number of desiderata.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:26.360
And these desiderata may
not be jointly satisfiable,

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.160
okay, that's an important
part of the story.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.943
I want lots of color,

01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:38.030
I want blooms at different
times of the summer.

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:42.430
You know, I want a harmony of colors,

01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:44.600
I want easy care.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.760
I want it to be drought resistant,

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.540
and blah blah blah blah blah.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.570
So what do I do?

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:53.240
I start out in a particular direction,

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.383
I buy some seeds,

01:22:56.558 --> 01:22:59.710
I use these ideas in

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.299
sort of starting up buying some plants

01:23:05.299 --> 01:23:08.560
and putting seeds in and watering,

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.920
and, you know, some years later,

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.380
after numerous experiments and trials

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:19.410
and applications of these desiderata,

01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:22.170
and others that have
cropped up in the meantime,

01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:24.560
I get something and I
say, this is pretty good,

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.940
this is the sort of thing I wanted.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.410
Going back to Alver's point,

01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:29.500
it could have gone in

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.423
any number of different directions, right?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.180
I wanna say that in a certain sense,

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.660
that wasn't teleological, I didn't have,

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.603
as it were at the beginning, a fixed goal.

01:23:44.278 --> 01:23:46.597
I had a problem in the sense

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.503
of something that was unsatisfactory,

01:23:51.503 --> 01:23:53.370
it's unsatisfactoriness

01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:56.100
was associated with various desiderata,

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.140
but you know, I revised

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.313
some of the desiderata along the way.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.790
And it's all been a sort of contingent,

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.670
path directed process.

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:10.980
The deeper question you're asking is,

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.260
how do you identify
problems, what's a problem,

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.260
and that is a very deep question,

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.660
but I want to say much
more about that tomorrow.

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:22.773
That is, I mean, that's a really
deep and serious question.

01:24:23.718 --> 01:24:26.310
And anyone who wants
to talk about progress,

01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:27.420
as I want to talk about it,

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:29.433
has to have an answer to that question.

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.150
- I'd like to ask you about the relation

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:42.730
between the conception of
progress that you're roughing out,

01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:45.140
and the conception of progress

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:47.300
that the scientists, or the artists,

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.560
the practitioners themselves,

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.500
and what they're doing.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.550
I mean, if I'm an artist,

01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:55.380
and my overriding objective
is to make something

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.830
truly avant garde, I don't
care about the public good.

01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:00.950
I mean, the public good
can go and get stuffed,

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:03.973
I want to do something
that moves things on.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.280
If you think about psychiatry,

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.930
psychiatrists really aren't really,

01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:14.240
what's the word I want, bothered

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.670
about whether there has really
been progress in psychiatry.

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:20.730
Now, from the point of
view of the public good,

01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:23.610
there's clearly been a lot
of progress in psychiatry.

01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:25.410
I mean, patients are no longer

01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:28.010
bundled into unfunded asylums,

01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:31.870
and standards of clinical
care are a lot better.

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:35.160
But when psychiatrists torture about

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.520
whether there's been any progress,

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.310
what they mean is that for,

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:42.040
especially for complex
disorders like schizophrenia,

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.020
or major depression,

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.350
they don't understand what's going on

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.020
any better than they did a century ago.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.560
That's the fear,

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.670
that when you're looking for
the nuts and bolts of it,

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:55.440
and it's not really an
issue about the public good,

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.540
you would not assuage that worry,

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.940
maybe we're not making any
progress in psychiatry,

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.050
by saying, but look the
standards of clinical care

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.260
are improved out of all recognition.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.970
That's not what they mean.

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:08.163
Or if, sorry.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.070
- Again, it's like the question
that was asked down here,

01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:16.270
it's two questions, and
they're both good ones,

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:18.560
and they're both ones
that I need to face up to.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.890
Let me deal with the psychiatrist first.

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:25.020
So the psychiatrists
may well be in the grip

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.760
of what I call the official view, right?

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.120
So they may be thinking, what we gotta do

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.790
is tell the truth about the human psyche,

01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:35.373
and the way it gets
disordered in various ways.

01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:40.190
And that may blind them to
one of the modes of progress,

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:43.760
I mean, part of my view allows,

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.273
and you can see this in the way that

01:26:46.273 --> 01:26:49.380
I talked about the
contributions of science

01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.930
not being simply sets of propositions,

01:26:51.930 --> 01:26:54.730
but also techniques
and so on and so forth,

01:26:54.730 --> 01:26:59.010
is that you might make
progress in one mode.

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.750
And even though you were making

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:03.010
no progress whatsoever in another mode,

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:05.430
and what I want to say
about the psychiatrist,

01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:07.990
is that they're, because they perhaps

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:10.540
have inherited this official view

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.210
in its application to psychiatry,

01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:15.760
they've overlooked an important mode

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.580
of psychiatric progress,

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.520
which is in forms of practical care.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.890
Okay, so that's the way
I would deal with that.

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:27.653
So what about the artists?

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.760
So the artists are also, I mean,

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.640
the artist you describe is very much

01:27:36.095 --> 01:27:39.740
in an internal tradition

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.180
with which that artist is interacting.

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.300
It's not just, you know,

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.040
I wanna do something avant garde,

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.810
but rather, I've got
ideas about where to take,

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:52.430
you know, abstract expressionism next,

01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:55.520
or I've got an idea about

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.213
where to go next with 12 tone music,

01:28:00.438 --> 01:28:03.760
or what minimalism should do next.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.290
So that's very much again, you know,

01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:12.780
the idea of there being
sort of an internal

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.160
sort of standard that's
cut off from the public.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.240
But there are other artists whom I think

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.510
are moved by the fact that

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:24.130
the kind of art that is being produced

01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:27.650
doesn't speak to certain
classes of people.

01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:30.262
So some artists, I think,

01:28:30.262 --> 01:28:32.220
are moved to say, look,

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.980
what we need is a new form of music,

01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.500
because everybody's, you know,

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.733
I mean, the young are not turned on by,

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.042
you know, sort of the high music

01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:49.042
that has gotten such a lot
of status in the culture.

01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:51.133
What we need is crossover stuff,

01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:55.600
Radiohead, and Radiohead
needs to come to terms

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.290
with Ligaty, and then
we'll put the two together

01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:00.823
and we're gonna make something fantastic.

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:05.270
And that's much more outwardly directed,

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:08.120
it seems to me, so it depends,

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.410
and you can think of this in
terms of the novel, right?

01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:12.390
I mean, you know,

01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:16.713
the marginalized audiences to
whom my novel will now speak.

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:20.793
And that, I think that's a genuine,

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:23.697
there you see the social stuff coming,

01:29:23.697 --> 01:29:26.233
and so I think it's a mixture.

01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:30.710
But it's a really good
thing to think about.

01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:32.190
- I guess I have a background

01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.330
Quinian kind of worry about...

01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:39.030
If you said my conception of progress is

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:42.900
picked up from what's
internal to each discipline,

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.390
and what the practitioners are
thinking in each discipline,

01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:47.810
that would be one take.

01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:49.740
But as you presented it,

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:53.030
your conception of progress
seems to come from outside

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:54.920
any particular discipline

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.480
to be something that's
being worked out a priori.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.965
- No, not a priori,

01:30:00.965 --> 01:30:05.230
but actually in terms
of a wider reflection,

01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.640
which I pointed to at both
the beginning and the end.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.820
I mean, the conception of progress comes,

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:13.940
is really wrestling with skepticism

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.070
about the very idea.

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:18.960
The very idea of progress,
what is it to talk about?

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.323
And that skepticism is
partly based on the idea of,

01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:28.900
yeah, you can talk about progress internal

01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.320
to one of these enterprises or domains.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.170
But when you enlarge the frame

01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:36.520
and you look at the human consequences,

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.720
I mean, if you think
about all of the people

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:45.380
who are saying, who are
deriding the idea of progress,

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.810
they're all moved by this thought

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:50.630
that as you expand your vision, right,

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:53.410
so take a very simple example.

01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:57.090
We both grew up on an island

01:30:58.170 --> 01:31:01.030
that made fantastic economic progress

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:04.070
in the 19th century, right?

01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:05.550
Expand the frame,

01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:08.800
look at the places that
were feeding into that.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.400
And you wanna say, no,

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.220
it's compromised by all of that,

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.540
it's compromised by the
exploitation of India

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.510
and so on and so forth.

01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.440
And it's precisely that move,

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.190
the move of expanding the frame.

01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:24.760
And so that's what pushes me,

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.900
and it pushes me in the genetics case,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:30.450
I mean I was challenged by
the very first question.

01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:33.610
That challenges me to
look at the ways in which

01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:40.010
the consequences pan out
for the broader society.

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.620
Because it seems to me,

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.470
that's where you have to
respond to skepticism.

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:47.980
So it's not a priori,

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:51.720
but it's based not only on looking

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.690
at the internal constraints
of the discipline,

01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:58.600
but also at a broader set of facts

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.280
about how that discipline is situated,

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.010
that then, if not attended to,

01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:08.207
foster this kind of worry and
skepticism about progress.

01:32:08.207 --> 01:32:09.612
Does that make sense?

01:32:09.612 --> 01:32:10.445
- [John] That makes perfect sense.

01:32:10.445 --> 01:32:11.278
- Okay, good.

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:13.973
- Last call.

01:32:18.977 --> 01:32:20.365
- [Audience Member] I think
I just wanna follow up

01:32:20.365 --> 01:32:22.560
this conversation you were
just having with John,

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.030
'cause it does seem like
you're tying progress,

01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:31.053
potentially too much to
its actual effects on,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.340
you know, the flourishing of
people in the broader society.

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.173
I mean, it seems like there's

01:32:36.173 --> 01:32:37.930
a perfectly intelligible narrative

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.610
where there's all kinds
of progress going on

01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:41.420
in the science and the arts.

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.870
If you start from the
internal perspective,

01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:45.580
the problems get more and more difficult

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.320
and challenging and
potentially inaccessible.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.920
And so the benefits of engaging with them

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.430
become harder for the society

01:32:55.437 --> 01:32:57.020
to realize in some ways,

01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.130
but you might say, there's
a lot of progress going on.

01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.470
Unfortunately, as we've disinvested

01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:06.440
in education simultaneously
with the problems becoming,

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.740
you know, more and more challenging

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.140
to understand on their own terms,

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.530
the benefits of this
progress are accessible

01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:16.823
to an ever smaller set of people.

01:33:18.032 --> 01:33:19.570
I want to say about that situation,

01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:21.530
it might still be the case that if people

01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:24.300
could acquire an
appreciation for the things

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.210
that are going on in
the different domains,

01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:28.940
it would enrich their
lives in all kinds of ways

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.750
counter factually, but it isn't, in fact,

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:34.410
because they don't have the educational

01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:35.500
opportunities and so on,

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.550
it seems like in that situation,

01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:40.330
we do have progress, but
it's not bringing about

01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:44.653
the kinds of Deweyan benefits
that you're pointing to.

01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.580
So what do you say about that?

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.413
- I say that

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.570
a fourth part of the
logic of progress concepts

01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:54.640
is that you're always looking at a frame.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.260
And you can take the internal frame,

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:01.460
and we can say, I mean, we
do say a lot of the time,

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:04.690
this scientific domain
is making rapid progress,

01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:06.335
and we don't even think about

01:34:06.335 --> 01:34:09.350
whether the questions
that are being answered

01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:11.610
have social merit or anything like that.

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.860
So that seems to me perfectly reasonable.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.773
But when,

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.760
I think the skeptics and the cynics say,

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.910
enlarge the frame, see if
your judgment is stable

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:23.680
when you enlarge the frame.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.280
And what they want from progress

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.460
is something that when you
move to the widest frame,

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.300
which is probably the impact on humans,

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.033
and maybe more than humans,

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.870
across, you know, not only the present,

01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:41.300
but also the future,
turns out to be positive.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.570
So it's as if you could

01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:45.680
imagine a sequence of frames that get

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.120
wider and wider and wider.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.270
The thought is that real progress is,

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:53.690
look at the narrowest frame, it's there,

01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:55.130
you enlarge the frame, it's there,

01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:57.933
it continues, it's stable
as you enlarge the frame.

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.730
So that's the thought.

01:35:00.730 --> 01:35:03.160
Now, the example that you
gave was really interesting,

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.880
because of course, you
can get this situation,

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.090
and it almost came up in the question,

01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:11.250
there was another scenario
that was very close

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:13.820
to the two that were offered at the back.

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.350
Where you think about a
scientific development,

01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:20.150
like the discovery of quantum mechanics,

01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:24.260
which from the internal point
of view is really important.

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.540
And then in the 30s,

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.580
starts to trouble various people

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.480
because it enables the production

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.360
of these extraordinary weapons, okay?

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.109
Now, what happens if you get

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:40.720
an awful social consequence because

01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:45.760
a scientific, piece of
scientific understanding,

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.220
answer to what seemed to
be a very good question,

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.630
gets translated.

01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:51.970
So this is exactly what I'm thinking of

01:35:51.970 --> 01:35:53.910
as institutional friction,

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:58.910
you can have an
institution of policymaking

01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:01.550
that surrounds the science

01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:03.970
and translates it into practice,

01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:05.690
that does horrible things,

01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:09.940
even though the institution
itself is not guilty.

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.010
So that can happen,

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:14.340
and that I think happens
in the case you imagine,

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:16.139
where, as it were,

01:36:16.139 --> 01:36:19.010
the sciences are making
these wonderful benefits,

01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:21.240
but the educational system is science,

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.940
science is so dismal and deteriorating,

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:27.580
that the effect on the broader
public isn't appreciated.

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.353
So, absolutely, I mean,

01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:33.020
so there's a lot to be
said here about frames

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.593
and the interactions among
institutions within society.

01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:38.563
Yeah.

01:36:39.622 --> 01:36:41.722
And I hope to say all of it at some point.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.923
And better than I just did.

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:45.953
- That was wonderful.

01:36:45.953 --> 01:36:49.666
Lucid, deep, unexpected,
thank you very much.

01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:52.250
(audience applauding)

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:55.750
