00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.400
What you’re looking at are tiny spores of Aspergillus,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.600
a type of fungus that can find its way into your lungs through air conditioning units.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.280
And this here is a rotifer, a microscopic
animal that loves aquatic environments.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.710
These nearly invisible bits can hitch a ride on your clothes, find their way into your body,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.480
and could have an impact on your overall health.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.540
They’re part of your exposome—and everyone
has one.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.910
Your exposome is all the things you're exposed to, comprised of biologicals—

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.480
so, things like pollen and microbes—

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.620
but also in your exposome is the chemical
exposure.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.120
So, that would be carcinogens, toxins that
might be in the environment.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.210
Some of them are natural.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.660
You can actually smell when it's going to
rain, because the air pressure drops, and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.180
there's a compound called geosmin that actually
comes out of the ground.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.600
Dr. Michael Snyder is a pioneering geneticist who’s investigating the exposome,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.219
and he doesn’t mind making this research personal.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.510
I make billions of measurements on me all
the time.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.160
I use about eight of these devices.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.360
I have three smart watches on me right now.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.030
So, these three here.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.410
This ring is not really a ring, it's actually
a sensor.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.600
It measures heart rate, and sleep and things
like that.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.880
According to Dr. Snyder, our health is a combination
of genetics and environment.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.130
And right now, we know a lot about the genetics
side.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.530
It really first started in 1985, when people
launched the Human Genome Project.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.000
“In the future, doctors will likely be able
to give each of us a genetic report card."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.380
“We are here to celebrate the completion
of the first survey of the entire human genome.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.390
Without a doubt, this is the most important,
most wondrous map ever produced by humankind.”

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.030
Your genome is really your blueprint for life.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.341
They're arranged in a very specific fashion,
and what's incredible is there are 6 billion

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:00.530
of these letters in each person.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.870
And that's what dictates you going from a
single egg that gets fertilized, turning into

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.220
this walking, talking, speaking, human being.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.420
We're now about 10 million times cheaper in
sequencing DNA than we were back in 1985.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.320
But it really is just a piece of the whole
equation.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.980
People always studied environmental exposures
at kind of a city level.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.080
We kind of know what the exposure looks
like in New York City, versus San Francisco,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.620
versus Atlanta.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.540
They would study something called PM2.5.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.360
It's particulate matter that's 2.5 microns
or less.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.240
And that's what gets into your lungs, and
that's what's in the air pollution

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.120
that people are concerned about.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.280
And so far as personalized efforts go: It's
usually taking surveys.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.879
Like, you have survey of 100 questions about
whether you have been smoking, whether you

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.810
have drinking, whether you suspect somebody
was coughing next to you.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.370
It was never measured directly.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.610
You could be sitting right now in a vast sea
of chemicals that you're breathing right this

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.139
moment, and you would have no way of knowing
that.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.499
The one hole that we always saw was in fact
your exposome.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.560
To fill the gap, Dr. Snyder launched a project to catalog personal exposomes on a deeper level.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.960
They re-designed an air-monitoring device, and gave it to 15 volunteers to wear

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.600
in and around the San Francisco Bay Area for varying time intervals.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.160
The exposimeter, basically, has a pump that
sucks up air roughly about 1/15th of what

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.439
you would normally breathe, and it pulls the air and captures all the particulates.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.329
The monitor contains a biological compatible
filter that collects virus, fungi, bacteria.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.100
Underneath this filter we have a specialized compartment, and it sucks up

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.200
all kinds of volatile chemicals.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
Then, we're using approach to extract things
off the filter.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.180
Then they became DNA and RNA at that point.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.220
We process them into the next general sequencing
library using another bunch of molecular techniques

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.780
and then submit them to the sequencing machine.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.800
Though Snyder only tested 15 participants, he had over 70 billion readouts—

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.320
meaning participants were bombarded with diverse fungi, protozoa, and allergens

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.760
that we couldn’t see in detail before.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.250
The chemicals went through a separate process.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.540
We put that in a specialized equipment called
a mass spectrometer.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.130
And we can see thousands of chemicals.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.600
These are all the things that you're presumably
breathing and getting exposed to in your skin,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
and everywhere else.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.080
The results are these exposome clouds.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.580
It’s your personal air bubble, mapped in detail.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.960
Some of our biggest findings are that the
exposome is huge.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.240
We discovered 2,500 species.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.220
And the mass spec analysis added roughly 3,000
chemical signatures to the mix.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.530
We discovered the exposome is vast.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.280
We discovered it's dynamic.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.780
We can classify these exposures as bacterial dominant, fungal dominant,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.540
plant dominant, or mixed.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.790
And what we've discovered is that they'll
vary from location to location.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.320
We see plastics in every single sample we
looked at.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.040
We see this compound DEET, which

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.370
is the thing you put in "Off" to keep insects off of you.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.340
So, there must be a lot of it floating around
in the air.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.440
There's certain organisms you'll see in the
San Francisco sample, a particular bacteria

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.660
found in sludge, that we didn't see in other
samples.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.140
Now, this is just with 15 people, so Snyder
wants to launch a 1,000 person study next

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.080
to tackle even bigger questions.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.880
What have we done that's really affected people's
health?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.640
It's a little early for that.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.630
We mostly have just been cataloging what is in the exposome in terms of bacteria and chemicals.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.060
That really is the next step.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.460
We want to learn exactly what exposures are
doing to individual people's health.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.790
People have different allergies, they have
different asthma conditions, some people would

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.960
be more sensitive to certain chemicals than
others.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.120
We don't really understand how this whole
thing works.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.820
There's so much we don't know,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.130
and this is why we went after this.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.670
By mapping the microbial soup that surrounds
us, Snyder hopes that it could transform the

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.670
way we manage our health on a daily basis.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.000
I'd like to really switch us from what I call
hunch-based medicine to data-driven medicine.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.100
A physician only has 15 minutes to actually figure you out in the time you visit.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.580
So, I think really in the future, no one's going to figure out you

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.480
better than you can figure out you.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.150
I think this is where data driven medicine
can be extremely impactful.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.520
Curious about what your exposome looks like?
