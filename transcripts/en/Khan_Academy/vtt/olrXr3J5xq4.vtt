00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.744
- [Voiceover] Alright we have a graph

00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:03.299
of y is equal to f of x

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.125
and we wanna figure out
what is the limit of f of x

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:07.836
as x approaches negative three.

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:11.173
And if we just look at
x equals negative three,

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:12.512
it's really hard to see

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.652
at least based on how this graph looks,

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:19.419
how what f of negative
three is and if anything,

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.700
it looks like we have an
asymptotic discontinuity here.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.617
It looks like on the left side
of x equals negative three,

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:29.479
it looks like we are approaching,

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.607
I guess you can say infinity

00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:31.619
and on the right side,

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.804
it looks like we are
approaching infinity as well.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:34.778
And we can just look at that and say,

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:36.778
What is f of negative 5?

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:39.062
That's four.

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:41.751
F of negative four is
looks like it is around,

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.009
I don't know around eight.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.950
F of negative three is off the charts.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.949
F of negative,

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.811
if we continued with this trend
and if we were to asymptote

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.589
towards this line right over here,

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.063
this vertical asymptote,

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:56.081
it looks like as we get closer
and closer to negative three

00:00:56.081 --> 00:01:00.230
that the value of the function
at that point is approaching,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.127
is getting closer and closer to infinity,

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:03.616
at least that's what it looks like

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.220
from what we can see on this graph

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.988
as we approach negative three
from the left hand side.

00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:10.112
Let's think about as we
approach negative three

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:11.557
from the right hand side,

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:14.571
so this is f of negative one,

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.804
f of negative two,

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:20.340
f of negative 2.5 looks like
it's up here some place,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.362
f of negative 2.9 would be even higher,

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.746
f of negative 2.999
looks like it will just

00:01:26.746 --> 00:01:28.847
once again approach infinity

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:32.581
so this type of limit in some context

00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.189
you'd say this limit doesn't exist

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.022
doesn't

00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:40.462
doesn't exist in the formal sense

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:42.034
so that's one way to think about it.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.197
In some contexts,

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:47.554
you'll hear people say that this limit

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:49.498
since from the left and from the right,

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:50.517
it looks like it's going to infinity.

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:52.775
Sometimes you'll see people say

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.869
that it's approaching infinity

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.248
and so this is depending
on what type of a class

00:01:57.248 --> 00:01:58.802
what type of a context you're in

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:01.470
but in the traditional sense of the limit

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.014
or in the technical sense,

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:04.986
there are ways that you can define limits

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:07.041
where this will make a
little bit more sense

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.646
but the traditional definition of a limit,

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:11.637
it would be,

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:15.387
you would say that this
limit does not exist.
