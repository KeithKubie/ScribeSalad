00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.034
SAL: I'm here with our
exercise guru Ben Eater.

00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:03.950
BEN EATER: Thanks Sal.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.420
SAL: And we're looking at your
exploring standard deviation 1

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.262
exercise.

00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:11.220
And let me think about
what's going on here is.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.551
It says arrange the 13 orange
sample points in the histogram

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.050
below.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.560
So these are the orange
points you're talking about.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.016
So the sample standard
deviation is approximately 1.6.

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.650
So just so I
understand these, these

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.112
are points that are being
sampled from sum distribution?

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:25.820
BEN EATER: Right.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.840
SAL: We get these
points right over here.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.030
And then your module
is automatically

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.232
calculating the sample mean.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:32.940
BEN EATER: Right.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.780
SAL: Which is kind of
the central tendency

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.070
of at least these points.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.870
It's estimating the
mean of this population

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.130
you're sampling from.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.520
And then also the sample
standard deviation,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.940
which is really kind of a way
to measure on average how far

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.350
away they are from
that sample mean.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.350
BEN EATER: Yeah and what
we're trying to do here

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.280
is to kind of get a sense
of what that actually means.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.940
So we say the
standard deviation is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.461
1.9, what does that
sort of feel like?

00:00:59.461 --> 00:00:59.960
SAL: Right.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.707
It seems clear that the sample
mean it looks like it literally

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.040
is the average of these numbers.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.590
BEN EATER: Right, it is.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.604
SAL: And it looks like
if I move this out,

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:08.270
then it moves to the
right a little bit.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.354
But that's just one point.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:10.520
The mean moves to the right.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.360
The mean I think, it's easier to
have an intuition for the mean.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.550
BEN EATER: A lot of people have
a pretty good sense of it here.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.150
SAL: If stuff
moves to the right,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.530
then the mean
moves to the right.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.260
If we move stuff to
the left, then the mean

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.300
moves to the left.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.210
That makes sense.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.520
But the standard
deviation in this case,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.450
we're measuring the
sample standard deviation.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.802
This is a measure of dispersion.

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:31.760
And I say on average in
quotes because it's not

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.702
exactly the on average
that we typically--

00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:35.910
BEN EATER: And that's kind
of point of this exercise.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.170
It's not kind of exactly
on average, so what is it?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.960
SAL: Right.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.850
But you see that
the further-- so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.590
let's see, the further
the points are spread out,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.430
the wider this sample
standard deviation is.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.570
If I bring the points
closer together,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.130
then the standard deviation
gets smaller and smaller.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.620
If I bring them closer to
the sample mean, as you see

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.270
they get tighter and tighter.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.360
So let's see, let's do
the actual exercise.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.400
So arrange the 13
order sample points

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.966
so the sample standard
deviation is approximately 1.6.

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.550
Right now it's 2.1, so I want
to squeeze things together.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.925
And there's no
right answer here.

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:10.788
I just have to get them in
a way that I'm close to 1.6.

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:14.170
So I want to move things
closer to the sample mean.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.800
And so let's see this one,
so 1 point by itself--

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.660
actually just moving
this 1 point--

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.640
BEN EATER: Not quite.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.820
SAL: Just that 1 point
didn't quite do the trick.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.160
But I could move more things in.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.440
And it really could be I
could pick another point,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.635
move it closer to the--

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.010
BEN EATER: Lots
of ways to do it.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.930
SAL: I'll have a bigger impact
if I move something that's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.780
right now far away and
move that closer in.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.330
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.810
SAL: Because right
now that's kind

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.840
of taking that-- OK,
that looks right.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.310
1.6, so let me check
my answer, correct.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.330
BEN EATER: Now, look
at this show solution.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.570
SAL: OK, show solution.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.945
The standard
deviation is smaller

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.699
if the points are
closer to the mean, yes.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.990
The standard deviation is
larger if the points are more

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.830
spread out.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.040
Try removing a point
closer to and further away

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.623
from the sample mean to see how
the sample standard deviation.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:00.734
BEN EATER: So that's
telling us what we just did.

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:01.650
Look at the next step.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.901
SAL: Oh, there's another step.

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.108
BEN EATER: And what this
will do is actually show you

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.820
different examples
of how to get to 1.6.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.735
So if you click that, it'll
show you maybe a different way.

00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:10.610
SAL: Oh, that's neat.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.696
BEN EATER: Now, click it again.

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:15.070
And so what you can see is
there's lots of different ways

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.950
to have a sample standard
deviation of 1.6.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.840
And they may look different,
but if you keep clicking that,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.340
you'll kind of see there are
some things in common as far as

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.810
how they are grouped
close to the mean.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.851
SAL: And one of the things
I just want to clarify

00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:30.670
is you've drawn this
kind of bell curve

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.100
with that area
shaded in the back.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.900
That is our estimate of what
the real distribution might

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.380
look like based
on the information

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.680
we have of the sample.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.850
So if our sample
mean is accurate,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.010
if it really is estimating the
true mean of this population,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.890
then that's what we're
drawing in the middle.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.820
And then we're assuming it's a
normal just kind of bell curve

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.640
shape distribution.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.590
So that's what it would look
like based on information

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.960
we have.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.668
BEN EATER: Right.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.690
SAL: This is very cool.
