00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:05.171
These allegations that I
have sent inappropriate pictures

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.807
over the internet
are completely ridiculous.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.476
They are levied
by my political rivals

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.646
who are trying to embarrass me
and advance their own agenda.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.816
So let me be perfectly clear.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.885
These allegations are false.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.586
I will be vindicated.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.821
- Okay, please, questions.
[all speaking at once]

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.723
- Senator, senator.
[overlapping shouting]

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:26.759
<i> TMZ</i> has obtained an actual
photo of your genitalia.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.494
They're posting it
to their website as we speak.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:29.862
They're saying you took it.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.097
How do you respond?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.068
[cameras clicking]
- Hmm? Okay.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.004
I may have sent one photo
of my genitalia.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.672
- All right?
(reporters) Senator, senator!

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.574
Okay, but I assure you
that's an isolated incident.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.609
- It was a one-time thing. Okay?
[overlapping shouting]

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.411
- Yes. Mark?
- Senator,

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.412
what about the new report

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.747
that there are three
new pictures

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.382
having been sent
to three different women?

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.250 align:start position:0%
That's not a one-time thing.
That's a lot of--

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.853
What second-rate news
organization is trying to--

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:54.921
<i> New York Times.</i>

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.356
(all)
Oh...oh...

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.059
O--
It was--it was four total.

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:01.260
- No more. That was it.
[all speaking at once]

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.529
It was just--
It was four, and no more.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.031
Questions? Yes, Amy.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:08.267
Yes, you are sure that there
were only four photos sent?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.702
That's it. Four. That's all.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:10.970
There's no more than four.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.705
Then how do you explain
the one you sent me?

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.108
- What?
[all gasping]

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.643
Everybody please, please.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.212
I'm begging you.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.950
I'm begging you to forgive me
for the foibles

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.451
and transgressions.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.386
It was the reckless act
of a younger man.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.255
A younger man?
You sent it two seconds

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.623
before you stepped on stage.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start position:0%
(man)
Senator, senator,
that's very recent.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.959
Yeah, Amy,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.562
last time I checked,
time is still real, okay?

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:37.797
So, technically speaking...
[text message dings]

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.398
I am much older now
than I was

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.467
- all of those seconds ago.
[all cell phones beeping]

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.468
- Did I just--
- Are you guys--

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.904
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.073
- What's happening right now?
- I just got one.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.575
[all speaking at once]

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.611
Senator,
how are you even doing this?

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.579
You have no proof
that I am doing anything--

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.348
- [all gasping]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry again.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.852
I'm sorry again.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:00.920
I'm sorry one more time.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.421
Oh, wait a second.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.823
You can do it,
but I can't do it?

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.325
[overlapping shouting]

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.960
Get in there, get in there.

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:09.126
[all groaning]
Oh!
