00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.893
So I want to give you a few tips on how you can deal with, errors that, might

00:00:02.893 --> 00:00:07.040
creep into your code. And here's a typical example. Have a look at the code on

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.272
the left. It does something wrong. See if you can figure it out, just by

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:13.316
looking at it. Well truth be told, I couldn't either when I saw it the first

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.850
time. So let's run it and see, how it behaves. Whoa, look at that, the numbers

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.110
are getting bigger and bigger. That's the bank account I want. But that's not

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.504
the program that I wanted. I wanted it to stop. When I've reached a million

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.040
dollars. It's gone way beyond that. This is getting crazy. I've been waiting

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.420
here for a long time, and the program just is not stopping. So the first

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.600
question is, how can I make it stop without buying a new computer? So let me

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.877
show you that first. You see that little barber pole icon here? What you do is

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:41.240
you right click on it, and then you select the one and only menu option to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.124
reset the virtual machine. And now the program has been killed, and we can

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:48.290
figure out what went wrong.
