your little cottage industry there's
always something to do when I go to my

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260
always something to do when I go to my
 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.710
always something to do when I go to my
studio I start out by sweeping the floor

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720
studio I start out by sweeping the floor
 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.360
studio I start out by sweeping the floor
I start out by making sure everything's

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370
I start out by making sure everything's
 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.810
I start out by making sure everything's
in order

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820
in order
 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.809
in order
I start out by trying to make sure my

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819
I start out by trying to make sure my
 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.020
I start out by trying to make sure my
mind is clear and then I think about the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
mind is clear and then I think about the
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.680
mind is clear and then I think about the
problem that didn't get solved yesterday

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
problem that didn't get solved yesterday
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.199
problem that didn't get solved yesterday
and that opens it up for me

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
and that opens it up for me
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.459
and that opens it up for me
so I think that's the process what's the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469
so I think that's the process what's the
 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.770
so I think that's the process what's the
problem today is the question I ask

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
problem today is the question I ask
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.790
problem today is the question I ask
myself the Roey seems to be something

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800
 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:52.600
I'm most happy when I I'm not distracted

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610
I'm most happy when I I'm not distracted
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.700
I'm most happy when I I'm not distracted
when I'm working when I could go to my

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710
when I'm working when I could go to my
 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.660
when I'm working when I could go to my
studio when I somehow could live in that

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
studio when I somehow could live in that
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.420
studio when I somehow could live in that
presence that presence and the present

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430
presence that presence and the present
 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.110
presence that presence and the present
and I could do it repetitively so that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
and I could do it repetitively so that
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.300
and I could do it repetitively so that
you kind of build up a steam you know

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
you kind of build up a steam you know
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.830
you kind of build up a steam you know
it's like a it's like an engine it's

like a it's like a percolator and
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.250
like a it's like a percolator and
sometimes it just becomes you know it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
sometimes it just becomes you know it
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.710
really becomes a kind of a concentration
that's so pure that I think is both

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720
that's so pure that I think is both
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.950
that's so pure that I think is both
playful and imaginative and opens up all

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960
playful and imaginative and opens up all
 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.820
