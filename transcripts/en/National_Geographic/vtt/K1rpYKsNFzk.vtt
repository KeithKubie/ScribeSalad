00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.567
She kept her
cabin pretty clean.

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.200
Now you walk into this
place of shambles.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.400
It's like night and day.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.734
The house was just smashed.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.433
It almost seemed like
someone was in a rage.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.567
The holes into her
bedroom, it was quite obvious

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.734
the tin had been cut and
had been pulled back.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.900
How could somebody have
cut that much and not made

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.567
a tremendous amount of noise?

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:51.433
And why was that not something
that was an alarm for Dian?

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.066
Why wouldn't she flee?

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.633
Why wouldn't she, you know?

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:00.700
So how did she end up being
killed right there by her bed?

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.467
I had once in my
life seen a dead body.

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.834
And I certainly
never expected to see

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.100
a person who had been a victim
of murder, violent murder.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.000
And it was somebody I knew.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.767
You know, it was Dian.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.266
From the story she told
me, putting pieces together,

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.367
man, she was really right
about what she said.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:51.166
Dian had made enemies with
a lot of people over time.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.567
But we never expected
her to be murdered.
