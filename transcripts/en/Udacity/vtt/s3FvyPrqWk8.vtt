00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.260
Okay, so what I've done here Michael, is I have

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.470
drawn both of these lines. So here's the line 15 p

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.700
minus 5. This is a case when b is a

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.330
resigner. This is my best attempt at drawing it to scale.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.970
You start out minus 5, as you point out, and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.210
you end up with plus 10. And this is the line

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960
where b is a seer. That's minus ten b plus 5,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.490
so you start out with plus 5. And you end at

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.650
minus 5. Okay?

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.650
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.290
&gt;&gt; So, what do you notice about these two lines?

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.730
&gt;&gt; They make an x? So they intersect.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.230
&gt;&gt; They do intersect. Can you tell where they intersect?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.500
&gt;&gt; How would I solve that?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.080
&gt;&gt; You'd have a quiz. Okay Michael, so here's a quiz. Where

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.940
do the two lines intersect? Think you know how to figure it out?

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.560
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. Then go.
