00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.120
&gt;&gt; BORT: You'll hear a lot about Android devices,
but that's just a small part of what Android

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.250
really is.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: When you think about a device

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.140
like an Android device, that's a gizmo, that's
a thing, you can go to the store, or you can

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.189
buy that.
&gt;&gt; BORT: There are tons of devices out there

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.130
on the shelf or whatever, and, you know, maybe
someday each one of those will be running

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.289
Android. You know, they all look different,
they all, you know, cost different, they could

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
be a bunch of different things that will be
made by different people, but, you know, one

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.760
of our goals would be just get Android all
over the place and we've done that in a bunch

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.730
of different ways mostly by making it so that's
really easy for the industry to adopt. We've

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
made it free. You don't have to license it.
We've done a lot of work making sure that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.220
this platform is viable to the industry. Manufacturers
and carriers are more likely to adopt the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.940
whole platform. And we make it easy for developers
to extend the platform to make sure that it

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.710
stays, you know, on the cutting edge of the
industry. In developing Android or developing

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.989
something like this, there's always this tension
between a product and a platform.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.659
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: A platform is what enables you
to make all of those things.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.590
&gt;&gt; BORT: As we built the Android platform,
we've spend a lot of time thinking how about

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.689
it's going to be used in the future.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: There are several layers in

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.850
the Android system. It's a complete software
of stack.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.350
&gt;&gt; BORT: We got the Linux Kernel, the system
libraries, Dalvik, the application framework,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.249
and then all of the applications on top of
that.

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.420
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: The Linux Kernel has been around
for many, many years. It's tried and true.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.030
It's used in millions of computers and devices,
but it hasn't really been thoroughly optimized

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.770
for mobile devices. So what we did was we
worked on power management. We worked on a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.880
new shared memory driver. We worked on this
thing we call the binder which is this Lightweight

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.229
IPC Mechanism. And we did work on--just on
the scheduler to really make it work efficiently

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.029
for a small device.
&gt;&gt; BORT: We pulled a lot of libraries in from

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:03.049
the Open Source community, big ones like WebKit
and Harmony, OpenSSL.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.899
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: The Apache HttpComponents and
ICU.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.119
&gt;&gt; BORT: In addition to a lot of the other
open source libraries that Android uses, we're

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.310
open-sourcing a bunch of new libraries as
part of the Android platform.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: Among the things that we wrote
ourselves were a bunch of media codecs, so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.750
for sound and video.
&gt;&gt; BORT: And we have Graphics Libraries.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.800
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: 2D and 3D graphics and Speech
Recognition.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.190
&gt;&gt; BORT: Dalvik is a new virtual machine that
was designed by Dan that was intended to be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.750
on these mobile devices.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: It was designed to deal well

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.900
in a memory-constrained and CPU-constrained
environment where you're operating off a battery

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.820
power.
&gt;&gt; BORT: The application framework makes it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.600
easy for application developers to use all
the different pieces of a mobile device. You

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.250
know, you're going to have things like the
screen, maybe a touch screen, a track ball,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.850
the buttons, a GPS.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: And, of course, the platform

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.850
really wouldn't be complete without some applications.
And so we've built them. We've included a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.730
web browser, an email client, instant messaging,
a camera for the phone, a dialer, contacts,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.000
and the list goes on.
&gt;&gt; BORT: At every layer of the platform, we

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.460
put in hooks to make it so that people can
extend it in ways that we never even thought

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.560
of. We partnered with kernel.org to host the
source, and we built tools to help developers

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.980
interact with the source. We're using git
as the source control system, but we built

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.460
a bunch of tools on top of it to make it a
lot easier to deal with the platform as large

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.280
as Android.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: We have a tool called Repo which

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.410
manages multiple git repositories and let's
people deal with them as a single unit. This

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.760
is super important for Android because, in
fact, we don't have just one source code repository.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.850
We have about a hundred of them. We also have
a web-based tool called Gerrit. And this is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.000
what we use for source code reviews and for
accepting patches and stuff like that. So

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.140
if a developer wants to submit a patch back
to the Android source code, they can use Gerrit,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.900
they can submit their patch through it, and
then the developer who works on that particular

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.720
component will be able to see the code and
comment on it and write a review, and there

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.880
can be kind of a back and forth between the
main, say, like the lead for that component

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.010
and the person submitting the patch. Once
the patch looks good, you can just hit the

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.240
button and it gets checked in and then it
becomes part of the open source project.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.630
&gt;&gt; BORT: The Android OpenSource Project is
ready for you to explore and contribute right

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.859
now at source.android.com.
&gt;&gt; BORNSTEIN: What will you do with Android?

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.849
&gt;&gt; BORT: What will you do with Android?
