authority on this I'm observer of the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
authority on this I'm observer of the

human condition apparently there's a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
human condition apparently there's a
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.929
human condition apparently there's a
spectrum some people are more inclined

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
spectrum some people are more inclined
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520

that for yourself
 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.749
that for yourself
and so being somewhere on the spectrum

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
and so being somewhere on the spectrum
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.080
and so being somewhere on the spectrum
of heterosexual with homosexual being on

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

balls in that conventional
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.440
balls in that conventional
construction so I would say that it's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
construction so I would say that it's
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.449
construction so I would say that it's
something that happens in nature and I

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
something that happens in nature and I
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.610
something that happens in nature and I
remember very well in this book now I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620

haven't read it in a long time but man
it was a big deal

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200

openly talking about sex in the 1960s

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500
openly talking about sex in the 1960s
 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.000
openly talking about sex in the 1960s
was a big deal that he claimed that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
was a big deal that he claimed that
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.330
was a big deal that he claimed that
there was more homosexuality in zoos

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340
there was more homosexuality in zoos
 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.940
there was more homosexuality in zoos
than he observed in nature and that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950
than he observed in nature and that
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.460
than he observed in nature and that
maybe just because he had we happen to

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
maybe just because he had we happen to
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.720
maybe just because he had we happen to
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.640
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos
or whatever in other words the sample

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
or whatever in other words the sample
 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.020
or whatever in other words the sample
size is way too small to extrapolate so

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.449
let's let's celebrate being alive
