00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.320
Okay the answer to this question is one over

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.830
eight, 1 8th probability of having an affected child. So

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.010
let's see why this is. Let's take it one step

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.140
at a time. Let's go to our affected individuals which

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.500
we know must be homozygous recessive based on the

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.700
autosomal recessive pattern. If you're affected that means you must

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.940
be homozygous. Now let's look at the father's father. He

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.820
must pass down one recessive allele. One of the minuses.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
But the father here is not affected. So we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.290
know that the other allele must be the dominant.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.580
This means that the father has a probability of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.500
one of being heterozygous. We know the father's heterozygous. Now

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.930
let's come over here to the grandmother. Again, she

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.480
must have passed down one recessive copy. And we see

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.940
that her daughter is unaffected. So she must have

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.200
one normal dominant copy. So this means she's definitely heterozygous.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.300
A probability of one. And what's the probability

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.620
that she'll pass down the recessive allele, not the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.610
dominant allele, to her daughter? We know the only

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.580
possibility is to be heterozygous, because she's unaffected. But

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.530
what's the probability of passing. That recessive allele on.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.130
It's one half, right? There's only one half chance

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.720
for that to happen. We assume, because this is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.200
a rare disease trait. That anyone mating in from

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.920
the outside is unaffected. So we assume plus

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.770
plus here. Type 3 Von Willebrand's disease, along

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.910
with many other genetic disorders Are pretty rare.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.530
And so unless we have some reason to think

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.000
otherwise, whenever you see individuals mating in from

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040
the outside, we assume that they're homozygous normal. So

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.690
the probability of this offspring, of this child,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.500
being heterozygous is one half. So now we have

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.460
the couple, the man and the woman, the male and the female. And if they're both

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.520
heterozygous, then what's the probability that they'll have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.240
an affected offspring. Well, we can set up

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.050
the Punnett square if that makes it easier for us. And we see that, out of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.950
four possible options, one out of four is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.660
homozygous dominant, one out of four is homozygous

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.790
recessive, and two out of four are heterozygous. So there's a one in four chance

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.510
of being affected or homozygous recessive. So now all we do is multiply the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.360
probabilities that each of the intermediate individuals are heterozygous, along

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.810
with the probability that the offspring will be affected, so 1 times

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.030
1, here. Times one half times 1 4th

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.120
is equal to 1 over 8 which is the solution. Have you had trouble with this? That

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.780
is alright. Genetic counselors have to be pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.450
good at estimating probability and it takes some time

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.580
and you may even want to use a calculator

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.290
but hopefully you have a new appreciation. For someone

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.290
who can read a pedigree efficiently and answer a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.340
question like the probability of having an effected individual

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.121
in a family

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:55.270
