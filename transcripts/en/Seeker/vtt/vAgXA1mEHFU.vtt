00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.649
Ahh the hot hot summer in San Francisco is
finally here, time for some pumpkin spice.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.309
I'm sure you just feel.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.320
WRONG about that, right?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.070
Hey sniffers, I'm Trace, this is DNews!

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.430
We got a question from Sydney Flowers asking,
"how does temperature affect your senses of

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.570
taste and smell?"

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.830
And we were all immediately curious about the smell
bit… so, we looked into it!

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.470
Firstly, we have to understand how the nose
knows in the first place!

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.410
In today's society, our olfactory system is
used mainly to entice and intrigue -- things

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.790
like tasty foods, perfumes and colognes they co-opt
our sense of smell.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.250
But the nose evolved to reveal information
about our environment;specifically, stuff

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.480
we can't see, hear or touch!

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.180
Smell tells us what's happening with our tribes
and clans, tells us if food is safe to eat,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.610
and warns us of strangers (or possible sexual
partners).

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.829
It can even influence emotional states and
initiate recall of memories.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.719
It's powerful, to say the least.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.909
The nose is constantly sucking in air - you're
probably noticing that right now.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.220
What's your space smell like right now?

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Think about it!

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.980
What's happening is: particles are
physically entering your body and hitting

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.860
specialized olfactory receptors.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.980
Yes, these particles are real.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.690
Yes, when you smell trash you're literally
inhaling tiny bits of trash.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.740
Or when you smell a pig farm you're literally
smelling particles of… well, you know what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.740
you're smelling.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.420
These particles or odorants are "volatile."

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.810
Which is science's name for something that
gets into the air at regular Earth temperatures.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.280
Lots of things are volatile substances: plants,
animals they are definitely, but steel, ain't.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.070
It has no smell.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.070
Sidebar: seriously, metal has no smell.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.310
Yep, I know you're thinking, I know what pennies
smell like (unless you've gotten rid of them

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.490
like Canada -- find nickels) . Whatever.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.490
But that smell is just chemical compounds
on your skin reacting with the metal -- and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.259
those ARE volatile.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.259
Boom!

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.259
End sidebar!

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.110
Anyway, temperature can of course affect volatility.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.689
According to a 2003 study in the journal Drying
Technology, pine trees release more odorous

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.390
volatiles as they get hotter and dryer -- mmm,
pine smell.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.409
And another study in Food Analytical Methods
rated how strong the smell of salami was at

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:17.180
various temperatures, finding 122* F was the
yummiest -- giving off the best odorants and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180
particles.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.980
But that's not enough, we also have to sense when
those particles are being given off!

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.439
A 1998 study in Physiology found humans can
detect volatiles and particles in air with

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.230
as little as 4 femtograms per liter.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.279
That's a decimal point, then fifteen zeros,
then a 4.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:37.499
It's really, really small.

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.989
The nose is a sensitive piece of evolutionary
equipment, and like any sensitive equipment,

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.040
it works better when it's in ideal conditions.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.579
The more humid air is, to a point, the better
it traps these particles and lets them hit

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.680
out olfactory receptors.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.439
Overly dry air doesn’t  trap and ferry
those smells to your detectors as easily!

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.900
And if you can’t detect it, you can’t
smell it.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.419
This detection also decreases at high altitudes,
because the air is drier and sometimes there's

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.609
just a bit less of it.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.839
Now that we're on the same page with particulates,
volatiles, odorants and olfaction; we've sort

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.430
of answered our question right?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.430
Sort of.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.829
Winter air is drier, and therefore ferries
less odorants and volatiles to your olfactory

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.829
receptors.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.639
AND colder temperatures mean fewer odorants
and volatiles are coming off trees, and things

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.430
sitting around your environment.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.620
So it's not that your olfactory system isn't
working as well, the world just has less smell

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620
in colder months.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.099
Lemme paint you a picture.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.120
If you were to sit outside in your front yard
and drink hot apple cider, or a pumpkin spice

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.489
latte in a hot humid environment, there would
literally be MORE smells in the air.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.889
So the nutmeg, allspice, star anise, and so
on would meld with the grass,  and soil, and flower

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.079
pollen…

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.669
Weird to think about it that way?

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.519
But in the fall, we still get all the smells
from the hot beverage; it's temperature is

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.839
the same, but the WORLD is colder, so we may
only detect some of nature's smells -- not

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:59.839
all.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.790
The final answer, does seem to be, your sense
of smell is basically the same… but it works

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.589
best when the air is warm, and even better
when it's a little wet.

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.499
When the air is cold, or dry, there's just
not as much smell to smell.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.999
Thanks for your question Sydney!

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:18.599
The thing is, every time you sick in air and
particles and odorants, you're also sucking

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.479
in microorganisms… and some of those could
be dangerously interesting.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.380
I've been watching Monsters Inside Me, on
Animal Planet Go, and I have to say the weird

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.479
computer animated microbes and crazy infections
are so….

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.479
addicting!

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.470
Check it out as well as all the other Animal
Planet shows on the ANIMAL PLANET GO APP!

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.970
Free on your App Store.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.710
Knowing what you nose about the schnoz,
what do you think space smells like?

00:04:38.710 --> 00:05:01.599
Maybe you can guess, but you should probably
just watch this video to be sure.

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.500
What's your favorite season for smells? Obviously

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:33.639
I love fall, as maybe you've already guessed.
