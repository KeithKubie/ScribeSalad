00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.290
When it comes to Olympic level track and field
events, history tends to only remember those

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.480
who ran the fastest, jumped the farthest and
pushed themselves further than their peers.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
Shizo Kanakuri is an apparent exception to
that rule because he’s fondly remembered

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.720
for having the worst official time of any
Olympic marathon runner in history, taking

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.550
over 54 years to finish a race he started
in 1912.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.790
Although mainly known in the west for his
aforementioned Olympic record, in his native

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.770
Japan, Kanakuri is regarded as one of the
country’s finest athletes, often being referred

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.760
to as “the father of the Japanese marathon”.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.350
In fact, Kanakuri was such an exceptional
athlete that he entered the 1912 Olympics

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.510
in Stockholm as a firm favourite to win the
marathon after it emerged he’d set a possible

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.680
world record in a qualifying round in Japan
the previous year, achieving a time of 2:32:45.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
(Whether or not this was a true world record
is debated as the distance Kanakuri ran was

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.680
never officially measured and it’s believed
by some that he only ran 25 miles instead

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.490
of the requisite 26.2 for the record.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.470
Nevertheless, his long distance running ability
was well known and established by the time

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.860
the 1912 Olympics rolled around.)

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.350
One of only two athletes Japan sent to compete
in the Olympics that year (the other being

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.659
a sprinter, Yahiko Mishima, a lot of pressure
was placed on Kanakuri to perform well as

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.190
he, along with his teammate, represented the
first Japanese athletes to ever compete in

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.190
the Olympics.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.409
The journey to Sweden was reportedly an incredibly
trying and involved travelling by both boat

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.920
and rail over the course of about two weeks.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.020
Not wanting their skills to slip, Kanakuri
and his teammate reportedly kept themselves

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.470
in shape by endlessly running laps around
the boat, and later when they travelled by

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.450
rail, jogging around the train station whenever
it stopped.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.590
Unfortunately, when Japan’s Olympic duo
arrived in Sweden, one of the men fell ill,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.850
although it’s not clear from surviving records
whether it was Kanakuri or Mishima.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.490
The local cuisine also didn’t sit well with
Kanakuri, further hampering his pre-race preparation.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.229
When the day of the Marathon arrived, the
weather in Stockholm was an unseasonably warm

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.250
32 °C (almost 90 °F).

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.829
Beyond the weather being less than ideal,
Kanakuri chose to run in traditional Japanese

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.879
cloth shoes called tabi.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.969
He did attempt to reinforce these shoes with
rough canvas, but they still proved to be

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.420
ineffective at protecting his feet from the
gravel and debris strewn across the marathon’s

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
path.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.109
Another problem for Kanakuri was his, shall
we say, unorthodox running method by modern

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.109
standards.

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.980
You see, while running, Kanakuri generally
abstained from drinking liquid due to the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.680
then widespread belief that sweating made
a person more fatigued.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.989
While this may seem strange, it was at least
an improvement on other marathon running practices

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.310
of both not drinking anything and taking small
doses of strychnine…

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.579
In any event, the lack of drinking combined
with the heat saw Kanakuri pass out from heatstroke

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.579
around the halfway mark.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.670
According to Kanakuri, around this time he
happened upon a garden party being held in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.909
a well-to-do banker’s villa and decided
to grab a drink with the host after spying

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.769
that they were drinking orange juice.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.830
After about an hour of recovering, Kanakuri
decided to forfeit the race and caught a train

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.999
to Stockholm where he stayed in a hotel until
his boat back to Japan arrived.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.769
Upon getting back to Japan, as thanks for
allowing him to recover in their villa, Kanakuri

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.079
sent the banker a mysterious box with a scroll
inside covered in Japanese writing that became

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.469
a treasured memento of the occasion for the
family.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.673
(More on that in the bonus facts section).

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.939
Now Kanakuri’s choice to drop out of the
race, in of itself, wasn’t unusual because

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.970
over half of the 69 runners competing in the
marathon that day ended up not finishing it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.720
because of the heat, with many similarly passing
out like Kanakuri did.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.599
Not only that, but one man, Portuguese runner
Francisco Lázaro, died as a result of the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.029
race, having fallen unconscious about 8 km
from the finish line with a reported body

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:48.859
temperature of a whopping 42.1 °C (107.8
°F).

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.589
He never regained consciousness and died the
next morning.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:55.959
It was later revealed that he had covered
his body with wax to help against sunburn.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.729
Unfortunately, it also prevented him from
sweating properly, contributing to his death.

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.730
As for Kanakuri, ashamed that he had been
forced to withdraw, he never told race officials

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.180
he’d dropped out and instead simply went
home.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.409
Thus, aware that many of the racers had passed
out and one ultimately died, they worried

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.700
that Kanakuri could be in danger and so reported
that he was missing to the Swedish police

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.799
who fruitlessly searched for him.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.110
Weirdly, Kanakuri remained an official missing
person in Sweden for about 5 decades, even

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.060
though he competed in the 1920 Olympics in
Antwerp and the 1924 Olympics in Paris (he

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.010
was also set to run in the 1916 Olympics,
but WW1 got in the way).

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.490
In his native Japan, Kanakuri’s failure
in 1912 was roundly criticised by the media

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.380
and Kanakuri himself wrote of how ashamed
he was of himself in his diary.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.300
However, some coverage was more favourable,
commending the young athlete for even being

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.690
able to compete on the same level as the best
in the world with so little preparation.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.690
(He was only 20 when he ran the marathon and
had trained for less than a year).

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.900
Despite this initial setback, Kanakuri became
a key figure in the history of long-distance

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.280
running in Japan, establishing the Tokyo-Hakone
Round-Trip College Ekiden Race, a relay race

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.090
for university students that helped foster
a longstanding love of the sport in the country

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.210
and something that led to him being crowned
“the father of Japanese marathon”.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.040
After retiring from the sport in 1924, Kanakuri
became a geography teacher.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.490
Kanakuri’s performance in the 1912 Olympics
likely would have been forgotten if not for

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.990
his absconding becoming something of an urban
legend in Sweden, with him coming to be known

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.110
as “the missing marathoner” in Stockholm.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.020
In 1962, a Swedish journalist learned that
Kanakuri was very much alive, much to the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.410
surprise of the Swedish National Olympic Committee
who made a note of it in their records.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.180
Five years later, in 1967, Kanakuri’s name
came up among a group of businessmen who were

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.510
helping raise funds to send Swedish athletes
to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.200
They then hatched a novel idea- why not have
Kanakuri “finish” the marathon in front

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.780
of the world’s media as a way to score some
free publicity and attract sponsors to their

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780
cause?

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.490
Worried Kankuri wouldn’t visit if he knew
what was going on, he was invited to Sweden

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.580
under the pretence of celebrating the 55th
anniversary of the 1912 Olympic games- a curious

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.750
request, but Kanakuri happily obliged regardless.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.170
It was only when Kanakuri arrived in Sweden
that officials informed him of the ruse and

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.670
the extent of the legend he’d inspired by
disappearing all those years ago (some tongue

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.670
in cheek versions went as far to posit that
Kanakuri was still running 50 years later

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.670
because he’d missed the first checkpoint).

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.440
Taking the whole thing in good spirits, Kanakuri
agreed to finish the race on camera, reportedly

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.410
still having the athletic fortitude to sprint
the final 100 meters at 76 years old.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.040
Upon Swedish Olympic Committee representatives
reading out his official finish time to the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.500
gathered press- 54 years, 8 months, 6 days,
5 hours, 32 minutes and 20.3 seconds- Kanakuri

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.910
was asked if he’d like to say a few words
about breaking a world record for slowest

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.910
marathon ever run.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.180
Thinking for a moment, the elderly athlete
shuffled to the microphone and said:

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.560
It was a long trip.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.970
Along the way, I got married, had six children
and 10 grandchildren.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.630
Kanakuri passed away in 1983 at the age of
92.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.360
In honor of his contribution to the sport
of long distance running in Japan, the grand

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.720
prize for the aforementioned relay he started
was named after him.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.350
During his brief trip back to Sweden in 1967,
Kanakuri revisited the villa he’d ended

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.690
up at over 50 years prior and shared a glass
of orange juice with the son of the host who’d

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.380
invited him to rest with them.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.320
While the two were chatting, the son asked
Kanakuri what was in the box he’d sent his

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.139
father as nobody in his family could read
Japanese.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:22.540
Kanakuri sheepishly responded that it was
simply an old customs form he had lying around

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:37.840
he put in the box because it looked kind

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.290
of important.
