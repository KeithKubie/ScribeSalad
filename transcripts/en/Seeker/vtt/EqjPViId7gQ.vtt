00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.429
I like to think the boogers that wield your
eyes shut in the morning is your body’s

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.460
way of saying you don’t need to open them
for 5 more minutes.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.600
Hi everyone, it’s Julian here for you at
DNews.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.350
Ok, so they aren’t actually boogers, but
you know that crusty stuff in the corner of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.820
your eye when you wake up?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Some people call it sleep, or rheum, or gound.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.090
And believe it or not, it serves a purpose.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.800
Dry and crusty, gunky or goopy, eye discharge
in small amounts is a normal part of waking

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
up.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.269
This combination of mucus, oil, skin cells
and other debris in your eye serves as a protective

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.070
shield and allows the eye to function properly.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.829
So let’s get technical for a second: the
eyes of mammals are covered by a multi-layer

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.410
film that helps them do what they’re supposed
to do.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.329
Closest to the cornea — the transparent
front part of the eye — is a layer of mucin.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.699
Mucin is made up of protein that scientists
think helps clear debris and pathogens from

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.699
the eye.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.559
On top of that is the aqueous layer, which
makes up 90% of your eye’s coating.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.359
This is a water-based tear solution only about
as thick as a single strand of spider silk,

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.210
which serves many functions, including keeping
our eyes hydrated and protects against infection.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.200
The last outer layer is called the lipid layer.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.350
It is made of an oily substance called meibum,
a key part of which are fatty acids.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.549
When you’re awake, your body temperature
keeps that layer oily, but at night when you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.030
sleep, the body cools, and some of the meibum
becomes a dry solid – forming the basis

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.170
of the eye gunk that you’re used to.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.060
Continuous blinking throughout the day allows
a film of tears to wash away the rheum from

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.670
our eyes, but when we’re asleep, we aren’t
blinking.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.520
[unless you’re a chronic sleepwalker].

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.729
According to research publish by the British
Journal of Ophthalmology, sleep relaxes the

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.880
muscles in our eyes, causing the excess meibum
to seep out onto our eyelids and lashes.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.920
Think of it like a zipper – from the edge
of your face in toward the nose.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.420
As the eyelid closes, it pushes the material
collected under the lid into the corner and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.679
dries out overnight.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.600
But why do we produce meibum at all?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.470
Well first, the oily juices prevent us from
crying constantly, unless we get our feelings

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.409
hurt, holding tears in place.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.619
It also keeps our eyes hydrated.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.820
A study published in the journal Experimental
Eye Research found that rabbits’ eyes, when

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.350
lacking meibum, lost water through evaporation
much faster than the normal rate.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.040
Call it annoying or disgusting, but the stuff
that glues your peepers together in the morning

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.160
is perfectly normal and important.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And you can be proud to say ‘I woke up like
this’.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.180
We're just gonna keep rolling.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.330
I'm just going to keep going.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.490
So now you know about eye boogers, but what
about nose boogers.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.630
What happens if you...eat them.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.830
Yeah, gross, right?

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.600
I covered that in this video.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.090
What do you think?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.460
Do eye boogers gross you out?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.620
