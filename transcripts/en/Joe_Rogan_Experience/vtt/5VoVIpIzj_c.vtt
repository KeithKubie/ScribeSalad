1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.720
Now we're alive.
Three two,
one boom.
Hello Annie.
Hello.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.810
Very nice to meet you.
I'm excited to talk to you.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
I'm super excited to talk to you about several subjects,
but this one,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.350
thank you very much for this.
A first edition copy of your area,

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.310
51 and uncensored history of America's top secret military base book.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.060
I'm super excited about this.
I heard through the grapevine you are a fan.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.260
I'm a freak when it comes to this stuff.
Do you,

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.980
what do you think is going on up there?
I mean,

9
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:29.580
same thing that's going on all over the place when it comes to military secrets,

10
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.650
which is stuff that you want to know about.

11
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.620
Very few people know about an every now and then a journalist gets a hint.
Hm?

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.860
Yeah.
Do you think there's any alien stuff up there?

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.550
I write in the book all about that.
Yeah.
We'll tell him last 12 pages.

14
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.290
You want me to [inaudible] pages?
What do you think?

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.890
So area 51 was this secret test base where the CIA was running a spy plane

16
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.490
programs.
Right.
So interestingly,
my new book is about ground branch guys.

17
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.270
On the ground that's about Arab ranch,
what we were doing in the air.

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070
And it was this idea that we should spy on the enemy.
Okay.

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.260
And,
but if you go back in time,
why area 51 really started,

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800
you learn that it was a base hidden inside of a base nuclear weapons and it was

21
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:28.251
all about beating stolen at his black propaganda campaign.

22
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.610
Sat right in the book to hoax Americans in a war of the worlds type scenario

23
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690
whereby little men who looked like aliens would get out of an aircraft and the

24
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:47.790
government would go crazy about it.
And then Stalin would say,
look,
we have,

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.460
not only do we have technology but better than you,

26
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.940
but we have a better propaganda department than you route that.

27
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.710
Joe,
you got to read the whole book.
I mean,
this is like a,

28
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:02.850
this is a tough opening.
You got me on the spot,
but it's a good spot.
All right.

29
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.620
Good spine.
So stolen.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.120
Just hired short people or where do you do all right.

31
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:12.960
I'm gonna make you save that.
I'm gonna make you earn.
Yeah,
I mean,

32
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.990
you want me to talk about that right now?
Right off the bat I'm sweating.

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.270
We're going to get to surprise,
kill vanish as well,
but I want to,
I just,
yeah.

34
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.980
Why does it make you sweat?
Oh my God,
it's such an incendiary topic.

35
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.720
I mean,
people,
people want to believe they're aliens.
Right?
Right.
Okay.
I mean,

36
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.110
I've spent five books dealing with the pathology of area 51 which is phenomenal

37
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:41.700
in its own way because it speaks so much to power,
to morality,

38
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.970
to information,
to,
you know,

39
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180
people's desire to know what's going on and,

40
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.340
and the government's desire to keep things hidden.

41
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:55.080
So this topic is always coming up because a lot of people want to believe that

42
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.580
there were aliens in that craft.
And my source,

43
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 1>who I write about in the book,
uh,</v>

44
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.270
told me otherwise that they were genetically,
you know,

45
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 2>then when we stop you right there,
because when you say that craft,</v>

46
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.840
what you mean is the supposed Ufo records or crashed in Roswell,

47
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.020
New Mexico in 1947 that's what you mean,
right?
Yes.

48
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.710
But that was never supposedly taken to area 51 I was supposed to be taken to

49
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.240
Wright Patterson air force base.

50
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.450
The legend has it that Truman flew there to meet them and

51
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.580
<v 1>right.
That's one legend.
Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:32.581
So in my book I interview a man who worked for the Atomic Energy Commission who

53
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.870
tells a different story,

54
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.930
tells the story of receiving that craft at area 51 in 1951 which is why the base

55
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:48.121
is called area 51 oh and that inside the craft where humans who had been altered

56
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.701
surgically altered to look like aliens in a plan for Stalin to sort of twist

57
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.200
Truman's arm.
Because at that time

58
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.890
we had the atomic bomb on Roswell happened,

59
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.440
we had the atomic bomb and the Soviets did not.
Can I stop you there?
Yeah.

60
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 2>When you say humans that were surgically altered to look like aliens,</v>

61
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.960
do you mean,

62
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.970
so this is 1951 so you're talking about four years after this supposedly

63
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.380
<v 1>crash.
Yes.
So what,</v>

64
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.920
what was the last they kept the bodies on bodies.
In what?

65
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:31.921
Formaldehyde and also because the idea was and remember or I can't say remember

66
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.070
cause you haven't read the book yet.
Right.
And I wrote this book eight years ago.

67
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.390
Um,
but it did really impact a lot of my,

68
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.720
a lot of my thinking and working on,
on,
you know,

69
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:48.721
government secrecy projects because it makes you really consider what a hopes

70
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:55.771
means and what it means to a population of people and how the government begins

71
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:00.190
to work with disinformation versus cover stories and all of that.

72
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.660
But going back to answer your question,

73
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.290
that is what I was told by the source that,
but how reliable,

74
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.140
<v 2>what was the source?</v>

75
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:11.141
This is a very incendiary idea to rely upon one individuals

76
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.610
<v 1>collection of it,</v>

77
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.810
which is why the book went through the roof in terms of people being upset about

78
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:22.340
it.
I mean,
where they,
oh my God,
I interviewed 79 CIA guys,

79
00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:26.540
air force guys,
spy pilots,
engineers.
I mean,
who's mad at you?

80
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.431
They,

81
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:32.840
conspiracy theorists were mad at me because they said this woman has bananas.

82
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.220
They were aliens.
Well,
even if they weren't aliens.
That's

83
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.120
<v 2>right.
There's also,</v>

84
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.210
there's accounts that it was some sort of a test vehicle and that there were

85
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.210
actually just dummies inside their crash test dummies that they used.

86
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.520
There's been a bunch of different versions of it,

87
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.050
but the most compelling version of the area,

88
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.350
51 alien myth to me is Bob Lasar.
Did you get into that?
Yeah,

89
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.040
he plays a

90
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 0>huge role in area 51 I mean,
yeah,
before Bob Lasar went public,</v>

91
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.560
no one even knew about area 51 people have all new people.
It was,

92
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.090
it was common folk lore,

93
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.010
but there was no definitive proof that there was something going on over there

94
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:18.011
other than some weird VHS footage of things flying around in the desert that

95
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:23.351
seemed to be behaving in a way that modern Aircrafts are not totally capable of,

96
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.610
at least modern piloted Aircrafts are not totally capable of.

97
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.620
Which brings me to another book I wrote called the Pentagon sprain,

98
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.380
which you know,
sort of off this idea.
I was like,
wait a minute,

99
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.960
what kind of technology is the government capable of?

100
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.200
And we have it hold department for that reason called Darpa,

101
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.680
which looks at weapon systems 25 years out.

102
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.710
So the idea that you and I don't know what the military is capable of in the air

103
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.170
under water,
wherever it may be,

104
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.560
is because we're not thinking 25 years out and they are and they're developing

105
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:59.750
weapons systems,
the great weapons systems of the future.

106
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.090
That's what they call them,
right?

107
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.360
Look how they develop the stealth bomber Lincoln that was all out in area 51 and

108
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:09.990
groom lake.
And um,
what do you think of Bible is our store,
cause Bob,

109
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.640
our story,
what's it really,
there's some fascinating aspects to it.

110
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.730
One of the most fascinating and some of the things that he's said that people

111
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.640
said was horseshit,
it's told has been proven to be true.

112
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.900
Like one of the things the,

113
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.901
the biometric reader that measured the length of the bones in your hand and that

114
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.840
they are unique as unique as a fingerprint and people are like,

115
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:30.590
what are you talking about?

116
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.860
And then they actually found out that this was something they really did have

117
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.090
and they have photos of this thing.

118
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.720
Now this is something that he talked about and they claimed it was science

119
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:40.100
fiction.
I mean,

120
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.260
it's fascinating when someone touches upon a subject that the government does

121
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.720
not want known about for any reason.

122
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.120
And there is a campaign to discredit that person.

123
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.800
And there's no doubt that that happened to him.
I mean,
it was remarkable.

124
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:58.280
And I write about him in the book because if you follow the logic that my source

125
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:02.570
told me that these were,
you know,
modified human beings as part of a hoax.

126
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.330
And the reason that I trust the sources,
because Joe,

127
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:07.730
he told me that he also worked on the program,

128
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.070
so he had like a burden to unload.
Right.

129
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.290
And so if you follow that logic through,

130
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:20.120
then the Bible is our story is that Bob,
when Bob was our set,
I saw an alien.

131
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.840
It looked like this.
It was small.
It had big eyes.
It's,
yes,

132
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.520
those were the [inaudible] genetically.

133
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.240
I mean those were the surgically modified humans that the government was doing

134
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:30.074
experiments.

135
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.290
I think Bob blazars exact quote was he walked by a window and he looked in and

136
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.390
he saw two agents that were,
it looked,

137
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.950
they were looking down at something that was very small and look to humanoid,

138
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.220
but he didn't know if it was a dummy or anything and he wasn't even supposed to

139
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:51.221
be looking in there and it was a brief like one second look for that.

140
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.070
He is bounced around in his head back and forth.
Has it ever

141
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v 1>occurred you that maybe the guy who gave that information did work there but is</v>

142
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.150
also feeding you horseshit?
Well,

143
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.740
the source was a major player in the Manhattan project.

144
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.160
He went on and worked in the Atomic Energy Commission.

145
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.630
I mean there's a wing of a museum named after him.
Um,

146
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.960
his accolades,
his awards were so extraordinary.

147
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.720
It would basis then you have never said his name,
although you know,

148
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:26.460
I will say this when you're giving away,

149
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.810
giving away a lot of the stuff that recently died and he did give me permission

150
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.060
to tell his full story after he died.

151
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.510
And I'm circling around circling around that.

152
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:39.990
But he was absolutely,
uh,
you know,

153
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.450
with a Q Q clearance,

154
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:46.530
that's what you have when you have access to nuclear secrets.

155
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:51.531
So if someone has a Q clearance for decades and they're full of garbage,

156
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.980
you really have to ask my God,
should this guy have a Q clearance?

157
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.040
I mean that's reverse engineering his credibility.

158
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:03.690
But I think you should read the whole book because you know,

159
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.600
it's shocking what he says,
but it does make sense.

160
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.320
If you can get through 400 pages of,
you know,

161
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.700
the CIA's idea about information disinformation,

162
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.770
why we need to cover things up,

163
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.340
why that's why I'm asking you if you think he might've been lying to you.

164
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.910
I don't believe it was line whatsoever.
No,
I don't believe,

165
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:26.570
I don't believe you think that the stall on that,

166
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:30.990
the Russian government definitely did surgically alter people to make them look

167
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:34.620
like a new Orleans.
I believe with the images of these,
I believe what he told me.

168
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.160
Did you see photos?
No,
I did not see if it is,
but here's the rub.
Ready.

169
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.310
When I was writing another book called phenomena,

170
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.380
which dealt with the CIA and the Pentagon's use of psychics.
Okay.

171
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.590
Um,
over decades.
I mean this goes back,

172
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.580
everything I write about pretty much goes back to post World War when we remote

173
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.970
viewing stuff.
Yes,
yes.
And it's all about government.

174
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.040
US government takes pole position after World War II and we now need to always

175
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:06.570
be ahead of the curve.
We must lead.
We can never get beaten by the Russians.

176
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:07.710
Now it's China.
Okay.

177
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.130
So the psychic program had a lot of people who really believe in aliens or you

178
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:17.340
know,
other Intel intelligence from other worlds.

179
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.830
And when I was writing the phenomenal book,

180
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.290
I learned a whole bunch of new information about how upset they were with my

181
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.770
story because they believe,
and they all knew the source by the way.

182
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.210
They knew the source and they believed that he was fed misinformation.

183
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.350
So these are two sides of the coin,
which are super interesting.

184
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.380
I think if you can look at them with your own biased turned off and not have a

185
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.440
desired outcome.
I want to believe this.
I don't want to believe this,
you know,

186
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.620
um,
speaking of,
I want to believe,
you know,

187
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.460
I was working on a project with Chris Carter

188
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.310
<v 0>who is the x files creator.</v>

189
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.880
And the one person I took the source,
um,

190
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.430
that I wanted to meet the source was Chris Carter and I,

191
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.470
we went out there together and sat with him and met him.

192
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.380
And it was well because the source had never even heard of the x files.

193
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.520
And it was like,
oh,
I know they talked about baseball,
you know?

194
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.270
Um,
see,
I don't have a desired outcome.
I mean,

195
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.240
I would love it if aliens were real okay.

196
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.310
But when someone starts talking about disinformation and propaganda campaigns,

197
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:31.270
but they want you to believe them.
Right?
But don't listen,

198
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.270
I'm here telling you the truth.
I'm here telling you the truth.

199
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.620
I'm not saying I'm telling you the truth at all.
That's why I was not yet.

200
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.890
Let's wait for an hour.
Three because it's too explosive.

201
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:45.460
People have such a horse in the race already.

202
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.050
They with aliens you think?
Well,
I mean maybe you are neutral.

203
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.650
I don't know.
I know I'm neutral.
I will listen.

204
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:58.470
I absolutely want aliens to be real hundred percent and I'm not neutral,

205
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.700
am neutral in my perceptions.
And when I look at things I go,

206
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.840
hmm,
I dunno about that.
Me To want to see a picture.
Like what are these?

207
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:10.390
What are these guys looked like?
I mean,
what did they do to them?

208
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:14.650
Did he describe what kind of surgical alterations stayed with a source?

209
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.210
I mean,
after the book published,
I would go and visit him.

210
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:23.350
We'd sit in a Chinese restaurant and eat and talk and I would try to get a

211
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:28.180
droplet of information out of him.
Oh my God.
He avoided.
I mean,

212
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.100
look,
here's another thing.
When the book came out,

213
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.940
his wife of 65 years knew it was him.
Okay.

214
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.420
And I went out to Las Vegas and sat there in a room with the source and his wife

215
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.210
and she said,
tell me this isn't true.

216
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:46.870
Tell me you made this all up to her husband.
And he said,

217
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.690
it's the truth.
I mean,
that's a triangular version of getting at the truth.

218
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:54.880
But again,
to reiterate,

219
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.870
I believe he believes what he told me was the truth.
That was the truth.

220
00:13:58.871 --> 00:13:59.704
He was told.

221
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.390
I think there's certain agents that think it's fun to fuck with reporters and

222
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.730
journalists and make things up.
I really do.

223
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.140
I think especially when they're talking about secret information that they were

224
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:16.141
sworn to protect and then all of a sudden they want to talk to someone that they

225
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.840
don't even know on the sneak tip.
Let's meet at a diner.

226
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.480
I'm going to tell you everything how we met.
Well,
I mean,
yeah,

227
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.800
I mean however you met.
Yeah.

228
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:29.310
We met because I was interviewing nuclear weapons engineers who are setting off

229
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:33.310
nuclear bombs in area 51 mushroom,

230
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.340
I mean in the Nevada test site area 12 area 23 and they all said to me,

231
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.630
you've got to talk to the top engineer of all this weaponry.

232
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.910
And they gave me his name and we talked for days and hours about nuclear
weapons.

233
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.060
And then in one conversation he began to cry and told me this story that I was

234
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:58.790
like,
what was crying?

235
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.330
He was crying because he participated in our version of the human experiments

236
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.750
because what the Russians do,
we do,
look,
I've written five books about them,

237
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.450
altered people to make them look like an alien.
According to him.

238
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:19.451
We had a small program in 1951 where we wanted to see how the Russians did what

239
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:20.750
they did,

240
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.440
how they made human beings look like this is where they do take prisoners or

241
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:29.420
something.
Who Do they alter?
He said they were handicapped children.

242
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.310
Oh Jesus.
And he told me that he participated in this.
So again,
I mean,

243
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:38.210
unless you have someone that lost their mind at age 90 and was willing to tell

244
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:40.370
their wife of 65 years,
I lost my mind.

245
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.460
So he's saying that he participated in something that altered handicapped

246
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:47.960
children.
When you say handicapped,

247
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.961
you know like down syndrome or something like that and they made them look like

248
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:56.810
aliens and then killed them.
Like what did,
how did they,

249
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.250
what did they do with this?

250
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:00.950
This is where we get into drops of information coming in.

251
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.980
But what I can say is he had a grandchild that was born that way and,

252
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.210
and the grandchild did not live long.

253
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.270
The grandchild died and it made him feel so guilty about what he had done that

254
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:17.930
he felt compelled to con to confess,
if you will.
And I remember saying to him,

255
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.960
why are you telling me this?
Why don't you tell a priest?
And he said,

256
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.890
a priest would judge me and I can tell you won't.

257
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.170
That's why wouldn't you judge them or judge them?

258
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.010
Well I guess that's why I'm a born journalist joke cause I really try not to

259
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.960
judge people.
I mean,
my new book surprised kill vanish.
It's about assassins.

260
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.590
It's about people who work for the CIA,

261
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:42.920
who do what needs to be done on the ground,
uh,

262
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.120
in the name of national security.
I don't judge them.
This is why you know,

263
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.290
what's really at issue here is morality,
right?
Yeah.
I mean,

264
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.370
can I tell you how I got the idea for this book?
Sure.
But let me,

265
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.010
before we go any further.
So you want to talk about the area.

266
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.690
Was he saying that there have never been any encounters with the alien

267
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.840
spacecraft?
He was totally neutral about aliens.
He had nothing to do with aliens.

268
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.150
He could have cared less.
He didn't watch the axe files.

269
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.720
What was his take on Bob Lozar?
His take on Bob was our,

270
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:19.721
was that he probably saw something that the government had an extension of the

271
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:23.120
program.
I mean,
he didn't know that was speculative.
We didn't talk about that.

272
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.490
I mean,
you know,
other than inference,

273
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.530
he was very limited in his,
in the information that he would get out.

274
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:33.500
But I mean,
I used 79 sources in that book.

275
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:38.501
That all went on the record in name and he was the one anonymous source because,

276
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.760
but like I said,
you know,

277
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.590
he told me after he died that I could tell the whole story.
I think I might,

278
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.930
I might come back into the book.

279
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.850
If you give me a break and back off of this subject,

280
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.120
I might come back and tell you,
and your audience is your book.

281
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.460
I want to promote your book.
I know you want to promote your new book,

282
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:01.050
but I want to promote this book as well.
I mean,
I'm teasing you,
but it's,

283
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.560
it's like it's an astonishing story and I think the best line of all is that

284
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:11.370
people that read about that in the very end of what we did,
they go,

285
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.750
I wish they were aliens.
You know?

286
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.260
So Stalin created some sort of a craft that mimic,
you're going to read it.

287
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.840
That's what you're going to do the rest of the afternoon.
Nope.

288
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.050
I'm going to come back on your chest and we're talking.

289
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.840
I think we should probably get into this a little.
Okay.

290
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.410
Come on with the question.
I'm used to asking the questions as a journalist.
Yeah.

291
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.230
No,
Stalin and the,
the Russians created something that mimicked,

292
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.530
um,
a Ufo,
something that looked like it would be from another planet.

293
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.200
Is that what they did?
Mother ship in those days?

294
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.250
Drones where there was a mothership and adrenaline was attached to it and it was

295
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:52.170
jettisoned off.
Okay.
So in those days,
well,

296
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:56.700
in 1947,
48,
well,
they didn't,

297
00:18:56.701 --> 00:19:00.600
I mean that was drone technology then,
right?
So there's a mother,
a mother craft,

298
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.920
like our aircraft,

299
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:06.921
and then the drone is like a small aircraft under it and it gets jettisoned off.

300
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.640
And that was what the craft was.
It was jettisons off.
So that,

301
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.210
so stolen actually according to the source,
invaded our airspace,

302
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.370
which was the deep embarrassment to Truman.

303
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.880
So we invaded our airspace and then let this drone crash land on the ground with

304
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:28.440
these things that turned out to be human.
They look like aliens,

305
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:31.490
but they turn out to be humans that were manipulated surgically to look like

306
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.700
Yale as a way to and remember,
I mean,
not remember,
but where,

307
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.130
where this was was,
you know,

308
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:42.870
very close to a nuclear weapon space to our white sands military base.
I mean,

309
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:46.980
this is like not a place you want the Russians to be able to get there.
Right.

310
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.120
You know,
I mean,

311
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:51.990
what was interesting is that area 51 we then went on and mimicked all of those.

312
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.390
One of our early drones was a mimicry of that.
It was the dean,

313
00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:00.590
there was a m 21 which was the mothership and a d 21 which was the daughtership.

314
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.850
So how was it wirelessly or we do,
no,
no,
no.

315
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:06.780
Then it was like the,

316
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.010
there was a pilot and the mothership and they kind of let it go and it flew off.

317
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.311
I mean,

318
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:16.020
there's incredible stories of what the CIA was able to do out there at area 51

319
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:20.640
with their air branch,
you know,
um,
the technology,

320
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.190
they're always ahead of technology.
That's what's remarkable.

321
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.420
Well what Bob was our did film that was really shocking was the film,

322
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.480
the filming of these drones flying around and performing these really,

323
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.390
you've seen those videos of sure.

324
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:38.010
Right in the 80s it gets really crazy with what they're able to do and went

325
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.520
there.

326
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.940
But I mean why I like looking at history is cause you can see the progression,

327
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.770
you know,
you see how science evolves,
you know,

328
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:48.010
bit by bit.
And then

329
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.550
<v 1>there's these great breakthroughs because what the government is always looking</v>

330
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.470
for is called a revolution in military affairs.
Right.

331
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.690
And that's certainly what drone technology did.
Um,

332
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.050
later on as drones became developed after the Vietnam War in the 1980s when Bob

333
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:06.010
was our,
was filming all this stuff,

334
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.900
you think this was similar to the technology that we see publicly described

335
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:15.240
today in terms of like what drones are capable of?
Sure.
I mean that's,

336
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.430
that's something like that.
But then they're all,
you know,
when,

337
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.680
when the f one 17 was revealed during the first Gulf War,

338
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.370
that aircraft was being developed for 20,

339
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:32.371
25 years out at area 51 actually at area 52 was where they had it set up,

340
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.800
um,
to develop that stuff.
Technology,
think about,
and what was amazing,

341
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:40.990
talk about keeping secrets.
Um,

342
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.380
they had something like 10,000 people working on that.

343
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.870
No one knew about it.
That story was never broken by the press,
not by anyone.

344
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.160
It just suddenly appeared in the Gulf War and took out Saddam Hussein's,

345
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.780
you know,
facilities.
That's a revolution in military affairs.

346
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.620
What becomes interesting is then it becomes obsolete because now everybody knows

347
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.780
about it and everybody's going to mimic that.

348
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.780
And now you have to have a new weapon system.

349
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:09.880
And that's the military industrial complex.

350
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.500
So was this drone aircraft that was released from the mothership,

351
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.590
was this capable of autonomous flight or was it just they just threw it out

352
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:20.720
there and let it crash?
Uh,
the ladder.
Right.

353
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.420
And remember that information.
I am very limited too.
That's why it's tough pages.

354
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:28.960
It's like the source gave me these little bits of information,

355
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.350
which I felt I felt was important to include because it speaks to the big issue.

356
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.980
Why is area 51 classified?

357
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.510
I mean now it's not President Obama was the first president to actually say area

358
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:48.010
51 publicly.
Some people say because of my book,
right?
Meaning it was out,

359
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.850
the secret was out.

360
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:53.560
But before that I went through 10,000 pages of documents from the national

361
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.394
archives.

362
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.170
And every place you see the word area 51 was actually redacted.

363
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.840
Right.
Why would you keep that so secret?
I mean,

364
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.560
all the guys that I was interviewing say they could call it,
you know,
groom lake,

365
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.950
they could call it the test facility.
They could call it paradise ranch,

366
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:14.080
but they couldn't say area 51 y.
And the source said,
well,

367
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:18.190
because we did this horrible program out there and the government doesn't want

368
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.530
anyone to know about that ever.

369
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.250
I mean there stories of like somebody asking Bill Clinton,

370
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:29.230
you know about area 51 him going away.
I mean human experiments,

371
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.250
who wants to be part of that?
It's horrible.
But the human experiments were,

372
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.560
were they limited to this mimicry of the Russian experiments where they were

373
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.940
trying to get people to look like aliens or where there's something else going

374
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:40.900
on?
Oh my goodness.

375
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:45.901
I mean you read now the declassified documents tell us how many different human

376
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:50.990
experiments were going on around nuclear weapons.
Okay.

377
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.940
Horrible experiments where they were subjecting people to radiation because they

378
00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:57.170
wanted to know,
they felt,
well,

379
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:01.340
it's more important to know what happens to people than to not know.

380
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.640
And so they would take groups of people that say had cancer or something and

381
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:09.410
test them.
So there's no doubt that the government has experimented on humans.

382
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.420
It's just,
is that something that is wise to make public?
And you know,

383
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:17.120
there's two sides of the coin on that.
I mean you,
you,

384
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.180
when you reveal these kinds of things,
when you write about them,
I mean,

385
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.490
people get really upset and you know,

386
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.090
vilify the government partially with good reason.

387
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:29.720
And partially it's like bad for national security.

388
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:33.650
So I think that's the justification on the part of the fence department to keep

389
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:34.440
things secret.

390
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.030
<v 2>That makes sense.
Wow.
That's a,</v>

391
00:24:37.031 --> 00:24:39.280
that's an interesting take that I never thought of before,

392
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:43.150
but if I was stolen and I was trying to air quotes,

393
00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:47.530
fuck with the Americans,
that's maybe way I would do it.
Hey man,

394
00:24:47.531 --> 00:24:51.310
you gotta problems.
Aliens are coming.
And there was,
if people,

395
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.780
it's hard for people that live in 2019 especially if you're young,

396
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.410
to really imagine a world,
not only without the internet,

397
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.580
but with two television channels.
Right.
And Radio,

398
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.310
which was where people got all their information from.
I mean,

399
00:25:06.311 --> 00:25:10.450
was there two channels?
How many channels where the,
in 1947 maybe three,

400
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.280
maybe three.
I mean it was radio in World War Two,
right?
Most video mostly.
Yeah.

401
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.640
Yeah,
mostly radio and newspapers and that's where people were getting their

402
00:25:18.641 --> 00:25:19.210
information.

403
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.210
And there was a mass hysteria where people were absolutely terrified that we

404
00:25:24.911 --> 00:25:29.830
were going to be invaded,
which is why when Orson wells war of worlds,

405
00:25:29.831 --> 00:25:33.190
which when they released it,
when they did it on the air,

406
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:38.191
they were very clear that this is going to be a reading of Orson Wells War of

407
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:43.890
worlds book or that a Hg wells,
excuse me,
war of war.
Right.

408
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.510
Was Hg wells book and Orson Welles Reddit.
Yes.

409
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.410
And when they were talking about this on the radio,

410
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:55.300
a lot of people miss that part.
Right.
And so as the radio went on,

411
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.120
as the broadcast went on and people were tuning in later in the day,

412
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.180
it erupted in mass hysteria.
People were freaking out.

413
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.600
Hundreds of thousands of people really did think that it was.

414
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.010
And it was also something that was recreated in other countries.

415
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.100
I don't know if you know that they did that in other countries and different

416
00:26:12.101 --> 00:26:15.490
languages when they saw how cute it worked in America.
And

417
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.130
<v 1>so you see,
you can see the logic.
I mean,</v>

418
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:21.520
at first it sounds absurd and ridiculous and that's why I was sweating because

419
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:25.780
it's like,
I know,
right?
Right.
But when you think it through,

420
00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:29.230
and I challenge you to read the whole book because you start piecing together

421
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.150
these various ideas and disinformation becomes less vague and more specific and

422
00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:35.680
you go,
oh,
that's how it works.

423
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.750
And you begin to see how people's perception and how they're easily manipulated

424
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.570
factors into national security.
Just like you just described,
stolen,

425
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:49.710
knew about that he was a master.
He was the master of propaganda.

426
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:54.120
He invented it.
I mean,
he didn't invent it,
but he invented it in a,

427
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.751
you know,

428
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:59.751
on the political stage to be used to mess with another country's perception of

429
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:04.020
things.
Hmm.
Think of what he did with brainwashing.
Right.
Okay.

430
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.920
So like in the fifties and this is journalists,
you know,
said.

431
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.220
So there was a journalist who is putting out stories about brainwashing and

432
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.660
there was this idea,

433
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:16.530
which is well taken that totalitarian governments brainwash people.

434
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.910
And this became a big code word.

435
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:22.911
It was introduced into the American lexicon in 1950 well then we're in the

436
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.130
Korean War.
Our pilots start getting shot down there,

437
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:31.131
put on TV by the Communists saying terrible things about America that American

438
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:35.010
pilots,
and suddenly it was like they've been brainwashed.

439
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:37.380
It was very convenient to have that story.

440
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.000
So these things work part and parcel and you've got all kinds of smart people

441
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:45.840
behind the scenes knowing this,
looking at it,
examining it,

442
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:51.090
and using it to their advantage to stay aware in the pole position.

443
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.020
That's the goal of the u s government.

444
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.600
<v 2>So the propaganda that we did that sort of copied Stallings and we were kind of</v>

445
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:01.620
playing catch up in that sense.

446
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.870
<v 1>I mean,
we're playing catch up,
then we're ahead or behind it.
It's always a,</v>

447
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.610
it's a game.
It's,
I mean,
you're a competitor.
You know this,
if that's okay.

448
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.920
<v 2>Crazy thing to do to make a fake spaceship and just let it slam into the ground</v>

449
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.680
with a bunch of people that you cut up to look like aliens.

450
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.090
Did he say specifically what kind of modifications they made to people that made

451
00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:24.740
them look like aliens?
I got dreads,

452
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.410
<v 1>drill,
read it in those 12 come mom with this 12 pages.</v>

453
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.100
I'm telling you that because you're asking me these questions as if I spent,

454
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:32.701
I mean look,

455
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:36.510
I did spend literally hundreds of hours with a source and we sat there and

456
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:40.620
talked about everything and I would try to squeeze out just like you're trying

457
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:42.150
to squeeze out of me and that's what I'm saying.

458
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:46.110
Read it because I literally tell you everything that there is.

459
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:50.190
I think what's most interesting about the source and why I might come back and

460
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:54.480
talk to you about it and tell you who he is on your show is because,

461
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.490
because of his backstory,
right?
Why he did what he did,

462
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.890
how he wound up in the Manhattan project.

463
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.830
<v 2>Sounds like he was probably Jewish from Germany.
No,
no,
no,</v>

464
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.870
no.
I'm trying.
Okay.
Gotcha.

465
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.970
Morality.
Talk to me how we're talking about morality.

466
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.910
We're talking about why we can't talk about certain things.
While we're,

467
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.670
what you were saying before about being a competitor,

468
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.190
the United States is competitive.
Yeah.
Obviously.

469
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.930
And when you're playing the ultimate game,
which is war,
yes.

470
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.000
You have to be very careful about what you reveal and what you don't reveal.

471
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.190
And this is where the conversation about surprise kill vantage comes in because

472
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.220
the CIA using these covert operations to assassinate people and whether or not

473
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.220
that

474
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.360
<v 3>should be allowed or not allowed,
whether it's good or bad.
Yes.</v>

475
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.920
Whether it's necessary,
whether it's like,

476
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:49.870
if you want people to be safe over here,

477
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.660
there's certain people you got to take out and sometimes you just can't follow

478
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:53.494
the rules.

479
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.950
<v 1>And why?
Why are we not supposed to know about them?
Should we know about that?</v>

480
00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.720
The way the story started for me,
I'm at my house in 2009 a source is,

481
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.900
you know,
calls me up.
He says,
I'm on my way back from the Middle East,

482
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.660
going to pop by the house and say hi.
Um,

483
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.950
he brings me a challenge coin that says Kabul,
Afghanistan State Department.

484
00:30:12.951 --> 00:30:16.970
I'm thinking,
okay,
he is not a diplomat.
I mean,
he's weapons trained.

485
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.750
Um,
at the time my boys were young,

486
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.920
there were lots of Gi joes in the garden and they had little weapons,
right?

487
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.420
And the source is showing them about the weapons and they're like so into it

488
00:30:29.421 --> 00:30:31.520
because they know he's military trained.
And then he says,

489
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.360
if it's okay with your mom and dad,
I'll show you some weapons.
The boys are like,

490
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.170
please.

491
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:41.170
So he sets up the sniper rifle in the living room and I live up in the hills and

492
00:30:41.331 --> 00:30:44.690
you can look across the canyon through this scope.

493
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:49.310
He sat up and I can see the veins on a leaf across the canyon.

494
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:53.990
And I thought,
okay,
so now I know what he was doing in Kabul,
Afghanistan,

495
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.000
he's taking out al Qaeda with this.

496
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.870
There's another case on the ground that he never opens.

497
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.790
And when the boys go off,
I say to him,
what's in there?
And he said,

498
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.480
he opens it up and inside there's a knife and it's saturated.

499
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.780
And I said,
what's that for?
Immediately realizing,
you know,
mine,
I have a ta.

500
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.750
And he says to me,
sometimes the job requires quiet.

501
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:24.250
So why that became interesting to me was because of my own thoughts and

502
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:28.190
perceptions about what he had told me.
In other words,
I could,

503
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.370
I could deal with him with a sniper rifle.
I couldn't be like,
okay,

504
00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:34.520
that's what he does.
But the knife gave me pause.
I was like,

505
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.730
see slitting someone's throat,
is it in the ribs?
And I thought,

506
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:43.270
why is it that I am willing to accept sort of the clinical nature of a,

507
00:31:44.451 --> 00:31:47.060
of a sniper rifle,
but I can't,

508
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.100
I'm uncomfortable with that close up hand to hand killing.

509
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.490
And that led me to surprise kill vanish because that was the motto of the

510
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:01.910
Precursor Agency of the CIA.
It was called the Oss,

511
00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:05.720
the office of strategic services.
Their motto was surprised,

512
00:32:05.721 --> 00:32:10.670
kill vanish because they would jump out of aircraft land,

513
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.930
work with their French partners and kill Nazis with uh,
you know,

514
00:32:14.931 --> 00:32:17.210
a knife to the throat.
And I thought,
okay,

515
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.230
that's considered okay because they were Nazis,
right?
But we can't,

516
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:26.090
we're not supposed to do that anymore in this world.
We live in.
Why?

517
00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:27.140
And I spent the whole,

518
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.800
this whole book researching and reporting is about that sort of conundrum,

519
00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:38.240
if you will,
that moral puzzle,
you know,
why do we,

520
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.103
why do we,

521
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.930
<v 2>yeah.
And who are they willing to do that too?
Where do they draw the line?</v>

522
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.070
Like,

523
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:52.070
I'm sure you're aware of the story of Jamal could Shogi the journalist who was

524
00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:57.270
assassinated by someone or some group of people on that day,

525
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:02.170
he entered into the Turkish embassy and,
um,
they,
they whacked him in,

526
00:33:02.171 --> 00:33:06.750
chopped him up and carried him out in boxes.
And it's,
uh,
an international

527
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.500
is,
well,
it's a huge incident,
right?
Yes.

528
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.040
This supposedly was ordered by,

529
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.040
who was it supposedly to order by the head of Saudi Arabia?

530
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.630
<v 1>Yeah.
Mbs Mohammad bin.
Salmaan.
I mean,</v>

531
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:24.620
that's the idea is that they're head of state wanted him killed because he was a

532
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:28.580
threat because he was a reporter.
Because you're writing some things.
Yeah.

533
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.070
<v 2>Yeah.
And that they,
this is how they did it.</v>

534
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.480
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
and there's,</v>

535
00:33:33.481 --> 00:33:35.910
that's a great question because what you're saying is like,
okay,
so,

536
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.460
but we all think of that as reprehensible.
Right,
right,
right.
Why you know,
cause

537
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.420
<v 2>because he's a journalist and he was on our side,</v>

538
00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:44.400
he's delivering information to people.

539
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:49.700
But the government of Saudi Arabia disagreed there like that information as our

540
00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:53.250
information.
He's a threat by releasing it.
Yes.

541
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.530
He's a threat to our livelihood.

542
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.400
<v 1>Yes.
Yeah.
And who decides who's a threat?</v>

543
00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:01.730
I'm in a lot of this book is about who's on the kill list,
right?

544
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.260
I mean there is an actual killer if there always has been and the euphemisms

545
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.970
involved.
I mean I write history as I said,

546
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:12.380
so Eisenhower called his assassination program.

547
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.160
Health alteration.
I mean literally in the date of classified documents,

548
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.180
hilarious.
Health alterations,
alteration,
a health alteration committee.

549
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.080
Whoa.
Kennedy had an executive action committee.
Right.

550
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.220
That's all it's cleaner.
Right?
Guess what Reagan's was called?

551
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.530
<v 2>Uh,
super Wonderboy power up.</v>

552
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.100
<v 1>I don't know what clothes.
Preemptive neutralization.</v>

553
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.420
Preemptive neutralization.
Wow.
Why do they keep switching the names for it?

554
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.000
They're burying the information.
Right.

555
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.150
And they keep switching around the,

556
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.380
they switch around who has authority to,

557
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.690
you know,
say yes,
let's go ahead and put this guy on the kill list.
I mean,

558
00:34:54.691 --> 00:34:58.350
that was fascinating.
I mean,
I interviewed a guy named John Rizzo,

559
00:34:58.351 --> 00:35:00.960
who is a decades long CIA attorney.

560
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.780
I was stunned that he was willing to talk to me.
Um,

561
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:09.170
and he explained to me how a presidential finding also called a memorandum of

562
00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:15.621
notification works that gives the president the authority to put an individual

563
00:35:18.331 --> 00:35:19.200
on the kill list.

564
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:24.201
That job is then given to the CIA's paramilitary army on operator,

565
00:35:25.201 --> 00:35:30.201
or they're assassins because the CIA works under a code called title 50 of,

566
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.330
so it makes it legal.

567
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.600
Whereas the Defense Department works under what's called title 10.

568
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.880
So in other words,
and they can't,

569
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:42.420
their rules of engagement are totally different.
So the misnomer is like,
oh,

570
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:46.800
the seals killed bin Laden while they were seals trained.

571
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.160
But that was ACI mission.
Mm.

572
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.250
Because Pakistan is a sovereign nation and the military can't kill people in

573
00:35:58.351 --> 00:35:59.730
countries we're not at war with.

574
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.360
So those guys all became essentially CIA operators for the night.

575
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.230
Right.
And if you look at photographs as I have seen,

576
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.680
you'll notice that they have no markings on their outfits so that if the job

577
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.100
went south it'd be like,
I don't know who these guys are.

578
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.510
And if you look back at Vietnam photos of the McAfee SOG teams,

579
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.240
which I also write about in surprise,
kill,

580
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:31.710
vanish cause that's the precursor of that.
You see no markings,
right?

581
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.910
That's that way you can go into,
you can go behind enemy lines,

582
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.200
you can go into Laos.

583
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.680
You know in the Vietnam War you can go now you can go into Pakistan.

584
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.160
What I learned reporting this book is we're in 134 countries doing title 50

585
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:51.930
operations.
Think about that.
Government wants that to be kept secret.

586
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.700
So in all those countries they're doing things that don't fall under the normal

587
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:03.690
leveler of the law.
Not Yes,
not under the rules of engagement of the military,

588
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.720
but the CIA works at the president's behest that that was one thing that really

589
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:12.330
blew my mind to report,
to research,
to understand.

590
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:16.650
I talked to 42 guys who have direct access to this who are in this world,

591
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:17.850
you know,

592
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.530
from the knuckle draggers on the ground as they call themselves to the lawyer at

593
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:26.970
CIA senior intelligence staff.
That's the equivalent of a general at the CIA.

594
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.600
Those guys explaining to me,
Annie,
this is how it works,
you know,

595
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.460
and again to your question,
well why?

596
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.060
Why does someone get to know that and why does the government want,

597
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.270
why are they allow that information out as super interesting.

598
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.780
And I believe that has to do with a certain climate we're in right now about

599
00:37:48.241 --> 00:37:50.520
military might,
right?
In other words,

600
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.310
what the CIA does is called Tershia optio.

601
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.180
It's the third option you've got the first option is diplomacy.

602
00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.220
Second option is war.

603
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.810
So if diplomacy is not working and wars on wise,

604
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.630
you go to the third option,

605
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:11.631
which is the CIA's paramilitary and they're in a hundred and how many countries?

606
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:16.740
134 or if you wonder why the military budgets so big,
that's what it is.

607
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.770
Folks going to feed those folks will work.
I mean,

608
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.020
and you as a competitor would be fascinated by the kind of training they do and

609
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:28.410
what they do.
I mean,
so many of these infiltration techniques are mind boggling.

610
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.170
You know,
they've got halo jumping,
which you know about,

611
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:36.060
right where they see high altitude,
low opening,
so they jump that,

612
00:38:36.061 --> 00:38:38.290
you know,
free fall down terminal velocity,

613
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.220
pull the ripcord really low so they're not detected by radar.

614
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:44.800
And then they meet up with a team on the ground and go do what they do.

615
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.610
And they also have hey ho,
which is high altitude,
high opening.

616
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:54.270
And that way you can fly over airspace where we're allowed and float into let's

617
00:38:57.161 --> 00:39:01.150
say a country like around
and land,

618
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.430
gather your team and do what you have to do.

619
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.770
[inaudible] but like so much of what I report,

620
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:09.130
I get information like that and then I ask a million questions like you've

621
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.550
asking me and it's like,
can't talk about that.
That's classified.

622
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.560
<v 3>Hmm.
You don't,
you,
you're a journalist.</v>

623
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.010
So you're trying not to judge,
but

624
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.620
is it your belief that this is a good thing for America?

625
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.570
<v 1>Meaning math,
that resident having a third option?
Well,</v>

626
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.160
I mean I write in the book that that's in the prologue.

627
00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:39.870
After I tell that story about the source with a knife,
I say I wanted to know.

628
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.550
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

629
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.920
<v 1>and that exact question,
like is this a good thing?</v>

630
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.450
And my answer at the end after it's complex,

631
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.040
not to be vague,
but it is really complex,
is also that,

632
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.540
well,
if you're gonna take that pole position,

633
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.840
you must accept rivalry.
Right.

634
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.500
And also after talk,

635
00:40:07.501 --> 00:40:12.501
do I think it's a good thing after talking to a lot of 20 year old soldiers who

636
00:40:12.511 --> 00:40:17.511
come back from the war theater missing a limb or with intense PTSD and who

637
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.170
essentially serve as cannon fodder,
I would say my opinion,

638
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.850
right?
For the Pentagon,
that's the second option.
Or

639
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.443
<v 4>okay.</v>

640
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.500
<v 1>The 42 guys that I interviewed,
you know,
they're like send me,</v>

641
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.980
they are professional.
They are tier one operators.
They're green berets,

642
00:40:39.981 --> 00:40:44.090
their seals,
their delta.
They retire.
They joined the CIA.
Yeah.

643
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.060
So they're like professionals at what they do and they're saying,

644
00:40:47.061 --> 00:40:49.070
I want someone has to do this job.

645
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.550
We've been doing this since the end of World War II.
I want to do it.

646
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.440
So do I think it's better?
I mean,

647
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:02.710
I think that that concept speaks to

648
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.060
choice,
right?

649
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:10.840
Because I'm not so sure that the 20 year olds know what they're in for and the

650
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:13.990
40 year olds know what they're in for and are willing to do it.

651
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.950
<v 3>So the d will also the difference between a specialized trained individual with</v>

652
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:24.370
a very specific task versus someone who is sort of following orders and at the

653
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:25.210
front of the line.

654
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.370
<v 1>Yeah.
Ryan,
I mean,
and also has a,
you know,</v>

655
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.650
a lot of times I talk to these young kids who go to war and they,
me,

656
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.890
one of the fascinating detail is that they talk about movies that they see and

657
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.060
whether it's saving private Ryan or Black Hawk down even right,

658
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.700
where the outcome is not necessarily great,

659
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.090
but they talk about the Romanticization of war and of Camaraderie and

660
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.880
brotherhood that comes from that.

661
00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:00.170
And then they have their experience and some of that does give them that sense,

662
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.000
but not always.
Whereas the operators are much more about,

663
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.890
um,
you know,
getting the job done.
That's what I was fascinated by.
I mean,

664
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:13.730
these guys are really clear there.
They're competitors.

665
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.240
They're like top tier competitors.
They have a job,
they do it,

666
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:20.450
they get it done and they asked for the next job.

667
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.680
<v 3>So is the oversight when it comes to choosing whether or not this operation</v>

668
00:42:26.801 --> 00:42:27.910
takes place or not,
is it,

669
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.960
do they have moral guidelines?

670
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.510
Do they have ethical or moral guidelines where they say like,

671
00:42:34.511 --> 00:42:39.511
this is the president is requesting that this person did get taken out.

672
00:42:40.301 --> 00:42:44.860
The chiefs of Staff,
whoever it is.
Is that,
I mean,
do they have to make a,
an,

673
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.230
an ethical distinction?

674
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.670
<v 1>You mean,
are they like kill him nicely?
Like don't</v>

675
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.950
<v 3>make it hard.
Do they decide like does this make sense?</v>

676
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.380
Or like what if the president is like Rosie O'donnell,
she had been talking shit,

677
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.010
take her out.
Like,
you know,

678
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.740
<v 1>well,
I mean that's,
you know,
that's a big issue.
But</v>

679
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.850
<v 3>okay.</v>

680
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.850
<v 1>What I try to write in what I try to report in surprise kill vantage is the idea</v>

681
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.150
that the people we take out maybe are bad guys,
right?

682
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:13.700
One one guy write about is Che Guevara.
Okay.

683
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:18.730
Because Jay is often portrayed in the press as you know,

684
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.660
this amazing hero and that he,
and we,
you know,
I don't know if you know,

685
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:30.800
but he was,
he was killed by the Bolivian Rangers,
but it was a CIA operation.

686
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.540
And I interview the man in charge of that operation in surprise call vantage.

687
00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:39.230
His name was Felix Rodriguez.
Okay.
Long serving CIA,
paramilitary officer.

688
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.663
So,

689
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.760
but I also report why the president to your question wanted Che Guevara dead.

690
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.310
You know,

691
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:54.310
he was really advocating for nuclear war and I,

692
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:58.730
and I show that.
Yes.
I mean he spoke publicly about,
you know,

693
00:43:58.731 --> 00:44:01.670
if we have to have an atomic war,
the Cuban,
I'm paraphrasing,

694
00:44:01.671 --> 00:44:05.060
the Cuban people will be happy to have sacrificed themselves for that.

695
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:09.770
I mean Jay was also,
Jay killed anyone who betrayed him,

696
00:44:09.771 --> 00:44:13.700
he killed,
he writes about it in his diaries as I write in the book.
Right.
So,

697
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:17.450
but on the morality question,
who decides?
I don't have that answer,

698
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:20.900
but I will tell you what I did.
I went with my main source Billy Wall,

699
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.630
who uses the 89 now,
and he was,

700
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.950
he's been with the CIA for 60 years.
Okay.
I mean,
he went

701
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:34.340
and he and I went to Cuba for him to do a halo jump with Chegg of son.

702
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:42.110
So we were a guest of the man whose father was killed by the CIA.

703
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.470
Whoa.
Okay.

704
00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.040
And we had this really interesting discussion in the Cigar Club where Che and

705
00:44:51.951 --> 00:44:53.510
Castro,
you know,

706
00:44:53.511 --> 00:44:57.170
smoke cigars and plotted the downfall of the United States.

707
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.790
And that's what I try to give readers a sense of

708
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:07.310
the long lens of history,
how time changes all things,

709
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:12.050
and maybe leave with them them with this idea,

710
00:45:12.051 --> 00:45:14.970
which they can come to their own conclusions about what you asked me of,

711
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:19.800
is it right or is it wrong?
Because really what you might ask is,

712
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:24.740
is it necessary?
Right.
I mean,
I could moralize right,

713
00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:29.490
wrong,
but it would just be my opinion.
But when you see,
uh,
I went,
uh,

714
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.010
Billy Walton,
I also trout traveled to Vietnam because he was supposed to kill,

715
00:45:34.011 --> 00:45:37.970
he was tasked to kill the top commander of the North Vietnamese army,

716
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.200
a guy named general shop.

717
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.000
And while I didn't kill shop and we had this incredibly,

718
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.240
this terrible mission that went awry that I write about in the book,

719
00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:50.930
in the Vietnam War,
so 50 years later wall,

720
00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:55.931
and I go to visit the son of general shop or sitting there and jobs home talking

721
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:58.790
about these same issues.
Right.

722
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.050
And my conclusion of that again is not,

723
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:07.880
is it right or wrong,
but is it necessary?
I mean,
we have these wars,

724
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.270
we keep having these wars isn't necessary.

725
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:12.940
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

726
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.240
<v 1>Yeah.
What do you think?
Well,
I mean,</v>

727
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:22.670
my opinion is that the Defense Department is far too concerned with vast weapon

728
00:46:24.521 --> 00:46:28.170
systems of the future,
which is its mission statement of it's science department.

729
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:33.410
And so you create what some at the Pentagon call a self licking ice cream cone

730
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.340
or the military industrial complex.
And there's a lot built into that.

731
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:40.100
And there's a lot to be said about that.
Yeah.

732
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.710
<v 3>And there's also probably some concerned about other countries getting ahead of</v>

733
00:46:44.711 --> 00:46:48.460
us.
So you have to do what you have to do if your,

734
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.910
if your job is to protect the American people and to keep the military strong.

735
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.450
Yes.

736
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:56.140
You just have to operate with that premise that there's a bunch of other people

737
00:46:56.141 --> 00:46:58.720
out there that are doing the same thing for their country and trying to take

738
00:46:58.721 --> 00:47:02.620
down the United States and we got to stay ahead of the curve and make human

739
00:47:02.621 --> 00:47:04.600
eating robots that can shoot missiles.

740
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:07.340
<v 1>Oh absolutely.
I mean when I was reporting the Pentagon's brain,</v>

741
00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:11.360
which is about Darpa and I was sitting there with scientists who are working on

742
00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:15.950
limb regeneration,
right.
Or Oh right.
Or working.
Yeah.
What do they do?

743
00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:17.930
Oh my God,
they have these little salamanders.

744
00:47:17.931 --> 00:47:22.931
I mean they're showing that salamanders can regenerate their limbs and so human,

745
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.790
their idea,
they're down at UC Irvine,

746
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:28.580
they have this incredible lab and they're funded by Darpa cause that's where the

747
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:29.950
money comes from.
Right.

748
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.990
And their idea is that humans should be able to regenerate their limbs.

749
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:37.750
And you know,
50 years out we'll be doing that.

750
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.570
And they're working on the science for that.

751
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.960
Well that's the same science that allows for cloning.
Right.

752
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.400
And so in our discussions,

753
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:50.080
cause that's how I try to report is like really ask people what they think about

754
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.300
future consequences.
And they said to me your exact question,
which is,

755
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.231
well Annie,

756
00:47:56.231 --> 00:48:00.790
what if one day we wake up and we find out that China has clone the first human

757
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.510
or a dark horse like Saudi Arabia,
you know,

758
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.410
the American people are going to freak out and go,
where the hell was Darpa?

759
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.790
Why aren't we ahead of the curve?

760
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.230
So it's that there's a chicken and the egg problem with that of like,

761
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.830
well we have to stay ahead.
We're,
we're on top.

762
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:21.040
We want to be on call it terrifying.

763
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.620
I mean everything I write about is terrifying.
I was like,

764
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.680
well do you have to take ambien?
I'm more worried of no god,
no.
I'm,

765
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.120
I'm more worried about coming on your show and being asked tough questions than

766
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.030
I am about no using you.
But then I am about,
I mean this stuff is informative,

767
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.060
it's informative and it's a longer conversation.

768
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:43.990
It's why I think what you do with your podcast is awesome because people can

769
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.991
really get into the thinking about things,

770
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.610
right?
They can really,
and they can move away from their own preconceptions,

771
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:55.600
their own biases.

772
00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:59.470
They're bringing into it and they're stopping for a minute and they're going,

773
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.620
what do I really think about that?
And to really think about something,

774
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:07.621
you need information and information can be boring unless it's interestingly

775
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:11.890
presented through conversation,
through,
you know,

776
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.360
uncomfortable conversation,
right?

777
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:17.760
<v 3>Also uncompromised conversation where you don't have a certain time period that</v>

778
00:49:17.761 --> 00:49:21.000
you have to smush something into like a four minute segment on CNN or something.

779
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.340
I mean that's impossible.
It's so difficult.

780
00:49:23.341 --> 00:49:26.700
I see people have these conversations about books or something that are trying

781
00:49:26.701 --> 00:49:31.701
to accomplish x very nuanced subject that they're trying to discuss and you

782
00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:34.840
know,
and there's another person on other sides like that's not true and they're

783
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:36.150
shouting over each other.
I'm like,
boy,

784
00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:39.120
that just the pressure the people have to understand that

785
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.820
people do understand,

786
00:49:41.821 --> 00:49:45.990
but you have to reiterate it and it has to be kind of drilled into your head.

787
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.280
You're,
when you're pressuring someone and you're yelling back and forth,

788
00:49:50.281 --> 00:49:55.020
you're not even gonna get a good version of whatever this person's argument is.

789
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.530
Like you should have the best version I want.

790
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.390
Like if I'm going to have a disagreement with someone,

791
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.900
I want the best version of their,

792
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.010
their point and I want them to get it out is with no pressure.

793
00:50:08.011 --> 00:50:10.770
I want to help them get it out.
I'd like to reiterate it with them.

794
00:50:10.771 --> 00:50:14.610
I like to give them plenty of time.
I want to know how you think.

795
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.690
I want to know what you're thinking about.
I would love to talk to these guys.

796
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.190
I would love loved it.

797
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:24.590
But the thing is like they can't tell you a lot of this is,

798
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:28.310
I mean,
for national security reasons,
there's a lot of reasons,

799
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.000
<v 2>I'm sure if they want to keep their job and stay alive,
they have to,</v>

800
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.650
they have to shut the fuck up.

801
00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:36.860
They can't just talk about what they do and how they do it and how,

802
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.780
and decisions that maybe they made that were uncomfortable with,

803
00:50:39.781 --> 00:50:42.410
they killed somebody that didn't think maybe needed to die.

804
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:47.300
<v 1>Yeah.
But,
but that's the reporter's job or lose my job.</v>

805
00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:51.050
So in other words,
okay,
so I go to visit Billy Ward is home and I knew,

806
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:54.260
I heard stories about,
he's this legendary operator,
right?

807
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:57.320
And he's also what's called a singleton.
So he works alone.

808
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.400
And when I was at the call them the second singleton,
right.
Which is like,

809
00:51:01.401 --> 00:51:04.250
he's got one guy giving him orders.
Whoa.
Right.

810
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:08.660
And he's out there alone all night.
God,
I mean,
Billy Wall is right.
I mean,
back.

811
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.970
Can we back up for a second?
I'm going to give you the story of him.
Okay.

812
00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:13.310
So here's this guy he's in,

813
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.870
he's in Vietnam and he's part of what was called Mac v Sock,
right?

814
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:21.380
And they're doing cross border missions into Laos and it's so dangerous.

815
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:22.200
It's like,
it's,

816
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.200
it's a CIA program that SOG stands for studies and observations group.

817
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.200
Am I supposed to sound like a bunch of guys in Ivy League tower with bow ties?

818
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.890
Right.
But the guys on the ground called it suicide on the ground.

819
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.280
That's how dangerous it was.
Jesus,

820
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.980
100% of the people had casualties.
Right.

821
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:47.810
Billy Wall has nine purple hearts from the work he did.
Nine.
Okay.
I mean,

822
00:51:47.811 --> 00:51:50.510
they get shot,
they bandaged themselves up there.
You know,

823
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:54.080
they're up in an aircraft because they're limping instead of on the ground,

824
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.880
you know,
viewing the missions,
um,
the warrants,

825
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:03.200
everybody's furious with the government,

826
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:08.060
with the military.
There's no room for special operators.
I mean everything,

827
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:10.310
it's called the time of troubles by them.

828
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.410
Billy was working in the post office and he gets this knock,

829
00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:19.850
you know,
and it's like,
he's back in the CIA now in 1977.

830
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:24.620
So he was out for was that it was over in Vietnam.
I mean he was,
he was,
you know,

831
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:25.454
it was over that one

832
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.600
<v 2>working in the post office [inaudible] movie.
It's,
he was working in the right,</v>

833
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.550
I mean,
and she needs you.

834
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.840
<v 1>I mean,
but he said the most incredible thing to me because he said,
I end,</v>

835
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.100
he doesn't ever talk about fear.
And he said there was only one time,

836
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:42.800
my whole life I've ever been afraid.
And that was in the post office.

837
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.960
<v 2>Whoa.
Cause he was getting back into it,</v>

838
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.590
probably like recycled his mind and put himself in a place,

839
00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:49.910
I'm just a civilian now.

840
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.421
<v 1>And he said,</v>

841
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:54.420
I'm at a wind up being one of those old guys drinking beer at the end of the bar

842
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.930
talking about the war.
Right.

843
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200
And instead he gets called up by the CIA and they send him to Libya in 1977 and

844
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:08.771
his cover is that he's training Kadafi paramilitary guys in paramilitary

845
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.600
tactics.
I mean,

846
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:15.710
that's the beginning of his career and it goes on all the way until we were in

847
00:53:15.711 --> 00:53:18.920
Cuba,
I think was an actually some kind of a mission because it was like,

848
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:23.750
what are we doing here in Cuba doing infiltration and exfiltration techniques

849
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:27.660
allegedly with Jaguar Sun.
But in any event,
you know,

850
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.840
when I went to visit Billy Wall the first time he's got this,
you know,

851
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:35.841
he's got Sir certificates and awards and metals all over the walls of his home,

852
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:39.120
but there's one framed

853
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.260
item that I'm looking at and it's a knife.

854
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.100
And there was a seal from the CIA and it says in appreciation to the assassin.

855
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.850
And I said,
Billy,
tell me about that.
And he said,
you know,

856
00:53:56.851 --> 00:54:01.650
I can't talk about that.
So I,
you know,
stayed with them for two years now.

857
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:05.910
I mean,
stayed.
We conversed,
we traveled,
I interviewed him,

858
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.370
you know,
hundreds of hours.

859
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:13.110
And I kept asking him about that award and he kept saying,
you know,

860
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:17.730
I can't talk about that.
But as I write in the book,
he couldn't talk about it,

861
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:21.210
but others did.
So that's how a reporter works.

862
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.670
You get introduced to enough of his friends,

863
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:26.250
enough of the others who are involved,

864
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:31.251
you make sure they're a legitimate source and you begin to find out what he

865
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:34.170
can't talk about.
And that's what I report in the book.

866
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:38.010
And that is very explosive because President Bush,

867
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:41.970
right after nine 11,
created what was called a stalker team.

868
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:47.190
And ironically,
you know,
people have this idea that we've been,
you know,

869
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:51.240
sending a team of assassins around the world,
um,

870
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.980
in NATO partner countries.

871
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.820
And that what I learned had never happened until right after 11 with the soccer

872
00:54:56.821 --> 00:55:01.020
team,
12 men and actually one or two women,

873
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:05.610
the femme fatale and they would go after bad guys.

874
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:10.200
And they adopted the term,
uh,
from the Reagan era.

875
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.370
So it was called preemptive neutralization,
who was,
who were the women?

876
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.460
There's always one woman on the team.

877
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:22.320
That's what I was told by the guy who was in charge of the soccer team.
And well,

878
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.310
I mean,
he,
he gave me this great example.
I don't report it in the book,

879
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:27.720
but I'll tell you right.
He said,

880
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:33.530
so women have a different presentation and this like he told me the story of a

881
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:40.320
woman sitting on a bench,
you know,

882
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:45.480
in embracing a man,
right?
And no one thought anything of it.

883
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:50.630
And it allowed her to spy on someone in a manner that would a man,

884
00:55:53.491 --> 00:55:56.580
what it would have drawn attention and then the soccer team could go.

885
00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:01.610
So what their job would be to is to conduct surveillance of a target and they

886
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:03.330
call it making book.

887
00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:07.050
They have to make book on that individual so they know exactly where the guy is

888
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:12.650
and they're waiting on the president's orders whether or not they should take

889
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:18.220
action.
And you know,
that's where the,
that's where the information stops,
right?

890
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.390
I said,
well then what happens?
Well that's all we can say.
Annie.

891
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:24.010
God must be so excited.
Like to

892
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.960
<v 3>live like that,
like all cloak and dagger gotta be so exciting.</v>

893
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.880
Like it's,
I would take that over a cubicle every day of the week.
I really would.

894
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:38.320
Well,
you might get killed.
Am I dying that damn cubicle to,
okay.

895
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:43.040
<v 1>I think it's why so many of these operators stay in it long term.
Right.</v>

896
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.460
<v 3>Did you ever see the television show,
the showtime show?</v>

897
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:50.150
What the hell's it called with um,
the Fox I'd show called that the,

898
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.970
the homeland?
Yes.
Yes.
Well that's like the whole premise,

899
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:58.180
like she's completely addicted to being in that world

900
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.260
<v 1>adrenaline.
I'm,
yeah,
that's what that is.</v>

901
00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:04.500
Imagine jumping out of an aircraft,

902
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.130
landing in,
you know,
behind enemy lines,

903
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.360
and then your work begins and then you have to get out.
That's why surprise,

904
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.480
kill vanish.
I mean,
yeah,
you got a surprise your way in.

905
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.070
Kill them and then get out.
And if you're getting the frame your knife,

906
00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:22.820
<v 3>we'll give you a plaque,
Jamie.</v>

907
00:57:22.821 --> 00:57:26.780
I'm going to get you a knife and appreciation of the assassins.
You're a killer.

908
00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.390
It's just such a crazy way to live your life.
But you know,

909
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.860
I'll take that over a boring life.
I would take that over.

910
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.370
Boring like everyday of the week.

911
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.660
<v 1>Well,
it's like the pink Floyd line,
you know,
living life of quiet desperation.</v>

912
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.673
I mean,
that just terrible.

913
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:46.790
<v 3>Well,
that's the rose quote that most men live lives of quiet desperation.</v>

914
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.390
It's one of my favorite quotes ever because it's true.
Snapped in that guy.

915
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:51.860
You just,

916
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.390
you're just in this world where you just can't wait to just run away.

917
00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.930
And how do people get stuck there?
How do you think they get stuck there?
Bills.

918
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.810
<v 1>Bells.
Like financial.
Yeah,</v>

919
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.890
<v 3>and commitment.
You have an apartment you have to pay for.
You have a car.</v>

920
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.100
You least,
you have a wife that you have to feed,

921
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.760
you have a child do you have to raise,
you have to,
you have your mortgage,

922
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.050
you have your this,
your that.
And that's where it all comes from.

923
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:19.680
Where do you think opportunity plays into that?
Well,

924
00:58:19.681 --> 00:58:22.950
the opportunity takes place usually when you're young and you don't have any

925
00:58:22.951 --> 00:58:26.310
responsibility though.
That's when you have your options.
Well,

926
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.290
your options are severely limited.

927
00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:32.040
The more you gather responsibilities.

928
00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:33.750
Like if I had to,

929
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:39.380
as a 51 year old father of three married man pays taxes,

930
00:58:40.621 --> 00:58:43.530
has a house and a mortgage and a business and all that jazz.

931
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:48.050
If I had to quit everything now and struggle the way I struggled as a standup

932
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.710
comedian,
it would never work.

933
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:54.570
But the only way I could be this person now is if I took that chance when I was

934
00:58:54.571 --> 00:58:59.571
21 when I was dead broke and had my cars repossessed and all that stuff.

935
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:04.620
That's the only way you,
you ever get where you want to go.

936
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:06.450
You have to,
you have to take a path.

937
00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:11.040
It's dangerous and most people want to take the safe path and the safe path

938
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:16.100
leaves you stuck in quiet desperation almost every time it's hell.

939
00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:22.130
It's hell you're selling insurance or some other shit that you care zero about.

940
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.240
But can people just make that change?
I mean,
yeah,
you can.

941
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.070
I believe that you have to plan it out.

942
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:31.490
The way you can change is you have to put aside enough money to give yourself a

943
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:32.324
window.

944
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.080
And then you have to have a plan and you have to spend all your waking hours

945
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:39.560
outside of whatever shit job you do planning your escape.

946
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.880
And you have to come to the realization very clearly that you fucked up and you

947
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:46.820
got yourself stuck.
So whatever you're doing,

948
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:51.170
you have to do it like your life depends on it.

949
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.550
And whether it is you're trying to be an author and you're gonna,
you're gonna.

950
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.420
If you're gonna try to be an author and you're working eight hours a day,

951
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:02.480
plus commuting,
plus family responsibilities or whatever else you have,

952
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.840
whatever time that you have,
you have to attack.

953
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.360
Like you're trying to save the world.
You're trying to save your life.

954
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:11.690
You don't want to drown that one and a half hours a day that you have to write

955
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.890
God damn,
you better be caffeinated and motivated.
You gotta go,

956
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.460
you gotta get after it and you got to have discipline.
That's,

957
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:20.930
most people don't have those things.

958
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.860
Most people don't understand what it's like to,

959
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:28.030
to really go for something and to know that the consequences of not doing that

960
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:30.140
are horrific.

961
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.350
<v 1>Then you're desperate and you're quiet.</v>

962
01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:37.510
But I do think there is something to be said for fate and circumstance.

963
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.110
Sure.
And I always right.
I mean,

964
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.900
people in these military environments that I write about and in these

965
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:45.640
intelligence,
world environments,

966
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.870
fate and circumstance plays a big part because yeah,

967
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.670
they too can even get complacent,
you know?

968
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.170
But when your life is on the line,
right.

969
01:00:56.530 --> 01:01:01.360
A lot of times they have these experiences where they're like,
I must change.

970
01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:05.470
And that's what I find really interesting.
Yeah.
In people.
Yeah,
sure.

971
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.820
<v 3>Desperation.
Yeah.
The,
um,</v>

972
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:11.840
I think a fate and circumstance or giant fortune is giant and there's no

973
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:14.880
question about it.
Some children get shot and drive bys.
Yeah.
You know,

974
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:19.820
that's just horrible,
horrible.
Lockin unfortunate circumstance was a lot of,

975
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.710
lot of it is fortunate and fate.

976
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.190
<v 1>How about people getting lost?
Right.
I'll tell you.
Okay,</v>

977
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:29.510
so the book that I told you,
I wrote on the psychics phenomenon,

978
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.470
what do you believe about that?
Again,
I'm neutral,
right?

979
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.690
You're not telling me,
I want to hear what you believe.

980
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.580
<v 3>I,
there's a lot of people that are full of shit.
Absolutely.
My God,</v>

981
01:01:39.581 --> 01:01:42.550
all people that are talking about being psychic or full of shit.

982
01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.120
But I do think that there is a strange connection that we have with each other

983
01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.750
that's intangible.

984
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:53.170
And I think that some people have better connections than others.

985
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.060
Just like some people are more intelligent.

986
01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:57.370
Like we were talking before the podcast about Ilan mosque,

987
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.920
and it's painfully aware when you talk to him what a champ you are.

988
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:06.460
He's so fucking smart.
And his brain is,
it just,
it's built different.

989
01:02:06.461 --> 01:02:08.470
Just like some people have defective heart.

990
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:11.290
Some people have a heart like Lance Armstrong.
It's incredible.

991
01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:15.610
Huge of an anomaly.
Some people have giant hands,

992
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.100
big heart.
Literally.
Yes,
he has literally it.
And they don't know whether or not

993
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.940
<v 2>that's from training or steroids and EPO and,</v>

994
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.540
or whether or not it's something he was born with.
They really don't know.
But,
uh,

995
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:31.800
yeah,
he has an unusually sized heart.
I'd usually large.
Um,

996
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.210
but what was my point?
Circumstance getting lost.

997
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.390
Oh,
psychics,
psychics.
That's what it is.
I don't,

998
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.230
I think that most of the people that can tell you the future of full of Shit,

999
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.780
most of the people that are,
I think people get feelings.

1000
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:48.870
I think sometimes you think about someone they call you and I don't know what

1001
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:52.770
that is.
I don't know if that's just complete fortune.

1002
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.200
Like how many times do you thinking about a person when they don't call you?

1003
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:56.370
That's the argument against it.

1004
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.550
But how many times you thinking about that person,
they don't call you,

1005
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:03.720
but they're thinking about you as well.
How many,
I mean,
how,
how often is,

1006
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:05.700
that was star crossed lovers.

1007
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.430
They find each other years later and they tell each other they'd been thinking

1008
01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:11.430
about each other all the time and they can't believe it.
That's that's,

1009
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.020
and when you get that text from someone,

1010
01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:14.790
maybe that's just someone prone to action,

1011
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.710
but maybe there is some sort of a connection,

1012
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.850
some sort of quantum entanglement between you and someone who spent time with or

1013
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:24.180
shared energy with.
It's possible.
It's possible.

1014
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:28.080
But the problem is you have these mediums and psychics and those people are just

1015
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.780
assholes.
And I've,
I have a friend,

1016
01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:35.781
his name is Ben a check and he runs a Los Vegas mentalist show where he shows

1017
01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:39.690
you how he does these tricks.
But he'll tell you absolutely these are,

1018
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:43.380
he's been on the podcast,
she's a brilliant,
brilliant man.
But he'll tell you,

1019
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:47.140
these are tricks.
I'm showing you how I do this.
This,
I mean,

1020
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:51.090
I'm going to tell you that's a trek.
I'm not going to give you the how I do it,

1021
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.940
but I'm going to tell you while I'm doing it,
this is a trick.

1022
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.600
But he's pulling all this information out of people about their past,

1023
01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:02.310
their childhood.
He's guessing people's ages.
He's guessing where they grew up.

1024
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:06.120
I mean,
and it's,
it's all a little sneaky shit.
You know,

1025
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:10.080
it's the way they do.
It's a skill as much as anything.

1026
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:15.060
And so when you see these people that are channelers or you know,
psychics,

1027
01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:18.480
they're telling you about someone in your past and trying to contact you,

1028
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.990
they're con artists almost exclusively.
I mean,

1029
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:27.330
maybe there's like one lady in Tibet that has a broken gene and she could tune

1030
01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:30.840
into the next dimension and pull some,
extract some information from it.

1031
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.760
But in my experience,

1032
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:36.780
the vast majority of those people that I've talked to that claimed to have

1033
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:41.380
psychic ability,
we're also at least partially full of shit there.

1034
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:46.260
They had weird ego problems that were glaring that they didn't notice.

1035
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.071
You know,

1036
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:51.120
like I could see it that this is a gross way to behave and they don't see it.

1037
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.860
Their interpersonal relationships,

1038
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:55.440
the way they communicate with people was like an agent,

1039
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:57.300
like a fake Hollywood person or something.

1040
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:01.200
There's something bull shitty about them and people who lie a lot.

1041
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.850
I think if you lie a lot,
it's very difficult for you to tell what a lie is.

1042
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.290
Oh,
that's interesting.
Yeah.
I think you lose your connection.
I think when you,

1043
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:14.000
when you bullshit,
I think you also bullshit yourself,
man.

1044
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:18.040
I don't think these psychics are a hundred percent honest.
Even with themselves.

1045
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.880
I don't think this like,
I'm gonna fuck this lady over stinks.

1046
01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:24.700
You got to talk to her husband.
Ammo towel or some nonsense,
take her money.

1047
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.630
I think some of them actually believe they're getting information.
You know,

1048
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:32.680
my grandmother used to believe that my grandmother was,
uh,
she was,
uh,

1049
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:38.050
a very eccentric lady and uh,
old Sicilian lady and she would tell you about

1050
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:39.583
<v 1>the</v>

1051
01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:42.400
<v 2>like old Italian ladies all like want to play the lottery.</v>

1052
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:43.900
They all have numbers there.

1053
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:46.330
And she was playing the numbers wasn't even a lottery.

1054
01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:50.440
It was like the organized crime numbers racket.
And she would always say,

1055
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:54.760
I was going to pick this number and I just add up the last minute I changed the

1056
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:58.000
number of what you know at the first one came in and she was so mad,

1057
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.080
but it was always that,

1058
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:03.280
that I had a dream of this and I had a vision of that and it was all visions and

1059
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:07.480
dreams in psychics,
but everything worked out horribly for her.
It always did.

1060
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:10.900
Like if like you were really psychic,
he would have better instincts.

1061
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:13.600
Like this is just this inclination that people have,

1062
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:17.320
that there's something special about their perceptions and that their psychic

1063
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:20.770
and it's always these really wacky people that believe they're psychics.

1064
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.480
In my my experience,

1065
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.750
<v 1>I mean it's you,</v>

1066
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.530
I think you're talking also about what some scientists would call the self

1067
01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:31.800
fulfilling prophecy.
You know that if you believe this,

1068
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:36.600
things happen manifest themselves and you can convince yourself that you believe

1069
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:39.330
this.
But for me,
I'm super interested in

1070
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.020
people who really believe in psychics,
right?
Like that's what,

1071
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:49.410
and the military for example,
and you know the most and talk to Ed Danes,

1072
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.300
you've talked to those guys,
the remote viewing guys,

1073
01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:55.320
I talked to a lot of the scientists who taught the remote viewing and I talked

1074
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:56.940
to a number of remote viewers and for the book,

1075
01:06:56.941 --> 01:07:00.030
but the most interesting of all was the astronaut Ed Mitchell.

1076
01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.090
And he was so,

1077
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.050
so I'm interested in like the psychology behind what are you looking for in
that?

1078
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.080
And I saw that I was doing some research in an archive and I came across a photo

1079
01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:17.430
of what turned out to be Ed Mitchell on the moon reading a piece of paper.

1080
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.460
Okay.
It's this extraordinary image cause you're like,
wait a minute,

1081
01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:24.060
he's on the moon and he's reading a document.
What is that document?

1082
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.440
I found out the document was a map of the moon.
Okay.

1083
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:33.300
Mitchell got lost on the moon and literally pull the map out of like,
okay,

1084
01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:33.700
you've got,
um,

1085
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.260
he was trying to get to a certain crater and they had a very limited amount of

1086
01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:41.970
time right there.
Right.
Okay.
There he is.
Wow.
I mean,
think about that.

1087
01:07:41.971 --> 01:07:45.390
It's like the most advanced technology of the time.

1088
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.240
What an art with the camera.
Tell them where to go.

1089
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.080
<v 2>Different story,
right?
Everybody.
Hey Bro,
this one we have left.</v>

1090
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:57.070
Let's just follow their footprints were the only ones walking.

1091
01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:00.460
What are you stupid?
Turn around.
Look at the ground.
See those things.

1092
01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:04.630
That's where you walked.
Let's go that way.
Jesus Christ.
I'd be so mad at him.

1093
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.650
I'm like,
Bro,
you pulling out a map.
Who wrote that map?
Who's,
who's,

1094
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.090
no one's even been here.
Come on man.

1095
01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.400
<v 1>They have little maps folded up in their,
in their pockets in case they got lost.</v>

1096
01:08:14.401 --> 01:08:17.900
They were on the way to crater and in that crater they were going to find

1097
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:22.010
allegedly rocks that we're going to solve the mystery of the moon's creation,

1098
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:26.060
the origin story,
right?
So they had like all this pressure,
they couldn't find it.

1099
01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:28.790
The heart rate's up,
the guy's a Houston are like,
you've got to turn back.

1100
01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:32.030
Your heart rate's going crazy and think about it.
Mitchell tells me,

1101
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:33.620
I went to interview him at his house when,

1102
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:35.480
I think it was his last interview before he died,

1103
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:40.930
and he said there we had gotten 240,000 miles to only to get lost.

1104
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.580
They missed the crater by like,
you know,
900 feet or something.

1105
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:50.930
Never got to it.
He was devastated.
And on the way back from the moon,
he has this,

1106
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.640
what he told me was a psychic change,
right?
He is.

1107
01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.820
His consciousness flipped and he became convinced that psychic powers were real.

1108
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.950
And that is really the beginning of his foray.
I mean,

1109
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:11.570
Mitchell became a huge proponent of psychic warfare of,

1110
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:12.800
you know,
the,
the,

1111
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.850
the idea behind what you're talking about that we spoke of as being sort of

1112
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:21.280
Charlatan Ism and he dedicated the rest of his life to it.
And he was ridiculed.

1113
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.760
He was rude.
Yes.
Aliens as well.

1114
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:30.650
And I think that comes in contact with aliens and,
and that comes from like,

1115
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.810
he was so vilified by the scientists and by the astronauts and by the kind of

1116
01:09:35.811 --> 01:09:37.640
military men,
because this was just,

1117
01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.150
he told me this story of when they were in quarantine,

1118
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:45.470
after they came back from the moon,
right.
He and shepherd were sitting there,

1119
01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.980
you know,
eating breakfast,
waiting and shepherd the stories.

1120
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:53.000
A story broke that Mitchell had done some ESP experiments on the way back from

1121
01:09:53.001 --> 01:09:57.410
the moon.
And Shepherds said to him like,
look at this nonsense.

1122
01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:01.760
The newspapers will do anything to sell,
make a buck.
And Mitchell said,

1123
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:05.150
I did that,
I actually did that and what experiments he,

1124
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:07.910
so he was doing ESP experiments on the way back from the moon.

1125
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.340
He had a psychic in Chicago,

1126
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.510
a Swedish psychic that he was sending messages to.

1127
01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:19.511
Like it was an old Swedish man named Olaf,

1128
01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.090
right?
Yeah.

1129
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.450
It's my psychic clothes off.
No,

1130
01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:30.440
I'll introduce you to Olaf.
Um,
the movie frozen.

1131
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:35.950
I didn't see that one.
The little snowman.
Oh,
you're,
you've got younger kids.

1132
01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:39.950
Yeah,
I missed that one.
Mine are older anyway.
Sorry.

1133
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.260
So Ed Mitchell was talking to this hot chick in the huddled man and uh,
and,

1134
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:47.180
and,
and the story broke because the,
the,

1135
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.300
the Swedish psychic could not resist telling,
you know,

1136
01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:53.330
leaking to the press that he had done these experiments,

1137
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.220
experiments where they're,
well,

1138
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:59.300
psychics train on these little cards called Zener cards,
right?

1139
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.710
So like you have a different symbols on them and you know,
one,

1140
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:07.730
one person,
that's how they decide whether or not they're being psychic.

1141
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:12.710
Like there would be a veil between us and I would say,
what are you seeing?
Right.

1142
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:15.540
And you would call it out.
So it's like a control system.

1143
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:20.130
And Mitchell had these items with him on the way to the moon and did these

1144
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:25.131
experiments to try to see whether you could have a psychic connection with

1145
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.890
someone back on earth.
I mean,
he,
that was,
you know,

1146
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:33.870
did it work well?
No.
And he took notes and he showed me the notes.

1147
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:37.470
It was so wild to be at his house in Florida and he pulls out this old spiral

1148
01:11:37.471 --> 01:11:41.070
notebook with like water stains on it that actually went to the moon.

1149
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:46.380
I was like,
wow,
this is really something else.
I mean,

1150
01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:51.060
it was one of those moments in time where you're just like,
I dunno,

1151
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.170
there was a feel,

1152
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.200
there was a feeling of sadness around all of it with Ed Mitchell sitting there

1153
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:01.390
in his,
um,
you know,
his chair and,
uh,

1154
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:06.120
talking to me about what it was like to be an Apollo astronaut on the walls.

1155
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.590
I'm not with a lot of these sources with like incredible amounts of awards on

1156
01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:12.810
the walls,
but what does that mean after time passes?

1157
01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:17.410
<v 3>Right.
So his experiments didn't work,
but he still believed in psychic powers.</v>

1158
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:22.220
<v 1>Yes.
I mean,
and that's,
and he,
okay,
so what we were saying,
he was ridiculed,</v>

1159
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.080
you know,
and he had such a tough time with it.

1160
01:12:24.081 --> 01:12:28.370
And so the people who propped him up and the people who gave him a lot of

1161
01:12:28.371 --> 01:12:33.371
encouragement had sort of more radical ideas as he grew older.

1162
01:12:35.931 --> 01:12:37.370
And I think they will,
you know,

1163
01:12:37.371 --> 01:12:40.970
conspiracy theorist who really kind of used him because he was an Apollo

1164
01:12:40.971 --> 01:12:45.971
astronaut and so he was so much more famous than any of them would ever be.

1165
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.130
And they really took advantage of him I think.

1166
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.210
<v 3>So you think they manipulated him with information and tried to get him more and</v>

1167
01:12:53.211 --> 01:12:56.900
more enthusiastic about their,
I mean,
it's speculation on my part,

1168
01:12:56.901 --> 01:12:59.660
but you kind of go where the love is.
Right.
It was an older guy too,

1169
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:02.990
and I seen some interviews with him,
uh,

1170
01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:08.320
as he was getting older and older and he seemed to be having some difficulties,

1171
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.620
like thinking about things clearly and people take advantage of that.
Yeah,

1172
01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:17.510
he was really obsessed with extra terrestrial life was really interesting

1173
01:13:17.511 --> 01:13:22.130
because didn't he claimed that he had seen something while he was a up in space?

1174
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.670
<v 1>I think people helped him make that claim.
That was my understanding of it,</v>

1175
01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:33.440
of reporting and I mean I stayed away from some of the crazier a speculative

1176
01:13:33.441 --> 01:13:36.440
things about him because what I was really interested in when I was writing that

1177
01:13:36.441 --> 01:13:41.441
book was how his Authority and power allowed the program to get funding.

1178
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:46.580
Right.
Because so much of this is,
it's like who's funding this stuff and why?

1179
01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:52.100
And it really does come down to authority,
which is always,

1180
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.980
which is always a narrative that I find fascinating.
Right.

1181
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.010
How do people get the authority to say,

1182
01:13:58.011 --> 01:14:01.400
go on these programs or you know,
we should do that.

1183
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:06.230
I mean the question you asked of like how does who's in charge?

1184
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:09.260
Right,
right.
And in all of this,

1185
01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:13.300
what I learned more than anything is that the office of the president has a lot

1186
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:16.930
more power than I think any of us are aware.

1187
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:19.880
<v 3>Oh,
I'm sure.
What did you find anything about Ed Mitchell?</v>

1188
01:14:19.881 --> 01:14:24.881
Did he say anything about 'em see if he said anything about seeing a Ufo or

1189
01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:29.480
seeing extra terrestrial life.
But the problem is if he believes that boy,

1190
01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.120
you know,
if,

1191
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.970
if he was talked into saying that you've gotta wonder about a lot of the other

1192
01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.660
things that he said as well.
The other thing is as these guys get older,

1193
01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.570
that becomes their career.

1194
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.580
The career becomes discussing their experiences and the more outrageous those

1195
01:14:46.581 --> 01:14:49.370
experiences are,
the better the career is.
It's,

1196
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.680
it's absolutely changed their stories.
You know,

1197
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.240
Michael Collins changed his story,
his story when he just got back from the moon,

1198
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:58.310
excuse me.
When you just got back from the moon,

1199
01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.480
his story was that they couldn't see any stars.
But then as he got older,

1200
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:07.010
he wrote in depth in his book and I think it was in the 90s you know,

1201
01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:11.300
decades later and how vivid the stars were and how incredible it was out there

1202
01:15:11.301 --> 01:15:12.200
with no atmosphere.

1203
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:16.400
But there's a press conference when he came back from the moon right after the

1204
01:15:16.401 --> 01:15:20.960
Apollo 11 moon launch he was talking about he couldn't see any stars.

1205
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:25.220
So everybody's like,
well,
what,
what is it?
Did you know?
They,
there's,

1206
01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.310
they get lost,
right?
They're older.

1207
01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.910
It's been so many years since whatever they did when they were working with
NASA.

1208
01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.700
And really it becomes,

1209
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:38.060
that's their focal point of attention.
Like what the,

1210
01:15:38.061 --> 01:15:41.930
where they get their attention from and where they make their career is from

1211
01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:46.010
their attention.
And so they start telling these inconsistent stories.

1212
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.050
<v 1>I mean,
one of the great perils of,
you know,</v>

1213
01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:53.290
living on your laurels is exactly that.
And it's why,

1214
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:56.470
I mean like a guy like Billy Wall,
I was so intrigued by that.

1215
01:15:56.471 --> 01:16:01.471
He was constantly reinventing his own role within the CIA as he talked to me

1216
01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:08.840
about at length because he never wanted to just become one of those has been

1217
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:13.750
right.
So his cover later became just another old man,

1218
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.210
which is like super interesting.

1219
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:21.211
Like he was in Sudan in the 90s and he actually took the first reconnaissance

1220
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:26.080
photographs of Osama bin Ladin before bin Laden was on anybody's radar except

1221
01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:30.340
for the CIS and his,
I mean,
how do you run,
he said to me,

1222
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.110
how do you run around Sudan?

1223
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:36.670
Which is a country made up of like really tall black Dinka tribesman.

1224
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:41.530
If you're a five foot eight old white guy,
the 72,
you know,

1225
01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:46.780
supposed to get reconnaissance photographs of bin Laden,
right.
Wear golf shirts.

1226
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:49.510
You know,
even though I have a photograph him,
he wore like,

1227
01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:54.200
you know those socks like that go all the way up to your mission dork.
Yeah.

1228
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:58.360
Yes.
And little shorts and a sweatband over his head.
And he said,

1229
01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:03.190
my cover was that I was an old man on a fitness craze and there is running

1230
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:07.630
around Sudan.
I mean there's no sidewalks.
Right.
And he's just jogging away.

1231
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.980
And he said bin Laden's used to

1232
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.140
<v 0>come after him and so he would have to run with a lead pipe.
Wow.</v>

1233
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.200
Lack the dogs on the nose.
And he said they stopped coming after me.
Wow.

1234
01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.473
Jesus.

1235
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:26.280
<v 5>I can't find any evidence that he says that he saw aliens,</v>

1236
01:17:26.281 --> 01:17:27.114
but there's,

1237
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.600
I'm seeing different reports that based off of his conversations with lots of

1238
01:17:30.601 --> 01:17:31.081
different people,

1239
01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:35.190
he believes that aliens at some point visited earth and that it's being covered

1240
01:17:35.191 --> 01:17:36.024
up.

1241
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.070
<v 0>Don,
Don.
Um,
I mean that's an easy narrative.
Sure.
Yeah,</v>

1242
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:46.260
sure.
Yeah.
And I mean,
how much did they tell Ed Mitchell to say,
hey,

1243
01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:48.270
thanks for going to the moon?
Well look,

1244
01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.340
one of the most interesting things about reporting this is what?

1245
01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:56.130
That you find out these people that you think have access to all the

1246
01:17:56.131 --> 01:18:00.750
information,
right?
Only know their piece of the Pie.

1247
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:03.450
How much do they Trump knows?
Do you think they keep stuff from him?

1248
01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.370
Cause I would say like he's kind of a loose cannon.

1249
01:18:05.371 --> 01:18:09.660
I wouldn't tell him about the alien.
I mean,
hi everybody.

1250
01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.930
I often wonder that like,
can the president be like,

1251
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:17.130
I demand to know about them and then can they say no sir?

1252
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.140
Or are they say as I write in one of my other books,

1253
01:18:19.141 --> 01:18:22.650
it's like you don't want to know about that because you don't want to have to

1254
01:18:22.651 --> 01:18:25.470
lie.
Well that's nonsense.
I definitely want to,
I would want to know.

1255
01:18:25.471 --> 01:18:27.450
And that'd be the only reason to become president.

1256
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.400
<v 2>You'd have to figure out why you have to lie.</v>

1257
01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.760
Like whether or not if you have to lie,
make sense to you.
Right?

1258
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:37.740
Like there's some things that you know,
that were done,
like,

1259
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.480
uh,
the Tuskegee syphilis experiment where you go,
what the fuck are you doing?

1260
01:18:42.481 --> 01:18:46.530
Like,
no,
you can't do that.
But then there's some things you go,
oh,

1261
01:18:46.531 --> 01:18:50.370
I see why you had to do that.
Yes.
You know,
so it would have to be like,

1262
01:18:50.371 --> 01:18:52.050
which one of those things is it,

1263
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:55.890
is it one of those things where it makes sense where you had to go and

1264
01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.700
assassinate someone who was plotting some sort of a nuclear attack on Chicago?

1265
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:05.060
Or is it some nefarious plot to turn down syndrome children into surgically

1266
01:19:07.891 --> 01:19:10.620
constructed fake aliens and crashing into the earth?

1267
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:13.520
<v 0>And the curiosity factor would be outrageous.
I mean,</v>

1268
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:17.040
can you imagine being the president and saying,
I want to know about,
you know,

1269
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:21.260
JFK and they're like,
sir,
you don't want to know,
right.
Then you would go,
well,

1270
01:19:21.261 --> 01:19:23.510
of course I want to know now.
I really want to know.
I mean,

1271
01:19:23.511 --> 01:19:27.230
that happens to me as a reporter all the time when I can't talk about that.

1272
01:19:27.231 --> 01:19:31.010
That just becomes the obsession.
It's like I want to know about that.

1273
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.830
<v 2>Yeah,
I,
that's the first thing I'd want to know.</v>

1274
01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:37.640
I'd almost run for president to learn about aliens and more.
Come on,
Bruh,

1275
01:19:37.641 --> 01:19:41.510
but then if I found out there was nothing,
I be like,
well,
fuck this job.
I quit.

1276
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.490
I don't want it.
I don't want to run the world.

1277
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:44.870
I just want to find out about the aliens

1278
01:19:45.210 --> 01:19:47.070
<v 0>and then there's all these things that you find out.</v>

1279
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:50.070
Jamie and I were talking about that before.
It's like,
you know,

1280
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.200
Jamie was obsessed.
Well,

1281
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.080
he's obsessed with a Chicago know Ohio Rather Columbus,
and we were,
well,

1282
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.700
we were talking about Nazis,
right?
Yeah.
I mean,

1283
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:04.260
I wrote a book about Operation Paperclip and my God,
talk about a rabbit's hole.

1284
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:05.760
Know Rabbit Hole.
It's a rabbit hole.

1285
01:20:05.761 --> 01:20:07.980
Let's explain to people that don't know what we're talking

1286
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.360
<v 2>about.
Operation paperclip was when after World War II,</v>

1287
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:17.190
the United States gathered up a ton of scientists from Nazi Germany,

1288
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:21.000
brought them over to America and even Warner von Braun,

1289
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.810
they had Wernher von Braun run NASA.
He was a Nazi,

1290
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.800
like a hundred percent Nazi.
Good friends with Hitler type Nazi.
Yes,
he was.

1291
01:20:28.801 --> 01:20:33.801
He ran a Berlin rocket factory where they hung the five slow as Jews.

1292
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:38.640
They would hang them out front so everybody would know like this is what happens

1293
01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:40.410
when you work slow.
We'll hang you.

1294
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.550
I mean the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun was alive

1295
01:20:44.551 --> 01:20:48.030
today,
they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.
Yes,
they would.

1296
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.190
And that was the head of Nancy.
That was the head of NASA.

1297
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.640
That was the guy who got us to the moon.
That was the big cheese guy.
Yeah.

1298
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.120
So we were willing to put a lot of really dark things aside in northern to

1299
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:03.270
gather up the best scientists or the Soviet Union couldn't get them all.

1300
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.890
And they've got a few of them as well.
But we got how many?
More than a thousand.

1301
01:21:07.891 --> 01:21:08.400
Right?

1302
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.670
<v 1>Allegedly a 1400 but I would not be surprised if you know</v>

1303
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:15.720
the story changes and there were more.
Right.
Yeah.

1304
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:19.830
But that goes back to our discussion earlier about being in pole position.

1305
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:23.280
I mean,
that's why we grab those Nazis.
We were like,
if we don't get them,

1306
01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:24.190
the Russians right.
It,

1307
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.520
<v 2>I get it.
And you know,
and I'm sure the Nazis could say I didn't want to do it.</v>

1308
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:32.580
They made me,
I'm a nice person.
I love Jews.
Yeah.

1309
01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:36.240
<v 1>Well that was part of the mythology was like,
we got the good Germans.
Well,</v>

1310
01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:39.150
no we didn't.
We got the,
we got the top Germans.

1311
01:21:39.151 --> 01:21:42.810
And who do you think the top Germans were?
Yeah.
They were coveted by Hitler.

1312
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:47.730
Himmler goring,
you know?
Yeah.
I mean these guys were uh,

1313
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.631
right.
I mean,

1314
01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:53.631
there were guys that we grabbed out of the docs at Nuremberg literally to come

1315
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:57.330
be part of our program.
You know,
one of these got mark.

1316
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.850
<v 2>You're an asset,
right?
I mean,
that's what Genghis Khan used to do.</v>

1317
01:21:59.851 --> 01:22:03.240
He'd take warlords from the other side and capture,
I'm going,
listen,

1318
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:08.440
just come over here,
bro.
Come on work for me.
I'm the man.
I mean,
what,

1319
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.380
you know,

1320
01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:14.240
<v 1>ideology aside,
I'm super smart and I want that to be known.
That's kind of,</v>

1321
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:17.000
that's,
that's the competitor,
right?
I mean you can't,

1322
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:22.240
you cannot be the best rocket designer in the world and not want those talents,

1323
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:26.690
you know,
demonstrated that's worn around Brown story.

1324
01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:28.160
That's the story of all of them.
And that was,

1325
01:22:28.161 --> 01:22:32.900
it was so shocking writing that book because it's a,
it's like wow,

1326
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:34.790
you know,
huge amounts of talent,

1327
01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:40.210
but how far will the competitor go to see their baby come to fruition?

1328
01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:43.220
What are they willing to put aside?

1329
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:44.263
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1330
01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.360
Did you pay any attention to the other places were Nazis went when they escaped

1331
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.830
Germany?
Like a Argentine in particular.
Have you ever seen any of that stuff?

1332
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:57.770
All they have entire German towns down in Argentina,
right?

1333
01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.330
They do Oktoberfest down there.
They were leader hose in.
They,

1334
01:23:01.331 --> 01:23:05.650
they drink out of Stein's.
It's crazy.
They speak German and you're like,

1335
01:23:05.651 --> 01:23:06.970
what the fuck is this?

1336
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:11.350
Like my friend Tim Kennedy went down there and he said he was literally talking

1337
01:23:11.351 --> 01:23:11.681
to people,

1338
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:16.480
interviewing people and they had photos of SS soldiers on their wall and they

1339
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:21.270
would talk about how grandfather was a hero and like,
like you are,

1340
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:24.310
you're the descendants of escaped Nazis.

1341
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:26.470
And they put together a town down there.

1342
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.750
<v 1>I mean,
the way the Nazis were able to flee is X.</v>

1343
01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:34.690
I can't read enough of that.
I mean,
that's what Jamie and I were talking about.

1344
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:39.250
It's like,
oh my God.
And it's endless.
I mean,
there are,
so,

1345
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.450
you know,
the ones that we,
there was a famous guy that we got,

1346
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.730
he was the surgeon general of the Third Reich.
I mean,
think about that.
Okay.

1347
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:52.120
Dr. Walter Schreiber,
I mean,
he was such a bad dude.

1348
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.840
He was in charge of the vaccine program.
I mean,

1349
01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:59.070
you just put those words together in your mind goes really dark.
Right.

1350
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.330
But we wanted him because he was an expert in vaccines and we brought him to the

1351
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.140
United States.

1352
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:09.780
He was the only Nazi I found of the ones that paperclip signed to his sister who

1353
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:14.440
came here,
that,
that was actually outed.
Right.
He was outed as a Nazi.

1354
01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:17.250
And that's because one of the,
um,

1355
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:21.890
investigators at the Nuremberg trials recognized him.
Oh,
juice.

1356
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.070
And we,
he's the only one we,
we got out of here and guess where he went,

1357
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:30.460
Argentina and lived out the rest of his life there.

1358
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.470
<v 2>Ah,
the,
the show was called finding Hitler there.</v>

1359
01:24:34.471 --> 01:24:36.800
They were trying to find evidence and Hitler somehow escaped.

1360
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:38.780
It was really a bullshit premise of the show.

1361
01:24:38.781 --> 01:24:43.781
But what was interesting is that there were thousands and thousands of Nazis

1362
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:48.170
that made it to Argentina and set up shop throughout South America.

1363
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.460
It's a lot of Germans down there.
It's kind of weird

1364
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:55.480
<v 1>if you can imagine me on book tour of like the kind of questions I get because</v>

1365
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:59.890
we're talking about right.
Having written books about area 51 Nazis,

1366
01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:04.480
assassins.
I mean,
he's still alive.
I mean,
just last night I was at a,
at a,
um,

1367
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.380
a book giving you the signing and people were like,
is Hitler really dead?

1368
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.860
You know,
are the,
I mean that right.
If he was alive,
he'd be the oldest man alive.

1369
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:15.400
Right?
Imagine he was probably like,
how old was he during World War II?

1370
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:19.600
He had to be in his forties,
right?
Be Hundreds,
you know?
I mean,
I know and but,

1371
01:25:19.601 --> 01:25:23.860
right.
Or they say he cloned himself.
[inaudible] six years old.
Yeah.
120.

1372
01:25:23.861 --> 01:25:26.730
Now it does what it means.
89.
Oh Geez.
Jamie knows

1373
01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.580
<v 2>that's an old band.
I mean,
there's been 120 year old people,</v>

1374
01:25:29.581 --> 01:25:33.390
but it's fucking pretty rare.
Yeah.
Um,

1375
01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:36.650
so operation paperclip was,
um,

1376
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:41.430
not even publicly acknowledged until,
what was it like the nineties?

1377
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:44.560
Like when did they,
when did it become public?

1378
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.680
I think it was through the freedom of information there.
It

1379
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.530
<v 1>wasn't,
it was this very intrepid journalists name and Linda Hunt Hill.</v>

1380
01:25:50.531 --> 01:25:54.460
Shout out to Linda.
Yeah.
I mean she,
but you know,
she broke the story.

1381
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:55.630
That's what's amazing.
I mean,

1382
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:59.540
as a journalist you're always riding on the shoulders of those before you.
Right.

1383
01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:04.280
And she had it really hard because she did a freedom information act requests,

1384
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:08.960
got all these documents that no one had ever seen.

1385
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:13.400
And then the government sent her a bill for $125,000,

1386
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.690
and she had to spend a lot of time,
this is what,
this is what I understand.

1387
01:26:17.691 --> 01:26:22.580
I never interviewed her,
but for xeroxing fees,
what?

1388
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.620
I just love that detail because it's like,

1389
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:28.850
it's such a covert way of getting someone to stop.
It's like,
okay,

1390
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:31.490
here's the information.
We had to give it to you.
But now here's your bill.

1391
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.140
Imagine if the government's coming down on you for 125 grand.

1392
01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:38.380
<v 2>Yeah.
See you're uncomfortable.
You want to call a bunch of rich people and go,</v>

1393
01:26:38.381 --> 01:26:40.420
hey,
let's all just donate $1,000

1394
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.400
<v 1>and it's a different world.
Now.
You could do that.</v>

1395
01:26:43.401 --> 01:26:46.550
You could do a go fund me campaign.
Oh my God.

1396
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:49.190
In the eighties and the nineties you were just like out on a limb.

1397
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.730
<v 2>Yeah.
They would crush you if financially.</v>

1398
01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.390
We actually had this very same discussion yesterday with my friend Phil Demars

1399
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:59.750
was being sued by marine land and because of he was a walrus trainer and trained

1400
01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:05.220
Orkos and he's showing how horrific it wasn't blackfish.
That's seaworld.
Yeah,

1401
01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.540
seaworld is actually the way he says.
It's a day in the park compared to marina.

1402
01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:13.950
I'm relaxed or horrific place in Canada.
Um,
and anyway,

1403
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:19.100
they have been trying to squash him with legal beats by dragging out his legal

1404
01:27:19.351 --> 01:27:21.780
fees by dragging down his case.
But he,

1405
01:27:22.050 --> 01:27:27.050
we set up GoFundMe's and all his legal bills get paid for from people that want

1406
01:27:27.571 --> 01:27:30.750
him to win the good fight.
And this is a,
as,

1407
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:34.950
this is an option today that wasn't available to Linda when she was exposing

1408
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.800
this $25,000.

1409
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:40.200
Do you assholes like you,

1410
01:27:40.201 --> 01:27:44.370
she should sue them for misappropriation of funds.

1411
01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:48.630
Like does it cost you really $125,000 a print those things out of it does,

1412
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:50.190
you guys should be in jail.

1413
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:54.840
Like that's like with like those $10,000 hammers that they have and the
Pentagon.

1414
01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:56.220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1415
01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.460
So she gets all this information and does the government immediately

1416
01:28:01.891 --> 01:28:03.980
acknowledged that the important thing is Nazis?
Yeah,

1417
01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:08.190
<v 1>no,
I mean,
she wrote the first book and it was just stunning.
And,
and you know,</v>

1418
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.730
what year was this?
Uh,
late eighties,
early nineties.
Okay.

1419
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:14.010
And you know,

1420
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.150
then more gets revealed because they gave her a certain amount.
I mean,

1421
01:28:18.151 --> 01:28:22.430
I filed a bunch of foyas.
There was releases.
I went to Germany for you,

1422
01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:24.270
meaning for you to freedom of Information Act.
Yes.

1423
01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:28.550
Then I went to Germany and looked in their archives with like a fellow,
um,

1424
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.980
a German phd who had,
you know,

1425
01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:36.030
real access to stuff and was able to translate for me while we were there

1426
01:28:36.031 --> 01:28:36.864
looking at this stuff.

1427
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.960
I interviewed a lot of grandchildren of Nazis and children of Nazis and you

1428
01:28:42.991 --> 01:28:46.020
know,
I mean this one extraordinary,
oh my God,

1429
01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:51.420
there's a guy I told you about Shriver,
right?
I'm,
I'm on the narrative level.

1430
01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:55.680
Humans acting.
I'm so interested in rivalry and competition,
right.

1431
01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.160
As a concept because this is what America does to be the best and also as

1432
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:04.410
humans,
right?
Because people are like that.
They're built like that.

1433
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:09.600
So the Nazis had rivals amongst themselves and Schreiber's rival was doctor

1434
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:13.830
Blumm who is in charge of the biological weapons program for Hitler.
Okay.

1435
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:19.320
And Bloom had a son and Bluhm was prosecuted at Nuremberg.

1436
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:24.240
You can see a picture of him with a big dueling scar.
You know,
he was a bad dude.

1437
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:28.650
He was dueling scar,
dueling scar,
a sword,
sword fighting.

1438
01:29:28.651 --> 01:29:31.500
It was like among the Nazis,
they would,

1439
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:35.490
they would well with one another when they were younger students and then they

1440
01:29:35.491 --> 01:29:40.491
would pack the wound with horse hair to make it even more pronounced because it

1441
01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:46.090
looked ferocious.
Really.

1442
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:49.090
Pull up Jamie,
pull up Buh [inaudible].

1443
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:55.330
<v 0>What's his name?
Well,
you can pull up doctor Blumm.
B O l m e but also,</v>

1444
01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:56.443
yeah,

1445
01:29:57.550 --> 01:30:01.300
and also you can pull it if you pull up Kurt Day Boosie who was the director of

1446
01:30:01.301 --> 01:30:04.980
our JFK center,
he was parked,
he was [inaudible],
um,

1447
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.380
von Brown's number two.
He had a huge dueling scar.

1448
01:30:08.381 --> 01:30:12.100
And yet when you look at there he is right there knowing what we know now it's

1449
01:30:12.101 --> 01:30:15.610
like,
come on,
you're trying to tell me that guy is not a hardcore naughty.

1450
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:19.540
So those guys are dueling scars on their face.
You see him?

1451
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:24.970
How often the duel,
well,
when they were in college death?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1452
01:30:24.971 --> 01:30:29.150
It was like on guard,
you know,
and then they wouldn't sing fencing.
Fencing.
Oh,

1453
01:30:29.151 --> 01:30:33.070
this guy,
how to to,
yeah,
get poked in the eyes.
Oh,

1454
01:30:33.190 --> 01:30:36.190
I guess that was the gentleman's rules.
How do you fuck listen,

1455
01:30:36.191 --> 01:30:39.730
you go on for the cheek,
you hit the,
I like,
that's happens all the time.
I mean,

1456
01:30:39.731 --> 01:30:41.140
there must have cut a lot of eyeballs out.

1457
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:44.050
I haven't seen any photographs of missing eyeballs,

1458
01:30:44.051 --> 01:30:46.690
but there's a lot right on the cheek.
So maybe that was the whole point.

1459
01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:51.610
It was actually just a bit for show.
Oh right.
Her weird.
But,

1460
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.790
but it was a,
it was a badge of honor.
Yeah.
There's more.
And,
and,

1461
01:30:56.090 --> 01:31:00.760
but they all had on their face.
It's almost same spot doing scars.
Yeah.

1462
01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:05.320
Wow.
So imagine like wanted to have these scars.

1463
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:10.660
That was a Jesus Christ.
Oh,
they had goggles on.
Oh,
there you go.

1464
01:31:10.661 --> 01:31:13.030
That's how they didn't take out the eyeballs.
DEMEC fencing.

1465
01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:17.140
It says academic fencing.
So what they're essentially doing,

1466
01:31:17.141 --> 01:31:21.640
they were having fencing matches with real swords,
not with ones with tips.

1467
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:26.980
Okay.
Wow.
And cutting their faces up.
Fuck man.
Oh Jesus,

1468
01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:31.840
look at this guy's face.
Yeah.
Hikes.
Wow.

1469
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:35.920
Doing cots colts.
That is crazy.

1470
01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:40.480
So when you consider like that people,
people did not know about that.

1471
01:31:40.481 --> 01:31:42.700
And then you've got these Germans walking around American.

1472
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.680
<v 1>Okay.
As part of our space program and our science programs and Oh,</v>

1473
01:31:46.681 --> 01:31:49.560
these are the good Germans.
I mean,
now you really have to say to yourself,

1474
01:31:49.561 --> 01:31:53.280
come on guys.
I mean Ryan and scars on their face.

1475
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:55.423
Woo.

1476
01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.000
<v 0>That's dark.
Who'd you fight?
Club?
Yeah.
Right.
Old Jeep off I</v>

1477
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:04.360
<v 2>super Oj.
Yeah.
God,</v>

1478
01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:06.130
that's crazy.
Wow.

1479
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.880
<v 1>So I go to interview,
um.
Dot.
Sometimes you as a journalist,</v>

1480
01:32:10.881 --> 01:32:15.320
you can get amazing information from scars.
Oh my God.

1481
01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.240
They're sliced up.
See European martial arts.

1482
01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:24.430
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
I mean that is a martial art.</v>

1483
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:28.930
It's an art of war.
Really.
A sword fighting is a martial art.
I mean,

1484
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:30.340
many martial arts have weapons.

1485
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:35.070
<v 1>Sorry.
So you've got to interviews people,</v>

1486
01:32:35.370 --> 01:32:39.690
so to piece together the story.
Yeah.
Right.
I can't tell you.

1487
01:32:39.691 --> 01:32:43.650
Others can write sometime in the,
to find out more about the Nazis.

1488
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:46.530
I went to Germany and sought out,

1489
01:32:46.531 --> 01:32:51.420
some children have these top top Nazis to see if maybe they didn't have journals

1490
01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:56.160
or anything they might share with me.
And one of them was Dr [inaudible],
his son.

1491
01:32:56.161 --> 01:32:59.790
I tracked down,
I found him and he said,
yes,
you may come visit me.

1492
01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:03.200
And it was such a remarkable journey.
It was like he lived in the black forest.

1493
01:33:03.201 --> 01:33:06.870
I had to take like a taxi through the mountains,
up over the hill,

1494
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:09.150
down through the valley,
you know,

1495
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.140
into a court yard behind a church to doctor [inaudible] mom's house.

1496
01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.820
So he was the junior to his father who was this horrific Nazi.
I mean,

1497
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:21.740
a top Nazi had favor of the fear war,

1498
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:24.090
what was called the golden party batch.
Right.

1499
01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.290
Hitler gave out these little buttons.
Um,
blaume's was,

1500
01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:32.970
I believe number six.
So that's how favorite he was.
Wow.
And his son,

1501
01:33:32.971 --> 01:33:37.300
Dr Carp Blom where's the father was in charge of the biological weapons program.

1502
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:38.970
So his plan was to,
you know,

1503
01:33:38.971 --> 01:33:43.590
murder people with biological weapons from nature.
Right.

1504
01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:46.200
The son had been a medical doctor,

1505
01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:50.160
but had left the profession to cure people with flowers.

1506
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:52.020
It's called Bach flower therapy.

1507
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:57.590
So he was this very interesting individual who had never given an interview

1508
01:33:57.601 --> 01:34:01.680
before,
and he agreed to let me come to him.
So I go on that journey.

1509
01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:06.660
I go to his house and he was remarkable.
I mean,
he was so interesting.

1510
01:34:06.661 --> 01:34:10.650
Talk about the sins of the father,
you know,
I mean,
my God,
what he,

1511
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.370
what he had,
what he had as a burden.
Right.
And He,

1512
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.610
and I asked him to tell me everything he could about his father and he did.

1513
01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.730
And then he asked me to tell me what I knew about his father.

1514
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:25.650
I had information from the German archives about his father that he did not have

1515
01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.750
or what kind of stuff like that his father had given something.

1516
01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:32.610
I'd just come from this archive and found these documents.
Doctor Blumm ordered,

1517
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:33.540
um,

1518
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:38.400
that 6,000 tubercular Jews be given Saundra be handling,

1519
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:41.940
that's the German word.
What does that mean?
Special Treatment?

1520
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:47.700
There is a euphemism for you that was kill those 6,000 tubercular Jews.

1521
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.490
When you say tubercular is that people with tuberculosis?

1522
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.540
They were suffering from tuberculosis and he doctor blown,

1523
01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:59.360
worked closely with Himmler.
Um,
and they just decided to kill them.
And you know,

1524
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:01.070
sitting there talking to this man,

1525
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:04.640
telling him about his father at his request was remarkable.

1526
01:35:04.641 --> 01:35:08.270
And then he's telling me what he knows.
And then as I'm getting ready to leave,

1527
01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:12.590
he says to me,
I'd like you to have these.

1528
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.520
And he takes down from his incredible bookshelf.

1529
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.520
He himself had written eight books,
right?

1530
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.090
And he takes down these books and he hands them to me and they're in these

1531
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:27.820
rappers and I can see that they have Nuremberg,
um,

1532
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.030
nomenclature on them.

1533
01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:34.060
And what they are is they're his father's documents from his Nuremberg trial,

1534
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:38.450
any.
And I'm like,
I can't take these.

1535
01:35:38.451 --> 01:35:41.630
I thought he meant take them back to my hotel room,
look at them,
and then,

1536
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:43.790
you know,
bring them back the next morning when we were doing the next interview.

1537
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:47.810
And he said,
no,
no,
no,
I want you to have them.
And I was like,

1538
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:52.280
I can't have them.
And he said,
I don't want them and you should have them.

1539
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.010
And it gave them to me.
So I had this stack.
So I was like,
on my trip home,

1540
01:35:58.011 --> 01:36:01.100
it was so perplexing because I threw out all of my clothes.
I was like,

1541
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:05.000
screw the clothes.
I mean I just carry,
I've traveled with a carry on bag.
Right.

1542
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.920
So I in my carry on bag,

1543
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:11.710
all I have is this Nazi of Oh that would be in right in Germany.

1544
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.150
That is doctor blossoms.
Oh my,

1545
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:18.880
the deputy surgeon general of the third Reichs documents from Nuremberg covered

1546
01:36:18.881 --> 01:36:20.300
with swastikas.
Oh Man.

1547
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:24.070
I mean he was acquitted at Nuremberg based on all these documents.
Okay.

1548
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:27.980
And Bet by the way,
based on human experiments.
Um,

1549
01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:32.750
and yeah,
I'm at the airport and I realized suddenly,
Oh my God,

1550
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.500
swastikas like this is illegal.
If they go through my bag,

1551
01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:41.150
I'm going to be arrested.
I'm caring.
I mean I'm carrying these incendiary.

1552
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.430
Do you have any copies of your book on you?
So you hadn't written it yet?

1553
01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:48.420
Journalist?
Oh yeah,
no,
no,
no.
I was just like holding my breath.

1554
01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.650
I was just one Joe.

1555
01:36:49.651 --> 01:36:52.230
I was sweating almost as hard as I was sweating at the beginning of this

1556
01:36:52.231 --> 01:36:57.100
interview.
Right.
All right,
thank you.
Sweating harder.
I was,
I went through,

1557
01:36:57.101 --> 01:37:01.240
cause you know,
I was like wow,
I went through,
no problem.
Got Home.
I have them,

1558
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:05.790
my office checking anything.
Nope.
Look,
you didn't go through Israel.

1559
01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:09.930
Oh my God.
Well,
you know what,
it's not,
the swastika is not outlawed there,

1560
01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:15.090
but it is in Germany.
You may not have any Nazi paraphernalia whatsoever.
In fact,

1561
01:37:15.091 --> 01:37:17.760
my paper clip book,
which has a swastika on it,

1562
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:22.860
had to be redesigned the cover for the German publication and it just has like

1563
01:37:22.861 --> 01:37:27.861
broken up images of the Nazis because you cannot reproduce that image in

1564
01:37:28.111 --> 01:37:28.730
Germany.

1565
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:31.460
<v 3>It's,
I mean,
I'm not pro swastika,</v>

1566
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:36.461
but it's so strange that we've given so much power to this design that you can't

1567
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:39.800
even see it.
It used to be there's a,
um,

1568
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:43.250
there's a temple out here that I think is,
I believe it's a Hindu temple.
Yup.

1569
01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.400
And it was a part of Hinduism that this swastika predates World War II.

1570
01:37:50.061 --> 01:37:54.350
It predates the Nazis.
It predates there.
They're sort of reclaiming of it.

1571
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:55.920
And this

1572
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:58.290
<v 2>building that was built out here in the 19,</v>

1573
01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:00.540
I think it was built in the 1920s has swatting design.

1574
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:03.150
There's a big plaque explaining why they're swastikas on it.

1575
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:08.400
<v 1>I know it was actually at a different angle.
Yeah.
But I mean,
talk about branding.</v>

1576
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:12.510
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
I mean,
my God,
that was,
and the Nazis were,
you know,

1577
01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:15.570
kings of that.
I mean,
they were only that the mustache,

1578
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.670
that guy killed that mustache.
There's not another thing like that.

1579
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:25.380
But he didn't kill the dueling scar.
Right.
That could come back,
do you think?
No,

1580
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:28.290
not enough.
Not after your show.
What do you have 4 million viewers?

1581
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.160
<v 2>It's probably right,
but people don't think about it that way.</v>

1582
01:38:31.161 --> 01:38:33.890
They don't think about the dueling scars being a Nazi thing.

1583
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:38.680
<v 1>No,
no.
That's what I find remarkable.
Right.
They really don't.
But the Nazis,</v>

1584
01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:42.720
the Nazis did.
And then you look,
there's an amazing photograph of JFK,

1585
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.820
Lyndon Johnson,
Kurt Davis,
sitting at,

1586
01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:50.400
you know,
for a launch,
a moon launch,

1587
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:54.240
and there's Davis with his huge dueling scar.
And I'm like,

1588
01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:57.630
and their position was,
oh,
he's one of the good Germans.
Wow.

1589
01:38:58.210 --> 01:39:02.700
<v 2>That culture was a culture of ruthlessness.
I mean,
it was a,</v>

1590
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.930
even the good ones.
There he is.

1591
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.660
<v 1>Yes.
Good Job Jamie.
Look at that.
Can you believe that?
Scar on his face.</v>

1592
01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:14.130
They still give out an award,
by the way,
that's called the curt day award.

1593
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:17.940
And I rang them up and said like,
why are you guys giving out this award?

1594
01:39:17.941 --> 01:39:21.840
He was a hardcore Nazi.
Well,
they say,
they were like,

1595
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.390
they've hemmed and hawed and I finally said,
well,

1596
01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:29.060
at least tell me what you say to people who asked that question.
You know,

1597
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:34.050
they said,
wow,
no one's ever asked us that question before,
Annie.
Well,

1598
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.930
they will now.
Jesus.

1599
01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:39.910
Oh,
it's,

1600
01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:41.481
<v 2>well,</v>

1601
01:39:41.481 --> 01:39:46.481
when you really stop and think about the horrific nature of what the Nazis did,

1602
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.850
I mean,
how inhuman it was,
how,

1603
01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:54.590
how crazy it was like that had to permeate the entire culture.

1604
01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.320
There is no good Nazis.
There was not one,

1605
01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.560
even one of them that was looped into that had to be responsible for some awful,

1606
01:40:02.631 --> 01:40:03.470
awful shit.

1607
01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.060
<v 1>I mean,
Einstein said it best when he said you should.
You know,</v>

1608
01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.390
you could have left.
Like people who could have left should have laughed.
Yeah,

1609
01:40:10.391 --> 01:40:14.710
right.
Well,
do you know the story of Fritz Harbor,
right?
The Guy,
yes.

1610
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:17.110
I mean,
he wound up having to flee

1611
01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.820
<v 2>and he's the guy who created [inaudible] gas and he's,
you know,</v>

1612
01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.980
he created his icon a,

1613
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.420
which had a smell built into it,

1614
01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:31.720
so that would warn you when you were using this pesticide.

1615
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:37.050
And then the Nazis turned it in as icon B or they remove that element that added

1616
01:40:37.181 --> 01:40:40.930
the smell and just this odorless,
horrific,

1617
01:40:40.931 --> 01:40:44.680
poisonous gas that they use,
the gas,
the Jews,
and he was a Jew.

1618
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:47.400
<v 1>I mean,
you know.
Then when you think about,
he became,</v>

1619
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:51.030
he was no longer useful to them because they've figured out he really was a Jew.

1620
01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.980
Yeah,
well once World War Two came around,
so he was

1621
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.820
<v 3>a part of world war one when they first started using gas and he was,</v>

1622
01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.130
there's a great radio lab podcast about it,
I think it's called the bad show.

1623
01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.650
But anyway,
what essentially says is that he was winning.

1624
01:41:08.651 --> 01:41:11.020
He was up for the Nobel prize.
At the same time,

1625
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:14.560
he was wanted for crimes against humanity because he was out for the Nobel prize

1626
01:41:14.561 --> 01:41:18.040
for creating the hopper method of extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere,

1627
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:19.780
which was used for fertilizer,

1628
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:24.460
which to this day they say 50% of the nitrogen in human bodies was created by

1629
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:29.380
the harbor method.
So what you get from food from vegetables like that nitrogen,

1630
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.920
50% of it at least is coming from this guy's method,

1631
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:37.980
who was a scientist who was a Jew who was working in Germany before it became

1632
01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:43.111
Nazi Germany and then was the guy who figured out how to use gas on people.

1633
01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.230
It's a dark,
his story,
dark story.

1634
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:51.220
I mean he died looking for medical treatment because he had to flee Germany and

1635
01:41:51.221 --> 01:41:54.100
he's had a bad heart and he died on the road trying to get to Switzerland.

1636
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:57.460
That's the thing.
It was Switzerland.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's,

1637
01:41:57.610 --> 01:42:02.590
<v 1>I mean Nazi Germany is like the pole position taken way too far.
Right.</v>

1638
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:05.680
And that's what's remarkable that the Pentagon was like,
okay,

1639
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:08.560
but we can learn from this.
And there is,

1640
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.480
there are elements that are dark in that.

1641
01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:14.610
<v 3>Well,
it also comes out of the devastation of World War One,
right?</v>

1642
01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.250
The economic devastation,
the defeat,

1643
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.720
the Germans are in this terrible state overall in terms of their morale.

1644
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:26.990
And then along comes this charismatic psychopath that is just really good at

1645
01:42:27.211 --> 01:42:30.150
screaming.
To this day,
I don't speak German,
but this to this day,

1646
01:42:30.151 --> 01:42:33.670
when you watch that guy scream and yell at all those people and see them
respond,

1647
01:42:33.671 --> 01:42:37.290
it gives you chills like that kind of charisma,

1648
01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:40.620
that kind of influenced that someone has where they can do that in front of

1649
01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:44.640
thousands and thousands of people and everyone's goosestepping and sorry,

1650
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.700
woo to see.
We're very fortunate.

1651
01:42:47.701 --> 01:42:50.820
There's not something like that right now and our forefathers and our

1652
01:42:50.821 --> 01:42:54.960
grandparents and whoever fought in World War II,
if it wasn't for them,

1653
01:42:55.170 --> 01:42:59.550
who knows where this world would be right now because that was a literal evil

1654
01:42:59.551 --> 01:43:03.540
empire straight out of Star Wars.
I mean that was like the sith Lord.

1655
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:05.370
They were,
they really were.

1656
01:43:05.371 --> 01:43:09.560
They were human beings who were doing some of the most evil shit that you,

1657
01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:13.410
you almost demonic.
If you really stopped and thought about it.

1658
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:16.290
If there were demons,
pretended to be people that would do the same thing.

1659
01:43:17.210 --> 01:43:18.043
<v 1>I mean it,</v>

1660
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:21.980
that's why I think it's a rabbit hole because it's so hard to comprehend that

1661
01:43:21.981 --> 01:43:26.981
like a culture of educated individuals

1662
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:32.720
in that moment in time that you talked about between World War II,

1663
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:37.880
World War One and World War II could,
could completely become Monette malevolent.

1664
01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:42.300
<v 3>That's one of the more disturbing things about the Nazis was that there were so</v>

1665
01:43:42.301 --> 01:43:46.320
many of these people that they did extract through Operation Paperclip,

1666
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:51.050
brilliant engineers and scientists that were also evil.

1667
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:55.640
Right?
Like those two things are very uncomfortable for us.

1668
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:59.300
We like to think of our scientists as being the people that are out there trying

1669
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:02.390
to solve the mysteries of the universe and provide us with the technology to

1670
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:04.910
make our life better here on earth.
Not the Nazis.

1671
01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.740
They were trying to figure out how to kill people better.

1672
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:10.370
They were trying to figure out how to use rockets to shoot them at Europe and

1673
01:44:10.371 --> 01:44:12.580
blow people up.
And it is a,

1674
01:44:13.090 --> 01:44:18.090
it's one of the more telling and horrific times in our history when you read,

1675
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.110
cause it's,
it's one of the,

1676
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:24.260
one of the more horrific ones that we have footage of.

1677
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:26.370
Cause we don't have footage of gangas common,

1678
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:28.700
we don't have footage of Alexander the Great,
we don't,

1679
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:33.850
we have stories and tales of Napoleon and some photographs and drawings of

1680
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:36.710
dictators past and PR.

1681
01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.710
But we have a lot of footage from Vietnam.

1682
01:44:39.711 --> 01:44:41.420
We have a lot of footage from World War II.

1683
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:45.140
We have a lot of footage from modern wars.
And out of all of them,

1684
01:44:45.141 --> 01:44:48.170
the one that scares us,
the moat and scares me the most is World War II.

1685
01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.670
<v 1>Do you think those scientists when they came here,
because this is a,</v>

1686
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.060
this is like,
I could not figure this out even after writing that whole book.

1687
01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:57.361
Is it,

1688
01:44:57.361 --> 01:45:02.361
do you think they came here and actually thought about what they had done or

1689
01:45:02.971 --> 01:45:07.971
they were able to convince themselves that they were the good Germans?

1690
01:45:08.251 --> 01:45:11.400
That they were part of it?
Because I never saw a single bit of remorse ever.

1691
01:45:11.401 --> 01:45:16.170
Like no one ever acknowledged what they had done.
So it made me wonder,

1692
01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.600
<v 3>I guess results very right.
I mean,</v>

1693
01:45:18.601 --> 01:45:21.360
I think there's probably two people that go through the same thing and one

1694
01:45:21.361 --> 01:45:25.680
person that's no problem with it and the other person literally can't sleep.

1695
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:31.760
I don't know.
It's a good question.
It would be interesting to interview them.
The,

1696
01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:36.761
the ones who've been caught who had been prosecuted and had been chased down and

1697
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:41.780
they've got one fairly recently.
They caught a Nazi like just a few months ago.

1698
01:45:42.150 --> 01:45:45.620
So one of the last ones,
he's in his nineties,
I believe.
Um,

1699
01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:48.980
the ones who survived,

1700
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:53.180
they all tell different stories.

1701
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:57.830
And some of them say they just following orders and you know,

1702
01:45:57.831 --> 01:46:00.920
some of them say that they didn't do it.
They're being framed.

1703
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.210
They all have different stories.

1704
01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:05.480
<v 6>It's,
it's,</v>

1705
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.690
<v 1>it's one of the,
you know,</v>

1706
01:46:08.691 --> 01:46:12.050
you write a book about that and are you think about it and you kind of have,

1707
01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.410
you go down the rabbit hole and then you have to,
you have to ask yourself,

1708
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:18.950
what does this mean?
Or are you kind of,
it's too dark.
Right?

1709
01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.270
And so I asked that question to a Auschwitz survivor.

1710
01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.630
Okay.
Who I wrote about in the book,
his name is Gerhard Michelle [inaudible].

1711
01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.860
And He,
the reason he was,

1712
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:33.080
he survived Auschwitz was because he was taken over to the labor camp,

1713
01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.880
which was called Buena.

1714
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:40.300
So it was a rubber factory and it was led by this truly evil man named Otto

1715
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.650
Ambrose who became part of operation paperclip.
Okay.

1716
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.840
After being tried at Nuremberg and being convicted of mass murder and genocide,

1717
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.360
right.
We got him out and he worked for us.

1718
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:57.030
I got to read the story of it.
I mean,
it's just,

1719
01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.280
it's just astonishing auto Ambrose chemist.
Right.

1720
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:07.410
But he was so,
he,
so Gerhard was at Buena,
this factory,
this rubber factory.

1721
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:10.620
And um,
he lived,

1722
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:14.010
and I did an interview with him because I was asking him,
you know,

1723
01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.820
the flip side of all of that and his whole family was killed at Auschwitz.

1724
01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:19.620
And I said to him,
what does any of,
you know,

1725
01:47:19.621 --> 01:47:23.280
we went through all these questions to try to get some closure to this or some

1726
01:47:23.281 --> 01:47:27.960
meaning.
And I said,
and then I let we landed on.
I said,
well,
you know,
we couldn't,

1727
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:31.500
we couldn't answer.
What does this mean,
right?
What does it mean for today?

1728
01:47:31.501 --> 01:47:32.700
Couldn't answer.
We,
yeah.

1729
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.170
So when I asked him what matters about all this,

1730
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:38.910
he went like this,

1731
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:44.030
he lifted up his sleeve and he showed me his tattoo and he said,

1732
01:47:44.851 --> 01:47:46.530
that matters.

1733
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:50.250
And I have that image seared in my mind.

1734
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:54.120
I had never seen a tattoo from Auschwitz before and I have not sense.

1735
01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:55.830
And it also made me think,

1736
01:47:55.831 --> 01:47:58.950
because I thought he's going to die soon and he has died since.

1737
01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.590
And then that tattoos gone.

1738
01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:08.690
So all you have is the exchange of information and people talking about the

1739
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:11.250
eyewitnesses die.

1740
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:16.500
How did they get that guy out of Nuremberg?

1741
01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.390
How did they get them to release him?
Well,
okay,
so he was convicted in Nuremberg,

1742
01:48:21.391 --> 01:48:25.270
then he went to prison.
He went to the prison where we had all the um,

1743
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.640
execute them.
No,
no.
They executed like the top Nazis.

1744
01:48:29.641 --> 01:48:32.700
And then a lot of these guys went to prison.
So there was a bunch of trials.

1745
01:48:32.701 --> 01:48:34.890
And so I went to the prison,
I saw his cell,

1746
01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.770
I mean in Germany was intense Landsberg prison.

1747
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:40.470
And then we,

1748
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:44.240
because we were sort of policing Nazi Germany after,
it was not a,
you know,

1749
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:44.971
after the war was over,

1750
01:48:44.971 --> 01:48:49.971
we were policing Germany and then came and a guy named I'm McCoy was in charge.

1751
01:48:51.541 --> 01:48:56.190
He was kind of like the Governor General of Germany and the Germans wanted

1752
01:48:56.191 --> 01:49:00.810
Germany back and they were like,
we're tired of you guys policing us.
Um,

1753
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.430
the threat from the Russians was very real.
And so deals were made.
I mean,

1754
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:07.140
I write about all this and paperclip,
you know,

1755
01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:12.141
based on the documents and one of the provisions was we want our guys out of

1756
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:16.320
prison,
we want them back in society.

1757
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:21.600
And that was arranged.
And again,

1758
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.600
you don't even know these things,
you know,
they're like,
but that was,

1759
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.500
and then auto Ambrose,
and they even gave him his money back.

1760
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:32.910
That was astonishing.
And the family still has this villa,

1761
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:37.650
um,
in Switzerland I believe,
or maybe it's the g,
the Bavarian Alps,
um,

1762
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.240
that had been in the family,
which is money from,
you know,
from,

1763
01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.480
from Nazi Germany and I,
I called up the sun to interview him.

1764
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:50.320
He was not as,
as doctor Blumm son and you know,
he hung up on me and said,
if you,

1765
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:52.690
if you ever contact me again,
I'll,
you know,

1766
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:55.210
they have very serious privacy laws in Germany.

1767
01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:58.990
I thought about going and knocking on his front door.
My lawyer was like,
Annie,

1768
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.280
do not do that.
They have very different laws in Germany for privacy.
Yes.

1769
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:06.820
Even if for issues like this son of a Nazi.
Yes,
absolutely.

1770
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:10.960
<v 3>Well,
I would imagine,
look,
if he didn't do anything,</v>

1771
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.240
he shouldn't be responsible for what his father did.

1772
01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:17.450
<v 1>No.
But he has the villa.
That was the point,
right.
I had all the money.
Right.</v>

1773
01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:21.140
<v 3>You got that money from his father who got that money from stealing it from</v>

1774
01:50:21.141 --> 01:50:25.070
people.
Yes.
During World War II.
Yes.
Yeah.
Like what happens there.
Yes.

1775
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:27.440
But if you go back to that,

1776
01:50:27.441 --> 01:50:32.441
like we should really find out who had the plantations in America and uh,

1777
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:37.160
who benefited from that,
like go several generations from there.
I mean,

1778
01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.420
you could get weird with,

1779
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:43.400
with war reparations or big deeds where people profitted.
Yeah,

1780
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:48.120
<v 1>I mean,
which is sometimes a reason why you,
I realized in looking at these,</v>

1781
01:50:48.121 --> 01:50:50.760
in reporting these books,
which is why certain things are kept secret.

1782
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:54.690
I mean they opened up a whole can of worms about reparations.
Sure.

1783
01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:59.620
<v 3>Yeah.
Wow.
Was Operating p operation paperclip writing that book?</v>

1784
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:00.670
Was that one of the most,

1785
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:07.960
<v 1>I mean that was so dark.
My husband,
um,
is amazing.
He's Norwegian,
right.</v>

1786
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:12.040
And the nor the Norway was occupied by the Nazis for five years.

1787
01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:16.480
Like people kind of forget that.
But he,
he grew up there and his mom,
you know,

1788
01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:19.090
was a grade schooler and it was really impacted,

1789
01:51:19.091 --> 01:51:21.400
like didn't go to school for five years while the Nazis were there.

1790
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:25.360
They were going to breed with the Norwegians cause they were such lovely area

1791
01:51:25.361 --> 01:51:29.710
and people.
Right.
So my husband having a Norwegian mom was like,

1792
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:32.500
when I was writing paper clip,
I would be so dark.

1793
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:37.060
Sometimes I would be like down in my office.
Like I can't,
you know,
honey,

1794
01:51:37.061 --> 01:51:40.570
I can't eat it.
And He'd,
he'd be down there with a sandwich or coughing and say,

1795
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:44.950
but are you throwing another Nazi under the bus?
And I would say yes.

1796
01:51:44.951 --> 01:51:48.820
And he'd say,
keep typing.
Right?
And then I realized,
well,
wait a minute,

1797
01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:53.230
the neutral journalist has to really make sure that she's not just throwing

1798
01:51:53.231 --> 01:51:56.050
Nazis under the bus without really good reason.

1799
01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.360
And so when I was in Germany at the archives,

1800
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:03.280
I went to how the concentration camp and I asked the lead archivist if I could

1801
01:52:03.281 --> 01:52:08.281
come and see the worst possible photographs that no one wants to see.

1802
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:10.270
And he said,
absolutely.

1803
01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.150
And I didn't write about them in the book because I didn't want to subject

1804
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:18.040
people to that kind of horror.
But I looked at them and I watched,

1805
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:22.630
I saw with my own eyes,
people moments before they were killed,

1806
01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.660
you know,
and then the body's afterwards,

1807
01:52:25.661 --> 01:52:28.330
and these are in human experiments to s you know,

1808
01:52:28.331 --> 01:52:31.390
to see whether or not pilots could survive height or you know,

1809
01:52:31.391 --> 01:52:34.860
they simulated different things in chambers,
um,

1810
01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.500
at high altitude or speed.
Um,
and I saw,

1811
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:41.980
I saw photographs,
you know,
freezing people to death,
right?

1812
01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:45.470
Because they were trying to develop programs where they would,
um,

1813
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:49.460
they wanted to see at what temperature humans actually died.
Right.

1814
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:51.590
And so they experimented on Jews.
These are the,

1815
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.250
these are some of the doctors that came on our programs.
And I looked at those,

1816
01:52:55.251 --> 01:52:59.300
that evidence and I was,
that blew me away.
And then I knew when I left there,

1817
01:52:59.301 --> 01:53:01.640
okay,
I can,
I can throw these Nazis under the box.

1818
01:53:02.130 --> 01:53:02.610
<v 2>It is,</v>

1819
01:53:02.610 --> 01:53:07.080
it's such a crazy time in history where you really stop and think about all the

1820
01:53:07.081 --> 01:53:08.580
different experiments that they did do.

1821
01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:12.120
It's almost like they just opened up the vault of evil that said,
listen,

1822
01:53:12.121 --> 01:53:15.750
we have an opportunity.
These people aren't people.
Let's do whatever we want.

1823
01:53:15.810 --> 01:53:19.620
It's like they're fake people.
It's like,
like they were an invention.

1824
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:23.510
<v 1>I mean the perception really played into it.</v>

1825
01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:29.530
<v 2>So gross.
It's so scary to think about that.
Humans just,
you know,</v>

1826
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:34.870
oh well a generation or two away,
he capable of doing that.

1827
01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.600
<v 1>Yes.
And so I think what it,</v>

1828
01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:41.650
when it all comes around full circle to all these government programs I write

1829
01:53:41.651 --> 01:53:46.570
about is that idea of an evil enemy.
Right?
I mean,

1830
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:50.590
we talked about that earlier when you brought up cash Shoghi right?
Yeah.
I mean,

1831
01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:55.660
you know,
people often say to me,
and these are sources,
they're like,
Annie,

1832
01:53:55.661 --> 01:53:58.330
Saudi Arabia is the root of all evil.
I mean,

1833
01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:02.140
I hear that constantly and why are they our ally?

1834
01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.240
Why are we protecting them?
You know,
oil,
right?
Yes.
Right.
Yeah.

1835
01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.060
<v 2>Yeah.
So on an influencer in the Middle East,
and to have an ally over there,</v>

1836
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:17.160
<v 1>and this,
it's why I think people,
the benefit of,
you know,
people often say to me,</v>

1837
01:54:17.161 --> 01:54:21.570
why do you write these 500 page books?
Well,
because I mean,

1838
01:54:21.571 --> 01:54:22.890
hopefully they're interesting.

1839
01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:26.820
And I do know they're interesting because I got this great email Joe the other

1840
01:54:26.821 --> 01:54:31.230
day from a reader and he said,
I'm Annie,

1841
01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:32.310
I'm a truck driver,

1842
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:36.600
and my whole life people have tried to tell me I'm stupid,

1843
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.930
but I drive around in my truck and I listened to your books.

1844
01:54:40.050 --> 01:54:43.890
I read the audio on my books and he said,
now I know I'm really smart.

1845
01:54:44.530 --> 01:54:48.820
<v 2>Okay.
He's stupid.
Okay,
I's ridiculous.
Well,
your whole life,</v>

1846
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:50.890
everyone's telling you you're stupid and then you read some books to go.

1847
01:54:50.891 --> 01:54:54.760
Now I know I'm smart like he,
Oh,
come on,

1848
01:54:54.761 --> 01:54:58.750
give him some space.
Right.
And that it says they're smart,
doesn't get any space.

1849
01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.510
I think he was making a point that he has the ability to listen.
Right.

1850
01:55:04.511 --> 01:55:07.430
Maybe he's not the world's greatest reader.
That's how I took it.
Right.

1851
01:55:08.010 --> 01:55:10.420
Are Your books,
Seville,
I'm just joking about this guy obviously,

1852
01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:15.520
but are your jokes of your training or your books available in audio form?
Yeah,

1853
01:55:15.521 --> 01:55:18.170
I read all my books.
Oh,
that's great.
Yeah,
I love that.
Yep.

1854
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:21.520
I get bummed out when someone reads a book.
That's a,

1855
01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:24.010
but my friend Graham Hancock had a really good point east,

1856
01:55:24.011 --> 01:55:27.100
like not my fiction books cause he writes fiction books as well.

1857
01:55:27.370 --> 01:55:31.840
He's like my fact base books.
I read myself but fiction,

1858
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:34.060
I hire a an actor.
I'm like that's a good move.

1859
01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.380
Nice cause then you got to do voices and inflection and all that other stuff.

1860
01:55:38.490 --> 01:55:41.090
<v 1>No,
it's amazing to read them.
I mean because you,</v>

1861
01:55:41.091 --> 01:55:45.710
you really also feel like later down the road you connect with with people.
Sure.

1862
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.500
<v 2>Yeah.
And then people that are hearing you right now,
the,
the heel that,</v>

1863
01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.460
the head of that same voice when they get your audio

1864
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:55.510
<v 1>book and because I write things that are so at the edge of conspiratorial</v>

1865
01:55:56.331 --> 01:56:01.220
thinking,
right.
There is a certain sense of oh there's a real human there.
Right.

1866
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.040
This is not government propaganda.
Right.
Um,

1867
01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:07.670
and I can relate to this and I can hopefully,

1868
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:13.520
I don't want to say trust,
but I can recognize on authenticity,
right?
Yes.

1869
01:56:13.730 --> 01:56:16.550
Of working with sources.

1870
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:19.980
<v 2>When you are done with the paper clip book and you know you,</v>

1871
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.180
you've published it and you have to live with all the information that you had a

1872
01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.700
gathering and run through your mind.
Did that book,

1873
01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:30.500
was that the book,
did that Change You,
that book?

1874
01:56:30.501 --> 01:56:35.070
Like was it the most altering of the different subjects that you covered?

1875
01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.040
<v 1>I mean each book has a huge impact for different reasons,</v>

1876
01:56:40.041 --> 01:56:42.090
but when I think of Paperclip,

1877
01:56:42.110 --> 01:56:47.110
I think of this one saying that was over the gates' book and wild and it was,

1878
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:49.970
it said he,
Adam does Zeina.

1879
01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.600
And what that means is everyone gets what they deserve and that was horrible.

1880
01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.930
And I still think about that because it's such a piece of Nazi propaganda.

1881
01:57:01.931 --> 01:57:04.100
It's like saying to the Jews,
you guys deserve this.

1882
01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.050
And so I know much of my reporting and my general just way of being as a human

1883
01:57:09.051 --> 01:57:13.970
is,
there is no such thing as what you deserve,
right?
There is what,

1884
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:18.590
there is what happens and there's what you do,

1885
01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:21.650
there's what you're responsible for and there's what you can change.

1886
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:24.170
But there's that idea is reprehensible.

1887
01:57:24.171 --> 01:57:27.590
For some reason that really stuck with me as the,

1888
01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:32.840
as just the worst possible thing that I could think of two years because it's

1889
01:57:32.841 --> 01:57:34.980
the psychology behind why they did what they,

1890
01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.400
<v 2>yes,
the dehumanizing.</v>

1891
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:41.360
But the weird thing is that that was less than a hundred years ago.

1892
01:57:41.361 --> 01:57:43.790
That seems like that should have been something that took place.

1893
01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:45.650
If you hear about the inquisition,
you go,
okay,

1894
01:57:45.651 --> 01:57:47.690
well that makes people didn't know any better back then,

1895
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:51.860
but 1945 is not that long ago.
It's just not,

1896
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.130
<v 1>I mean,
people,</v>

1897
01:57:56.130 --> 01:58:01.130
people just read and read and read about World War II for good reason,

1898
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:04.020
you know,
and everything I write starts,

1899
01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:09.110
it all goes back to the Nazis and every book I the the trail,

1900
01:58:09.451 --> 01:58:13.830
the paper trail at the national archives or individual university libraries and

1901
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.780
people's papers where I go,

1902
01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:21.020
they all refer back to that because it was so remarkable that the Nazis led in

1903
01:58:22.201 --> 01:58:26.370
weapons technology and they almost took over the world because of it.
Right.

1904
01:58:26.490 --> 01:58:29.640
And that is the premise of all of this.
I mean in surprise,
kill vanish.

1905
01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:34.260
It's like these are the guys on the ground in the Pentagon's brain.
It's,

1906
01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:38.790
this is the technology in the sky,
but we must,
we,

1907
01:58:38.791 --> 01:58:43.240
the government's position,
whether it's CIA is always,

1908
01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.250
we have to stay ahead because the next Nazi Germany is right around the corner.

1909
01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.930
Yeah.
And that's,
uh,
that's really something to think about is that alarmist.

1910
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:53.730
Oh,
wow.

1911
01:58:53.730 --> 01:58:55.670
<v 3>She does history repeats itself.
I mean,
Huh.</v>

1912
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:59.880
If we went and stopped and looked at all the instances throughout history of

1913
01:58:59.881 --> 01:59:03.870
people being evil dictators,
there's quite a few,
and there's,
you know,
we've,

1914
01:59:03.871 --> 01:59:07.710
we could look at North Korea right now and that guy a assassinated his own
uncle,

1915
01:59:07.711 --> 01:59:11.970
right.
With a,
Oh,
is that with a missile coming out of a helicopter,

1916
01:59:11.971 --> 01:59:16.590
I think put them in a field.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1917
01:59:17.790 --> 01:59:20.100
I mean,
that's straight up messaging.
Yeah.

1918
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:21.821
<v 1>Right.</v>

1919
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:26.640
Which is another thing I think is interesting about the CIA's paramilitary

1920
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:27.040
program.

1921
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:31.690
It's all meant to remain plausibly deniable.

1922
01:59:31.691 --> 01:59:33.160
It's supposed to be a secret.

1923
01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:37.930
Like we're not supposed to be giving out the message that we have these teams,

1924
01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.720
you know,
that go after high value targets,
right.

1925
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:44.190
They're just supposed to disappear.
That's the vanish part of the [inaudible].

1926
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:49.270
So that and that as someone who is really interested in transparency and people

1927
01:59:49.541 --> 01:59:54.040
being educated and having information,
that always puts me in conflict with,

1928
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:58.150
you know,
the government in essence because I'm,
I'm like,
we should know.

1929
01:59:58.420 --> 01:59:59.350
But then you think about it,

1930
01:59:59.351 --> 02:00:01.870
well the whole thing is you are not supposed to know because it's supposed to be

1931
02:00:01.871 --> 02:00:04.930
just the hidden hand,
the president's hidden hand,
they call it.

1932
02:00:05.010 --> 02:00:09.630
<v 3>What has to be this distinction that they have the ability to break the rules</v>

1933
02:00:09.631 --> 02:00:14.550
because that's how they protect us and that that's,
that's the rub,
right?

1934
02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:19.910
<v 1>And the stories we hear are off in the failures because those are the ones that</v>

1935
02:00:19.911 --> 02:00:23.270
get reported in the press.
There is a sense undergirding this narrative,

1936
02:00:23.271 --> 02:00:28.271
which I really like and I'm interested in and intrigued by is that the

1937
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:33.970
successful operations you don't hear about because they're plausibly denied,

1938
02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:37.710
<v 3>right?
Yeah.</v>

1939
02:00:37.711 --> 02:00:40.230
Well there's gotta be a ton of them that went through that you don't hear

1940
02:00:40.231 --> 02:00:43.610
nothing about and your kids will hear about Pauline.

1941
02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:48.660
Maybe when you think about protecting us from something like another Nazi

1942
02:00:48.661 --> 02:00:49.160
Germany,

1943
02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:54.160
that's when people are willing to give up some of the freedoms they're willing

1944
02:00:55.021 --> 02:00:57.780
to give up.
Surveillance are willing to give a,
and this is,

1945
02:00:57.990 --> 02:01:00.520
this is where things get real slippery.
Right?
Okay.

1946
02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:04.390
<v 1>I mean also when you think about Russia,</v>

1947
02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:09.450
because all of this cold war science,

1948
02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:15.130
technology,
operations,
all of that was to beat back the Russians.

1949
02:01:15.190 --> 02:01:18.460
Okay.
Then the Russians go away and now they're back,
you know,

1950
02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:22.900
the Russians or the master assassins and they do it through poisoning.
I mean,

1951
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:25.200
look at Skirball,
right?
Yeah.
Um,

1952
02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:30.480
I write in the book about a defector who came over in the 50s and said I was an

1953
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:36.340
assassin for the KGB and gave us all kinds of information.

1954
02:01:36.341 --> 02:01:39.070
It's fascinating to look at those documents and realize like,

1955
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:44.210
this is how it works.
This is how it worked,
you know,
60 years ago.

1956
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:48.230
And then you kind of see echos of that,
of how it's working today.

1957
02:01:48.231 --> 02:01:50.990
And you can only imagine,
um,

1958
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.420
the defectors or those who come over from the other side who we learn from and

1959
02:01:56.421 --> 02:02:01.100
they just disappear into him and they disappear as sort of the CIA's version of

1960
02:02:01.101 --> 02:02:04.910
witness protection.
Wow.

1961
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:06.283
Do you,

1962
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.440
<v 3>because of the subject matter that you choose to write about,</v>

1963
02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:11.990
does this affect you as a human?

1964
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:14.960
Like are you suspicious of everything now?

1965
02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.040
Do you look at everything in terms of like things that are happening in the news

1966
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:22.810
to try to look at the,
the hidden mechanisms behind the scenes?

1967
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.500
<v 1>I think the opposite.</v>

1968
02:02:25.710 --> 02:02:30.710
I th I really believe that information gives you a certain understanding of like

1969
02:02:31.951 --> 02:02:34.950
the long view,
right?
Yeah.
It does not make me paranoid at all.
In fact,

1970
02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:39.090
the opposite,
people often say like,
my God,
the world's about to end.
And I say,

1971
02:02:39.091 --> 02:02:39.811
well,
wow,

1972
02:02:39.811 --> 02:02:44.811
you should really read about what it was like in 1959 or 1962 when we were

1973
02:02:45.511 --> 02:02:50.340
really almost at war with the Russians,
thermo nuclear war.
Right,
right.

1974
02:02:50.490 --> 02:02:54.600
That is essentially at bay for now.
Right.
So,
I don't know,

1975
02:02:54.601 --> 02:02:56.160
maybe it's my personality,

1976
02:02:56.370 --> 02:03:01.310
but I actually take comfort in the fact that what is happening now is sort of,

1977
02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.730
as you just said,
it's a,

1978
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:07.790
it's a bit of a re branding in the modern era of what has always been there,

1979
02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:13.290
which is rivals seeking supremacy over one another.

1980
02:03:13.650 --> 02:03:15.090
Um,
you know,

1981
02:03:15.091 --> 02:03:19.620
people trying to outfox the bad guys.
Um,

1982
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:25.550
what I think has changed is that the desire to prevent war has shifted and that

1983
02:03:27.181 --> 02:03:28.014
makes me,

1984
02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:33.690
that makes me upset because we used to sue for peace.

1985
02:03:33.691 --> 02:03:38.610
We used to want a peaceful world.
I mean war was outlawed in 1928.

1986
02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.580
Right?
Um,
and now we just,

1987
02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:45.270
the military industrial complex is such that it's really a lot better for the

1988
02:03:45.271 --> 02:03:49.350
defense department to be in a state of constant war because then you're in a

1989
02:03:49.351 --> 02:03:53.580
state of constant weapons production and you can always be creating those vast

1990
02:03:53.581 --> 02:03:56.530
weapons systems of the future for the next war that comes along.

1991
02:03:57.390 --> 02:04:02.390
And that's troubling because those 18 year old kids are the ones who get sent

1992
02:04:02.551 --> 02:04:03.870
into the life line of fire.

1993
02:04:05.210 --> 02:04:10.210
<v 3>What if any research have you done on artificial intelligence and robotics and</v>

1994
02:04:11.601 --> 02:04:15.800
autonomous weapons and the the future of warfare,

1995
02:04:15.801 --> 02:04:19.010
which a lot of people think it's going to be like what we're seeing now in Yemen

1996
02:04:19.011 --> 02:04:22.730
with drones that we're going to be seeing that with robots on the ground and

1997
02:04:22.731 --> 02:04:23.840
that this will be the future.

1998
02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:27.740
<v 1>Huge amount for the book that I wrote called the Pentagon's brain.</v>

1999
02:04:29.550 --> 02:04:34.230
Really impactful moment was going to Los Alamos when I went there to meet a

2000
02:04:34.231 --> 02:04:38.730
Darpa scientist who was working on an brain for Darpa.

2001
02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:44.210
I mean this stuff is way the physical brain trying to create a system,

2002
02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:50.340
you know,
a free thinking system and what his name was Garrett Kenyon.

2003
02:04:50.341 --> 02:04:53.940
What he told me was just utterly fascinating cause again that human thing I'm

2004
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:57.150
always after.
It's like what are you doing?
I mean leave the science.

2005
02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.320
You've had lots of guys on here.

2006
02:04:58.321 --> 02:05:00.090
I'll talk to you about the high technology elements,

2007
02:05:00.091 --> 02:05:04.200
but I'm interested in who's doing that,
who's creating that science and why.

2008
02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:07.830
And he said to me,
this is like,

2009
02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:11.670
like where artificial intelligence is right now with scientists who are really

2010
02:05:11.671 --> 02:05:14.200
looking into this.
It's like Magellan,
you know,

2011
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:19.320
like who will discover the new world,
right?
But on the,

2012
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:22.500
on the idea of frightening artificial intelligence,

2013
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:27.300
he told me an interesting story about his daughter and he said,
um,

2014
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:28.910
people seem to think like,
you know,

2015
02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.880
facial recognition software is like telling us that we're one step away from AI,

2016
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:36.840
true Ai.
And he said if,
if he's,
he was,

2017
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:38.070
he showed me on his iPhone,

2018
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:42.570
this was a couple of years ago and how much trouble the iPhone had recognizing

2019
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:47.340
him.
Like if he put a hat on or if he made a funny face and he said,

2020
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:52.640
my daughter can recognize me from across a baseball field.

2021
02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:57.240
You know,
if I have a hat on,
just by the way I walk.
Right.
And he said if she,

2022
02:05:57.510 --> 02:06:01.080
if she couldn't,
there would be something really wrong with her.
In other words,

2023
02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:06.380
her human recognition abilities are truly intelligent.

2024
02:06:08.730 --> 02:06:11.430
And that is a system of systems,

2025
02:06:11.431 --> 02:06:15.210
a biological system of systems that no scientist has,
you know,

2026
02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:19.170
the algorithm for which no one has ever able been able to figure out yet.

2027
02:06:19.710 --> 02:06:21.480
And he believes that we're far away from that.

2028
02:06:21.690 --> 02:06:23.580
But the Defense Department on the other hand,

2029
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:29.250
is moving us in that direction and absolutely wants autonomous weapons to be

2030
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:33.120
fighting wars.
Look,
there was a program that said,
um,
I quote this in the book,

2031
02:06:33.121 --> 02:06:37.740
it says the,
um,
the battle place is no place for humans.

2032
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:39.763
<v 3>Whoa.</v>

2033
02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:45.400
So drones are the way of the future,
right?

2034
02:06:45.401 --> 02:06:47.520
But there used to kill people,
which,

2035
02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:51.910
and which also means that the enemy is creating drone systems.

2036
02:06:51.970 --> 02:06:54.870
And pretty soon that's going to be a big,
a big issue.
Yeah.
That's the,

2037
02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:55.960
the big fear.

2038
02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:59.180
The big fear is that they're going to be the first ones to implement it.
I mean,

2039
02:06:59.190 --> 02:07:03.460
what scares you about Ai?
Everything.
Darpa thinks AI could help troops,

2040
02:07:03.461 --> 02:07:07.780
telepathically control much machines.
Of course they do.
And they probably Gen,

2041
02:07:07.781 --> 02:07:10.420
I mean they've already got cursors that people can move around that are

2042
02:07:10.421 --> 02:07:14.290
paraplegic.
They can move them around with their mind in their eyes.
Yeah,

2043
02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.620
I think there's going to be a quite a few of those things.

2044
02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:20.710
What does it stream it just,
and this is called the synapse.
This is a,

2045
02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:23.560
I'll look read this thing.
That's though,
oh,

2046
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:29.430
Darpa funded program develop electronic neuromorphic machine technology that

2047
02:07:29.891 --> 02:07:33.340
scales to biological levels more simply stated,

2048
02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:36.160
it is an attempt to build a new of computer with

2049
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.910
<v 2>similar form and function to the Mammalian brain.</v>

2050
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:44.740
Such artificial brains would be used to build robots whose intelligence matches

2051
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:49.360
that of mice and cats.
Jesus,
US Christ,
robot cats,

2052
02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.310
robot cats coming to get us.

2053
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:57.030
<v 1>Well,
they created something called the the Robo rat.
That was the first,</v>

2054
02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:01.400
um,
bio hybrid,
right?
So a bio hybrid is when you mix,
uh,

2055
02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:06.120
animal on a machine.
And Darpa was doing that,
um,

2056
02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:09.630
right before nine 11.
And people freaked out.
They were like,

2057
02:08:09.631 --> 02:08:14.631
you cannot put brain chips and rats and make them move through a maze by,

2058
02:08:15.271 --> 02:08:17.820
uh,
you know,
remote control,
which is what they were doing.

2059
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:21.900
And I interviewed the guys who are all working on this program before nine 11.

2060
02:08:22.590 --> 02:08:26.010
And so the,
the morality of the,

2061
02:08:26.370 --> 02:08:28.140
of the citizenry was like,
no.

2062
02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:33.650
Then nine 11 happened and suddenly all this money got pumped into Darpa to do

2063
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:38.640
anything they wanted.

2064
02:08:39.090 --> 02:08:42.810
The morality issue went out the window and they started creating all kinds of

2065
02:08:42.811 --> 02:08:47.770
bio hybrids as I write in the Pentagon sprain.
So they put,
um,
they,

2066
02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:51.690
they now have pigeons that are mixed,
you know,

2067
02:08:52.110 --> 02:08:57.000
animal and machine.
What they created something called,
there's a moth.

2068
02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:59.390
So there's a Manduka sex to moth,
that's what it's called,

2069
02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:01.470
a large mouth and sign Darpa,

2070
02:09:01.471 --> 02:09:05.460
scientists put brain chips into the larva.
Okay.

2071
02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:10.730
So that when it cocooned and became a flying moth,

2072
02:09:12.150 --> 02:09:13.650
it had the,

2073
02:09:14.850 --> 02:09:17.190
the chip built into its system,

2074
02:09:17.490 --> 02:09:22.490
making it easier to integrate and they could fly the moth around the lap.

2075
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:24.900
And that was a huge step.

2076
02:09:24.901 --> 02:09:28.670
And this is now four years ago that I was interviewing these scientists.
Did you,

2077
02:09:28.671 --> 02:09:32.100
what?
Did you see any of this stuff?
I didn't see them off,
but I,
I told you,

2078
02:09:32.101 --> 02:09:37.101
I saw that the limb regeneration lap was a trip and this is all spring on there.

2079
02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:41.010
Well they were just cutting limbs off of salamanders and watching the limbs grow

2080
02:09:41.011 --> 02:09:45.810
back.
Right.
And examining that and saying,
well,
if a salamander can do this,

2081
02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:49.350
so can we one day.
And I said to them,
but wait,
that's impossible.
You know?

2082
02:09:49.351 --> 02:09:54.090
And they said,
well,
it's not actually because humans have,
they broke.

2083
02:09:54.091 --> 02:09:57.600
I love scientists who break it down into terms I can understand.

2084
02:09:57.601 --> 02:10:01.590
It's like what Elon Musk did,
you know?
Yeah.
Right.
Cause,
and they said to me,

2085
02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.400
you were once a single cell in your mother's womb and then you were two and then

2086
02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:11.970
you were,
you know,
right.
So you can regenerate.

2087
02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:14.910
And that's their premise.
I mean,

2088
02:10:14.911 --> 02:10:18.180
these are the tops on the world's top scientists in regeneration.

2089
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:19.303
<v 2>What is this,
Jamie?</v>

2090
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:23.180
The moth being stimulated by electric occurrence in its abdomen.

2091
02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:26.660
So the stimulation of the electro occurrence,

2092
02:10:26.661 --> 02:10:29.720
they can cause it to go left or right.
Is that it?
Yeah,

2093
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:31.610
I was just looking up these bio hybrid moss,

2094
02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.190
who was the thing that you throw your hands in head like you're freaking

2095
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:37.790
<v 3>out.
Macaulay Culkin home alone in this and I was reading something and he went,</v>

2096
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.790
ah,
yeah.
I typed in as I started typing in bio hybrid stuff.

2097
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:44.330
And this is the first thing that popped up.
Was this a shrimp article?
Yeah,

2098
02:10:44.331 --> 02:10:47.690
it says through it.
They're going to test them through Olympic themed events.

2099
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:48.920
Oh my God.
Look at this.

2100
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.040
Darpa MTO seeks innovative proposals for the development of micro to Millie

2101
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:58.940
insect scale,
robotic technology shrimp were developed.
We'll develop.

2102
02:10:58.970 --> 02:11:03.110
Okay,
so shrimp is the an acronym problem,
right.
Okay.

2103
02:11:03.111 --> 02:11:05.330
Love an acronyms.
Uh,

2104
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:09.530
we'll develop and demonstrate through a series of Olympic themed events,

2105
02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:14.330
multifunctional m m to see em scale robotic platforms.

2106
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:19.130
So I guess that's millimeter or centimeter scale robotic platforms with a focus

2107
02:11:19.131 --> 02:11:24.080
on untethered mobility,
maneuverability,
and dexterity to achieve this goal.

2108
02:11:24.081 --> 02:11:29.081
Shrimp will also provide foundational research in the area of micro actual

2109
02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:34.900
actuator materials and enduring energy efficient power systems for extremely

2110
02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:40.310
swap capital,
letter s,
capital level,

2111
02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:43.010
w lowercase a,

2112
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:48.070
capital p constrained microbiotic systems they expect is such advances will be

2113
02:11:48.411 --> 02:11:52.640
enabling for applications including search and rescue.
Yeah,
right.

2114
02:11:52.641 --> 02:11:54.950
Search and rescue disaster.
Really.
Yay.

2115
02:11:54.951 --> 02:11:58.190
We're going to help people hazardous environment inspection or killing

2116
02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:01.730
motherfuckers with uh,
with an evil nuclear B.

2117
02:12:03.110 --> 02:12:06.470
That's all you need is always a search and rescue me that goes in your mouth and

2118
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:09.980
blows up.
Fuck.
That's crazy.

2119
02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:14.840
<v 1>I mean they do all kinds of planning for the future.
Yeah.</v>

2120
02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.330
The search and rescue thing is,
uh,
it's a great sort of,
you know,

2121
02:12:19.331 --> 02:12:22.870
way in which to present Darpa as doing all this great stuff.

2122
02:12:22.871 --> 02:12:26.320
I interviewed Darpa scientists who said,
look,
Andy,
we've got,

2123
02:12:26.321 --> 02:12:31.321
we're able to send robots into Fukushima to twist the cores.

2124
02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.360
And yes,
that is great.
But that's far from the only thing people,
right?
Yeah.

2125
02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:40.990
Well,
yeah,
but here's the trip.
Do you want to hear?
I mean,
sure it gets,

2126
02:12:41.290 --> 02:12:46.290
there are rabbit holes there because I sourced all these documents and also

2127
02:12:47.411 --> 02:12:50.860
interviewed generals at the Pentagon who were like,
we don't like a AI.

2128
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.360
We want like,
we want this,
we want our guys on the ground.
You know,

2129
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:59.170
they believe in the human,
the warrior,
that concept.

2130
02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:03.580
And so the generals were very opposed with the Darpa took a of a vote and it was

2131
02:13:03.581 --> 02:13:08.110
like,
no AI.
We want humans in the mix.
And so what a Darpa start doing,

2132
02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.110
and they are the generals.
They said,
why don't you,

2133
02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:13.330
why can't we go more autonomous?

2134
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.130
And the answer was we don't trust the machines.
Okay.

2135
02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:21.790
So right around that same time,
what a Darpa start doing,

2136
02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:27.060
it started looking into and hiring scientists who were working with how trust

2137
02:13:27.821 --> 02:13:32.160
works in the brain,
specifically with what is called the moral molecule.

2138
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.930
And it's this molecule in the brain that mothers emit when they're
breastfeeding.

2139
02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.650
Okay.
Oxytocin.
Yes.
So think about that.

2140
02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:43.710
And I mean that's like the ultimate going way back biology.

2141
02:13:43.711 --> 02:13:48.590
Like you have to have a mother,
a trusting mother to breastfeed in,
you know,

2142
02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:52.020
pre history or otherwise you'd be eaten by,
you'd be like,
this is a bad idea.

2143
02:13:52.021 --> 02:13:54.720
I'm stopping to do this,
I'm going to die.
Right?
Right.

2144
02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:57.990
So they examined that molecule,

2145
02:13:58.150 --> 02:14:00.300
the brain's moral molecule,

2146
02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:04.380
and they began a program to work with that,

2147
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:08.280
to be able to give that to soldiers so that they're,

2148
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:11.130
that they trusted AI machines.

2149
02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:14.910
And that's where I think you're getting into a really spooky,

2150
02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:19.940
dark multilevels of manipulation about what humans want versus what the Pentagon

2151
02:14:21.601 --> 02:14:22.980
ones.
Wow.

2152
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:26.820
<v 3>Don't worry about trusting the machines.</v>

2153
02:14:26.821 --> 02:14:29.970
Scares the shit out of me because that's what everyone's worried about when it

2154
02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:34.090
comes to AI.
Like that's what Elon Musk keeps warning people about,

2155
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:37.920
that these things are going to have superhuman capabilities and they're going to

2156
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:39.390
be sentient.
And it's a matter of when.

2157
02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:43.090
<v 1>Absolutely.
So I,
I as the journalist said to myself,
well,
wait a minute,</v>

2158
02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:46.750
if the generals at the Pentagon and um,
you know,
that's a,
that's a euphemism,

2159
02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:50.080
but the meaning that the actual opera,
you know,

2160
02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:53.150
the guys that are in charge here don't want that.
Who does want this?
Right.

2161
02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:56.860
And where am I research took me to was the group that wants,

2162
02:14:56.861 --> 02:14:59.080
that is what's called the defense science board.

2163
02:14:59.590 --> 02:15:04.590
And those are the individuals who are counseling the Pentagon in the manner in

2164
02:15:04.811 --> 02:15:05.830
which they should proceed.

2165
02:15:06.130 --> 02:15:11.130
And now those individuals are all sitting on the boards of the defense

2166
02:15:11.501 --> 02:15:12.370
contractors.

2167
02:15:12.850 --> 02:15:17.110
So you can really see how money drives the rubric.

2168
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:19.810
The generals don't want it,
the humans don't want it.

2169
02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.730
But guess who does the people who stand to make the money creating the

2170
02:15:24.731 --> 02:15:25.810
autonomous systems.

2171
02:15:26.230 --> 02:15:30.580
And that's exactly what Eisenhower warned us of [inaudible] in his farewell

2172
02:15:30.581 --> 02:15:32.500
speech.
You know,
the military industrial complex.

2173
02:15:32.710 --> 02:15:35.890
And the other part of that speech,
which people don't,

2174
02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:40.810
don't know as well,
is that what he said,
his antidote,
Eisenhower said this,

2175
02:15:40.811 --> 02:15:45.370
the antidote to the military industrial complex is an alert and knowledgeable

2176
02:15:45.371 --> 02:15:47.800
citizenry.
It's why I write my books.

2177
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:52.300
Because an alert and knowledgeable citizenry has the ability to kind of push

2178
02:15:52.301 --> 02:15:54.760
back and go,
but we don't want that.

2179
02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:57.330
<v 3>I think what we're worried about is Pandora's box,</v>

2180
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:01.140
right with when it comes to AI.
And we're worried that,
first of all,

2181
02:16:01.141 --> 02:16:04.080
if we're not the ones to open it,
what if they open it all right?

2182
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:08.310
What if the Chinese open it now and obviously their technology is super,

2183
02:16:08.311 --> 02:16:09.180
super advanced.

2184
02:16:09.181 --> 02:16:13.650
I mean their electronic technology particular their cell phones or cutting edge,

2185
02:16:13.651 --> 02:16:17.520
I mean apple and all these other companies are struggling to try to keep up with

2186
02:16:17.521 --> 02:16:21.390
Walway.
And these one fc are a one m x.

2187
02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:26.400
What is the fucking one?
S t what does that one,
what does that big company

2188
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:30.430
that uh,
they just released some,

2189
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:35.460
they've just hired Robert Downey jr to gave him millions of dollars to on one

2190
02:16:35.711 --> 02:16:38.540
plus one plus seven.
They have this,
uh,

2191
02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:41.950
new phone that doesn't have a front facing camera.
You press a button,

2192
02:16:41.951 --> 02:16:45.310
it slides out of the top.
They figured out a way to make it the entire phone,

2193
02:16:45.311 --> 02:16:49.960
all screen.
And they are incredibly advanced in terms of their electronics.
We,

2194
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:54.961
we deeply are concerned that they're going to be the ones that implement

2195
02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:57.610
military autonomous,

2196
02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:00.640
sentient robotics before we do.

2197
02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:06.120
Cause then you can essentially you can launch them with no physical human costs

2198
02:17:06.491 --> 02:17:08.930
on your side.
And yeah,
I mean they,
they,

2199
02:17:08.931 --> 02:17:13.450
they are literally weapons of mass destruction if you have robots that can go

2200
02:17:13.451 --> 02:17:14.620
over there and just kill people

2201
02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:18.680
<v 1>and,
and what they need for that is the world's fastest supercomputer.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

2202
02:17:18.810 --> 02:17:21.420
And what's interesting is that we just,
we,

2203
02:17:21.421 --> 02:17:24.840
America just overtook the Chinese in having,
again,

2204
02:17:24.841 --> 02:17:26.400
having the world's fastest supercomputer,

2205
02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:29.910
but they had it for a couple of years and think about this.
Okay.

2206
02:17:29.911 --> 02:17:33.450
Cause you were saying hard to believe the Nazis were only,
you know,

2207
02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:37.410
not even like just in just in our grandfather's age.
Right.
Yeah.

2208
02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.910
So go back in time to then listen to this about this really freaked me out in

2209
02:17:41.911 --> 02:17:44.610
terms of progress.
Right after the war,

2210
02:17:44.611 --> 02:17:48.930
a guy called John von Neumann got a grant from the Atomic Energy Commission to

2211
02:17:48.931 --> 02:17:51.240
essentially build the word world's first computer.

2212
02:17:51.241 --> 02:17:55.020
I mean they existed but he built the first computer that could actually do

2213
02:17:55.021 --> 02:17:56.610
calculations.
Okay.

2214
02:17:56.910 --> 02:18:00.870
Before that calculations were done with like buy calculators,
computers.

2215
02:18:00.871 --> 02:18:01.704
We're humans.

2216
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:06.780
But there's this amazing story of anointment in the basement of the Princeton

2217
02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:09.600
Institute for advanced study where he built this computer with government funds

2218
02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:12.330
and he,
cause he was a brilliant polymath,

2219
02:18:12.331 --> 02:18:15.990
he could add faster than anyone around him.
Okay.

2220
02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:19.770
He's also the guy who calculated at what level the atomic bomb should explode

2221
02:18:19.771 --> 02:18:23.850
over Hiroshima for the most blast.
Okay.
Cause it didn't hit the ground.

2222
02:18:23.851 --> 02:18:26.460
It wouldn't kill as many people.
Right.
So this is how his mind worked.

2223
02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:28.710
So he's faster than the computer.

2224
02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:32.160
He has a pen and paper in front of him and he can outperform the worlds fastest

2225
02:18:32.161 --> 02:18:33.540
computer with his own brain.

2226
02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:38.840
Two and a half years into it and like 1949 the computer beat him and he made a

2227
02:18:41.251 --> 02:18:46.251
statement then that said one day artificially intelligent machines will be the

2228
02:18:48.091 --> 02:18:51.000
ruin of man.
I mean I'm paraphrasing.
Yeah,
that was his prediction.

2229
02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:53.220
But that was in 1949

2230
02:18:53.650 --> 02:18:57.400
<v 3>in the fifties Marshall Mcluhan said that we are the sex organs of the machine</v>

2231
02:18:57.401 --> 02:19:02.170
world.
I'm going to have to really think about that.
That's a deep one.

2232
02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:04.010
That is very deep.
Yeah,

2233
02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:09.070
we are the propagators or we're the ones who are progenitors.

2234
02:19:09.071 --> 02:19:10.810
Yeah,
that's it.
That's our baby.

2235
02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.660
We're going to make that baby and then we're going to die.

2236
02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.640
Most likely that's going to be the new living things were said that Marshall

2237
02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.670
Mcluhan.
Yeah,

2238
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:25.190
let's stop and think about that.

2239
02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:30.200
So figuring that out in the 50s so looking around and going,
oh,

2240
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:34.710
<v 1>we're given birth to these things that I have a question for you then on that</v>

2241
02:19:34.711 --> 02:19:37.900
morality issue,
right?
Which is okay,

2242
02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.870
if man has always been a warring animal,
right.

2243
02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:49.840
Why do we look so down upon the throat,

2244
02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:50.231
you know,

2245
02:19:50.231 --> 02:19:55.231
the knife to the throat and why do we as a society except drone strikes?

2246
02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:58.870
Cause that's the whole question I ask and surprise,
kill,

2247
02:19:58.871 --> 02:20:03.871
vanish and I'm not sure I answered it to my own satisfaction because it's such a

2248
02:20:04.511 --> 02:20:05.620
complicated question.

2249
02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:10.380
<v 3>Well one of them is very personal.
The other one is like a video game,</v>

2250
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.670
you know,

2251
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:14.970
to to stab someone to look them in the eye and and shove a knife through the

2252
02:20:14.971 --> 02:20:17.630
ribs.
That's a six different kind of person.

2253
02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:19.620
We don't think we want that person around us.

2254
02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:23.740
<v 1>Interesting.
You think it's a proximity issue?
Oh it's,</v>

2255
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:26.270
<v 3>it's just different.</v>

2256
02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:30.920
You know one of them is throwing a rock at someone that's nowhere near you.

2257
02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:34.720
The other one is beating and got a death when he's right in front of you there.

2258
02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:35.450
One,

2259
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:40.220
it's very personal and you see someone struggling and we don't like to think

2260
02:20:40.221 --> 02:20:44.840
that someone can put that aside and still twist that blade.
We don't want that.

2261
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:49.040
We don't want that on our side.
We don't want our people to be noble and Justin.

2262
02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:53.340
But meanwhile when it comes to civilian casualties,

2263
02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:57.360
drones are one of the worst invention ever in human history.

2264
02:20:57.750 --> 02:21:02.750
If we really want to examine ourselves in terms of advocacy and the moral,

2265
02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:06.810
moral,
high ground terms of engagement,

2266
02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:09.780
like launching missiles at apartment buildings.

2267
02:21:09.781 --> 02:21:14.670
Cause you found metadata in there that indicates that most likely an al Qaeda

2268
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:18.330
operative has a cell phone in that building.
Like that.

2269
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:22.080
That's some shit that people have done.
I mean that has been done.

2270
02:21:22.081 --> 02:21:27.081
And the casualty rate for civilians when it comes to drone strikes for innocent

2271
02:21:27.211 --> 02:21:29.250
civilians is stunning.

2272
02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:34.050
I think it's in the high 80% I think that's,

2273
02:21:34.470 --> 02:21:38.220
we've done this before,
right?
Have it wing.
I think it's um,
it's,

2274
02:21:38.490 --> 02:21:39.900
it's a disturbing,

2275
02:21:39.930 --> 02:21:43.980
I might be conservative by saying it's in the 80s it might be in the 90s it's a

2276
02:21:43.981 --> 02:21:48.180
disturbingly high number of people who died who were not the intended target.

2277
02:21:48.210 --> 02:21:49.043
Right.

2278
02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:53.630
<v 1>Which would,
which would be an argument for the blade for the blade.</v>

2279
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:54.471
The blade is,

2280
02:21:54.471 --> 02:21:59.210
you know who you're stabbing and at that warrior is going in there aware that he

2281
02:21:59.211 --> 02:22:01.520
to my di,
what do you got Jamie?

2282
02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:02.990
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2283
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:07.070
<v 3>What's that phase?
3% 3% what?
That's what this says.</v>

2284
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:11.870
That's the Porsche now who released that?
Maybe 3% accuracy.
No,

2285
02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:12.650
I know there was,

2286
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:17.150
there's been some serious discussions amongst scholars about this.

2287
02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:20.840
Yeah,
that's not true.
Whatever you read in there can't be right.
Yeah.

2288
02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:23.060
So just one operation was 3%

2289
02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:26.940
<v 1>just to throw this out there,
because there is that big debate.
I mean,
CIA,</v>

2290
02:22:26.970 --> 02:22:30.420
paramilitary,
army,
tiny.
Yeah.
Defense Department.

2291
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:34.920
Huge CIA using either ground operators or drones.

2292
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:38.340
Defense Department.
I read this test statistic the other day,

2293
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:44.480
7,200 and change bombs dropped on Afghanistan last year.

2294
02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:47.101
I mean,

2295
02:22:47.101 --> 02:22:52.101
people don't even realize we're still 77,000 that says

2296
02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:55.200
<v 3>practicing.
Here it goes,</v>

2297
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:57.630
Hi President Donald Trump provoked a requirement.

2298
02:22:57.631 --> 02:23:00.810
The U S intelligence officials publicly report the number of civilian killed in

2299
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:04.920
drone strikes and other attacks on terrorist targets outside of wars on,
oh,

2300
02:23:04.921 --> 02:23:06.570
so we're going to get shit information now,

2301
02:23:06.810 --> 02:23:11.560
but pull up 2017 I don't know.

2302
02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.920
<v 1>You have to fight.
Well,
you got to really look hard to get that statistic.</v>

2303
02:23:14.921 --> 02:23:19.090
There's an inspector general who covers Afghanistan,
right?
For the government.

2304
02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:21.790
He looks at all the statistics and by the way,

2305
02:23:21.791 --> 02:23:24.280
this administration just canceled his job.

2306
02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:26.190
So we will no longer have that information yet,

2307
02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:30.250
but he's the one that is in charge of reporting that cause it's called the

2308
02:23:30.251 --> 02:23:32.140
reconstruction effort.
Right.

2309
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:36.160
But that number of bombs really makes you think long and hard or at least me

2310
02:23:36.161 --> 02:23:39.260
about,
you know,
the big footprint.
Yeah.

2311
02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:43.690
Versus the small um,
operation.
Um,

2312
02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.621
and I again,

2313
02:23:44.621 --> 02:23:47.200
I think this is why most people don't want to talk about this because it's a

2314
02:23:47.201 --> 02:23:49.190
dark rabbit hole to go down.
You know,

2315
02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:54.780
people prefer to believe that we're just safe and sound here and not,

2316
02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:59.380
not at risk.
And I mean that's,
that's the endless question of are these,

2317
02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:02.470
are these threats real and must they be dealt with?

2318
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:07.590
<v 3>What's very hard for people to IX to be 100% aware of something they're not</v>

2319
02:24:08.531 --> 02:24:10.210
experiencing?
Right.

2320
02:24:10.211 --> 02:24:14.020
And right now we're not experiencing a war currently in our,

2321
02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:18.460
in our neighborhoods,
but yet it is happening overseas in the United States,

2322
02:24:18.461 --> 02:24:20.230
technically is involved in these wars.

2323
02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:25.860
And I think that right now we're dot experiencing sentient robots running

2324
02:24:25.871 --> 02:24:29.950
through the streets,
murdering people.
But that could happen.

2325
02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:33.670
We're not experiencing Nazi Germany anymore.
We,
we've got past that,

2326
02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:35.860
we'd like to assume that that's in the past.

2327
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:40.990
But if you just looked at the vast amount of history that's dedicated to

2328
02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.190
atrocities that are committed by armies against their enemies,

2329
02:24:45.490 --> 02:24:49.360
it seems like that's just what people do.
It seems it's a part of what people do.

2330
02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:54.730
And if there is a real technological race in order to develop autonomous,

2331
02:24:54.731 --> 02:24:57.850
sentient robots that are capable of killing people,

2332
02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:03.040
we should be fucking horrified.
And who are you most afraid of?
China.
China,

2333
02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:04.660
100% well the,
you know,
they keep,

2334
02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.040
they keep outperforming us in that super computer.

2335
02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:11.380
They also have a total integration of their government and their industry.

2336
02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:15.940
You know,
that everything is connected.
It's not like us,
you know,
like the gut.

2337
02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:18.850
Like they like they'll play the long game.

2338
02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:24.210
They're strategic in their ability to plan things and not have them be currently

2339
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:31.210
profitable.
They don't have to operate on a bottom line.
Like a,

2340
02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:33.310
someone who is beholden to stock owners

2341
02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:37.150
<v 1>and they don't have an informed public</v>

2342
02:25:37.330 --> 02:25:41.330
<v 3>yes at all.
I mean they have Google censorship.
I mean they've,</v>

2343
02:25:41.331 --> 02:25:44.770
they convince Google to go over there and I was talking to an executive at

2344
02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:48.460
Google and they were saying essentially we're willing to let them sensor because

2345
02:25:48.461 --> 02:25:50.330
we know we're gonna,
they're gonna just,

2346
02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:53.620
they're gonna do what they want to do anyway.

2347
02:25:53.621 --> 02:25:58.621
They're going to copy all of our information and just redo Google in like least

2348
02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:03.190
think at least this way we will protect our interest by being over there.

2349
02:26:03.390 --> 02:26:07.270
Am I do not crazy.
That sounds.
You're going to let the Chinese government help.

2350
02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:09.100
You're going to help them censor people

2351
02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:13.430
<v 1>on an interesting note of that in the mirror.</v>

2352
02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:17.840
All my books are published in China.
Whoa.
Like the Darpa book,

2353
02:26:17.841 --> 02:26:20.990
they were right on that.
They had that translated into Chinese.

2354
02:26:21.350 --> 02:26:24.020
I have a copy of it.
It's spooky.
It's like you see the Pentagon,

2355
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:27.890
all this Chinese writing,
I don't understand a word of it except for my own name.

2356
02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:32.870
Head.
Wow.
But it's like,
wow,
they're reading.

2357
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:36.500
They're reading us.
Of course.
You know anything.
I mean there's those.

2358
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:37.760
Anything that makes us look bad.

2359
02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:41.270
There is an interesting story about the freedom of Information Act and Iran,

2360
02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:45.170
which came to mind with this new activity and around which is that they filed a

2361
02:26:45.171 --> 02:26:50.171
FOIA to get all the information that that we had on Iran and the government.

2362
02:26:51.021 --> 02:26:55.840
It went to when very high up in the judicial system to say we're not going to

2363
02:26:55.850 --> 02:26:59.270
release this information to them even though they had the right to have it

2364
02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:00.890
because it would benefit them.

2365
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:02.700
<v 3>Well,
we brought the pull up.
Yeah,</v>

2366
02:27:02.850 --> 02:27:05.460
<v 5>I found a couple of my better information.
Um,</v>

2367
02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:08.730
I might've misread that it said that something I just found showed something

2368
02:27:08.731 --> 02:27:13.731
like only 2% are the high target district are the targets and the rest would be

2369
02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:18.780
severe children,
civilians,
but other combatants too.

2370
02:27:18.781 --> 02:27:19.740
There might be other soldiers,

2371
02:27:19.741 --> 02:27:23.190
but I'm part of the reason I've got to get rid of that.
Sorry.

2372
02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:28.440
Part of the reason on why the strikes things has changed is because the Trump

2373
02:27:28.441 --> 02:27:31.590
administration is carried out way more than the Obama administration ever did

2374
02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:32.453
over eight years.

2375
02:27:33.330 --> 02:27:36.090
<v 3>Well,
I think the Trump basically told the military,
you know what you're doing.</v>

2376
02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:37.850
Do you just go do it?
I mean,

2377
02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:42.120
basically let them just run the military instead of having the same sort of

2378
02:27:42.121 --> 02:27:46.380
oversight that other presidents insisted upon and the military people like him

2379
02:27:46.381 --> 02:27:47.214
for that

2380
02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:50.580
<v 1>and people aren't focused or interested in drone strikes anymore.</v>

2381
02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.940
They're more interested in the wall and watching the,
the battle and the,
yeah,

2382
02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:57.800
the conflict and the name calling and the shouting.
It's like,

2383
02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.260
it's like throwing rocks without warfare.
You know,

2384
02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.220
China's making robots to kill us.
Absolutely.
No,
right.
Oh,

2385
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:07.930
<v 3>Chinese people,
please be nice.
This was the thing.
What does this say?
Okay.</v>

2386
02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.930
US drone strikes fighting isis in Iraq and Syria have killed at least 1,257

2387
02:28:13.931 --> 02:28:15.610
civilians according to the Pentagon.

2388
02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:21.000
Air Wars estimate the number to be as great as 7,500 this year only.
Yeah.

2389
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:25.610
Just this year has a gene.
Yeah,
they are.
They're doing a weird thing.

2390
02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:30.290
They are shooting people from a remote location with a robot.

2391
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:35.990
<v 1>That all came to be,
by the way,
right after nine 11 I mean when,</v>

2392
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:38.530
whenever we get attacked,
it's like Pearl Harbor.
You know,

2393
02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:43.580
suddenly there is a massive swing of what civilians,

2394
02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:47.120
what the citizenry will tolerate.
Sure.
Yeah.
And first surprise kill vantage.

2395
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:49.520
I interviewed,
I told you lawyer John Rizzo,

2396
02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:54.521
who wrote what was called the 17 September 17th memorandum of notification and

2397
02:28:56.121 --> 02:29:01.121
it gave presidential powers to the degree which had not been seen since,

2398
02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.480
you know,
the worst part of the Cold War.

2399
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:08.000
And Congress rode off on that.
In fact,

2400
02:29:08.001 --> 02:29:11.570
what Rizzo told me is the gang of eight that are in charge of,
you know,

2401
02:29:11.571 --> 02:29:14.840
the intelligence committees in Congress said,
is this enough?

2402
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:20.230
And that's where the drones became such a big issue because the idea of

2403
02:29:21.021 --> 02:29:25.100
preemptive neutralization,
the idea,
we're going to take out bad guys,
you know,

2404
02:29:25.101 --> 02:29:27.950
we should have taken up in Lawton and we didn't.
Yeah.
Um,

2405
02:29:28.010 --> 02:29:30.980
we're going to now do that preemptively and it set off,

2406
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:35.570
it's set us on this entirely different course,
which continues to this day,

2407
02:29:35.571 --> 02:29:37.850
although it's fallen out of the news,

2408
02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:42.740
which is let's strike someone before they strike us.

2409
02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:46.940
And it's such an interesting chicken or the egg because you know,

2410
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.950
yes you have civilians dying and yes you have more terrorists being created.

2411
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:53.540
On the other hand,

2412
02:29:53.541 --> 02:29:58.541
do you really want the Pentagon dropping (740) 030-0200 bombs on Afghanistan in

2413
02:30:00.021 --> 02:30:00.854
any given year

2414
02:30:01.310 --> 02:30:03.450
<v 3>and it seems so detached.</v>

2415
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:08.280
Whereas if you sent someone over there to assassinate these guys with the knife,

2416
02:30:08.970 --> 02:30:11.520
you would think of that,
I don't want that person in my neighborhood.

2417
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:13.290
That person is willing to stab somebody

2418
02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:17.400
<v 1>and what are the unintended consequences of that?
And we never even know.</v>

2419
02:30:17.430 --> 02:30:20.070
You know,
I'll tell you an interesting story that's not in the book,

2420
02:30:20.071 --> 02:30:24.630
which is that Billy Walsh showed me a number of plans that he had presented

2421
02:30:24.631 --> 02:30:27.330
because sometimes the operators are asked like,
what do you think we should do?

2422
02:30:27.331 --> 02:30:31.140
And it doesn't mean we do it is just that those plans get sent up the chain of

2423
02:30:31.141 --> 02:30:33.870
command and then it comes back.
So he said,

2424
02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:38.460
he showed me these drawings,
they were going to go kill Chavez,
right?

2425
02:30:38.461 --> 02:30:43.310
This is when Bush was in power and you know,
he was like teaming up with um,

2426
02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:46.710
Ahmadinejad and he was really bad guide,
you know,
a threat to us.

2427
02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:51.540
And so the plan was to halo in,
um,
take the team down,

2428
02:30:51.541 --> 02:30:56.340
go kill Chavez and vanish and the plans got rejected.
They were like,
no way.

2429
02:30:56.341 --> 02:30:58.500
We are not doing this according to Billy Wall.

2430
02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:02.850
Well Billy was said to me recently,
I mean,
thank God we didn't do that.

2431
02:31:02.851 --> 02:31:04.740
Can you imagine if we had,

2432
02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:09.860
we would be blamed right now for everything that is going on in Venezuela.

2433
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:14.220
It's a really interesting point.
I mean,
who has to make that decision?

2434
02:31:14.221 --> 02:31:18.090
I'm glad it's not me.
Can you imagine?
No,
yes.
Kill this guy,

2435
02:31:18.091 --> 02:31:20.610
but don't kill that guy.
That's a good idea.
Yeah,

2436
02:31:23.610 --> 02:31:28.140
<v 3>it's intense and it's the world we live in that we don't discuss and we don't</v>

2437
02:31:28.141 --> 02:31:31.890
think about because it doesn't affect our daily lives in terms of like,

2438
02:31:31.891 --> 02:31:33.930
it's not something you,
it's unavoidable,

2439
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:38.090
<v 1>but I think it's super interesting because it also comes back to your own</v>

2440
02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:41.930
humanness,
right?
What are you making judgments about?

2441
02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:45.800
What are you for or against and why are you really,

2442
02:31:46.280 --> 02:31:49.550
are you really,
do you,
do you want that opinion?
I mean,

2443
02:31:49.551 --> 02:31:51.710
I think that's so interesting and important and,
and,

2444
02:31:51.730 --> 02:31:56.210
and discuss it with your children,
you know,
and let people have my,

2445
02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:00.590
my favorite expression is just as long as you don't make me do it,
you know,

2446
02:32:00.730 --> 02:32:04.100
I'm pretty tolerant of other people's opinions about things.

2447
02:32:04.101 --> 02:32:08.540
Don't force me into it.
Yeah.
But this stuff impacts all of us.
It really does.

2448
02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:13.610
Really does how the robot's going to be taken over your show,
Joe?
No.

2449
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:17.670
<v 3>No.
Well they probably could</v>

2450
02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:20.180
to a certain extent.

2451
02:32:20.181 --> 02:32:23.840
I don't think robots are currently capable of spontaneous humor.

2452
02:32:25.430 --> 02:32:28.280
Right.
That's the only thing saving a person like me.

2453
02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:31.160
<v 1>Oh,
there's nothing funny about it.</v>

2454
02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:35.420
<v 3>Drown.
No,
not yet.
But what is the difference too?</v>

2455
02:32:35.421 --> 02:32:38.710
Wet ware and hardware and silicon based,
you know,

2456
02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:40.690
interactions like if,

2457
02:32:40.691 --> 02:32:44.890
if there's a computer that can beat the greatest chess masters and then they

2458
02:32:44.891 --> 02:32:47.260
have it and then the greatest go master now too,

2459
02:32:47.261 --> 02:32:50.500
which they thought was even more complex than people just get destroyed by these

2460
02:32:50.501 --> 02:32:52.580
computers now.
Like,
what,
what,

2461
02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:56.320
what makes us think that creativity is so unique and special?

2462
02:32:56.321 --> 02:32:59.680
I think what separates us really is our biological instincts.

2463
02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:05.160
And that these are things that are programmed into our DNA over thousands of

2464
02:33:05.350 --> 02:33:08.770
years of survival that this is,
these are the things you have to worry about.

2465
02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:11.890
This is the information we have and uh,
act on that.

2466
02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:15.820
<v 1>That's our intuition.
Trust you,
should I trust it?
Should I not?</v>

2467
02:33:15.821 --> 02:33:19.090
And you take that out of the equation,
really bad things could happen.

2468
02:33:19.210 --> 02:33:22.030
<v 3>Yeah.
I born,
I worry,</v>

2469
02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:25.780
I worry that we're creating a thing that's going to surpass us.

2470
02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:27.670
But I think that that's inevitable.
I mean,

2471
02:33:27.671 --> 02:33:31.120
if I was a champ and I was worried about becoming a person,
I should probably,

2472
02:33:31.121 --> 02:33:32.890
you know,
seem silly.
It's inevitable.

2473
02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:37.610
<v 1>You want to hear the scariest Ai Story.
I know.
Oh,
it's old,
right?</v>

2474
02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.740
It's like an dim,
the lights turn the candle on,

2475
02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:43.220
but it's from like the early days,
gather round children.

2476
02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:46.610
This is like early days of Darpa.
Okay.

2477
02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:51.830
And this is when we were really seriously afraid that the Russians were going to

2478
02:33:51.831 --> 02:33:53.030
send,
you know,

2479
02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:57.290
a hundred thermo nuclear warheads at Washington and take out the whole country.

2480
02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:01.640
Okay.
Right?
So Darpa sets up this station at the top of the world,

2481
02:34:02.330 --> 02:34:06.950
um,
to monitor the Soviet launch.
So that,
you know,

2482
02:34:06.951 --> 02:34:11.951
cause it only takes 24 minutes for an ICBM to get from the launch pad in Russia

2483
02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:18.220
to hit New York or Washington.
Okay.
So we up the station up there,

2484
02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.740
um,
and to monitor this so we would have some kind of a jump on this.
Okay.

2485
02:34:23.741 --> 02:34:27.670
Like we'd learned at about eight minutes.
My God,
you know,
it was a radar station.

2486
02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:33.240
That station called the beam moves site or Jay site is connected to the no rad

2487
02:34:33.341 --> 02:34:36.760
station in Cheyenne Mountain,
you know the one from the movies.
Right.
Okay.

2488
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:42.510
And it's like the first week of business and the guys that are sitting there in

2489
02:34:42.881 --> 02:34:46.720
the station looking for the alert are sitting there and they've been trained.

2490
02:34:46.721 --> 02:34:50.650
Like the alerts never go off.
And all of a sudden the alerts go from one,
two,

2491
02:34:50.651 --> 02:34:53.170
three,
four.
Number five is end game.
Okay.

2492
02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:58.440
So the information that the technicians are getting is now 1000 Soviet thermo

2493
02:34:59.531 --> 02:35:04.531
nuclear missiles are on their way to Washington DC with 99.9% certainty.

2494
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.830
Actual story.
Okay,
the guy panics,
but he trusts,
he says,
wait a minute,
you know,

2495
02:35:11.831 --> 02:35:13.510
cause he's supposed to now give a launch code,

2496
02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:15.610
let's try and get the generals on the phone.

2497
02:35:15.611 --> 02:35:17.890
They can't get the Pentagon general in charge of no Rad.

2498
02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:22.600
They get a Canadian guy named general Sleeman and slim and you know,

2499
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:26.020
my God,
we should we launch,
should we launch Slamon's like wait a minute.

2500
02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:31.650
Human thought he remembered that the night before he thought he saw Khrushchev

2501
02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:37.060
on TV at the UN.
You know him,
he's famously banging his shoe and he says,

2502
02:35:37.061 --> 02:35:40.510
where's Cruise Jeff?
Right now they check.
He's in New York City.

2503
02:35:40.690 --> 02:35:45.460
Why would the Soviets send a thousand nuclear weapons are away while their own

2504
02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.790
leaders in New York?
I said,
I don't know sir,

2505
02:35:48.791 --> 02:35:51.880
but the radar returns are reporting this and they're,

2506
02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:57.420
so someone had the idea at that be mu site to go outside and Lo and behold,

2507
02:35:59.231 --> 02:36:02.080
what was there a big full moon.

2508
02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.470
The system was reading the moon,

2509
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:10.500
moving and misinterpreted it as a thousand nuclear thermo nuclear ICB,

2510
02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:16.510
BMS coming crummy didn't launch.

2511
02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:19.930
So we came that close to the end of the world.
I mean,

2512
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:23.290
it's an astonishing story.
The documents are now declassified,
