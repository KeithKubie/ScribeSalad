00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.840
From cars that talk
to us when we're

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.840
lost, to houses that know when
we're too hot or too cold,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.080
to phones that can
take our vital signs

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.470
and notify your
doctor, mobile apps

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.940
can do anything and everything.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.076
What do you want your
app to do for your users?

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.450
Answering this
question will help

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.317
you decide what data to measure
and what insights you need.

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.150
With Google Analytics,
you have of a variety

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.330
of tools and
capabilities to give you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.050
data about your
business and audience

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.759
so you can optimize
your app for success.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.470
Be sure to spend
some time thinking

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.930
about what you need
to know about how

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.880
users interact with your app.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.090
What insights would help
your app be smarter?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.250
For example, if by
level two in a game

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.730
you've already lost over
50% of your traffic,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.230
you'll need to take
a look at what's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.090
happening for users while
playing that first level.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.940
Depending on what
the analytics show,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.760
you may want to add an
additional tutorial,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.660
or make the levels
easier or shorter.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.300
Here are some other questions
you may want to ask.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.290
How many installs has
your app generated?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.970
How much does each
download cost you?

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.730
Where did your
downloads come from?

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.430
Are your users high quality
and loyal to your app?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.270
Do you want to achieve a
certain engagement time?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.360
If you make a few tweaks
to your app interface,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.010
would people be more
or less engaged?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.660
When's the best time to
offer in-app purchases?

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.959
What's your user retention rate?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.500
Whatever insights
you're looking for,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.290
Google Analytics gives
you the data you need.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.280
And Google Analytics
integrates directly with AdMob,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880
helping you understand your
users and their behavior

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.390
right in the AdMob interface.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.084
By implementing Google
Analytics in your mobile app,

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:41.750
you can start collecting
data for things

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.670
like audience analytics,
attribution modeling,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.766
conversion tracking,
and even re-marketing.

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.390
With Google Analytics,
you can find out

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.970
how often your app is
downloaded and installed,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.440
and how successful certain
marketing campaigns are

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.590
in attracting visitors.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.190
Want to know how users
are finding your app?

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.540
Google Analytics provides
app specific metrics

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.970
so you can learn more about
your user acquisition.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.940
Google Analytics helps
you answer questions

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.830
like which operating
system do my new users use,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.240
and where are they
located geographically?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.400
Which traffic sources are
bringing the most new users?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.780
What is my cost per
download, broken down

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380
by each of my
marketing initiatives?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.220
What's the ROI of my
marketing efforts?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.954
You can access information
about the campaigns

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:29.120
that you're running via the
advertising and campaign

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.660
performance report.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.640
There you can find data about
all traffic sources and gain

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.870
insight into how many new users
and downloads each campaign

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.700
generated, the
number of sessions

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.332
that took place, the
average session duration,

00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:44.540
as well as whether or not
you're achieving your goals

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.070
and generating revenue.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.030
OK.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.620
So now you have successfully
gained new users

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.990
and are growing
your app downloads.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.060
But now what?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.030
After people discover
your app, it's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.390
key to understand
their behavior.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.030
How are they engaging
with your app?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.540
What actions are they taking?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.700
Are they doing what
you want them to do?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.860
What are they purchasing?

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.267
How is this related
back to their behavior?

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.600
Answering these questions
will help you monitor and grow

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.660
your app success.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.930
Google Analytics helps
you do just this,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.010
by defining user segments based
on any metric or dimension

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.040
being measured in your app.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.122
So using conditions
and sequences,

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:25.580
you can create
segments that are as

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.935
detailed and specific as
you'd like them to be.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.000
You can apply these segments
on all of your reports

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.900
within Google Analytics.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.680
So here's an example.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.130
You can create a
segment of users

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.010
who have, say, spent at
least $10 in your app

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.870
and engaged with it at least
once in the last 30 days.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.640
From there, you could apply this
to any Google Analytics report,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.960
such as the e-commerce
product performance report.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.030
And that will allow you to
see which items the users

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.350
are actually spending
their money on.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.040
Another example,
suppose you want

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.950
to find out which section
of your app is most popular.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.660
You can then use
this information

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.190
to create similar content.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.970
With the behavior
reports, you can

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.520
find lots of
valuable information

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.170
about user activity,
from aggregate metrics,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.020
such as average time spent
on a particular screen,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.790
to the behavior flow, which
helps you understand how users

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.010
move between different screens,
to the crashes and exceptions

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.579
report.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.400
So let's say we're looking
at the behavior flow report.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.730
What you might notice is that
there are big areas where

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.580
people are dropping off.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.650
So based on this
data, you might try

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.300
to improve these
areas so that people

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.780
are less likely to leave
your app before completing

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.190
the task you'd like them to.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.510
If you sell products in your
app via in-app purchases

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.670
or on your own
store, you'll also

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.780
want to keep track of
what people are buying.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.610
With the e-commerce
functionality,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.400
you can gain insight into the
customer's path to purchase,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.860
like when customers
added items to the cart,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.060
began the checkout
process, completed

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.870
a purchase, and perhaps
most importantly,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.060
identify segments of
customers who are falling out

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.420
of the shopping funnel.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.640
