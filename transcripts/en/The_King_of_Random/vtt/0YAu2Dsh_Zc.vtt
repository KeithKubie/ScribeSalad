00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.510
This isn't looking good at all. What was supposed
to be an easy day hike, is quickly turning

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.660
into a life-threatening situation. One of
your top priorities is to get a fire going

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.240
before nightfall, but all you've got with
you is a bag lunch and an empty water bottle.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
This is a challenge that's going to require
a little creativity. You're going to have

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.030
to light this fire, with your pee!

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.720
For this project you're gonna need some
of that special yellow liquid, and the timing

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.190
is great because with all that water you drank,
nature is calling. You can use a container

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.660
like your water bottle to collect as much
as possible. Now, that's really not a lot,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.860
and it looks like you're still a little dehydrated,
but you're gonna have to make it work.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.620
When you flip the bottle over and attempt
the water bottle trick from a previous video,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.740
it doesn't seem to be working. And that's
because you don't have enough fluid in your

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.869
bottle. You try removing the label to see
if that helps, but it's not making much of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.680
a difference. Ok, time to check your lunch
bag to see what other resources you have.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.409
There's a bag of celery sticks that could
be useful. But here's something even better…

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.340
…you wrapped your apple with a plastic wrap.
Perfect! Carefully remove the wrapper, making

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.520
sure not to rip it, and now you're gonna
need some rocks. When you place these rocks

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.159
in a circle, they've formed a crude concave
mold. The rocks help form the wrapper into

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.640
a bowl shape, and now you can add the liquid.
When it's filled to the edges, grab all the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.540
sides, and hold them together at the top,
making this into a little liquid pouch. Twisting

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.290
this pouch, while holding at the top, helps
remove any air and seals the liquid inside.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.020
When you twist the excess plastic around your
middle finger like a ring, then wrap it around

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.770
the base to hold it in place, the pressure
can be adjusted, and you've got yourself a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.860
great little liquid lens that's easy to use!
It's magnifying very well, so time to test

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.010
it out on some tinder. One of the unneeded
pages from your map should work perfectly,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.990
so focus the sunlight on the darkest ink you
can find, because this will absorb the heat.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.689
It's incredible how quickly this starts smoking,
and where there's smoke, there's a hope of

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.189
fire! A hole is burning in the paper now,
and when it's about the size of a quarter

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.680
it's pretty well self sustaining. Without
wasting any time, try adding layers of dry

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.569
grass, and blowing gently to add some air.
It's getting hot, and smoking quite a bit,

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.530
so just blow a little stronger, and success!
You've got a flame. Now get that to a place

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.290
you can build your fire up, and it's finished!
You just lit a fire with your pee. Well there's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.910
a little trick most people will never have
to use, but might be good to know just in

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.230
case. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll
like some of my others. Check them out at
