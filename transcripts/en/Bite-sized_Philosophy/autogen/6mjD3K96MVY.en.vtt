partner right so you might think well
what do you want in a stable partner and

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
what do you want in a stable partner and
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.230
what do you want in a stable partner and
at least in principle one of the things

at least in principle one of the things
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.540
at least in principle one of the things
you don't want is too much mismatch

you're really extroverted and you have a

come to consensus because it's not just

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
come to consensus because it's not just
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479
come to consensus because it's not just
a matter of opinion right it's really a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
a matter of opinion right it's really a
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.910
a matter of opinion right it's really a
matter of different and if you're

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
matter of different and if you're
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619
matter of different and if you're
looking at extremes of really different

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
looking at extremes of really different
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.510
looking at extremes of really different
types of people and the thing about

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
types of people and the thing about
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.510
types of people and the thing about
introverts is they just don't enjoy

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520
introverts is they just don't enjoy
 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.340
introverts is they just don't enjoy
large scale social interaction that much

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
large scale social interaction that much
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229
large scale social interaction that much
one-on-one they're often fine but in a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
one-on-one they're often fine but in a
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880
one-on-one they're often fine but in a
group they don't like that and they it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
group they don't like that and they it
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.130
group they don't like that and they it
tires them out whereas a real extrovert

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
tires them out whereas a real extrovert
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050
tires them out whereas a real extrovert
it's like you isolate them and and they

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
it's like you isolate them and and they
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
it's like you isolate them and and they
just wither on the vine because a huge

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
just wither on the vine because a huge
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429
just wither on the vine because a huge
part of what actually motivates them in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
part of what actually motivates them in
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740
part of what actually motivates them in
a positive way is tangled up with social

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
a positive way is tangled up with social
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320
a positive way is tangled up with social
interaction and so if you're an

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
interaction and so if you're an
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940
interaction and so if you're an
agreeable person and you have a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
agreeable person and you have a
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950
agreeable person and you have a
particularly disagreeable partner you're

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
particularly disagreeable partner you're
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.570
particularly disagreeable partner you're
also going to run into problems because

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
also going to run into problems because
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550
also going to run into problems because
the agreeable person will say whatever

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
the agreeable person will say whatever
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130
the agreeable person will say whatever
you want whenever and the agreeable / a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
you want whenever and the agreeable / a
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350
you want whenever and the agreeable / a
disagreeable person will say well I'd

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
disagreeable person will say well I'd
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090
disagreeable person will say well I'd
like to know what the hell you want for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
like to know what the hell you want for
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460
like to know what the hell you want for
a change and be much more harsh and much

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
a change and be much more harsh and much
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649
a change and be much more harsh and much
more demanding in the situation and the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
more demanding in the situation and the
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450
more demanding in the situation and the
agreeable person is going to find the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
agreeable person is going to find the
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910
agreeable person is going to find the
disagreeable person harsh and unpleasant

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
disagreeable person harsh and unpleasant
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.039
disagreeable person harsh and unpleasant
and the disagreeable person is going to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
and the disagreeable person is going to
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260
and the disagreeable person is going to
find the agreeable person wishy-washy

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
find the agreeable person wishy-washy
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030
find the agreeable person wishy-washy
and unable to stand up for themselves

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
and unable to stand up for themselves
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.160
and unable to stand up for themselves
and again that's a that's actually one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
and again that's a that's actually one
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719
and again that's a that's actually one
of the primary sources of tension

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
of the primary sources of tension
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819
of the primary sources of tension
between men and women because women tend

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
between men and women because women tend
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.499
between men and women because women tend
to be higher in agreeableness than men

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
to be higher in agreeableness than men
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389
to be higher in agreeableness than men
it's about half a standard deviation

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
it's about half a standard deviation
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940
it's about half a standard deviation
which is quite quite quite a quite a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
which is quite quite quite a quite a
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190
which is quite quite quite a quite a
large difference by psychological

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
large difference by psychological
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.999
large difference by psychological
standards and so what did what that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
standards and so what did what that
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889
standards and so what did what that
means I probably haven't got the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
means I probably haven't got the
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.649
means I probably haven't got the
statistic quite right but I think I've

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
statistic quite right but I think I've
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.029
statistic quite right but I think I've
got it about right what that means

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
got it about right what that means
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.529
got it about right what that means
fundamentally just so you have some

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
fundamentally just so you have some
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.309
fundamentally just so you have some
sense of how larger an effect that is is

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
sense of how larger an effect that is is
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000
sense of how larger an effect that is is
that if you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
that if you
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.530
that if you
have a group of men and women and you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
have a group of men and women and you
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.839
have a group of men and women and you
pick out random pairs the woman is going

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849
pick out random pairs the woman is going
 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.360
pick out random pairs the woman is going
to be more agreeable than the man 60% of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
to be more agreeable than the man 60% of
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.030
to be more agreeable than the man 60% of
the time so that's not an overwhelming

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
the time so that's not an overwhelming
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.070
the time so that's not an overwhelming
proportion but it's reliable and it's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
proportion but it's reliable and it's
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.539
proportion but it's reliable and it's
quite it's quite large by psychological

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549
quite it's quite large by psychological
 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.300
quite it's quite large by psychological
standards so there's the problem with

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
standards so there's the problem with
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.940
standards so there's the problem with
agreeableness with conscientiousness

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
agreeableness with conscientiousness
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.890
agreeableness with conscientiousness
well if you're conscientious you're

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
well if you're conscientious you're
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.789
well if you're conscientious you're
industrious and orderly and orderly

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799
industrious and orderly and orderly
 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.559
industrious and orderly and orderly
people seem to be sensitive to disgust

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
people seem to be sensitive to disgust
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.000
people seem to be sensitive to disgust
which is something we'll talk about in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
which is something we'll talk about in
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.940
which is something we'll talk about in
detail later we've had a hard time

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
detail later we've had a hard time
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.440
detail later we've had a hard time
specifying exactly what makes

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
specifying exactly what makes
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300
specifying exactly what makes
industrious people industrious because

industrious people industrious because
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.559
industrious people industrious because
it's hard to come up with an animal

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
it's hard to come up with an animal
 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.000
it's hard to come up with an animal
model for that sort of thing and there's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
model for that sort of thing and there's
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.479
model for that sort of thing and there's
no theoretical model but our latest idea

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
no theoretical model but our latest idea

is that my it's not my idea it's
 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.410
is that my it's not my idea it's
actually the idea of my graduate student

Christine Brophy is that industrious

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
Christine Brophy is that industrious
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.180
Christine Brophy is that industrious
people find it unpleasant and unsettling

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
people find it unpleasant and unsettling
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.729
people find it unpleasant and unsettling
to to not be doing something so it isn't

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
to to not be doing something so it isn't
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.009
to to not be doing something so it isn't
so much that industriousness makes them

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019
so much that industriousness makes them
 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.330
so much that industriousness makes them
happy or fills them with positive

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
happy or fills them with positive
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.190

emotion that would be more extraversion

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
emotion that would be more extraversion
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.690
emotion that would be more extraversion
right because extraversion is the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
right because extraversion is the
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.250
right because extraversion is the
positive emotion to mention it's that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
positive emotion to mention it's that
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.800
positive emotion to mention it's that
industrious people can't stand sitting

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
industrious people can't stand sitting
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.059
industrious people can't stand sitting
around doing nothing

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069
around doing nothing
 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.509
around doing nothing
and you know it this is speculation but

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519
and you know it this is speculation but
 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.759
and you know it this is speculation but
you know human beings are obviously

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769
you know human beings are obviously
 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.949
you know human beings are obviously
always engaged in the exchange of Labor

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
always engaged in the exchange of Labor
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960
always engaged in the exchange of Labor
especially the reciprocal exchange of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
especially the reciprocal exchange of
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.259
especially the reciprocal exchange of
Labor and you can imagine that in a in a

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
Labor and you can imagine that in a in a
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940
Labor and you can imagine that in a in a
community where everyone knows everyone

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950
community where everyone knows everyone
 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.280
community where everyone knows everyone
the people who work hard are going to be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
the people who work hard are going to be
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.900
the people who work hard are going to be
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.849
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic
basis with the people who are completely

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
basis with the people who are completely
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.539
basis with the people who are completely
unproductive

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
unproductive
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.509
unproductive
and my suspicions are that plenty of

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
and my suspicions are that plenty of
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.069
and my suspicions are that plenty of
people who are completely unproductive

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079
people who are completely unproductive
 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.830
people who are completely unproductive
in the history of our of the evolution

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
in the history of our of the evolution
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.809
in the history of our of the evolution
of our species were wiped out by people

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
of our species were wiped out by people
 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.970
of our species were wiped out by people
who are unhappy with their lack of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980
who are unhappy with their lack of
 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.059
who are unhappy with their lack of
productivity and so I think generally

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069
productivity and so I think generally
 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.009
productivity and so I think generally
speaking human beings have this sense of

speaking human beings have this sense of
 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.170
speaking human beings have this sense of
ethical obligation with regards to one

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
ethical obligation with regards to one
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.229
ethical obligation with regards to one
another to share labor and people who

are conscientious really really feel
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.250
are conscientious really really feel
that so they feel bad if they're not

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260
that so they feel bad if they're not
 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.650

busily working on something that's
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.409
busily working on something that's
productive all the time and so the

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419
productive all the time and so the
 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.520
productive all the time and so the
advantage to being with someone

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
advantage to being with someone
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.990

psychometric analysis is that women are
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.110
psychometric analysis is that women are
slightly more orderly than men and I

who's exactly like you because then both

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020
who's exactly like you because then both
 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.450
who's exactly like you because then both
of you have the same strengths and

of you have the same strengths and
 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.860
of you have the same strengths and

weaknesses and there's a bit of a
 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.110
weaknesses and there's a bit of a
problem there right because maybe an

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
problem there right because maybe an
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.000

right so we don't understand the optimal
