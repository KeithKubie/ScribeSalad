00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:03.485
- [Voiceover] So these are
both ways that you will see

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.864
limit-based definitions of derivatives.

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:09.567
This is usually if you're
thinking about the derivative

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.263
at a point, here if you're thinking about

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:16.004
the derivative in general,
but these are both equivalent.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.030
They're both based on the
slope of a tangent line,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.289
or the instantaneous rate of change,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.356
and using these, I wanna establish some of

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:28.429
the core properties of derivatives for us.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.973
And the first one that
I'm going to do will seem

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:34.545
like common sense, or maybe
it will once we talk about it

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:38.752
a little bit, so if f of x,
if our function is equal to

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:42.773
a constant value, well then, f prime of x

00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:45.190
is going to be equal to zero.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.279
Now why does that make intuitive sense?

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:53.317
Well, we could graph
it, we could graph it,

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:56.734
so if that's my y-axis, that's my x-axis.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.265
If I wanted to graph y equals f of x,

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:02.944
it's gonna look like that,
where this is at the value

00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:07.027
y is equal to k, so this
is y is equal to f of x.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:11.760
Notice no matter what you
change x, y does not change.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.151
The slope of the tangent
line here, well frankly,

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.362
is the same line, it has a slope of zero.

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:20.086
No matter how, y is
just not changing here,

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:21.918
and we could use either
of these definitions

00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:24.682
to establish that even
further, establish it using

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:28.310
these limit definitions, so let's see,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.477
the limit as h approaches
zero of f of x plus h,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.452
well no matter what we
input into our function,

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:41.804
we get k, so f of x plus
h would be k minus f of x.

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.686
Well, no matter what we
put into that function,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:48.174
we get k over h, well,
this is just going to be

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:52.341
zero over h so this limit is
just going to be equal to zero.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.820
So f prime of x for any, for
any x, the derivative is zero,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.652
and you see that here, that
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:03.034
for any x is equal to zero.

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:04.751
So if someone walks up to
you on the street and says,

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:08.584
"Okay, h of x, h of x,
h of x, is equal to pi,

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:12.883
"what is h prime of x?"

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.086
Well, you say, well, pi,
that's just a constant value

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:16.966
that the value of our
function is not changing

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.799
as we change our x, the slope
of the tangent line there,

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.382
the instantaneous rate of change,

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:24.049
it is going to be equal to zero.
