00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.620
The look on your face right now...

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.680
is priceless.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.940
[LAUGH] whispers wow.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.860
What's up, guys. Welcome back to the lab.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.920
Today, we're trying another one of those experiments you really shouldn't try at home, and that's why we are in iJustine's home.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.840
Hello. I've also got this, just in case.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.480
That's right. Today, we're gonna be playing with fire.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.400
So safety precautions are in place and the only things we're going to be using for this experiment are a large metal bowl of water,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.820
we're using some dish soap and some butane that I just went down to the Home Depot and got about 3 and an half dollars.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.200
So, when you guys add water and dish soap together, and you take a straw and you blow in it, bubbles form.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.500
What are we doing?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.640
So guys, update what we just did is we took some dish soap

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.160
And we put into the water stirred it around and used one of these yellow straws

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.020
I'm not sure if they're color specific, but we did use yellow to blow some bubbles and bubbles

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.889
We've got a lot of bubbles, so pretty elementary. Everybody knows that dish Soap forms bubbles, right?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
But what if we happen to trap a different kind of gas inside those bubbles?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.829
What if instead of using air, we try to fill it up with something like a butane instead? I have absolutely no idea

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.090
we're going to find out so we're gonna have just seen here go ahead and remove the cap and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.269
[we're] gonna find on this butane bottle is there's a little nozzle sticking up here at the top that's actually for refilling like barbecue igniters

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270
And lighters and go to that nature there

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.258
Sometimes refillable these ones probably [are] I think yeah that's definitely not one

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.139
Yeah, yeah, these are made to purchase multiple

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.199
But the interesting thing about this if you press this down

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.180
You get a little squirt of gas that flies out there, and if you were to light that gas on fire. [oh]

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.400
Holy crap!

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.880
sweet

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.890
My dog is extremely excited about it improvised [flamethrower]

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.199
[and] this is one of those things you don't try at home right leave it to us expert, so definitely a flammable gas

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.520
Thank you [very] much

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.759
So go ahead and take your canister [of] Butane all right?

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.810
We're going to flip this upside down

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.670
And we're gonna stick it straight down to the bubbles until it hits the bottom of the bowl yeah when you feel they contact keep

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.809
Pushing okay, it's going to start forming bubbles until that entire container is completely full okay. Do you know what's going to happen? Yes, okay?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.699
That's good stuff. [hot] now if you angle, Er to the side a little bit

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.950
You can get a lot [more]

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.119
So a moment of truth now what I need you to do is I need to put your hand in the side

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.470
I want you to get a little bit soapy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.249
So when you pick up the bubble of the bubble stain your hand dry skin and bubbles don't mix very well

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.199
So you wanna get your hand nice [and] soapy and wet so [come] [in] from the bottom switch your hand around a little bit

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.130
And then when you feel, it's nice and sticky you go ahead and scoop up [some] of those bubbles there

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.550
And I see how all the bubbles are popping here. That's because some of the skin is still dry

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.729
So what really works best if you put your hand down the bottom okay?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.759
[push] it around your whole hand covered in that nice soapy water

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.279
Let's go ahead and move this dish out of the way, far out of the way, and now this is the important part

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.190
I'm going to take some paper towel and just brush off the bottom of your hand

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.299
So that we only have the bubbles on the top

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.299
All right now. This is actually quite a bit

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.729
This is an enormous amount to do for your first time

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.160
Are you comfortable doing this no, but let's do it, okay?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.369
so when we're going to light this off [justine] is going to open her hand fully and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.199
What I want you to do is count from three to one if they claim on okay three two one flame on

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.079
Did you see that?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.989
That was amazing you didn't even flinch

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.229
She's just like it burns, and then she just as they're holding this ball of fire

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.230
What am I supposed to do with it that [was] impressive wow? [so] what did you feel tell us about that experience?

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.370
[oh] warm

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.980
I think I was

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.549
over

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.369
Exaggerating a little bit because I think the shock [of] seeing my hand on fire was more scary than the feeling because it was like

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.399
A slightly can you put your hand at the top of the toaster? It's like that warm Mm-hmm?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.459
Like if you like a run over top of a candle for a second you can feel it warming up

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.650
Then I quickly dissipated that was cool

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.690
That was like three or four seconds her hand was on fire

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.369
And she just held it like I think you're a natural that was really cool. We'll try this again

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.359
Okay, okay one word of advice guys the small bubbles hurt

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.888
so if you have a lot of small bubbles wipe them off and get some bigger bubbles they burn a lot quicker the

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.489
Small bubbles have a tendency to linger. So we're just going to clean this up

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.500
We're going to soak your hand in there again

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.589
Swish it around wow this is neat neat it is pretty neat. You heard it here [first]. It's neat

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.680
This looks really cool. Go ahead [and] scoop those up

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.540
And I love the way that it kind of like sticks to the bottom of your hand as you're pulling it out now obviously

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.920
flames rise

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.739
So if you have bubbles on the bottom of your hand it will burn and that's why it's very important to pull all these bubbles

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.739
off

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.679
You shouldn't try this at home. [it's] really what we're saying that's looking pretty good. All right. I'm going to like this

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.950
I'm [just] going to bring it [right] down for you ready, and then I just like to exact what [any] last time?

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.950
I just seen the human torch

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360
He didn't know that was coming

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.019
Totally surprise, and I expect it wasn't it. How are you doing? How's your hand?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.080
She's wanting to say it like it hurts. It really doesn't but it's honestly just like look at this look at this the perfect manicure

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.940
It looks beautiful. This is a small hint of charred human hair yeah, that's cool. [no], we feel actually your hands to look great

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.030
That's good. That's beautiful

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
Wowie [like] that would be burning you

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.700
Beautiful bubbles of mad science, are you ready to burn can we just go?

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.890
Okay, the old library

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.279
That's beautiful. Isn't it it's beautiful. Okay?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.980
now

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.950
you want to see something really crazy the reason that I told you to move this out [of] the way the first time is because

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.580
You accidentally drop a flame in there the whole things can go up. It's absolutely insane so we're gonna try that next on purpose I

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.219
Do a few little bubbles in your hand when it lights on fire

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.720
I just want you to come down and touch the bowl and back up okay, okay? Wow all right. Let's see what happens

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.030
It can't be like the bowl the [human] [torch] ignition prepare yourself because this is about to be a wild ride

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.000
[it's] the best time ever

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.060
Guys right now justine is literally becoming a firebender. She's gonna throw fire from her hand into this bowl here

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.520
Let's do it three

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.050
two one oh

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.660
Oh jeez, Oh my...

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.949
Rise. Is that not amazing ?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.520
I'm sure you guys are surprised that this hasn't happened Sooner in my kitchen

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.760
Then absolutely amazing that she took fire from her hands and lit that whole bowl on fire. I'm speechless

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.140
This is so awesome

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.870
So obviously guys

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.100
playing with fire

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.209
Should only be done under adult supervision if ever but we did this demonstration for you to see what could happen if you accidentally?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.560
Like let the flames travel into the bowl big ball of fire super dangerous very dangerous

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.820
Please don't try it at home and adult supervision if I'm supervising you do not try it

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.100
How's your heart feeling good? I think [that's] more in shock than anything. I'm more interactive

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.380
It didn't hurt [but] I thought that it hurt it basically like tricked my mind and thinking that I was too in pain

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.850
But I really wasn't because I saw myself on fire so like as you were watching your hand burn

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.100
You were like subconsciously thinking this really hurts a lot

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.049
Yeah, that's why I'm screaming out like this really hurt. You just felt like it should've.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.820
whoa

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.950
That was actually pretty cool, did you see that?

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.460
I guess it didn't burn by skin or my body, it's probably not going to burn this yeah, it actually burns up pretty quickly

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.190
It's all about the dissipation of heat what you have to keep in [mind]

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.360
Is that flames travel upward? And that's why if you have any bubbles hanging around on the bottom of your hand?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.920
It's going to burn the bottom of your hand and if you have bubbles on your wrist

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.700
It's going to burn off your hair, and it's gonna make the whole place smell like burning human hair. Right,  burning flesh.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.900
But hey if you're not getting hurt, you're not having fun, right?

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.200
wait

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.300
You know they say go big or go home? Well? I'm already home, so

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.940
That is a lot. Oh my goodness. Are you ready to take this on? Yes! That is huge okay? Ah?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.900
That was good, perfect, insane you nailed it. Whoo. Yeah

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.630
She did it guys. This girl is insane. It's like a shock every time you do it

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.779
It's just like what is happening like my body is on fire

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.840
Yeah, well you're literally shooting fireballs out of your freaking palms of your hand

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.280
That's about as human torch as you 
 can get yeah, that's cool. So we still got some butane bubbles left in here

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.160
That should be light you on fire we mmM, okay?

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.800
Ahh god, that just scares me so bad

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960
was that cool?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.650
That was so scary

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.260
Here you smell the burning hair on my hand? You're burning. So yeah

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.569
It's not without risk guys you might end up with some scorched human hair, but that's no big deal it's part of

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.119
I mean some people wax some people burn

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.580
This is the iJustine fire slap in three, two, one.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.300
Oh god so scary.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.440
Yeah

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.900
That's amazing, but you do it like a pro every time!

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.980
It's just so scary

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.540
It's amazing how it goes up so quickly. (mouth sound effect) Pretty cool huh?

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.540
The look on your face right now is priceless

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.800
[laughs]

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.200
That is awesome

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.240
But very cool experiment guys now

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.240
you know how to take butane and some dish soap and water and makes the human flaming torch effect

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.200
Big thanks for iJustine for joining us for this experiment, for putting her safety on the line

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.360
She actually had no idea what to expect

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.149
No, he didn't he was like hey, so how about I'd like you on fire, and I was a little skeptical

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:22.059
But this actually worked out pretty well. Yes, it was so much fun

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.359
You already know who she is, but I put a link down in the description so you can go check out her channel

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.469
She's got all kinds of cool videos coming up including one that we're about to go do in the backyard right now

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.560
Melting an iphone in a 2,000 degree foundry, so make sure you go check that out

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.360
Thanks for joining us for this experiment we'll be looking for you in the next one, talk to you then. Bye

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.600
I'm gonna go back to the nail salon they're like why are your finger nails burned off?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.600
What's all this char under your cuticles? Well..

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.780
Aww I was going for it. I missed..

00:09:48.780 --> 00:10:07.380
