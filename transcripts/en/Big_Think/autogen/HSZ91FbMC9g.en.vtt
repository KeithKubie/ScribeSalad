reading part of it the more you read the
 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.430
reading part of it the more you read the
better you do on it the math part the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
better you do on it the math part the
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.220

more you study mathematics and work at

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500
more you study mathematics and work at
mathematics the better you do on I don't

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
mathematics the better you do on I don't

know how you can run and an admissions

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
know how you can run and an admissions
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580
know how you can run and an admissions
process in the United States where the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
process in the United States where the
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.330
process in the United States where the
schools have the the the choice of what

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
schools have the the the choice of what
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340
schools have the the the choice of what
students they invite to come to their

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
students they invite to come to their
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.340
students they invite to come to their
schools unless you have some sort of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
schools unless you have some sort of
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860
schools unless you have some sort of
objective measurement I don't think it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
objective measurement I don't think it
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540
objective measurement I don't think it
should be the only measure but you need

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
should be the only measure but you need
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459
should be the only measure but you need
some objective measurement because an a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
some objective measurement because an a
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.889
some objective measurement because an a
in one school certainly it in what an a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
in one school certainly it in what an a
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479
in one school certainly it in what an a
is another school so if you just use

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
is another school so if you just use
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.830
is another school so if you just use
grades that that's not that's not a good

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
grades that that's not that's not a good
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440
grades that that's not that's not a good
enough criteria now you have to look at

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
enough criteria now you have to look at
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270
enough criteria now you have to look at
what the students done the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
what the students done the
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800
what the students done the
recommendations that they get from their

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
recommendations that they get from their
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.419
recommendations that they get from their
teachers and their schools but you need

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429
teachers and their schools but you need
 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.570
teachers and their schools but you need
one objective a test that allows you to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
one objective a test that allows you to
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.800
one objective a test that allows you to
see the with other students what what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
see the with other students what what
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.650
see the with other students what what
what is how well a student is done on

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660
what is how well a student is done on
 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.719
what is how well a student is done on
that test and there's a there's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
that test and there's a there's
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.800
that test and there's a there's
obviously a correlation between how well

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
obviously a correlation between how well
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.889
obviously a correlation between how well
a student does on on an essay and how

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899
a student does on on an essay and how
 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.330
a student does on on an essay and how
well they're prepared to go to college

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
well they're prepared to go to college
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.570
well they're prepared to go to college
and succeed

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580
 
 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 
well I think the one thing that that I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
well I think the one thing that that I
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.940
well I think the one thing that that I
would say is I don't want somebody just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
would say is I don't want somebody just
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.400
would say is I don't want somebody just
to rely on the s80 I wanted the more

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410
to rely on the s80 I wanted the more
 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.320
to rely on the s80 I wanted the more
information they can get about a student

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330
information they can get about a student
 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.650
information they can get about a student
the more they understand the student

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660
the more they understand the student
 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.690
the more they understand the student
body they want to have the better it is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
body they want to have the better it is
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850
body they want to have the better it is
I don't think this sa t is the beginning

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
I don't think this sa t is the beginning
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.400
I don't think this sa t is the beginning
and end of the admissions process I just

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410
and end of the admissions process I just
 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.170
and end of the admissions process I just
think it's an important objective tool

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180
think it's an important objective tool
 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.630
think it's an important objective tool
that statistically has proven to be very

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
that statistically has proven to be very
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.090
that statistically has proven to be very
helpful in that admissions process and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
helpful in that admissions process and
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.360
helpful in that admissions process and
very much part of fairness
