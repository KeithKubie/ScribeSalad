I'M MR.
THERE'S-GOT-TO-BE-A-BETTER-WAY.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.372
I'VE MADE BILLIONS
FINDING PROBLEMS

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.740
AND SELLING SOLUTIONS,

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.442
SO I STARTED THIS CHARITY.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.544
NOW I SOLVE
THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.212
THE BIGGER, THE BETTER.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.213
- [clears throat]

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:14.848
UH, MAYBE I COULD HELP TOO.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.150
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU'RE JUST A JANITOR.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.520
- TRUE, I MAY BE
A LOWLY JANITOR, BUT--

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:20.921
- YOU'RE A TEMP. YOU'RE NOT--
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.756
- "TEMP" JANITOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.191 line:0%
 
BUT KEEP IN MIND,
I HAVE TWO DEGREES:

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.360 line:0%
 
A MASTER'S
IN COMPLEX MATH PROBLEMS

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.396 line:0%
 
AND A DOCTORATE IN THE TOUGHEST
CHEMISTRY THERE IS, SO...

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.664
- RIGHT, I SEE THAT.
- FRAMED.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.699
GREAT, WELL,
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.101
SO DOES ANYONE
HAVE A PROBLEM HERE?

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.202
- WHEN I WAS FLIPPING THROUGH

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.070
MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE
THIS MORNING,

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.071
<i>CIGAR CHOMPER...</i>

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.174
MMM, THAT'S A YUMMY CIGAR.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.543
YES, THAT'S ME ON THE COVER.
- VERY HANDSOME.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:43.544
- LOOK INSIDE HERE.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.346
I SAW THIS PHOTO
OF A STARVING CHILD.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.115
- OH.
- LOOK AT THIS KID.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.683
LOOK AT HIM!
- YEAH, I DON'T GET IT.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.684
THERE'S ALL THIS FOOD,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.085
BUT NOT EVERYONE
IS GETTING TO EAT.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.654
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER WAY.

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.056
- WELL, YOU GUYS ARE ALL EATING,
SO YOU FIGURED SOMETHING OUT.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.457
MARILYN,
WHAT ARE YOU CHOMPING ON?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.992
- OH, I'M ON THIS SPECIAL DIET

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.961
BECAUSE IT'S MY TIME
OF THE MONTH.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.863
NO PUN INTENDED.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.164
AND I'M EATING A--

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:05.832
- THERE WAS NO PUN THERE.
- THAT'S NOT A PUN.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.434
- I DIDN'T GET A PUN.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.070
- I'M EATING A VAGINATION
<i>VAGINA MONOLOGUES</i> ENERGY BAR,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.071
AND IT IS AWESOME.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.773
- JACK, WHAT DO YOU GOT IN--

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.174
SLOPPING IN YOUR MOUTH
OVER THERE?

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.175
- UM, THIS IS A--

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.276
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.811
A BURGY-BURGY CHICK BURGER.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.948
IT'S A CHICKEN BURGER WITH
TWO BEEF BURGERS AS THE BUN.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.116
SO IT'S--IT'S GOOD.
- DOES IT FILL YOU UP?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.618
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT DOESN'T DO THE TRICK, BUT--

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.886
- YOU NEED TO TOP IT OFF.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.654
- YEAH, I TOP IT OFF WITH RANCH
AND THEN SOME--

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.590
- IS THAT WHAT THAT BUCKET IS?

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.591
- YEAH, A BUCKET OF RANCH.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.125
- YOU'RE NOT CLEANING.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.660
- NO, IT'S JUST A BUCKET
OF RANCH I USE--

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.128
- WHY ARE YOU DIPPING
YOUR MOP INTO IT?

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.231
- IT'S A TO-GO MOP.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.232
[chomps]

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:43.103
