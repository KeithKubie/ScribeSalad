00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.310
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we run an egg farm,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.380
and yesterday, we went out
and we collected 398 eggs

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.170
from the chickens, and then today,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.690
we went out and we collected
251 eggs from the chickens.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.350
And what we're curious about is,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.100
roughly how many eggs do we now have

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.430
that we've collected
over the last two days?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.630
Well, there's a few ways we could do that.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.200
We could just add 398 to 251,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.920
and figure out what that is equal to.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.670
But let's say that we
don't have a lot of time,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150
and we don't have paper, and
we want to do it in our heads,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.210
and we don't care about the exact number.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.820
We want to know roughly
how many eggs do we have?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.390
Well, that's where the tool
of estimating is useful.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.920
So instead of saying the
exact amount of eggs,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.050
we could say, how many do we roughly have?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.580
And that's what this
squiggly equal sign means,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.940
it means, hey, we don't have
to get the exact number,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.710
but how many do we roughly have?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.920
And so we will be estimating.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.170
And the way that we can do that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.880
is that we can round each of these numbers

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.350
to a number that is close to them,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.130
but that's easier to add in our heads,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.160
and then we add those two numbers.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.810
So pause this video, and see
if you can do that on your own

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.540
before we do it together.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.570
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.570
Let's start with 398, and let's
round it to the nearest 10.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.730
So, 398, you can view this as,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.580
we have a nine in the 10s place,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.210
but you could view this
as 39 10s, and eight.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.970
The 10 that it is right directly above

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.800
is exactly 39 10s and zero ones, or 390,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.640
and then the next ten would
be if we go up to 40 10s,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.440
which would be the same thing as 400.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.370
Now, which one would we round to?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.370
Well, 398 is closer to
400 than it is to 390,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.610
and we've talked about
in the rounding videos

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.050
that you can see that this right over here

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.970
is five or greater, so we
would round the 10s place up.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.187
So we would round to 400.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.720
And so, 398, we round to 400.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.020
And then we're going to add that to 251,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.410
what's that rounded to the nearest 10?

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.000
So I'll do that again, right over here.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.833
251.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.670
The 10 that is right below
that is going to be 250.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.860
The 10 that is right above that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.233
is going to be 260.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.440
Once again, you could view
this as 25 10s and one.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.440
And 251 is clearly closer
to 250, we can round down.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.510
Another way to think about it
is, you look at the 10s place,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.210
and then you look at the ones place,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.410
and you say, hey, this is less than five,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.240
so I'm gonna round down
to on the 10s place,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.940
so we get to 250.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.430
So when you round 251 to the nearest 10,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.790
you're going to get 250.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.010
Now, I encourage you, add
these two in your head.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.913
What would this be equal to?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.780
Well, the way that I
think about it in my head,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.060
and there's a lot of different
ways to approach addition,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.520
but you could say, alright,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.880
I can think about the hundreds.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.650
I have four hundreds, and I'm
adding that to two hundreds,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.020
and let me do this in a new color.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.330
So if I have four hundreds,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.820
and I'm adding it to two hundreds,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.250
well, that's going to be six hundreds.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.130
And if I have zero 10s, and
if I'm adding it to five 10s,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.780
well, I'm still going to have five 10s,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.790
and then I have zero ones in either cases,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.740
so I'm still going to have zero ones.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.630
And so there you have it.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.630
We were able to estimate 398
plus 251 as being roughly 650.
