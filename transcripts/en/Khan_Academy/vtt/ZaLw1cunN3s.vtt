00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:02.272
- [Instructor] Multiple
videos and exercises

00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:04.273
we cover the various techniques

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:06.370
for finding limits.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.936
But sometimes, it's helpful
to think about strategies

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:12.067
for determining which technique to use.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:14.500
And that's what we're going
to cover in this video.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.237
What you see here is a flowchart

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:19.076
developed by the team at Khan Academy,

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:21.323
and I'm essentially going to
work through that flowchart.

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.731
It looks a little bit
complicated at first,

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:24.886
but hopefully it will make sense

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.751
as we talk it through.

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:28.124
So the goal is, hey,

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:29.593
we want to find the limit of f of x

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:31.343
as x approaches a.

00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:35.284
So what this is telling us to do is,

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:36.312
well the first thing,

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:40.071
just try to substitute what
happens when x equals a.

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:41.904
Let's evaluate f of a.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:44.317
And this flowchart says,

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:47.561
if f of a is equal to a real number,

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.758
it's saying we're done.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.463
But then there's this little caveat here.

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:52.753
Probably.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.684
And the reason why is that
the limit is a different thing

00:00:55.684 --> 00:00:57.574
than the value of the function.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:59.507
Sometimes they happen to be the same.

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.285
In fact, that's the definition
of a continuous function

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:04.213
which we talk about in previous videos,

00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:06.614
but sometimes, they aren't the same.

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.613
This will not necessarily be true

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.414
if you're dealing with some function

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:11.512
that has a

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:12.393
point

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:13.657
discontinuity like that

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.369
or a jump discontinuity,

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.830
or a function that looks like this.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.924
This would not necessarily be the case.

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.482
But if at that point

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.327
you're trying to find the limit towards,

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:29.318
as you approach this
point right over here,

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:31.208
the function is continuous,

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:33.398
it's behaving somewhat normally,

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:36.150
then this is a good thing to keep in mind.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.063
You could just say, hey,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.551
can I just evaluate the function

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:39.384
at that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.495
at that

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:42.625
a over there?

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.074
So in general, if you're dealing with

00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:47.357
pretty plain vanilla
functions like an x squared

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.594
or if you're dealing with
rational expressions like this

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:52.363
or trigonometric expressions,

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:54.847
and if you're able to
just evaluate the function

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.794
and it gives you a real number,

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.314
you are probably done.

00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:00.543
If you're dealing with
some type of a function

00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:03.224
that has all sorts of special cases

00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:05.134
and it's piecewise defined

00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:06.730
as we've seen in previous other videos,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.690
I would be a little bit more skeptical.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.132
Or if you know visually around that point,

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.441
there's some type of jump

00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:15.006
or some type of discontinuity,

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:16.653
you've got to be a
little bit more careful.

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:17.541
But in general,

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.069
this is a pretty good rule of thumb.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.630
If you're dealing with
plain vanilla functions

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.648
that are continuous,

00:02:24.648 --> 00:02:26.761
if you evaluate at x equals a

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:27.770
and you got a real number,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.459
that's probably going to be the limit.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.198
But I always think about
the other scenarios.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:34.782
What happens if you evaluate it

00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:38.115
and you get some number divided by zero?

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.190
Well, that case,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.698
you are probably dealing
with a vertical asymptote.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.256
And what do we mean by vertical asymptote?

00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:48.114
Well, look at this
example right over here.

00:02:48.114 --> 00:02:50.072
Where we just say the limit

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:51.752
put that in a darker color.

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:53.156
So if we're talking about

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:54.408
the limit

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:56.822
as x approaches one

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.450
of one over

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.011
x minus one,

00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.380
if you just try to
evaluate this expression

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.798
at x equals one,

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:06.256
you would get one over one minus one

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:08.855
which is equal to one over zero.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.688
It says, okay,

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:10.521
I'm throwing it,

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.363
I'm falling into this
vertical asymptote case.

00:03:13.363 --> 00:03:14.506
And at that point,

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:18.025
if you wanted to just understand
what was going on there

00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:20.490
or even verify that it's
a vertical asymptote,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.348
well then you can try out some numbers,

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:23.976
you can try to plot it,

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:25.004
you can say, alright,

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.843
I probably have a vertical asymptote here

00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:28.184
at x equals one.

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:30.464
So that's my vertical asymptote.

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:31.747
And you can try out some values.

00:03:31.747 --> 00:03:32.580
Well, let's see.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.372
If x is greater than one,

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:38.267
the denominator is going to be positive,

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:39.806
and so, my graph

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.143
and you would get this from
trying out a bunch of values.

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:43.746
Might look something like this

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.738
and then for values less than negative one

00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:48.609
or less than one I should say,

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.576
you're gonna get negative values

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:52.089
and so, your graph might look

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.922
like something like that

00:03:52.922 --> 00:03:55.385
until you have this vertical asymptote.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:57.173
That's probably what you have.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:58.290
Now, there are cases,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.803
very special cases,

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:02.568
where you won't necessarily
have the vertical asymptote.

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:04.925
One example of that
would be something like

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:05.758
one over x

00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:08.583
minus x.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:12.281
This one here is actually
undefined for any x you give it.

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:13.717
So, it would be very,

00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.493
you will not have a vertical asymptote.

00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:17.191
But this is a very special case.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.309
Most times,

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.952
you do have a vertical asymptote there.

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:23.449
But let's say we don't fall
into either of those situations.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.313
What if when we evaluate the function,

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:27.714
we get zero over zero?

00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:29.177
And here is an example of that.

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:31.105
Limit is x approaches negative one

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.327
of this rational expression.

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:34.323
Let's try to evaluate it.

00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:36.456
You get negative one squared which is one

00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:39.119
minus negative one which is plus one

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:40.070
minus two.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.720
So you get zero the numerator.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.981
And the denominator you
have negative one squared

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.843
which is one

00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:47.267
minus two times negative one

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:48.633
so plus two

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:52.215
minus three which is equal to zero.

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:55.338
Now this is known as indeterminate form.

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:56.424
And so on our flowchart,

00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:58.773
we then continue to the right side of it

00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:00.287
and so here's a bunch of techniques

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:04.527
for trying to tackle something
in indeterminate form.

00:05:04.527 --> 00:05:05.504
And

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:06.940
likely in a few weeks

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.594
you will learn another technique

00:05:08.594 --> 00:05:10.114
that involves a little more calculus

00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:12.055
called L'hospital's Rule
that we don't tackle here

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:13.371
because that involves calculus

00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:15.484
while all of these techniques can be done

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:16.768
with things before calculus.

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:17.917
Some algebraic techniques

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.024
and some trigonometric techniques.

00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:21.448
So the first thing that you might want to

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:22.521
try to do

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:25.356
especially if you're dealing
with a rational expression

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:26.189
like this

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.444
and you're getting indeterminate form,

00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:29.781
is try to factor it.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:30.829
Try to see

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:33.006
if you can simplify this expression.

00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:34.066
And this expression here,

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:35.247
you can factor it.

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:37.463
This is the same thing as

00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:38.296
x

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.213
x minus two

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.133
times x plus one

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.173
over

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:47.309
x

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.611
this would be x minus three

00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.239
times x plus one

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:55.317
if what I just did seems
completely foreign to you

00:05:55.317 --> 00:05:57.941
I encourage you to watch
the videos on factoring

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.959
factoring polynomials

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.894
or factoring quadratics.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:02.935
And so,

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:04.014
you can see here, alright.

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:05.097
If I make the

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.577
I can simplify this 'cause

00:06:07.577 --> 00:06:10.623
as long as x does not equal negative one,

00:06:10.623 --> 00:06:12.063
these two things are going to cancel out.

00:06:12.063 --> 00:06:15.499
So I can say that this is going
to be equal to x minus two

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.721
over x minus three

00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.275
for x does not equal negative one.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:22.670
Sometimes people forget to do this part.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.898
This is if you're really
being mathematically precise.

00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:27.472
This entire expression
is the same as this one.

00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:29.630
Because this entire expression
is still not defined

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.444
if x equals negative one.

00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:34.601
Although you can substitute
x equals negative one here

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:36.140
and now get a value.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.024
So if you substitute x
equals negative one here

00:06:38.024 --> 00:06:40.891
even if it's formally taking it away to be

00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:42.347
mathematically equivalent,

00:06:42.347 --> 00:06:43.733
this would be negative one

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:45.386
minus two

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:46.976
which would be

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:48.643
which would be negative three

00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:50.667
over negative one minus three

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:51.869
which should be negative four

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.829
which is equal to three fourths.

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:56.581
So if this condition wasn't here,

00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:58.618
you can just evaluate it straight up and

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.470
this is a pretty plain vanilla function.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.119
Wouldn't expect to see
anything crazy happening here.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.845
And if I can just evaluate
it at x equals negative one

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.493
I feel pretty good.

00:07:09.493 --> 00:07:10.859
I feel pretty good.

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:12.354
So once again, we're
now going in factoring.

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:13.187
We're able to factor.

00:07:13.187 --> 00:07:14.371
We have valued,

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:15.482
we simplify it.

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:17.649
We evaluate the expression

00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:19.971
the simplified expression now,

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.498
and now we were able to get a value.

00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:23.005
We were able to get three fourths,

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.610
and so we can feel pretty
good that the limit here

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.688
in this situation is three fourths.

00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:29.521
Now, let's

00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:31.223
and I would categorize what we've seen

00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:32.762
so far is

00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:34.984
the bulk of the limit exercises

00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:36.389
that you will likely encounter.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.238
Now the next two,

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:40.916
I would call slightly fancier techniques.

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:42.934
So if you get indeterminate form

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:45.354
especially you'll sometimes
see it with radical expressions

00:07:45.354 --> 00:07:46.187
like this.

00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:48.355
Rational radical expressions.

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:51.158
You might want to multiply by conjugate.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.202
So for example, in this
situation right here,

00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:56.114
if you just try to
evaluate it x equals four,

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:58.854
you get the square root of four minus two

00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:00.521
over four minus four

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:03.145
which is zero over zero.

00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.946
So it's that indeterminate form.

00:08:04.946 --> 00:08:07.308
And the technique here,
because we're seeing

00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:09.907
this radical and a rational expression

00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:12.602
let's say, maybe we can
somehow get rid of that radical

00:08:12.602 --> 00:08:14.900
or simplify it somehow.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.496
So let me rewrite.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.476
Square root of x minus two

00:08:18.476 --> 00:08:19.919
over

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:20.966
x

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.671
minus four.

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:23.629
Let's say a conjugate,

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:26.885
let's multiply it by the
square root of x plus two

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:30.723
over the square root of x plus two.

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:31.556
Once again,

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:33.373
it's the same expression
over the same expression.

00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:36.604
So I'm not fundamentally
changing its value.

00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:38.641
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:41.655
well if I have a plus b times a minus b

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.047
I'm gonna get a difference of squares.

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.569
So it's gonna be square root of x squared

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:46.902
which is,

00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:49.505
it's going to be square root of x squared

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:50.338
minus four

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:52.592
over

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:54.108
well square root of x squared

00:08:54.108 --> 00:08:56.184
is just going to be

00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:57.267
x minus four.

00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:00.845
So let me rewrite it that way.

00:09:00.845 --> 00:09:02.531
So that's x minus four

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:03.533
over

00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:04.533
x minus four

00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:07.735
times square root of x plus two,

00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:10.775
square root of x plus two.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:12.218
Well, this was useful because now

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.968
I can cancel out x equals four

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.552
or x minus four right over here.

00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:19.385
And once again, if I wanted it

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:21.949
mathematically to be the
exact same expression,

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:24.531
I'd say well, now this
is going to be equal to

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:25.738
one

00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:27.807
one over the square root of x plus two

00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:29.921
for x does not equal four,

00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:31.626
but we can definitely see what

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:33.605
this function is approaching

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.961
if we just now substitute x equals four

00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:38.420
into this simplified expression.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.581
And so, that's just gonna be one over

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.784
so if we just substitute

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:46.523
if we just substitute x equals four here

00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:49.135
you'd get one over square root of four

00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:50.246
plus two

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:52.398
which is equal to one fourth.

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:54.601
And once again, you can feel pretty good

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.586
that this is going to be

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:57.419
your limit.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:59.395
We've gone back into the green zone.

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:00.673
If you're actually to plot

00:10:00.673 --> 00:10:02.039
this original function,

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:04.855
you would have a point discontinuity.

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:07.058
You would have a gap at x equals

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:07.891
four

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.768
but then when you do that simplification

00:10:10.768 --> 00:10:12.499
and factoring out that x minus

00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:14.408
or canceling out that x minus four,

00:10:14.408 --> 00:10:15.877
that gap would disappear.

00:10:15.877 --> 00:10:17.071
So that's essentially what you're doing.

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:19.069
You're trying to find
the limit as we approach

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:21.260
that gap which we got right there.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.111
Now, this final one.

00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:24.638
This is dealing with trig identities.

00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:26.215
And in order to do these,

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:29.433
you have to be pretty adept
at your trig identities.

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:32.115
So if we're saying the limit,

00:10:32.115 --> 00:10:34.497
I'll do that at a darker color.

00:10:34.497 --> 00:10:36.240
So if we're saying the limit

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.877
as x approaches zero

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:39.877
of sine of x

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:41.722
over sine

00:10:42.862 --> 00:10:44.465
of two x

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:46.227
well, sine of zero zero,

00:10:46.227 --> 00:10:47.060
sine of zero zero,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.900
you're gonna be at zero, zero.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.100
Once you get indeterminate form,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.789
we fall into this category,

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:53.142
and now you might recognize
this is going to be

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:54.981
equal to the limit

00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.437
as x approaches zero of sine of x

00:10:58.437 --> 00:11:00.161
we can rewrite sine of two x

00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:01.078
as two sine

00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:03.037
x cosine x

00:11:04.114 --> 00:11:07.780
and then those two can
cancel out for all x's not

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.700
equaling

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.318
for all x's not equaling zero

00:11:11.318 --> 00:11:13.326
if you want to be really
mathematically precise.

00:11:13.326 --> 00:11:16.388
And so, there would've
been a gap there for sure

00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:18.080
on the original graph

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.193
if you were to graph y equals this.

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:21.538
But now, for the limit purposes,

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:23.748
you can say this is this limit

00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:24.884
is

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.081
this limit is going to be the limit

00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:29.724
as x approaches zero

00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:32.057
of one over two cosine of x.

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:35.141
And now we can go back to

00:11:36.397 --> 00:11:38.562
this green condition right over here,

00:11:38.562 --> 00:11:40.478
because we can evaluate
this at x equals zero.

00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:42.693
It's going to be one over
two times cosine of zero.

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.437
Cosine of zero is one.

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:47.987
So this is going to be equal to one half.

00:11:47.987 --> 00:11:50.637
Now in general, none of
these techniques work,

00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:52.508
and you will encounter
few other techniques

00:11:52.508 --> 00:11:54.711
further on once you learn more calculus,

00:11:54.711 --> 00:11:57.955
then you fall on the base line.

00:11:57.955 --> 00:11:59.276
Approximation.

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:02.099
And approximation, you
can do it numerically.

00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:04.749
Try values really really really close

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:07.297
to the number you're trying
to find the limit on.

00:12:07.297 --> 00:12:09.634
If you're trying to find the
limit as x approaches zero

00:12:09.634 --> 00:12:11.134
try 0.00000000001.

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.164
Try negative 0.0000001

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.593
if you're trying to find the
limit is x approaches four

00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:19.760
try 4.0000001.

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:22.352
Try 3.9999999999

00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:25.878
and see what happens.

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.781
But that's kind of the last ditch.

00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:29.614
The last ditch effort.
