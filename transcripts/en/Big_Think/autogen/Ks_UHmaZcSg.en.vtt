00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.139
 We have all experienced the phenomenon of dijafu, which is the strange feeling we feel when entering 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:12.879
 Room or exposure to a new position and say to yourself "I've been here before. 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.070
 I feel like everything here is familiar. " 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 It has been shown that we can stimulate some forms of dijafu towards subjects of experience. Therefore 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.080
 There is a theory that the Deja vu produces scattered memories 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.789
 We stored them in our minds, and these memories can be retrieved by moving around 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.510
 It's like something we've been through before. So we do not have to call the universes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.559
 Parallel. We do not have to call several universes to explain most of the cases of digavo. 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.559
 However, this raises a question about mobility between 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.300
 Several universes are different by any measure and the answer to this is not fairly clear. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 We physicists believe that there are several actual universes within 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 Living room. We are vibrating waves operating in a dial, and these waves 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.860
 Vibrate and break up over time 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.280
 The Nobel Prize winner Steve Weinberg is on the radio. 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.310
 If you are in your living room and listen to the radio (BBC) radio was set to one frequency, 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 But in the living room there are several radio frequencies for stations (Cuba) and (Moscow) and stations 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.399
 Other, all these radio frequencies vibrate inside the living room, while 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.210
 The radio is set to one frequency only 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.939
 Now, in other words when there are two adjacent universe, they are coherent and you can move 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.229
 Between them and back. But in time, these two worlds separate and begin 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.249
 Vibration at different frequencies. They may not come together again. So why 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.789
 Your radio inability to listen to Moscow Radio? Why can not you have your radio 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.470
 Listen to all frequencies? Since the radio has been disconnected and is no longer vibrating 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 In harmony with these other frequencies. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.060
 The same is true of quantum physics. We are atoms and these atoms are vibrating, but they are 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.530
 No longer vibrating in perfect harmony with these other universes. We have separated from them 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.530
 And we became in isolation from them. In other words, the DiJavo is probably only scattered memories 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 Inside our minds recall memories and previous positions scattered. However, in quantum physics, 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.170
 There really are some certain parallel universes surrounding us, and the problem is that we can not enter it. 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.940
 Because we have become isolated from them and are no longer vibrating in harmony with them. 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.500
 Sorry for that.
