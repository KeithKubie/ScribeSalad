00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.250
Welcome back.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.990
To just review what I was doing
on the last video before

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.050
I ran out of time, I said that
conservation of energy tells

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.980
us that the work I've put into
the system or the energy that

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.300
I've put into the system--
because they're really the

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.740
same thing-- is equal to the
work that I get out of the

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.440
system, or the energy that
I get out of the system.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.480
That means that the input work
is equal to the output work,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.540
or that the input force times
the input distance is equal to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.610
the output force times the
output distance-- that's just

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.020
the definition of work.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.040
Let me just rewrite this
equation here.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.730
If I could just rewrite this
exact equation, I could say--

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:42.780
the input force, and let me just
divide it by this area.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900
The input here-- I'm pressing
down this piston that's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.580
pressing down on this
area of water.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.560
So this input force-- times
the input area.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.380
Let's call the input 1, and
call the output 2 for

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.630
simplicity.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.069
Let's say I have a piston
on the top here.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:09.320
Let me do this in a good color--
brown is good color.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.060
I have another piston here, and
there's going to be some

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.140
outward force F2.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500
The general notion is that I'm
pushing on this water, the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.740
water can't be compressed, so
the water's going to push up

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.470
on this end.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880
The input force times the input
distance is going to be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.540
equal to the output force times
the output distance

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.560
right-- this is just the law of
conservation of energy and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.590
everything we did with
work, et cetera.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.060
I'm rewriting this equation, so
if I take the input force

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.610
and divide by the input area--
let me switch back to green--

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.660
then I multiply by the
area, and then I just

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.222
multiply times D1.

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:55.730
You see what I did here-- I just
multiplied and divided by

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.710
A1, which you can do.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.230
You can multiply and divide by
any number, and these two

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.260
cancel out.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.160
It's equal to the same thing
on the other side, which is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.420
F2-- I'm not good at managing
my space on my whiteboard--

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.790
over A2 times A2 times D2.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.270
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.890
What's this quantity right here,
this F1 divided by A1?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.640
Force divided by area, if you
haven't been familiar with it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.780
already, and if you're just
watching my videos there's no

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.450
reason for you to be, is
defined as pressure.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.260
Pressure is force in a given
area, so this is pressure--

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.620
we'll call this the
pressure that I'm

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.165
inputting into the system.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.360
What's area 1 times
distance 1?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.950
That's the area of the tube
at this point, the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.840
cross-sectional area,
times this distance.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.750
That's equal to this volume
that I calculated in the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.520
previous video-- we could
say that's the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.410
input volume, or V1.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.420
Pressure times V1 is equal to
the output pressure-- force 2

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.115
divided by area 2 is the output
pressure that the water

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:07.670
is exerting on this piston.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.560
So that's the output
pressure, P2.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.700
And what's area 2 times D2?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.110
The cross sectional area, times
the height at which how

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.490
much the water's being displaced
upward, that is

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.740
equal to volume 2.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.680
But what do we know about
these two volumes?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.420
I went over it probably
redundantly in the previous

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.690
video-- those two volumes are
equal, V1 is equal to V2, so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170
we could just divide both
sides by that equation.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.040
You get the pressure input is
equal to the pressure output,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.380
so P1 is equal to P2.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.410
I did all of that just to show
you that this isn't a new

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.190
concept: this is just the
conservation of energy.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.120
The only new thing I did is I
divided-- we have this notion

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.200
of the cross-sectional area,
and we have this notion of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.190
pressure-- so where
does that help us?

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.320
This actually tells us-- and
you can do this example in

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.660
multiple situations, but I like
to think of if we didn't

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.170
have gravity first, because
gravity tends to confuse

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.070
things, but we'll introduce
gravity in a video or two-- is

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.490
that when you have any external
pressure onto a

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.490
liquid, onto an incompressible
fluid, that pressure is

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.960
distributed evenly throughout
the fluid.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.770
That's what we essentially just
proved just using the law

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.030
of conservation of energy, and
everything we know about work.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.370
What I just said is called
Pascal's principle: if any

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.390
external pressure is applied to
a fluid, that pressure is

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.660
distributed throughout
the fluid equally.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.640
Another way to think about it--
we proved it with this

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.710
little drawing here-- is, let's
say that I have a tube,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.520
and at the end of the
tube is a balloon.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.720
Let's say I'm doing this
on the Space Shuttle.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.320
It's saying that if I increase--
say I have some

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.570
piston here.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.560
This is stable, and
I have water

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.810
throughout this whole thing.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.950
Let me see if I can use that
field function again-- oh no,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.760
there must have been a
hole in my drawing.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.120
Let me just draw the water.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.970
I have water throughout this
whole thing, and all Pascal's

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.410
principle is telling us that
if I were to apply some

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:51.360
pressure here, that that net
pressure, that extra pressure

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.040
I'm applying, is going to
compress this little bit.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.770
That extra compression is
going to be distributed

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.130
through the whole balloon.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.330
Let's say that this right here
is rigid-- it's some kind of

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.450
middle structure.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.150
The rest of the balloon is going
to expand uniformly, so

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.830
that increased pressure I'm
doing is going through the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.100
whole thing.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.980
It's not like the balloon will
get longer, or that the

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.010
pressure is just translated
down here, or that just up

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.615
here the balloon's going to get
wider and it's just going

00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:19.170
to stay the same length there.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.800
Hopefully, that gives you a
little bit of intuition.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.050
Going back to what I had drawn
before, that's actually

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.430
interesting, because that's
actually another simple or

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.220
maybe not so simple machine
that we've constructed.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.190
I almost defined it as a
simple machine when I

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.100
initially drew it.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.520
Let's draw that weird thing
again, where it looks like

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.440
this, where I have
water in it.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.678
Let's make sure I fill it, so
that when I do the fill, it

00:06:56.678 --> 00:06:59.720
will completely fill, and
doesn't fill other things.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.820
This is cool, because this is
now another simple machine.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:15.320
We know that the pressure in is
equal to the pressure out.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.990
And pressure is force divided
by area, so the force in,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.080
divided by the area in, is equal
to the force out divided

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.200
by the area out.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.200
Let me give you an example:
let's say that I were to apply

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:49.450
with a pressure in equal
to 10 pascals.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.590
That's a new word, and it's
named after Pascal's

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.090
principle, for Blaise Pascal.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.070
What is a pascal?

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:02.310
That is just equal to 10 newtons
per meter squared.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.460
That's all a pascal is-- it's
a newton per meter squared,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.770
it's a very natural unit.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.930
Let's say my pressure in is 10
pascals, and let's say that my

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:20.930
input area is 2 square meters.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.560
If I looked the surface of the
water there it would be 2

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:31.500
square meters, and let's say
that my output area is equal

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:38.640
to 4 meters squared.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.550
What I'm saying is that I can
push on a piston here, and

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.470
that the water's going to push
up with some piston here.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.220
First of all, I told you what my
input pressure is-- what's

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.840
my input force?

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.900
Input pressure is equal to input
force divided by input

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.260
area, so 10 pascals is equal to
my input force divided by

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.470
my area, so I multiply
both sides by 2.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.640
I get input force is equal
to 20 newtons.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.650
My question to you is what
is the output force?

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.810
How much force is the
system going to push

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.180
upwards at this end?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.880
We know that must if my input
pressure was 10 pascals, my

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.270
output pressure would
also be 10 pascals.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:34.390
So I also have 10 pascals is
equal to my out force over my

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.760
out cross-sectional area.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.880
So I'll have a piston here,
and it goes up like that.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.710
That's 4 meters, so I do 4
times 10, and so I get 40

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.450
newtons is equal to
my output force.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.740
So what just happened here?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.920
I inputted-- so my input force
is equal to 20 newtons, and my

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.550
output force is equal to 40
newtons, so I just doubled my

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.840
force, or essentially I had a
mechanical advantage of 2.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.530
This is an example of a
simple machine, and

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.040
it's a hydraulic machine.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.310
Anyway, I've just
run out of time.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.560
I'll see you in the next video.
