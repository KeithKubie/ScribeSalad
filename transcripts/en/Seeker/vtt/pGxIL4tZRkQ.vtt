00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.410
Scientists published a new study on...penis
size........oh here we go.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.400
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews. When
you think of things that might cause an affair,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.670
a big penis isn't usually one of them. The
cultural narrative is basically: "the bigger

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.460
the sexier, the bigger the better!" But according
to a new study published in PLOS One last

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.119
week, big penises might be causing some...big
problems. US and Kenyan researchers studied

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.439
around 600 couples living around Lake Victoria
in Kenya and found that for every extra inch

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.660
of length in her husband's penis, the likelihood
that the wife would cheat increased by almost

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.420
1 Â½ times. Their qualitative data found the
same results: women associated large penises

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.570
with pain and discomfort during sex, which,
oooobviously, makes things a lot less enjoyable.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.890
Women in the study were quoted saying things
like:

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.800
"...some penises may be large yet my vagina
is small, when he tries to insert it inside,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.790
it hurts so much that I will have to look
for another man who has a smaller one and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.440
can do it in a way I can enjoy".

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.190
Well....shoot. Can't argue with that can you?
Well, except from the perspective that it's

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.060
really strange to solve this problem by CHEATING
ON SOMEONE. I think that's what I find strangest

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.810
about this story. Then again, various forms
of dissatisfaction with the relationship or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.820
the sex is a huge reason why people cheat
in general, so I guess it shouldn't come as

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.490
a huge surprise. The researchers also looked
at other causes of having an affair - the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.710
main ones they found were.....domestic violence---huge
shocker there---and denial of the woman's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.329
preferred sexual positions. Man, these guys
sound like real keepers, amirite?

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.229
What does this research mean? It tells us
something the sexual health world has been

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.320
saying all along: size matters, but not in
the way you think it does. What's most important

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.670
is the way that your bodies *fit together*,
not about how "large" someone is. Vaginas

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.670
come in different sizes as well -- just like
penises, they get erect when aroused and some

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.280
are longer, some are shorter. A short vagina
paired with a long penis is a undoubtedly

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.469
a recipe for very painful, unenjoyable sex.
In addition to stretching things in an unpleasant

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.240
way, it can hit the cervix and jar the ovaries.
Not an uncommon thing - and it can really

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
hurt!

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.630
The researchers concluded the report by ever-so-gently
discouraging men from pursuing penis augmentations,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.060
since it's counterproductive to pleasure for
both parties. They also noted that they hope

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.980
the findings encourage men to understand that
having a large penis doesn't make for better

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.451
sex or better ability to please a partner.
Especially not if you're straight, since the

00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:24.610
vast majority of women can't orgasm vaginally
anyway. Yeaaaaah, myth bustin!

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.580
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone,
we'll see you next time with more science

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.910
updates!
