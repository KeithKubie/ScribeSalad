00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Global life expectancy is 74.1 years 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.360
 But increases in the United States to 78.6, 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.860
 This is equivalent to 28 thousand and 689 days, 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.140
 Or 24.787 million seconds of life on earth. 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.640
 So 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.000
 What can happen in this period of time? 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 You produce 0.4 milliliters of saliva per minute 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 It is 0.5 to 1 liter per day. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.560
 This means that you have filled your life for the rest of your life 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.700
 180 to 360 baths of saliva. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.940
 Men cry on average once a month, 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.340
 The women of Vibein 2.7 times, 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 This means that the average you cry in your life is 1,745 times. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.680
 The average person does not walk an average of 10,000 steps 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.640
 Because the average of the American adult is 5100 steps a day. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.060
 But if it's all about age, 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.840
 Will reach a record number of 146801 steps. 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 If the average step length is 0.71 meters, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.740
 Then you will walk around the equator about 2.6 times. 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.000
 Men do not stop producing new sperm. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 Men produce between 1 and 10 trillion sperm in their lifetime. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.060
 People usually practice sex at the age of 16 to the age of 17. 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.260
 The boomers were associated with an average of 11 sexual partners, 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440
 Millennium babies are expected to be associated 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.860
 With nearly eight sex partners throughout their lives. 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 It is estimated that a person from 20 to 60 years of age learns a word or two a day 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 With a total average of 42,000 words. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.000
 This figure declines as we get older 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.340
 Because this is about the deterioration of our mental powers 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.640
 At a rate of 5% each contract after the age of forty. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 The average person aged 15 or older works 7.9 hours a day in the United States of America, 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.220
 With a retirement age of 63, 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 She will spend about 16 years in the office altogether. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.900
 But do you really work or do you entertain the comic jokes? 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.460
 According to one study, young adults use their phones 5 hours a day, 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.120
 They also scan their phones in 30 seconds at an average of 85 times a day. 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.740
 When you calculate it you will find that the result is about 13 years spent surfing your phone. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 This period does not include Netflix Netflix 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.100
 Whose subscribers exceed 500 hours 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.760
 In viewing the content you view annually, 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.800
 That means you spend about 4.5 years watching Netflix at this rate. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.560
 Over the course of your life, you may become a millionaire like a bachelor's degree holder 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.880
 Who earn an average of 1.8 million 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.620
 And those with a university degree who earn 1.1 million. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.220
 Of your total wealth, you consume alcohol 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 0.9% of your annual income at $ 515 per year on alcohol. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.060
 Men slept about 496.4 minutes daily 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.480
 Women spend 507.6 minutes, 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000
 On average, this means statistically 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.280
 They are more than 11 minutes away from men, 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.000
 You spend more than a third of your life asleep. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 But even in waking time, we spend 10% of our day with closed eyes. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.600
 Because the average person's inclinations reach 28,800 times a day, 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 Or at a rate of 15 to 20 beats per minute. 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.520
 By the age of 30, you may get the flu twice every 10 years. 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 The chances of injury may be reduced due to medical development, 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.920
 But they may also increase because of the amount of time you spend at home. 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.680
 A study in the journal " 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.640
 "We spend 87% of our lives indoors or indoors, while we spend 6% in vehicles. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 The Earth stands at 73 billion and 884 million km over the course of your life. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.060
 So whatever happens, I have traveled billions of kilometers across space. 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.220
 This is really fun! 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.380
 Thank you very much for watching. 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.280

 And does not exceed the minute of time actually. 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.000
 Literally
