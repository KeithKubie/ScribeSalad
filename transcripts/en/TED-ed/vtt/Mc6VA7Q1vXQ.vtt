00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.434
It's a good day to be a pirate.

00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:11.244
Amaro and his four mateys,

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.044
Bart,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:12.746
Charlotte,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:13.514
Daniel,

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:14.225
and Eliza

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:15.715
have struck gold:

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.804
a chest with 100 coins.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:24.584
But now, they must divvy up the booty
according to the pirate code.

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:29.349
As captain, Amaro gets to propose
how to distribute the coins.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.321
Then, each pirate, 
including Amaro himself,

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.728
gets to vote either yarr or nay.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:42.604
If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan.

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:44.663
But if the majority votes nay,

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:46.995
Amaro must walk the plank

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.046
and Bart becomes captain.

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:52.854
Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:56.746
and all remaining pirates vote again.

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:00.036
If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too,

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.245
and Charlotte takes his place.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.826
This process repeats,

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:06.988
with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza

00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:12.526
until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left.

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:18.427
Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible.

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:21.759
But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.107
so they can't collaborate in advance.

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:27.108
And being blood-thirsty pirates,

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.148
if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way,

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:36.297
they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun.

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:40.158
Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:43.368
and knows that the others are, too.

00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:48.287
What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives?

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:53.399
Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself!

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.378
Answer in: 3

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:55.308
Answer in: 2

00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:56.449
Answer in: 1

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.068
If we follow our intuition,

00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:02.798
it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:06.170
to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.129
But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why?

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.570
Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.069
So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal,

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.968
but about all possible outcomes
down the line.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.832
And because the rank order is known
in advance,

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:34.151
each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:37.801
and adjust their own votes accordingly.

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.170
Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.989
so let's start by following 
her thought process.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.431
She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:53.201
with only her and Daniel remaining.

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.701
Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold

00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.471
and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him,

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:05.631
so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs.

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:08.271
Now we move to the previous decision point

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:12.560
with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.501
Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel,

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:19.941
who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing.

00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:22.156
So to secure Eliza's vote,

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:27.291
Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.113
Since this ensures her support,

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:33.821
Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all.

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.713
What if there are four pirates?

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:40.862
As captain, Bart would still only need
one other vote for his plan to pass.

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:45.342
He knows that Daniel wouldn't want 
the decision to pass to Charlotte,

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:49.022
so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support

00:03:49.022 --> 00:03:52.172
with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:57.543
Now we're back at the initial vote
with all five pirates standing.

00:03:57.543 --> 00:03:59.952
Having considered all the other scenarios,

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:02.423
Amaro knows that if he goes overboard,

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:04.211
the decision comes down to Bart,

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.102
which would be bad news 
for Charlotte and Eliza.

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:13.253
So he offers them one coin each,
keeping 98 for himself.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.150
Bart and Daniel vote nay,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.304
but Charlotte and Eliza 
grudgingly vote yarr

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:23.414
knowing that the alternative 
would be worse for them.

00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:27.383
The pirate game involves some interesting
concepts from game theory.

00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:30.124
One is the concept of common knowledge

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:33.064
where each person is aware of what
the others know

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.407
and uses this to predict their reasoning.

00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:40.334
And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:43.593
where each player knows every other
players' strategy

00:04:43.593 --> 00:04:46.394
and chooses theirs accordingly.

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:49.355
Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.979
than cooperating would,

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.555
no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.826
So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold,

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:02.539
and the other pirates might need
to find better ways

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.214
to use those impressive logic skills,

00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:08.475
like revising this absurd pirate code.
