application it will still work very well

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930
application it will still work very well
 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.780
application it will still work very well
now let's look at some other numbers to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
now let's look at some other numbers to
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.289
now let's look at some other numbers to
prove this so oral in the world the 3G

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299
prove this so oral in the world the 3G
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.050
prove this so oral in the world the 3G
coverage by population is 69% this is a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
coverage by population is 69% this is a
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.120
coverage by population is 69% this is a
very good number like 70% of the world

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
very good number like 70% of the world
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.820
very good number like 70% of the world
population has 3G coverage in their area

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
population has 3G coverage in their area
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.559
population has 3G coverage in their area
this will make like really good internet

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
this will make like really good internet
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.890
this will make like really good internet
by minimis but if you look at the rural

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
by minimis but if you look at the rural
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.990
by minimis but if you look at the rural
population is 30%

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
population is 30%
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.420
population is 30%
so if you're not living in a city this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
so if you're not living in a city this
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.660
so if you're not living in a city this
is a 30% chance that you're a has 3g 2g

I was below 3G we're talking about like

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100
I was below 3G we're talking about like
 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.599
I was below 3G we're talking about like
age I know so if you look at urban

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609
age I know so if you look at urban
 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.849

population so if you live in a city this

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
population so if you live in a city this
 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.190
population so if you live in a city this
90% is a very good number ninety percent

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
90% is a very good number ninety percent
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.670
90% is a very good number ninety percent
of people have 3G at a given time so I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
of people have 3G at a given time so I
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.170
of people have 3G at a given time so I
was giving like talking about these

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
was giving like talking about these

if you look at the application what

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010
if you look at the application what
 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.560
if you look at the application what
happens there is you click on the button

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570
happens there is you click on the button
 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.570
happens there is you click on the button
it goes you're like presenter view

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580
it goes you're like presenter view
 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.310
it goes you're like presenter view
control or whatever you choose to use

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320
control or whatever you choose to use
 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.610
control or whatever you choose to use
and then it calls the network when the

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620
and then it calls the network when the
 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.340
and then it calls the network when the
network decides to come back you get it

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.350
network decides to come back you get it
 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.710
network decides to come back you get it
off the modal dialog but like who cares

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720
off the modal dialog but like who cares
 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.570
off the modal dialog but like who cares
user doesn't even understand like my mom

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580
user doesn't even understand like my mom
 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.950
user doesn't even understand like my mom
doesn't really understand that there's a

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960
doesn't really understand that there's a
 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.510
doesn't really understand that there's a
network request song like she doesn't

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520
network request song like she doesn't
 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.379
network request song like she doesn't
know what network is get it off it so

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:46.389
know what network is get it off it so
 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.409
know what network is get it off it so
instead do something a model like model

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:49.419
instead do something a model like model
 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.770
instead do something a model like model
your data locally so that when user

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:52.780
your data locally so that when user
 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.570
your data locally so that when user
clicks is the click button you just

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580
clicks is the click button you just
 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.490
clicks is the click button you just
update the model your market is like

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:56.500
update the model your market is like
 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.180
update the model your market is like
they say you know 100 milliseconds 200

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.190
they say you know 100 milliseconds 200
 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.980
they say you know 100 milliseconds 200
milliseconds it comes back you update

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990
milliseconds it comes back you update
 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.409
milliseconds it comes back you update
the real now your model tells it to the

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:04.419
the real now your model tells it to the
 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.120
the real now your model tells it to the
network a like there's a change I here

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.130
network a like there's a change I here
 

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.339
network a like there's a change I here
locally can you apply it to the server

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:08.349
locally can you apply it to the server
 

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:11.040
locally can you apply it to the server
and the server comes back you refresh

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.050
and the server comes back you refresh
 

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.870
and the server comes back you refresh
your view again because now you know you

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:12.880
your view again because now you know you
 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.629
your view again because now you know you
really change it so if he implemented it

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639
really change it so if he implemented it
 

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:17.370
really change it so if he implemented it
this way it will look like this you tap

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.380
this way it will look like this you tap
 

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.620
this way it will look like this you tap
on the button there's some sort of

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:19.630
on the button there's some sort of
 

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.810
on the button there's some sort of
indication that usually take like user

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:21.820
indication that usually take like user
 

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.930
indication that usually take like user
receives the feedback instantly and then

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:24.940
receives the feedback instantly and then
 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.420
receives the feedback instantly and then
when you finally synchronize it it turns

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.430
when you finally synchronize it it turns
 

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.360
when you finally synchronize it it turns
red so it's important that you give a

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.370
red so it's important that you give a
 

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.219
red so it's important that you give a
feedback to the user so they understand

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:32.229
feedback to the user so they understand
 

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:35.699
feedback to the user so they understand
something has changed and then you find

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:35.709
something has changed and then you find
 

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.469
something has changed and then you find
also let the neither users learn this

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479
also let the neither users learn this
 

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:38.760
also let the neither users learn this
and this is what we call the response to

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:38.770
and this is what we call the response to
 

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.199
and this is what we call the response to
user experience so look at the same

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:43.209
user experience so look at the same
 

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:47.820
user experience so look at the same
application again I tap on it as yellow

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:47.830
application again I tap on it as yellow
 

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.069

something like AI is consistent this is
 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.890
something like AI is consistent this is
good then I go to okay I did that again

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:04.900
good then I go to okay I did that again
 

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.470
good then I go to okay I did that again
another use case and I go to this pace a

Droid decides to kill the application
because we needed memory and like time

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.110
because we needed memory and like time

there anymore now you have no idea what

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.180
there anymore now you have no idea what

so you don't want to do this and I how

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:42.550
so you don't want to do this and I how
 

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.410
so you don't want to do this and I how
do we fix this

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:43.420
do we fix this
 

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.420
do we fix this
so in the previous one why we said we

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.430
so in the previous one why we said we
 

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.280
so in the previous one why we said we
have control calls the model model calls

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.290
have control calls the model model calls
 

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.579
have control calls the model model calls

okay let's improve this a little bit

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:51.790
okay let's improve this a little bit
 

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.150
okay let's improve this a little bit
interview something call it application

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160
interview something call it application
 

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.880
interview something call it application
logic and make the model persistent it's

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:56.890
logic and make the model persistent it's
 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.560
logic and make the model persistent it's
very important like you should use you

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.570
very important like you should use you
 

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.990
very important like you should use you
should definitely use use SQLite use

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000
should definitely use use SQLite use
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.640
should definitely use use SQLite use
rearm use whatever you want we don't

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:02.650
rearm use whatever you want we don't
 

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.510
rearm use whatever you want we don't
care but use persistent data storage so

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:06.520
care but use persistent data storage so
 

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.520
care but use persistent data storage so
when the application logic does any

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:08.530
when the application logic does any
 

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.829
when the application logic does any
network requests it always updates the

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839
network requests it always updates the
 

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.829
network requests it always updates the
persistent model and then this speech is

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839
persistent model and then this speech is
 

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.540
persistent model and then this speech is
in event or you might be using or it's

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.550
in event or you might be using or it's
 

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.540
in event or you might be using or it's
Java observables again we don't care

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:17.550
Java observables again we don't care
 

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.850
Java observables again we don't care
this race event and the wheel shows the

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:20.860
this race event and the wheel shows the
 

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.610
this race event and the wheel shows the
state on the model the important there

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:23.620
state on the model the important there
 

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.740
state on the model the important there
two important parts here the model

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.750
two important parts here the model
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.230
two important parts here the model
should be persistent and the wheels

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240
should be persistent and the wheels
 

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.510
should be persistent and the wheels
should always reflect what is in the

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:30.520
should always reflect what is in the
 

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.060
should always reflect what is in the
model so you don't you just go and

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.070
model so you don't you just go and
 

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.000
model so you don't you just go and
change the button to like selected state

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.010
change the button to like selected state
 

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.710
change the button to like selected state
while you try to make your web request

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720
while you try to make your web request
 

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.110
while you try to make your web request
don't do that update the model let the

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120
don't do that update the model let the
 

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.300
don't do that update the model let the
view refresh itself because when you do

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:42.310
view refresh itself because when you do
 

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.000
view refresh itself because when you do
this it's a user clicks click you tell

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.010
this it's a user clicks click you tell
 

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.920
this it's a user clicks click you tell
the application logic I want to send a

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:46.930
the application logic I want to send a
 

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.280
the application logic I want to send a
like that updates the model model says I

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.290
like that updates the model model says I
 

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.800
like that updates the model model says I
have changed or duplication logic says I

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:52.810
have changed or duplication logic says I
 

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.500
have changed or duplication logic says I
have changed and your real nose if user

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:55.510
have changed and your real nose if user
 

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.150
have changed and your real nose if user
is there I like all right I should

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160
is there I like all right I should
 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.040
is there I like all right I should
refresh myself because the data I'm

00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.050
refresh myself because the data I'm
 

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.190
refresh myself because the data I'm
displaying has changed so you go there

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200
displaying has changed so you go there
 

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.800
displaying has changed so you go there
it refreshes the you are this is man it

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:04.810
it refreshes the you are this is man it
 

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.660
it refreshes the you are this is man it
is yellow because you know data is

some like transient temporary UI states

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500
some like transient temporary UI states
 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.560
some like transient temporary UI states
so we look at the application again we

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:31.570
so we look at the application again we
 

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.480
so we look at the application again we
go there there was a profile you see you

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.490
go there there was a profile you see you
 

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.610
go there there was a profile you see you
go back you got another profile you go

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:35.620
go back you got another profile you go
 

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.480
go back you got another profile you go
back using the application for a wire

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.490
back using the application for a wire
 

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.400
back using the application for a wire
and now what happens is you go back to

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.410
and now what happens is you go back to
 

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.020
and now what happens is you go back to
this list again and there's a loading

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.030
this list again and there's a loading
 

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.590
this list again and there's a loading
it's like I was on the application two

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600
it's like I was on the application two
 

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.510
it's like I was on the application two
minutes ago I saw that list like there

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:48.520
minutes ago I saw that list like there
 

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.190
minutes ago I saw that list like there
is no way you are loading that list

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200
is no way you are loading that list
 

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.140
is no way you are loading that list
because I know the list is there so what

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.150
because I know the list is there so what
 

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.170
because I know the list is there so what
went wrong here so it's what's happening

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:55.180
went wrong here so it's what's happening
 

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.390
went wrong here so it's what's happening
every time you go into UI you fetch the

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:57.400
every time you go into UI you fetch the
 

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.130
every time you go into UI you fetch the
list of users right you facial you know

00:11:59.130 --> 00:11:59.140
list of users right you facial you know
 

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.500
list of users right you facial you know
the date ID if the user like this so

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:01.510
the date ID if the user like this so
 

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.450
the date ID if the user like this so
this you're like background thread pool

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:03.460
this you're like background thread pool
 

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.610
this you're like background thread pool
you keep consuming these things you have

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:05.620
you keep consuming these things you have
 

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.860
you keep consuming these things you have
multiple workers

so after is refreshing user data from
 

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.450
so after is refreshing user data from
network the otherwise the again like

like you went back to that UI you want

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:17.260
like you went back to that UI you want
 

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.380
like you went back to that UI you want
to read the list of users from the disk

to read the list of users from the disk
 

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.910
to read the list of users from the disk
so you've not the right way you are

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920
so you've not the right way you are
 

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.130
so you've not the right way you are
trying to load it from the disk but the

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.140
trying to load it from the disk but the
 

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.290
trying to load it from the disk but the
problem is your background turns are

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:25.300
problem is your background turns are
 

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.380
problem is your background turns are
busy trying to make a network request

busy trying to make a network request
 

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.910
busy trying to make a network request
like this is so bad because you know

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920
like this is so bad because you know
 

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.560
like this is so bad because you know
this case that you know you will be able

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:31.570
this case that you know you will be able
 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.080
this case that you know you will be able
to access it but the network you don't

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.090
to access it but the network you don't
 

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.590
to access it but the network you don't
know and you're making the user wait for

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600
know and you're making the user wait for
 

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.310
know and you're making the user wait for
no reason

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320
no reason
 

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.500
no reason
and the solution for this is very simple

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:40.510
and the solution for this is very simple
 

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.930
and the solution for this is very simple
you just save different queues for

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:42.940
you just save different queues for
 

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.460
you just save different queues for
different type of months have different

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:44.470
different type of months have different
 

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.990
different type of months have different
queues well you cannot just create a

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000
queues well you cannot just create a
 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.480
queues well you cannot just create a
queue for every type of run but usually

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:48.490
queue for every type of run but usually
 

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.310
queue for every type of run but usually
at least you shouldn't want for your

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320
at least you shouldn't want for your
 

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.650
at least you shouldn't want for your
network related stuff and one for your

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
network related stuff and one for your
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.350
network related stuff and one for your
local access you know for local access

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360
local access you know for local access
 

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.150
local access you know for local access
you'll probably just use a load on async

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160
you'll probably just use a load on async
 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.860
you'll probably just use a load on async
tasks that were fast enough because

00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:58.870
tasks that were fast enough because
 

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.420
tasks that were fast enough because
those things are like under 200

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.430
those things are like under 200

so once we do this as we add these tests

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:06.400
so once we do this as we add these tests
 

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.590
so once we do this as we add these tests
because we want to get data they get

application should work offline like
 

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.390
application should work offline like
everything just works and then you're

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:21.400
everything just works and then you're
 

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.060
everything just works and then you're
trying to sync it later on of course

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.070
trying to sync it later on of course
 

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.120

it's not always everything whether so we

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.130
it's not always everything whether so we
 

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.980
it's not always everything whether so we
look at the other section how do you

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:28.990
look at the other section how do you
 

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.010
look at the other section how do you
optimize for the next billion and the

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.020
optimize for the next billion and the
 

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:38.370
optimize for the next billion and the
next villain looks like this so this is

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:38.380
next villain looks like this so this is
 

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.830
next villain looks like this so this is
101 you need to translate your

because you may have text there and you
also translate your in-app purchases so

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:55.540
also translate your in-app purchases so
 

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.640
also translate your in-app purchases so
that they can spend money but actually

the right thing you should do is
localize so localize your application

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:09.670

won't just translate it because let's

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:11.980
won't just translate it because let's
 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.500
won't just translate it because let's
say you have an application about a

say you have an application about a
 

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.390

page if you have an American family in
 

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.950
page if you have an American family in
United States put an Indonesian family

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:22.960
United States put an Indonesian family
 

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.570
United States put an Indonesian family
in Indonesia and if you're in China put

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.580
in Indonesia and if you're in China put
 

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.040
in Indonesia and if you're in China put
the Chinese family like you should

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.050
the Chinese family like you should

their differences and if you want to
 

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.990
their differences and if you want to
make best of localization this is what

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000
make best of localization this is what
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.080
make best of localization this is what
you should be doing and the other thing

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.090
you should be doing and the other thing
 

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.060
you should be doing and the other thing
is text free layers no way you can do

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.070
is text free layers no way you can do
 

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.000
