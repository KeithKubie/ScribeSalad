00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.120
The focus of this lesson is
going to be on software security.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.070
Software runs on everything.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.650
The devices we carry in our pockets.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.425
The back end servers.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.500
Even the network elements that provide
the connectivity that we depend on.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.450
We're going to explore common bugs and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.740
vulnerabilities and
how they get exploited.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.710
We're also going to talk about defenses,
both what we can do, and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.320
what the operating system can do for us.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.180
By the end of this lesson, hopefully,
you're going to understand

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.340
the importance of what we
call secure programming, and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340
will practice it when you write code.
