1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,180
Okay.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey Man, what's going on? Oh,

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,880
Yay.

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,750
Fucking freckled cunt.
It's the Thursday afternoon,

5
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,540
just before Friday and
Monday morning podcast.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,060
[inaudible] just checking in on you.
Oh,

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,070
Billy's burning it at fucking
both ends do to, to, to, to do,

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,740
do you know I woke up this morning by
Dubai [inaudible] poop and I went to the

9
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:28,150
gym by that and I that and I did so bad
pull downs and I had to leave with a

10
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:31,350
grin cause I got it out of the way up.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,670
I was going back and forth with somebody,
um,

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,880
this morning and east coast friend of
mine who I hadn't talked to in a while.

13
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:42,220
How are you enjoying being a dad
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,160
And then she hits me up with the
whole, hey, I'm turning 50 this year.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,120
I am not happy about it. I said,
yeah, I turned 50 last year. She goes,

16
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:52,990
how was turning 50 for you? You
know, she goes, you're a guy.

17
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,300
You probably don't care.
It's much harder for a woman,

18
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,560
especially with our careers. Oh,
did I have fun with that? You know,

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,690
I just wrote back,

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,283
wow.

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,640
Jesus fucking Christ.
You know what I mean?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,690
White women complaining is
one of the funniest fits.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,750
Like you got to fucking house in a
beautiful family. What is the fucking per,

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,620
it's so much harder for me. You're going
to outlive me by six to eight years.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,150
So me turn in 50s, like
me turn in like 56, 57 58.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,850
You don't hear me complaining.
You know,

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,480
you never hear me complain on this
podcast. This is nothing but positivity,

28
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,310
rainbows and fucking UNICORNS. Um, yeah,

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,260
I love that Shit. It's harder for,
it's harder for women to go to the gym.

30
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,740
It's harder for us to lose weight. Well
then fucking work harder. You know,

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,460
everybody's different. Oh, is that where
it's hard and you know, it was, you know,

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,370
it's harder for me,
uh,

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,350
trying to get some woman to pay the
cover charge and buy me drinks. You know,

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,490
it's harder for me to divorce court,
uh, outliving you. I mean, the, it,

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,570
it balances out ladies.
Getting child support. Yeah,

36
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,370
that's harder for me because
I'll be the one paying it.

37
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,330
Then all of a sudden it costs 900 grand
a month to raise a fucking two year old.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,010
Right. I just don't understand the
constant complaining by white women.

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,430
Okay, you're white, you live
in America. Shut up. Okay,

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,280
wait to the other problems is
solved and then we'll get to you.

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,360
You're at the meat counter. Your
number isn't up yet. Wait your turn.

42
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,920
Alright, wait your turn
Abigail. Chino but hard.

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,020
It's so much easier for you to go to.
It's not easier.

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,260
Men's lives are harder because
we have to live with you guys.

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,350
Oh Man.

46
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,830
I want to become friends with a lesbian
couple and I want to like be friends

47
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,620
with like the, the, the, the chicken,

48
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,350
the relationship that's got to
handle more the dude shit. You know,

49
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,820
cause you know,
opposites attract.

50
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,970
And I would think even like in
the lesbian community there,

51
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,740
there's gotta be somebody you know
who's out there swinging the ax,

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,210
getting the fucking firewood while the
other ones there making the muffins.

53
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,170
That's the lesbian I want to talk to
right into my podcast. Please. You know,

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
I want to know if those lesbians
on average die sooner than,

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,140
than, than the, the, the
dainty lesbian, you know.

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,710
Okay.

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,890
The lesbian who's got to go out on the
fucking roof and adjust the fucking

58
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,780
directv satellite fucking thing
in the middle of the fucking rain.

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,420
That's all I want to.
That's who I want to hear from.

60
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,630
That's the study I would be
doing. Um, anyways, uh, Geez,

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,110
I'm coming in hot. I'm coming in hot.
I'm wearing my old man's sweater that I,

62
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:39,290
that I've got when I was over there in
Ireland, you know, and I'll tell you,

63
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,880
that was so much harder for women to
find sweaters, you know, to be judged.

64
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,960
Um, anyway, speaking of which,

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm in the middle of an acting gig right
now and I am having the time of my life.

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,990
I'm having so much fun in this acting gig.

67
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:57,980
It's actually scaring me because
most of the time comedians,

68
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,650
the entire time you're on the acting
Gig, you'll be in like, you know,

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I could have fucking made you know twice
as much money in one hour that I have

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,090
that I'm going to on this entire fucking
shoot. You know, why am I still here?

71
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,720
That's what you usually think at.
But uh, I've, I've cracked the code.

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,420
Yeah,

73
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,450
I know how to do it now.
What I do is when I go on to set,

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't bring my phone and I don't bring
a watch and then it's like I walked

75
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,500
into a casino. I don't know if its
day, I don't know if it's night.

76
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,360
I just fucking do my shit.
I tried to do it, you know,

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,760
as well as I can,
I listened to the director or whatever.

78
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,330
And then in between takes I sit down
and just conserve my fucking energy and

79
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,760
that's all I do.
Not Looking at anything.

80
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,761
I just sit there like fucking private
pile when he's sitting on the commode

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,570
in full metal jacket.

82
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,060
And then now all of a sudden after
I feel like I've been at two hours,

83
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,640
all of a sudden it's okay, we'll
break for lunch. I'm like, okay.

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,400
And then I go outside into the sun.
You know,

85
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,730
I get a salad with the protein ladies
salad with the protein heavy on the salad

86
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,550
protein,
no bigger than the size of my pasty palm.

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,441
That's what I do.

88
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,430
And then I just fucking go back in and I
just do it all over again and I have no

89
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:19,990
fucking idea what time it is. And then
all of a sudden they just say, you rapped.

90
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,350
And I just act like a silly jackass
and try to make jokes all day long.

91
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:30,351
And I have been having the fucking
time of my life having a great time.

92
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,990
Um, so anyways, what am I acting
on? I'm not allowed to tell.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,810
It's a secret. Um, I'm
acting on general hospital.

94
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:46,950
Everybody. Okay? I've come back from the
dead. I, a lot of people don't know this.

95
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:51,951
I had a role on that back in the 80s when
I had a giant orange fucking Afro and

96
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:57,260
a, my character died of cancer.
But now he's come back it,

97
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,330
you know, his hair didn't grow
back yet, but his beard didn't.

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,160
And that's the jump off
point to the character.

99
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,640
And I am going to go out on a limb
and say this is going to be the most

100
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,040
interesting character since
heath ledger's the joker. Okay.

101
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,570
I am the heath ledger joker character of,
of general hospital.

102
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,183
Okay.

103
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,550
It's an 87 episode arc that we
shoot over the course of one week.

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,670
I don't know what I'm talking about
anymore. Uh, you know, and you know,

105
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,720
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

106
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,740
I'm talking about two and three shows
after this acting Gig is over to get

107
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:38,030
myself ready to shoot my next special,
I'm going to be in Santa Barbara,

108
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,990
Santa Barbara, where all the rich
white people in Oprah moved after they,

109
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,260
after they made money in Hollywood.
All right?

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,320
Then I'm going to Pasadena. All
right. We're all the racist,

111
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:54,500
right wing lunatics,
you know,

112
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:58,010
build a fucking wall of la live.
A lot of people don't realize that.

113
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,460
A lot of people think everybody out
here is a liberal area. That's not true.

114
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,160
All you gotta do is just go to
Burbank, okay? They're walking around.

115
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:08,660
They got fucking two by fours
and pitchforks. You know,

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,400
I believe the kids say shit gets real in
Burbank and then I'm out in Riverside.

117
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,250
Okay. Riverside, that part of America,

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,130
you know that politicians don't bring up.

119
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,660
You know that feminists don't bring up
when they're attacking standup comedians

120
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,410
x, they forget. What about all
the poor people in Riverside?

121
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,661
Riverside.

122
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,750
That's just sounds like a place where
you can dump a body and you know what?

123
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,040
That's exactly what happens.
If you ever kill anybody in Los Angeles,

124
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,010
you have to know their next move.
Okay.

125
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:44,930
Other than getting rid of your cell
phone is you drive the body to Riverside.

126
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,360
Okay. As far as I know, there is no
river there. Okay? I don't know what,

127
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,820
I don't know what it is,
but all I know there's,

128
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:56,720
there's enough gullies and there's just
enough dead people there already that

129
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,310
you can get lost in the herd with
dragging your dead body. Okay.

130
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,130
Um, I will be performing there.
Santa Barbara on February 15th,

131
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,700
the day after the most bullshit
fucking holiday there is the,

132
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,850
you never hear a fucking, you
know, peep out of your wife, bitch.

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,430
You see here what my fucking
wife's asking, hey man, did she,

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,580
she asked for this fucking
stupid designer goddamn bag.

135
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,600
I swear to God it looked like somebody
dumped toothpaste all over it. You know,

136
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,810
like,
you know,

137
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:31,811
like when some fucking jackass partners
up with some high end label to do their

138
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,030
version of the bag,
you know,

139
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,890
and then every fucking bored
fucking Douche bag has to
go get the fucking thing.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,120
You know, not say my wife's board, I love
her. I just, I just, I looked at the bag,

141
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,690
I'm like, you look at that fucking
thing that did that. It's not getting,

142
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,260
what are you going to do with that thing?
I like it. I think it's interesting.

143
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,070
It's bold. It's fucking ugly as
shit. I wish you could see this bag.

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,850
Do you remember those stupid fucking
toothpaste that came out that was like

145
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,790
toothpaste, mouthwash and
deodorant all at the same time?

146
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,090
It looked like a fucking rainbow.
Just imagine if you did that,

147
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,960
but it,
but it was also like cloudy,

148
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,160
like milk and you dump
that on a beautiful,

149
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,550
yeah.

150
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,270
Gorgeous handmade fucking bag.
That was perfectly fucking fine.

151
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,030
You know what is art? You can't judge
art. Yeah, you can't. That stinks.

152
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,880
Okay. Fucking stinks. You know, that's,
that begs for like, people who like,

153
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:34,000
you know, like John Michael
[inaudible], you know,

154
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,120
like the hacky artists that
everybody knows. You know,

155
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,800
people just like to say is guys name,

156
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,450
just so they can make it
sound like they fucking,

157
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,520
they can speak French Shawn
Michael Basket. You don't
just fucking stick figures.

158
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,440
I mean, I fucking drew like
that in the first grade.

159
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,053
Yeah.

160
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,063
I had,

161
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,520
I can't believe how much all this pictures
I put on my parents' refrigerator.

162
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:01,990
How much should they be worth nowadays?
Um, I'm fucking with you. I don't,

163
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:05,320
this one thing I don't know anything
about at, and if you don't believe me,

164
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,210
just watch my act,
but I really don't.

165
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,820
I don't know why.

166
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,023
Okay.

167
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,910
Um,
I don't get Andy Warhol.

168
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,450
Okay.

169
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,090
Just painting the tomato soup
can every was like, oh my God,

170
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:23,950
he's commented on commercialism in
America. All right, great comment. Uh,

171
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,700
how much is,

172
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,720
how much for fucking can of soup and
that canvas that you fucking put it on?

173
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:33,700
I'll give you that amount of money
for it. Um, anyways, by the way,

174
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,610
you know, that guy got shot by
a woman. I didn't know that.

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,180
And then she did like fucking three weeks
in jail and then got out for the rest

176
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,050
of his fucking life.

177
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:44,050
He's got to deal with this crazy sell
would sell running around out there.

178
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,610
And then like 20 years later,

179
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,120
you kind of died of complications
from getting shot by her. No,

180
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,210
but it's so much harder for a woman.

181
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,030
MMM. Anyways, yeah. I
don't understand. You know,

182
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,380
the one guy I actually liked liked it,

183
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,600
that I kind of understood and it's
not cause I kind of look like the uh,

184
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,560
bald version of him. I didn't
mind Van Gogh. Oh really?
Bill, you didn't mind him.

185
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,560
Did you allow him in your artistic world?
I didn't mean it like that.

186
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,770
The guy who used the lines,
you know,

187
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:20,330
the vertical lines and he painted
shit like that. Uh, I liked that shit.

188
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,240
I Dunno. I like when somebody paints
somebody, how they look, you know,

189
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,270
now when they stick their ear and
their forehead and it's like, whoa man.

190
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,070
Like why do you think he did that?
You know?

191
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,540
Is that because he feels like nobody
can hear his thoughts? I mean,

192
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,430
is there are layers to this? Uh, no.

193
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:39,580
I just think he fucking knows how to draw
an ear and he stuck it on the forehead.

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,840
He's probably dropping
acid. I don't know. Or,

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,850
or even all those canvases where it's
just, it's, it's nothing. It's just,

196
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:53,140
it looks like some toddler just
fucking smeared it all over the place.

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,560
He's just like, yeah, just like, why,
you know, I just look at him like,

198
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,890
why did he put that color over there?
Like why is that?

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,710
I saw Laura's one time and some Metallica
documentary and he was selling this

200
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,890
fucking this fucking pay too.
Cause he was getting all this money for,

201
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,440
he was just going,
I just like that over there is just like,

202
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,650
why did he put that cock?
Like I don't know Lars,

203
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,340
I've got to go out on a limb.
I think you could have done that.

204
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,750
The saved yourself a bunch of money.

205
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:24,751
But he turned around and he sold it
and he made even more fucking money.

206
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,870
And you combine that with the fact that
he gets his drum kits for free in what

207
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:33,280
you have is a very rich young man.
Um,

208
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,580
anyways, how much time is
that? 12 minutes. Fuck,

209
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,240
I got another fucking 17 and a half
to go. Jesus fucking Christ. You know,

210
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:42,100
some days this podcast,
you know,

211
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,030
it just goes by quick and other times
it doesn't. Did Anybody Watch uh,

212
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,870
barstool sports at the fucking super
bowl man? How fucking fun was that?

213
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,450
They got into the, uh, the, uh,
the fucking press conference
and Portnoy was asking,

214
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,710
uh, Gee, I don't know any of the names.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,790
Still the rams running back wide took
a knee and how it cost them like four

216
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,624
grand on a bed

217
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,830
and then what the NFL is going to
fucking kick them out. It's like that.

218
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,470
They're all about gambling. They have
sports gambling now. It's just like,

219
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,720
you know,
it's their dirty little secret.

220
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,470
You might as well just let fans
ask those questions. Right.

221
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,050
I thought it was fucking hilarious.

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,040
And the only thing funnier than that
was afterwards when Portnoy did his

223
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,370
interview or what I was interviewing
thing and he was all fucking amped up

224
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,500
saying like, what were they
gonna do to me? And he goes,

225
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:31,460
put the fucking cuffs on me.

226
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,820
Okay.
It's

227
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,720
all good. Like he's fucking snake plis
skin. What the fucking cops on me.

228
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,070
I didn't know he was like
that. Steven Seagal. Dave
Portnoy's, I'm telling you, man,

229
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,940
you put them in a prison. Evidently
they're going to take over. Um,

230
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,970
but anyways,
I thought that was really funny.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,560
And then he went on fucking the new show
there with that fucking Weirdo looking

232
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:59,380
guy. That guy, he always
goes on, that guy's show,

233
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,720
that guy who looks like you know,

234
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,050
he the guy who killed his girlfriend
accidentally cause they were having rough

235
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,750
sex, doesn't he look like
one of those guys? Um,

236
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,510
and he was still wearing the costume that,
you know,

237
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,540
God bless those guys at fucking, at
a bar stool. You know what I mean?

238
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,850
How boring is the week between the AFC
and NFC championship game and the Super

239
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,900
Bowl, you know, put the cuffs on
me, put the lotion at the pocket.

240
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,690
Um, oh, by the way, now the Ruffin
rally is coming up order that,

241
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,670
that's gotta be a in
Atlanta. And um, you know,

242
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:39,900
I heard, I didn't realize they said
Portnoy was banned from all NFL events.

243
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:40,890
I don't know how many years ago,

244
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,550
but he's still allowed to buy a
ticket to the Superbowl and go, right.

245
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,570
You know, is he allowed to do that or
are they going to be sitting there?

246
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,380
Do they have this security?
All right, this is Dave.

247
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,770
Looks like without a fake
mustache hanging off his face.

248
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,460
And this is what he looks like now with
it on. Um, I wonder how that works.

249
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
I wonder. These are the things that I
think about. All right. What are we up to?

250
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:07,400
15 minutes, just like that,
15 minutes, just like that.

251
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,220
Um, so anyways, I went to the
gym this morning, right as
that woman was texting me,

252
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,800
telling me how hard it was for her
to turn 50. You know what I mean?

253
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,790
It was so difficult.

254
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,350
I just can't imagine being in a white
woman having to blow out all those candles

255
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,770
in your beautiful house.
I mean, God, you know,

256
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,390
maybe you ought to think
about the children that put
those candles together in a

257
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,010
sweatshop. Um, you know,

258
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,130
they probably have to do that with their
one arm after they dug up some diamonds

259
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,430
for you. I want that. Why? Um,

260
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,930
all right. Anyways, hey bill, do you
have any super bowl predictions? Yes,

261
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,990
I'm going to age 100 fucking years.
Once again,

262
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,110
I am having a small select group
of people come over and uh,

263
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm going simple, by the way. Anybody
who's hosting a super bowl party,

264
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,443
all right,

265
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,440
don't let anybody talk you into
getting this all this fucking food.

266
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,720
All right? Nobody throws an event
like my lovely wife. All right?

267
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,950
But the thing about it is,

268
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,980
is afterwards you left with a bunch of
stuff and then you have to eat it because

269
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,800
you don't want it to go bad.
And then like, you know,

270
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,510
whatever you enjoyed by the
last time we had a thing.

271
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,410
I think it was for my daughter's
birthday is hilarious. She turned two.

272
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,650
So we had a two and under party, right?
Instead of 21 and over, you know,

273
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,970
two and under. So he had all these
little kids there and then like whatever.

274
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,430
So we had 10 kids. It's going
to be 20 parents there, right.

275
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,740
Provided it's not a broken home.
Um, so we had to have all, you know,

276
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,010
fucking Bagels, Sam like
locks, all of this shit, dude.

277
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,010
I was eating a fucking salmon
for like eight fucking days.

278
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,460
I mean, I just have two words. It's just
like, you know, because, oh, that's right.

279
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,070
So now I'm having my
Superbowl party and he goes,

280
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:02,880
why don't you get a caterer referred?
I say,

281
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,770
cause I don't want to be eating fucking
hotdogs for like the next 12 days.

282
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,090
So I just, you know, I figured, all right,

283
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,110
the most anybody's going to eat is two
burgers each the biggest I'm going to

284
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,850
make the burgers probably a quarter
pound. Right? That's another thing too,

285
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,640
when you make the homemade burgers, don't
make them fucking gigantic. All right?

286
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,580
You can't make them check canted take.
It's just, it becomes too much. All right,

287
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,910
you got to make them like the same way
Miller high life makes their beers,

288
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,530
somehow it's 12 ounces,

289
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:37,160
but if feels like fucking four
and it just goes down easy.

290
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,000
That's what you want to do.

291
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,920
Cause then they'll come back and
then they'll get the second one.

292
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,870
You know what I mean? Uh, yet bill, it's
very simple. Your theory is very simple.

293
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:49,440
So I'm trying to, uh, like
have the least amount,

294
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,790
you know, and just some chips and
some beer. And some fucking cigars.

295
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,570
And the great fucking thing
is that this is a very,

296
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:02,310
very sexist Superbowl party in
that it's men only. All right?

297
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,340
So they're not going to give a fuck.
Burgers and dogs,

298
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,690
they're in a little bit of chips.

299
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:10,230
They bring the booze and I get the
cigars and then I'm good. I'm out.

300
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm fucking out. All right. Worst thing
I got to do is I gotta wash fucking,

301
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:14,790
you know,

302
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,200
five to 10 plates and the Shit I used
on my flat top grill who gives a fuck.

303
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,590
And then I'm out and I'm when I'm hoping
is in the end that you're in a wiggle

304
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,250
of Patriots have won their sixth

305
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,903
uh,

306
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,470
Super Bowl Championship. So we'll
have six super bowl championships,

307
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,390
zero AFL titles,

308
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,660
zero AFL NFL championships
and no NFL championships.

309
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,933
MMM.

310
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,830
Maybe it's because maybe this is what I,
I,

311
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,580
here's another theory have about why
they don't count NFL championships.

312
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,760
Maybe because the AFL at
first was this upstart league.

313
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:56,350
Everybody laughed at the League

314
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,963
and then

315
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,140
they got better and better and better to
the point the NFL actually had to have

316
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:08,520
a championship game with them to show
that they were the superior league,

317
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,220
which they did for the first two years.

318
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,240
And then the third year they lost
because they played Earl moral instead of

319
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,890
fucking Johnny Unitas.

320
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Some people say so they actually proved
that they were on par or at least good

321
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:29,010
enough to win one out of every
three championship games.

322
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,740
And at that point they were like,
what are we doing here?

323
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,650
Why don't we just merge
and we'll start over again.

324
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,270
But having said all that,
it was still called the NFL.

325
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,820
So maybe that's why they do it.

326
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:46,821
But I think it's unbelievably
disrespectful to Sam Huff,

327
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,370
Bobby Lane, Frank Gifford,
all of these, Jim Brown,

328
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:55,371
all of these amazing hall of
Famers to act as though like,

329
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,343
you know,

330
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,730
to not bring up the championships within
those franchises that they played for

331
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,120
that have wreaked havoc on their
bodies that shorten their lives,

332
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,120
that you don't even bring it up. I just
think it's fucked up bill. We get it.

333
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,060
Jesus Christ.
You've made the point.

334
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,780
How about you read some advertising so
we can laugh at your inability to read

335
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,390
out loud? Fine, fine. I'll do it. You
don't think I'll fucking do it? Oh,

336
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,650
fuck it. I'll give him my wife. So much
shit about fucking Valentine's Day.

337
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm like, I'm not getting you
shit this year is your year.

338
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,890
What are you going to do
for me? Huh? She goes,

339
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,140
what do you want for Valentine's
Day? I go, I want you to shut up.

340
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,030
I know I'm an asshole. She left him. She
knows him a dick. You know what I mean?

341
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,580
She knows what she married.
She knows what she married.

342
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,750
She now she married an
asshole like butcher box.

343
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,780
Butcher butcher box delivers 100%
grass fed and grass finished beef.

344
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,060
Oh, this is great for your
Superbowl party. Free Range.

345
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:03,061
Organic chicken and the the the the
the pinnacle of all murdered animals.

346
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,310
Heritage bread.
Pork.

347
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,180
Yeah.

348
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,150
Isn't bread B. R. E. D. B. R. E. E.

349
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,390
D is breed heritage breed pork.
Is that what it is?

350
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,850
Have I been saying that wrong
the entire fucking time?

351
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,180
Don't you love when you look up how to
pronounce something and then it's like,

352
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,691
it's not,

353
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:27,130
it's like that white robot guy just trying
to figure out how to say the name of

354
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:32,090
this person. And then I got us the APP APP
out there. Uh, all right, pronunciation.

355
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,300
It is breed. I've been, let me try.
Oh, it's a lady. Oh, it's about time.

356
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,800
All these robot ladies had been suffering
for so long. Let's hear that again.

357
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,070
Fried Fried,
fried.

358
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,060
Fried,
fried.

359
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,550
So what is breed?

360
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,900
Okay,

361
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,520
I thought bread was breg. Now that looks
stupid. I'm the worst speller ever. Uh,

362
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,410
the incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

363
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,280
raising animals humanely and
free of antibiotics and hormones.

364
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,920
Before there were assassinated.
You know, if I was actually,

365
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,080
if I was working at a slaughterhouse,
I would like,

366
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,820
I would build like a fucking clock tower
and I'd have like the gun scope with

367
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,220
the hat turned around backwards.
I would just do that.

368
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,290
I'd go Oswald on him.
A cook with the peace,

369
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,560
peace of mind knowing you are eating
healthy and have all the cows running

370
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,140
around. We got a shooter, you know,
running for cover, high quality meat.

371
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,560
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

372
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,940
which is enough for 24 individual
size meals. But if you're a woman,

373
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:47,050
you're not allowed to eat that.
But

374
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,310
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

375
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,130
beef and pork,
mixed box for the liberals.

376
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,400
Custom box for the Conservatives.

377
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,290
Just give me whatever I'm picking
out my own mic. This is America.

378
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,190
You want my meat? Kind of get it. I
said, come and get it mother fucker.

379
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,530
You get to to the fucking neck.
Um,

380
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,520
my favorite butcher block
cut is heritage breed pork.

381
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,640
I think bread sounds better.
Yeah, because I like toast.

382
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,710
Announce, announcing our brand,
our new brand of protein.

383
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,820
Uh, wild. You can't even
believe what I was going to say.

384
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,260
Dead feminist foot. Yes.
Run over at a rally.

385
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:38,650
So announcing our new bread brand,
brand of protein,

386
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:42,610
wild Alaskan Salmon, salmon,
salmon, butcher box sources.

387
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,150
They're pure sustainably
harvested salmon from Bristol Bay,

388
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,490
Alaska. Unlike any salmon
you'll find in your local store.

389
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,503
Literally,

390
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,930
it's red color means that this salmon
is as fresh as nutrient rich as it gets.

391
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay? And rather than you having
to take a trip up there to get it,

392
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,890
some other person is going to catch it
for you and deliver it right to your God

393
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,371
damn door.

394
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,570
The same person who caught it is going
to show up and is all yellow fucking rain

395
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,680
coat with that look in his face, gets the
boat almost capsized during the storm.

396
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,173
You know,

397
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,630
and you won't even be able to look
them in the eye because you're not even

398
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,720
nearly the merit of years.

399
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,510
For $20 off your first box and two
pounds of free salmon, go to butcher

400
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,180
box.com/bird [inaudible],
B u r,

401
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:36,950
r that's butcher box.com/burr
and enter [inaudible] B u.

402
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:41,540
R. R. Oh look who's left? Everybody.
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.

403
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,950
Jollies shave club.

404
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,930
Dollar Shave Club has
everything you need to look,

405
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:51,680
feel and smell your best and you never
have to go to the store again. You know,

406
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:55,580
it's funny, I'm all out of one wipe
Charlies and up to in Paris to order more.

407
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,030
This Guy Shit in his,
uh,

408
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,330
that's because they deliver everything
you need right to you do and they keep

409
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,690
you fully stocked on what
you use so you don't run out.

410
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,010
Here's how it works. By the way, one
wipe Charlie is not accurate. Okay?

411
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,120
You don't just do one wipe.

412
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:15,140
What it is is you used the toilet paper
first and then the one wipe Charlie gets

413
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,450
rid of any evidence that
anything went down. Okay?

414
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,000
It's like the poor man's per day.
Okay? You heard it here first.

415
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,650
You're probably going
to hear it here last.

416
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,150
Just make sure I get some sort of credit.

417
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,880
Dollar Shave Club has everything
you need to get ready.

418
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,700
No matter what you're getting ready for.

419
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,320
They have you covered head to toe
for your hair. Hey, your skin,

420
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,330
your face, you name it, they have it.

421
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,010
And they have this new program where
they automatically keep you stocked up on

422
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,300
the products you use.

423
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,740
You determine what you want and when
you want it and it shows up right.

424
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,630
It should door. Uh, well Jesus Christ,
I hope you get out and exercise.

425

All right and with that,

435
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,150
let's talk super bowl for
the final three and a half

436
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,030
Matte Buddha. Um, I don't know
what the fuck's going to happen.

437
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,010
I have this,
I kind of feel like it's going to be,

438
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,610
I feel he's going to be like a lot of
these NFL games where you've got two high

439
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,170
powered offenses and
they're going to be like,

440
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:01,470
this is going to be a high scoring game
and I think it's going to be low scoring

441
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,010
for the first half and then it's
just going to be a fucking shit show

442
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,170
in the second half and it's
going to be one of those things.

443
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:15,930
Whoever has the ball last wins,
you know,

444
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,280
or it could be like last
Superbowl where the defenses are,

445
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,080
are a complete non factor.
And to the point,

446
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,080
all that has to happen is your,

447
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,780
if whatever defense makes a play,

448
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,940
you just need to make one fucking
play and then, and then boom,

449
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,850
then you win the game.
That's what I think.

450
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,600
That's what I think cause I think last
year Superbowl rather than being one of

451
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,940
the ugliest fucking games
I've ever watched in my life,

452
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,510
I literally felt like I was watching
a third grade pop Warner game with the

453
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:52,380
complete lack of fucking
defense in that game. I, I, uh,

454
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,470
I am now realized that
that was not an anomaly,

455
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,620
that that is now the
way the game is played.

456
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:01,230
And that's the way it has to be played.
Because if you don't,

457
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,890
then these poor people that are playing
the fucking game or are going to,

458
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,070
you know, have this CTE
shit. So I've accepted it.

459
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,580
That's the way it is. And
uh, you know, I dunno,

460
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,700
that's just, I don't know. So, uh,
that, that, that is my feeling. I am,

461
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,990
I'm not believing on any level that
Todd Gurley isn't gonna play in,

462
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,460
is not gonna, you know,
fucking get a bunch of yards.

463
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,840
And I also feel like their quarterback,
whatever his fucking name is, I forget.

464
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,730
Um, he doesn't give a fuck that it's
a super bowl. He's going to come out.

465
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,990
They're cool as a cucumber.

466
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,420
I will say this about all
these new fucking quarterbacks.

467
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:43,230
They don't give a shit that
they're in the Superbowl. You know,

468
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,230
nick falls last year either. He was like,
he was playing catch in the backyard.

469
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,690
The first ball he threw, it was
like, this guy doesn't give a fuck.

470
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,550
This is going to be a long day. Uh,
loved nick false. I'm trying to think.

471
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:58,080
The last time I saw a quarterback
get look nervous, they just come.

472
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:02,820
I am a rookie. I threw 50
touchdowns. Patrick, my home's,
hey you want 50 more? Hey,

473
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,350
who wants to score next?
Fucking thrown it sidearm and shit.

474
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,580
They don't give a fuck.

475
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,990
They're all coming in like Clint Eastwood
in the Spaghetti Westerns, you know,

476
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,240
staring at three guys with your little
fucking cigarette, you know, Cigar Rela,

477
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,800
whatever the fuck he used to smoke.

478
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,000
They just come in and they just fucking,
they just light him up. So I think,

479
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,380
um, yeah. So I have no prediction.
I just hope my team's going to win.

480
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,430
I haven't watched enough football to
even remotely try to break the game down.

481
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:37,080
All I can do is break down
when I'm going to be doing,

482
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,160
which was making burgers and dogs and
not sitting down and pacing the entire

483
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,580
time.
But uh,

484
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,990
I think it's cool that the rams are back
in La and that got the blue and yellow

485
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:49,210
helmets. I liked that shit.
Oh, the blue and white.

486
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:53,320
I guess they went back to the one
they had in the 60s, but, uh, um,

487
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,790
I liked that shit.

488
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,610
And I think the Raiders should stay in
Oakland even though moving to Vegas is

489
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,800
going to be a great thing.
Oh, this can be a great thing.

490
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,330
Can you imagine how many people like
their last thing they're going to do after

491
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,260
they kill their wife in Vegas is to go
to a Raiders game before they're let out

492
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:12,430
in cuffs at halftime. I mean, it's going
to be like, it's gonna happen a lot,

493
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,280
you know, or choke a hooker or
whatever the fuck they going to do.

494
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,410
And that seedy little town,

495
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,860
the fucking nerve or the NFL to throw out
Dave Portnoy for asking that gambling.

496
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,550
I guess it's cause he didn't have a,
uh,

497
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,370
you didn't have a parking pass or whatever
the fuck you need to get into that

498
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:31,150
thing. Um, anyways,

499
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:34,840
but I just think it's so funny how much
they fucking annoyed and irritate the

500
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,990
NFL. They're sitting there acting
like they're a decent organization.

501
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:42,850
All the shit, all the fucking crap
that they've done. Um, I love it.

502
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:47,890
I love her. So God, God blessed
the fellas over at Barstool sports.

503
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,430
Um, all right, so what is it here? It's a,

504
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,300
there's your half hour.
Put the fuck off of me.

505
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,083
Yeah,

506
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,820
I run a sports website, but I'm fucking
cops on me. I'll take over the prison.

507
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,350
I would have been the exact opposite.
Please don't put them on me. I'm sorry.

508
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,440
Um, all right, that is the
podcast. Please enjoy, uh, the,

509
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,630
the music here and then the greatest
hits and all that shit coming up.

510
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:22,010
Another half hour of fucking stuff
here. And then, uh, have a Thursday,

511
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,470

that I did about a Thursday afternoon

512
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,480
podcast. And everybody, I will, I'm
getting ready. Oh, Billy's getting ready.

513
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:35,170
He can't read the word bread or breed.
He's getting ready to do with special. So,

514
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,970
um, um, where are you
doing? You're special.

515
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,980
I should do take my special
at a woman's college.

516
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,950
Uh, I'm doing Santa Barbara, Pasadena,
Riverside tickets on sale now.

517
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,690
Um, on February 15th,
16th, 17th, Santa Barbara,

518
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720

and going old school here. All right.

522
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,830
Go fuck yourselves. Enjoy
the weekend. You can't, uh,

523
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,310
and I'll talk to you after the Superbowl.

524
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,920
I'll either be in a great mood or a
very subdued mood, one or the other,

525
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:18,910
but I'll see you on Monday.

526
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,790
[inaudible] the video.
Got It. Okay, great.

527
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,830
A lot of people sent me this
week. It was about these, uh,

528
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,450
these fucking bank of
cock suck. Is there, um,

529
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,050
let's see, what letter is it
here? This isn't the BBC news. Uh,

530
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,270
HSBC imposes restrictions
on large cash withdrawals.

531
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,810
All right. And, uh, so at HSBC,
customers have been prevented.

532
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:44,740
Some customers I've ever been prevented
from withdrawing large amounts of cash

533
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,540
because they could not provide
evidence of why they wanted it to.

534
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,750
BBC has learnt, isn't it? Learned,

535
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,270
has learnt anyways.

536
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,110
Listeners have told radios for his money
box not to be confused with nature's

537
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:02,650
box.
Uh,

538
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,650
they were stopped from withdrawing
amounts ranging from five grand or 5,000

539
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:09,640
pounds,
10,000 pounds.

540
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,180
HSBC admitted it is not informed
customers of the change in policy policy,

541
00:34:15,851 --> 00:34:17,530
which was implemented in November.

542
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,670
The bank says it is now
changed its guidance to staff.

543
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,690
Um, so basically this
guy went down, they said,

544
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,170
can I have my 5,000 pounds that I earned
and I put in this bank for safety?

545
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:34,250
They said no. He said, can I
have 4,000 pounds? They said no.

546
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,900
And then I wrote one out, I guess one
of the withdrawal slip for 3000 pounds.

547
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:43,760
And they said, okay, we'll give
you that. Um, blah, blah, blah,

548
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,271
blah, blah, blah.

549
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:46,970
So they've got a bunch of bad press
and now allegedly they're changing it.

550
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:50,820
So a bunch of people said, you know,
what's the fucks with these banker cuts?

551
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,760
You know, it's, it's our money,
Yada, Yada, Yada, and all that shit.

552
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,300
I got news for you.
It's not your money.

553
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,740
All right? It's their money.
They print it, it's theirs. Okay.

554
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
And your job is to take the money that
they give you for working your ass off

555
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:10,410
all week,

556
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:15,410
and your job is to then take that money
and give it back to them or get your ass

557
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,000
into debt with it. Think about
your work all fucking week eight.

558
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,670
What do I do? Even hold money
in your fucking hand anymore.

559
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:26,520
They give it to you on this
fucking piece of paper. All right?

560
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,790
I know a lot of people rolling
their eyes right now. Okay?

561
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,710
But I got a point at the end of this shit,
okay?

562
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:33,220
You take it down to these fuckers and

563
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,320
but to them now,
this is the thing,

564
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,690
the reason why it's not like the reason
why they didn't give that person the

565
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:43,200
10,000 pounds. Do you know why
they didn't give it to them?

566
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,120
It's because they don't have it.

567
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,090
I'm not saying that they don't physically
have 10,000 pounds in the back.

568
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,933
Yes they do,

569
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,500
but they don't have 10,000
pounds available to give to it.

570
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,500
Just some random jackass
who goes, oh, by the way,

571
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,290
I want to take 10,000 pounds
out right fucking now.

572
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,330
They don't have it as well. I don't
know about how it works in England,

573
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,280
but as far as in the United States,

574
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,970
they don't have it for the simple fact
that when if you went down and you

575
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,790
deposit some regular fucking Tom,
Dick,

576
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:21,750
Harry or Louise and you
deposit 10 grand into a bank,

577
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,860
back in the old days when there was some
sort of rules and regulations governing

578
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,150
these audit controls.
Cunts, when you ran a bank,

579
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,370
you had on your books,

580
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:40,230
like you could only loan out a
certain percentage of the money

581
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,480
or the bank was in violation. Like, like
say, let's just say to make it easy,

582
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,870
there are $1 million was
deposited into your bank.

583
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,140
You could only at during that
time you could only loan out,

584
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:56,040
I don't know what the percentage was, but
it was like 300 grand of it, 400 grand.

585
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,170
Um, I forget what the percentage
was, but she, you could, you could,

586
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,950
you couldn't go past a certain tipping
point because God forbid if there was a

587
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:08,730
run on money and everybody
started withdrawing,

588
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,190
the bank would fail.
Now any bank,

589
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:16,191
if everybody shows up and tries to take
the money out is gonna fail because you

590
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,310
know, they, they, they loan out a
certain percentage of it all right?

591
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:21,450
But throughout the years,

592
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:26,280
they kept pushing that percentage up
more and more and more and more to the

593
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:31,281
point that they got up to not only can
they loan out 100% of the deposits from

594
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,190
the hard work and the people
that deposit the money in there,

595
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,610
they can actually then create
another $2 million off that million,

596
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,490
something like that. Like,
so if you deposit 10 grand,

597
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,670
they can take your full
10 grand loan it out,

598
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,600
plus another 10 grand off that 10 grand
plus another 10 grand off that 10 grand.

599
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:57,601
So they basically just invented slash
counterfeited 20 grand that didn't even

600
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,480
fucking exist off that 10 grand.

601
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,960
They got 30 grand loaned out so they
can make the money off that fucking 20%

602
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:10,230
interest off of that kicking you half
a percent in your fucking account.

603
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,820
And they just sit there knowing
full well at some point,

604
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:18,900
whatever bubble they're creating is going
to burst. Shit is gonna hit the fan.

605
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,840
You're going to be asked out
and they're too big to fail.

606
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,650
And at worst case scenario that you're
going after a corporation and what are

607
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:28,920
they? They're just, they're just,
they're faceless corporation is faceless.

608
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,430
They take their bonuses is just sitting
there waiting for John Cougar Mellencamp

609
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:33,681
to right.

610
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:38,470
You have fucking song at fucking jackass
aid and they're out there buying a new

611
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,190
fucking yacht. All right?
Did that make sense?

612
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,930
And I know you guys are going to be okay.
Will you full of Shit, blah, blah, blah,

613
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:50,740
blah. You don't know what
the fuck you talking about.
You sound like a moron. Hey,

614
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,910
I'll take all of that.

615
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:55,270
But I'm going to tell you this for like
the fucking hundred time in my standup

616
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:57,100
career when I was in Albuquerque,

617
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,660
I had a banker come up to
me and was laughing going,

618
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:05,320
I know you hate us. And I said,
listen, am I am more on the podcast?

619
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:08,380
And they always say no.
They go, no, you're not.

620
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,410
You know this of some factual
errors a little bit here or there,

621
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:14,050
but basically what you're
saying is 100% true.

622
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,420
I talked conspiracy theory one time
in my own bank as I was trying to set

623
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,520
something up new one my account,

624
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,440
I was talking to a banker about
conspiracy theory and he was talking about

625
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,080
banking. It was talking about
how scary and fucked up it was.

626
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,330
And he was asking me what I plan to do.

627
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,880
What do you think about
gold and silver coins?

628
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,900
What do you think about growing Zucchini?
And I was the most taken,

629
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,110
he's whispering and shit.
I'm telling you. Um,

630
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,460
and I have no solution.

631
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:48,040
So when I'm really being right now is
a fucking fear monger. But uh, this is,

632
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,920
this is the great thing about
banking is that, you know,

633
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,950
I would say a good 95% of people walking
around with a fucking Goddamn tootsie

634
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,690
pop in their mouth, pulling their fucking
Hawaiian shorts out of their ass, crack,

635
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,060
believe in it. All right? And as long
as they continue to believe in it,

636
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,640
you can kind of exist in the
game drafting behind there.

637
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,650
Um, uninformed. I don't know
what the fucking word is. I'm so,

638
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,090
I'm too stupid to do this, but you
just basically like, I don't know.

639
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,550
I am of the belief that if you can get
a fucking house by one that you can

640
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,400
afford and then pay that
fucker down as soon as you can.

641
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,010
And all of that shit that
people say where they go, oh,

642
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,960
it's not investment because
you go to the dude, fuck that.

643
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,240
Pay Off your fucking house. And then if
the bank fails, you still have a house.

644
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,560
Who gives a fuck if you
paid 700 grand for it,

645
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:51,250
now it's only worth a hundred grand.
You still have a house.

646
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,110
As much as that sucks,

647
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,090
at least just still have it like
the fucking stock market, right?

648
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,120
You work your whole God damn life.
You stick it in that,

649
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,580
stick it in this over there when
you think you're being conservative,

650
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,930
the thing shits the bed and in the
end you can be left with nothing.

651
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,740
So I am into tangent,
tangible shit. Can you tell?

652
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:17,741
I screamed whenever I do a podcast the
day after I went to a game or I did a lot

653
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:22,930
of shows. I sound like I'm going through
puberty again. I apologize. But, um,

654
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,290
I believe in investing in tangible shit.

655
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,830
And don't let your wife or your husband
below goal. We go, kid, we'd go,

656
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,590
we'd go to shave up with a
college education. You know what?

657
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,670
Fuck their college education.
All right. Take out a loan.

658
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,750
Take out a fucking look.
You're paying interest on your house.

659
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,980
Now the amount of money that you're going
to save knocking down your principal

660
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,330
will pay for most if not all
of their college education.

661
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,920
All right? Unless they just go to some
unbelievably expensive school. And your,

662
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,970
I dunno, living in some
little house on the prairie,

663
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,440
Michael Landon smoking a pipe.
Um,

664
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,060
so there you go. So that's why,
that's why when they go down there,

665
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,430
because they,

666
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,350
they're not going to give 10 grand or
10 pounds to the average jackass walking

667
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,860
in there because that starts
fucking with their game,

668
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,430
which is pretending that all the
money is there and that it's,

669
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,870
it's safe and that there's nothing to
worry about and nothing to see here.

670
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,870
So what they do is they pull this shit
and they bully people individually over

671
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,780
in the corner of behind that
bulletproof glass. And they're like, no,

672
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:39,620
you have to get a note and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And most people

673
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,660
like they have a parent child
relationship their entire life.

674
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,430
They come out as a child,
their parents tell them what to do,

675
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,620
what they can and can't do,
when they can eat,

676
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,730
when they have to go to bed and they
go off into the world. You know,

677
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:02,090
you go to school or going to lunch,
now you have a question,

678
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:05,480
raise your hand and you
stay in that mentality.

679
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,600
So to the point you have a fucking adult
who earned the money will go into a

680
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:15,050
bank. You know, God bless this person
who actually fucking was like, no,

681
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,750
this is my money and complained
and brought this out to light.

682
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,260
I think this is the only
person they did that to.

683
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,940
The money's not there man.
Yeah.

684
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:28,010
Like if you had like two
300 grand in an account,

685
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,130
you decide that you just
want to fucking take it out.

686
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,560
Like if you physically want the money,

687
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,340
if you want to transfer it like
fucking numbers, hit enter,

688
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:38,620
they'll fucking do that all day.
I had no worries.

689
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,990
But you actually wanted the paper,

690
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,000
like you can't just walk in there and
be like, yes, I'd like my 300 grand.

691
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,990
And they'd be like, okay, I
come out big sex and money.

692
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,110
You got to call them days
if not a week in advance.

693
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,580
And then what they gotta do is
frantically call around in front,

694
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:02,581
find an armored car with enough of this
paper that isn't worth shit other than

695
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:07,510
the fact that the guy with the underwear
and his ass still believes in it.

696
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,910
They got to drive that there so they can
physically keep the lie going. Alright,

697
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,090
there you go.
So that's the end of Mike.

698
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:21,520
My fucking a barroom banking one oh one.
All right.

699
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,660
And uh,
you know,

700
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:27,220
I don't give a fuck about your opinions
either because I'm not enlightened as a

701
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:29,890
human being. If you don't agree
with what I said, then you know,

702
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,070
just laugh at me and continue on with

703
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,070
your fucking day because you're actually
helping me out as long as you keep

704
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:38,250
fucking believe in it.

705
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,790
But I think the day the wave hitting
the beaches is coming soon because,

706
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,830
uh, you know, at least in this country,

707
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,410
I mean the government shut down for
three fucking days and I know it made for

708
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,500
great standup material,
but that is absolutely fucking terrifying.

709
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,780
Every year when August comes around and
we hit the debt ceiling and we just keep

710
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,950
raising it and we just keep
pushing more of shit under the bed,

711
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,090
like eventually, it's not all, I dunno,
that's probably the wrong analogy.

712
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:10,230
I don't know what the fuck we're doing,

713
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,980
but eventually the shit is
going to hit the fan. So, uh,

714
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,270
I'm not saying I'm going to survive it,
whatever the fuck happens,

715
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:19,530
but I do have a game plan.

716
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,430
My game plan is to pay off
my house as quickly as I can.

717
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,470
So when the first wave of people
are being brought to the, uh,

718
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,010
I don't know what euphemism they're
going to be using for detention camps.

719
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,840
Um, I figured it'll be like, well,
you can't pay off your house.

720
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,590
We're repossessing the house. So now
we're gonna move you to alternative,

721
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,440
relaxing, living, whatever the
fuck they're going to call it.

722
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,050
At least I won't be in
that first wave of people.

723
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,200
I will have my house paid off and I
will stand there dressed like a court

724
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,680
gesture with my little fancy came going,

725
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:58,090
but get off my property and
they'll look at me and be like, oh,

726
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,750
look at those little cunt thick
and he has power. All right,

727
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:03,060
we'll be back for you.
We'll get back for like a month assault.

728
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,750
Let's just get the, uh, let's
get the mouth breathers first.

729
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,490
Let's get the easy people then will weed
out the red cunts and then it'll all be

730
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:12,324
ours.

731
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:18,370
Some of that somehow ties
in to how they're trying to
make robots more and more

732
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:22,980
human. Like, all right,
this is the character shit.

733
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,200
This story right here,

734
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,860
that seems like a victory for the
common man and what it really is,

735
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:35,670
is this just moving the ball forward on
the development of robots so they could

736
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:38,520
eventually phase us out.
Um,

737
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,580
and then they could just have robot
people that will never, never complain.

738
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,850
And then of course,
if you watch science fiction movies,

739
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:48,060
they somehow take over the humans,
which they're not going to do.

740
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,620
They're not going to do that.
All right, we made you all right,

741
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,800
we'll unplug you. We won't fix.
You have dump some water on you.

742
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,870
You know, this is the deal.
Every fucking web designer,

743
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,360
when he builds your
website or rebuild you,

744
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:10,410
a secure site always builds in
a fucking back door. All right?

745
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,530
So the guys making the robots are
going to do the same fucking thing.

746
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,490
There's no way the Illuminati is going
to have a bunch of robots that are

747
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:20,790
stronger than them. Don't need to
sleep and all that type of shit.

748
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:24,270
And like they watch science fiction
movies. These fuckers are science fiction.

749
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,100
How crazy do I sound this week?

750
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:29,100
I'm actually enjoying every
fucking second of this. Um,

751
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,960
they're going to have a back door,
you know,

752
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,400
somewhere up that robots asked this gotta
be something that they can fucking do.

753
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,440
Some button they have to push.
Um, all right, so there you go.

754
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,160
Was that weird enough
for you? Huh? I'm sorry.

755
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,110
What do,
what do you want from me?

756
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,400
You know,
a fucking weird guy.

757
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,093
[inaudible]

758
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,580
Hey,
what's going on?

759
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,820
It's built bar and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

760
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,770
January 31st, 2011. How are you?

761
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,150
How are you doing? Really? Oh,
that's good to hear. You know,

762
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:47,720
I was worried about you that
you know something. You see,

763
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:49,580
it just goes to show you,
doesn't it?

764
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,240
It just goes to show you that if you sit
around and you think positive thoughts,

765
00:48:55,731 --> 00:49:00,230
you'll have a happy Monday.
Are you having a happy Monday?

766
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:03,440
Happy Monday to you.

767
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,590
Um, I'm not having a happy
Monday. I fucking, uh,

768
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,940
flew back from Dallas,
Texas,

769
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:14,240
which is why the podcast is a little
bit late among other fucking tech

770
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,590
knowledgey goddamn reasons cause I bought
a new fucking microphone and I brought

771
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,680
it out to Texas with me and uh,

772
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:26,150
it just picked up the entire room and
I did a whole fucking podcast and I was

773
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:28,730
going to upload it like
a good boy midnight.

774
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,110
So even my friends over there and jolly
old England way back over there and

775
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:36,740
Sweden and even those couple of
constant listening in Mongolia,

776
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,600
what have something on a Monday morning,
wherever the fuck they're at.

777
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,191
And what happened?

778
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:43,640
I went back and I listened to it and
it sounded like ash and I was like,

779
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,660
I'm not subjecting my listeners to this.
How do you like that? You're like that.

780
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:49,250
Isn't that a great excuse for being late?

781
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,110
I'm late because I was thinking about you.
I was thinking about your needs.

782
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:00,050
I think I cared too much.
Um, oh God. I feel like shit.

783
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,980
I forgot to bring my vitamins with
me. Right. I'm such a fucking old man.

784
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,200
Did that mother fucker just
hit the floor down there. Nice.

785
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:12,640
I think now I'm just hearing
things. Fuck that old guy. Um,

786
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,190
and his balls. Um, yeah, I know.

787
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,320
I forgot to bring my vitamin.
Speaking of old,

788
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,100
I have to bring vitamins with me
when I'm on the road now, you know,

789
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,430
I can't fucking do it anymore. After
years of breathing in that airline food.

790
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,250
Listen, listen to voice right now, right?

791
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,730
A lot of the ladies probably thinks
it's sounds a little bit sexy. It is.

792
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,290
This is what I sound like when I'm
beginning to get sick and I forgot all my

793
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,260
shit. You know, all my
pills on know your man.

794
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,220
All my pills that if fucking take when
I'm on the road, so I don't get sick.

795
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,390
You know, you fly out. I'm
always flying back fucking east,

796
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,230
you know, so then I gotta
get up at six in the morning,

797
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,810
which is really like four in the
morning for me than I do radio.

798
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,330
Then I tried to come back and go to sleep,
but the fucking sun's out.

799
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,110
It can't do it.

800
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,130
Then I do my shows and then I'm fucking
shaking everybody's hands afterwards and

801
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:05,270
then I fuckin, you know, rub my face,
you know? And next thing you know,

802
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:09,320
I got road aids, you
know, but it's curable.

803
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,820
It's curable by fucking three shitty days
sitting in your own fucking apartment.

804
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,810
It's my big announcement for the
weak people. I have wrote AIDS,

805
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,770
the first known case of a 2011. It's
early this year. And uh, you know,

806
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:31,010
it was my fault. I didn't
protect myself. So, uh, yeah,

807
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:33,170
I'm a little under the
weather this week, so, uh,

808
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,930
but I'm going to fucking bring
it like Jerry Lewis, you know,

809
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,770
who never sat down in his Tuxedo pants.
So I'm laying down right now,

810
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,190
so I'm going to try to bring the fucking
funny, let me tell you about my weekend,

811
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,170
right people. I went out
to Dallas tacy, Dallas,

812
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,930
Texas.
I went out that way and um,

813
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,530
I performed at the new
Improv in Arlington, Texas,

814
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,090
despite the fact that kept saying,

815
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,890
I was in Addison on last week's
podcast podcasts. I was in Arlington.

816
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:04,520
Did any of you guys accidentally go to
Addison? You have been disappointed,

817
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,760
you would've saw earthquake of
fucking good friend of mine.

818
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,760
Someone I highly recommend you go see
live fucking you want to hear one of

819
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,050
fucking great off the top of his head.

820
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,700
Out The top of your fucking headline
that I saw him do one time. Uh,

821
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,190
what a fuck worthy. We were some
fucking room in the Bronx or some shit.

822
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:25,911
I can't remember.

823
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:29,510
It was one of those fucking clubs
were like two days after we did it.

824
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:32,030
It got shut down because
somebody shot off a pistol in.

825
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:35,060
There was one of those fucking things,
you know back when I was like,

826
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:38,360
I'm going to do this. Psycho
is rooms ever, you know,

827
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,230
and then I won't be nervous when I'm
doing Letterman. Well you know what?

828
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:46,040
It doesn't work that way.
You just get used to doing shitty rooms.

829
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,790
But then when you go to do Letterman
you like, oh wait this, this is,

830
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,900
this is a different kind of pressure.
That kind of pressure is,

831
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,110
well no one's paying attention. How the
fuck can I get these people to listen?

832
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,230
But then it's kind of easy because
it's like, well then that's, you know,

833
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,490
it's supposed to suck. So if you do,
okay, then, then people are like, wow,

834
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:07,970
that was amazing. But if you do
Letterman, you supposed to do well,

835
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:10,580
everybody's paying attention.
They got the air conditioner on,

836
00:53:10,581 --> 00:53:14,810
everybody's facing
forward, right, whatever.

837
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,130
So I'm in this fucking room trying to
figure out what the fuck I'm going to say

838
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,623
to try to get,

839
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,170
try to get the crowd going before they
realize how disgustingly white I am,

840
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:27,930
which they're going to see before
you'd get to the fucking mic stand. Um,

841
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,980
what's his face? Earthquake was on
stage when it was this in Atlanta.

842
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,650
I can't fucking remember anymore.
I'm still whatever.

843
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,300
I was doing some fucking rock.
Right?

844
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,260
And he was up there [inaudible] and he
looked over in the crowd and there was a

845
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:47,370
woman sitting in there, there's large
woman who was not good looking. Okay.

846
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:51,390
I'm not trying to be mean,
but her face was a mess.

847
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,850
Okay. I'm talking like a
rottweiler with a dress.

848
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,000
And she had one of those big,
you know,

849
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:03,780
those African hats kind of looks like
the pope hat, but it's more look,

850
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,100
sort of like a vase and it just
goes straight up. You know,

851
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,190
didn't one of those early rappers
with the giant chunky gold chains,

852
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:14,550
didn't she wear one of those?
UN I t y that's see unity.

853
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,540
Did she wear one of those?
So anyways,

854
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,860
the girl is sitting in the crowd and
he's in the middle of killing and the

855
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:26,130
second east, Cesar, you said in
the middle of telling a joke,

856
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:29,610
he just says he called
her Erica Bod don't.

857
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:35,383
Yeah,

858
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:39,240
it was one of the funniest
and meanest fucking things.

859
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,780
I S it was fucking brilliant.
It was right off the top of his head.

860
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:47,400
But it was so fucking mean because
she didn't say anything. Uh, you know,

861
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:48,540
she really didn't deserve it,

862
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:52,680
but it was just what I liked about it
was he didn't point out or he just looked

863
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:56,250
at her and just to himself when
Erica Bud don't,

864
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,050
and you know the people in that section
new and they just fucking dealt with.

865
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:05,490
That was what I liked about him
was he, he just said it. He said,

866
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,010
I don't give a fuck that only
people sitting cause you know,

867
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:12,060
the rest of the crowd could see her,
whatever. So whatever I fucked up.

868
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,990
If you want to wow. The Addison Improv,
you saw earthquake. So there you go.

869
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,980
There you go. Um, but anyways,
I was out in Arlington,

870
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:23,370
Texas this week to go out
there to the, uh, the Texas,

871
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:26,640
Oklahoma area with those girls,
with the huge faces in the big heads.

872
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,700
And um,
I saw a lot of them.

873
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,140
So I let her big headed Texas girls and
saw a lot of cutie pies to one way or

874
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:36,540
the other out there.
They're either fucking drop dead,

875
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:40,830
gorgeous height doing hi you out.
You want some grits? Gorgeous.

876
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,550
Or they just have these
fucking mount Rushmore heads,

877
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,170
hair teased up cause it's Dallas.
Everything's big in Dallas. Um,

878
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,750
just giant Fred Flintstone fucking heads.

879
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,000
That doesn't stop them
from teasing up their hair.

880
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,960
They look like those Texas girls with
the big heads when they're done with the

881
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,900
eye shadow teasing up their hair,
they look like fucking Nikki Sixx.

882
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,340
Do

883
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,520
you realize the fucking balls I
have to attack how anybody looks?

884
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:10,300
Do you understand that?
A balding fucking redhead?

885
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:14,450
Do you want to stay in the level
of fucking balls that that takes?

886
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,320
Um, all right. So anyways,

887
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:22,690
the first night I fly in and uh,
you know the,

888
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:26,080
the club out there, he's a little fella,
you know, stands about four foot 11.

889
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:30,490
He's adorable, you know, likes to dress
a little fucking shiny shirts, you know,

890
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,470
just, just the little fella, you know,

891
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:37,370
scoots his seat right up to the
steering wheel, you know, sketches,

892
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,580
see, although is, is,

893
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:43,630
is far up as you could possibly Skoda
seat and his arms are still straight when

894
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,430
he's holding on to the
fucking steering wheel.

895
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:52,750
I'm just being a Dick and
Casey's listening. Um, so
anyways, he picks me up, right?

896
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,950
And we went right to the fucking
Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets Game.

897
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,910
Sat right behind the fucking,
this how great. My weekend was,

898
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:05,050
sat right behind the
Houston Rockets bench.

899
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,161
Okay,

900
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:08,800
well actually this is a bench and then
there's the fucking guys who hand them

901
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:09,640
the water bottles.

902
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:13,390
Then there was a fucking court
little alley and then there was us.

903
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,510
It was fucking ridiculous.
All right.

904
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:20,260
And I'm sitting there getting to see all
this shit you don't get to see when you

905
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:22,210
watch a game on TV,
like a,

906
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,830
towards the end of the fucking
game I saw, uh, you know,

907
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:29,290
I was one of those deals where
they needed to scores, you know,

908
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:32,920
don't shoot a three, just get a quick
two and then try and file, do that shit.

909
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,080
So the fucking point guard goes, you know
what? I don't see any other teammates.

910
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,090
I guess it's all up to me.

911
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,480
For some reason he decided to
do this and one bullshit, right?

912
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,140
Fucking one of the most spectacular
missed layups you've ever seen in your

913
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:47,974
fucking life.

914
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,000
If he did a percentage of the odds
of the fucking thing going and it was

915
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,540
probably even with a good NBA player,
like a 40% shot.

916
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:59,590
That's what the fuck he took when they
needed, they needed a big score. Right.

917
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:03,550
Didn't even look, just brought it up.
The court did it all himself. All right.

918
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,300
And fucking missed it. And I immediately
see, you know, cause I'm sitting there,

919
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:10,930
I saw the coaching staff's reaction.
They just Ah, you know what?

920
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:16,070
Remember one fucking Slater dropped that
ball and Superbowl fucking 13 and Roger

921
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,740
Star back went ah, just
fucking, that's what they did.
All three of them in unison,

922
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,250
like backup dancers did
the exact same thing. Ah,

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,330
just looked over their left fucking
shoulder and then they all went over and

924
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:32,380
they sat down on the bench like,
well this fucking games over. Okay.

925
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,280
So the rockets quickly foul.
Someone on the Mavericks,

926
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,830
they go up to the line.

927
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,740
I think the fucking point guard did it
cause he's standing up there by half

928
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:45,340
court and I see him calling over the
coaches. He's going, hey coach, he goes,

929
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:45,941
should I file?

930
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:49,660
You want me to file and the coach won't
even look at him and then I see the

931
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:53,230
player and the coat on the floor
just rolls his eyes like Ash Shit,

932
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,100
I'm going to fucking hear about this
one. Right? That's how close I was.

933
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm sitting there, I'm absolutely giddy
to the left of me to the right of me.

934
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:05,800
I'm sorry, where? Three ladies, right?

935
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,850
They weren't even hot.
They will like sorta hot.

936
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:13,570
You know they did all this
shit that hot girls do.

937
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,490
They had fancy clothes they had on the
eye liner. They teased up their hair,

938
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:20,620
but they take just work.
You know?

939
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,040
You know when you watch American idol
and someone can almost sing kind of like

940
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:29,930
the way I sing picture of the
way. I'm almost there. Listen,

941
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:34,690
row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream here.

942
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,240
I just said stray right. That's
the kind of good looking. They are.

943
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,990
You are right. Was it wasn't
that bad right up to stray.
That's what happens. Yeah.

944
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,970
That asses in bed, those
titties, not that bad either.

945
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:50,840
And then you look at their face
straight, you're like, fuck really?

946
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,910
How to fuck are you sitting this close?
So not only were they sitting there,

947
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,530
they weren't fucking paying attention.

948
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,350
This is why I am fucking,
I don't know if the word is racist.

949
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,340
I don't know if it's not racist.
Good looking women is, it's not,

950
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,300
it's not a racial thing.

951
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,810
I don't know if I'm sexist now
cause it's not a woman thick.

952
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,200
It's a specific kind of fucking,
I just,

953
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,500
I fucking beautiful women.

954
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,310
I don't know. You know, you know
when you go to the golf course,

955
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:27,170
you know what guys tee off in my fucking
mental world versus where the women tee

956
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:29,980
off in my world, mentally
beautiful women, they,

957
01:00:29,981 --> 01:00:31,640
they got to tee off way back there.

958
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:36,980
They got to go that extra fucking 30
goddamn yards because I just immediately

959
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:41,360
assume that you're going to be exactly
like these fucking cops who sit next to

960
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:45,320
me. They sat there and they had their
fucking stupid noisemakers. Right.

961
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,750
Which is always a sign of a bad franchise.
By the way.

962
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,830
I've said this for fucking years
and for some reason some of you are,

963
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,450
you're not hearing me okay.

964
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:58,780
If your fans sucks so bad that they have
to give them noisemakers so they can

965
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,840
sound like a fucking enthusiastic crowd.
Okay.

966
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,410
Noisemakers like it's fucking New
Year's eve or some shit. Right?

967
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,173
So this sitting there,

968
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,450
I took a picture of it and it's going
to be up on the MM podcast. By the way,

969
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,310
the girl next to me is holding her two
little thunder sticks in her left hand

970
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,210
hand.

971
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:21,650
Sorry my voice is fucked up and her
left hand and then she's texting on her

972
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:25,910
blackberry with their thumb and the
blackberry is wrapped in this little hot

973
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:28,310
pink fucking would just
annoyed the shit out of me.

974
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:32,540
And at one point somebody throws an
alleyoop for this monster fucking dunk.

975
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,990
The crowd goes crazy.
She misses the whole fucking thing.

976
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,930
She sets down her blackberry
and then starts clapping.

977
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:43,931
The thunder sticks together just cause
he hears the crowd and she just goes Yay.

978
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:50,240
And then put it went right back to
what the fuck she was doing. Yeah,

979
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,210
it shouldn't, it annoyed me,
but it did. It annoyed me.

980
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,750
And then at one point her to two other
whore friends kept yelling over at

981
01:01:56,751 --> 01:02:01,310
somebody who work from the Mavericks.
They were going match, match,

982
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,820
match.
You know they do that in Dallas.

983
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,730
They'll take a one syllable word and
they make, they can make it to like,

984
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:10,780
I'm going to bag it,
they go me yet.

985
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:17,410
And I look over and Mitch turns out
to be one of these jackasses who comes

986
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:21,390
running out like sort of skipping and
running at the same time with one of those

987
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:25,410
guns and he shoots fucking tee
shirts up into the upper deck.

988
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,450
You know,
you know those fucking guys,

989
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,300
you ever want to just punch someone in
the face more when you see them with

990
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:33,540
their eyebrows up and they're pointing
up at the upper deck like, Huh,

991
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,490
you want a free tee shirt? Do yet
they do that stupid little skip step,

992
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,660
you know, across the court.
And then they stop, you know,

993
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,500
feet parallel to each other and then they
just stick one hand up in the air and

994
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:50,470
they, the girls do this and
then they started jumping
in a circle waving. It just,

995
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,070
it's, you know, first of all,

996
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:56,280
it's embarrassing to watch people freak
out that much about a fucking free tee

997
01:02:56,281 --> 01:03:00,690
shirt. You know, it's like, what
does it fucking 10 bucks. Go buy one

998
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,480
people up there hanging up.

999
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,360
I'm telling you someone's going to
fall out of that fucking upper deck and

1000
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:08,490
they're going to,
it's going to be the dumbest death ever.

1001
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,400
And I'm going to laugh and I'm going
to watch it on youtube and I'm going to

1002
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:15,750
have no sympathy for the person cause
you're F it's a tee shirt. So anyways,

1003
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,530
he turns out he's one of these guys
and he wasn't really a good looking guy

1004
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:22,380
either, but he works for the Mavericks.
So he has three Sorta hotties. You know,

1005
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,920
unfortunately with guys, it's
not how you look. It's, it's,

1006
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,700
it's the position you're in in life.

1007
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,940
He just doesn't realize it that he could
have got three better looking women.

1008
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,193
But you know,

1009
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,340
he's too busy looking at is a
imperfections when he brushes his teeth.

1010
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:40,160
That's what I think. Did that story go
off the rails? I think it did match.

1011
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:45,960
Um, then I did my
fucking shows at the, uh,

1012
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,610
at the Improv. I had great shows. And then
Sunday I'm sitting around doing not eh,

1013
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,111
and a,

1014
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:56,550
the Oklahoma City thunder had a
game against the fucking Miami Heat.

1015
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,630
Okay. And I'm like, well,
I live in Los Angeles.

1016
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:05,190
If I wanted to sit down close to see
the Miami Heat at a fucking Lakers game,

1017
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:05,730
I mean,

1018
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:10,500
I'm going to have to fucking shell
out two grand and blow Hugh Hefner.

1019
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:14,340
So fuck it.
I'm going to go up there.

1020
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:18,390
You know what face value for the tickets
were face value of sitting behind the

1021
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:23,220
goal where Chris Bosch should fucking,
uh, Duran got in each other's faces.

1022
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,000
I was sitting behind that goal about
fucking, I don't know, 15 rose up.

1023
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,450
They yelled really loudly. I could
hear what the fuck they was saying.

1024
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,200
You know what face value on
those tickets was 55 bucks

1025
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:41,610
underrated going to a sporting
event in fucking Oklahoma.

1026
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,590
All right? Don't sleep on those in
the middle of nowhere. Fucking cities.

1027
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,410
It's great.
The cost of living is so much lower.

1028
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:54,180
Ticket prices are fucking lower and you
can sit down low like you're fucking Ben

1029
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,860
Stiller. Assump shit. Well,

1030
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,610
20 rows behind where he would be sitting
and I'm also on the side and I couldn't

1031
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:03,330
see part of it because the fucking goal
was in the way. But other than that,

1032
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:05,880
it was great.
And I've got to tell you,

1033
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:08,480
underrated also is the
fucking Oklahoma Thunder.

1034
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,160
A fucking fans man.

1035
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:15,270
They had great fans and they
had a phenomenal fucking
stadium. It was bare bones,

1036
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:18,370
it was like reverse staples center.
So,

1037
01:05:18,371 --> 01:05:21,790
and the tickets were
cheap and people you know,

1038
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:25,330
could afford to go and they had a big
upper deck and they only had one row of

1039
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:27,890
luxury boxes.
So it was loud as hell.

1040
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,690
It was way louder than the
fucking staple center. Um,

1041
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,880
you know, and I actually liked it
better than the fucking Goddamn Bank,

1042
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:39,790
North Fleet Garden, whatever the
fuck they call that back in Boston,

1043
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:44,920
that awful arena,
those two fucking legendary franchises,

1044
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:48,340
the Bruins and the Celtics. And that's
the fucking arena that you build up.

1045
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,290
You go down to Home Depot and you buy
16,000 cinderblocks and you just make a

1046
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:57,250
big fucking square. That's what,
that's what we get. You know,

1047
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,870
we had this unbelievable
home ice home court advantage
back in the day. And, uh, I,

1048
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,010
I feel like I'm in a food court with them
and that fucking place, so, so anyways,

1049
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:06,161
yeah,

1050
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:09,310
I was sitting right there when they
were talking shit and have identically a

1051
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,620
Kevin Durant went off on him afterwards,

1052
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:16,150
said he was one of those fake tough guys
and it was all the big fucking gossip

1053
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:19,930
around the NBA and I was there.
It was fucking site. And uh,

1054
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,590
I know you guys think I'm
fucking nuts for doing that shit.

1055
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,780
What else was I going to do? Sit
In my hotel room, tell the feature,

1056
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:31,480
act to pick me up and go take me
to get some fucking barbecue. I,

1057
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:36,220
I can't do it anymore, you know, went up
there. You know what's great about that,

1058
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:39,520
that drive from Dallas to,
uh,

1059
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:44,650
to Oklahoma City is it's in between the
two cities when you're in the middle of

1060
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:48,520
fucking nowhere, right? And he'd
go, you go over the Red River,

1061
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,060
which I didn't even know I was going to
go to the red river rivalry game last

1062
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,420
year. Right. I don't even know
what the fucking red river was.

1063
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,320
I didn't know what it was.
What?

1064
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,870
Cause they kick the shit out of each
other and there's a river of blood

1065
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:00,920
afterwards.
I had no fucking idea of identity.

1066
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,980
That stat river that runs along the south
of the state that gives its, its, its,

1067
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,060
its shaped,
right.

1068
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:12,400
So fucking go over that river and then
that's when all the signs about Jay's A's

1069
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,420
, they all start coming out. I
took one creepy fucking photo.

1070
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:21,810
This was outside of a gas station
with a fuck is my phone like that?

1071
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,120
That's the type of shit, you know,
you're driving down the street. Right.

1072
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,700
And you know,
I saw one point,

1073
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,840
there were like four crosses on the side
of the road for where like I guess for

1074
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:34,240
people died in a goddamn accident.
I Dunno,

1075
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:39,310
they fucking side swiped an ox or some
shit. I mean it was like in the middle.

1076
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,090
It's like the middle of
fucking nowhere. And, uh,

1077
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,900
when the hell was that at a time he did
that podcast and I was telling you that,

1078
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:51,580
that guy, oh, I know. When you drive from
fucking Cincinnati down to Nashville,

1079
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:54,400
somewhere in Kentucky.
Can somebody send me a picture of this?

1080
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,670
Somebody has the 10 commandments
written out in signage on the,

1081
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,560
the outskirts of his, of his, of his
farm. It's really fucking frightening.

1082
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,990
Let me see if I can find this. Here I am
scrolling. You know, you get out there.

1083
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,990
Yeah, it's all shit about Jesus. Or it's,
or it's a, it's a farm or it's a casino.

1084
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,853
Here it is.

1085
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,750
Here it is. We pulled over for
gas. What does this sign say?

1086
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,410
His blood paid all,

1087
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,560
you know, it's like, can
I enjoy my fucking day?

1088
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:35,600
Can I just drive up and
go see a basketball game
without you bringing up the

1089
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:40,601
fact that somebody got tortured to death
so I can somehow make it to fucking

1090
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,920
Lala land,
which I'm not going to,

1091
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,080
I'm not gonna make it right.
You've heard the podcast,

1092
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,950
you think God doesn't have iTunes. I'm
fucked. There's no way I'm making it.

1093
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,030
I don't even buy into that shit. You
know somebody last week, you know,

1094
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,230
cause I went off on a fucking
Jay star there last week, right?

1095
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,090
Fucking bosses son.

1096
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,410
Oh fucking twinkle toes himself or
the originator of the Bergen stock.

1097
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:10,490
Fucking look that guy,
you know

1098
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:15,590
who later went on to play bass in
Nirvana, right? Isn't that what Jesus did?

1099
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,410
That's the re is he already came
back. You guys missed it. Um,

1100
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,060
what was the fuck was I talking about?
Oh,

1101
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:26,480
I was on such a great little fucking
tangent there and I'd bring up Nirvana.

1102
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:28,760
What the fuck did I do
that for? All right, Phil,

1103
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,520
you ever do this shit when you can't
remember you talking about that?

1104
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:35,240
You got to back it up in your head. All
right. His blood for you. Oh, I know.

1105
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,980
Yeah. Um, yeah. I,

1106
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,780
somebody last week sent
me this fucking email.

1107
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,030
Let me see if I can find this shit.

1108
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:48,740
It was hilarious because he had in
the subject, in all capital letters,

1109
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,620
it just said, answer me. Right.

1110
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,360
And I didn't know if it was
somebody fucking around or what,

1111
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,600
but it was some dude who was annoyed
by me taking the Lord's name in vain.

1112
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,710
Um, there it is. Answer me, Bill.
Here we go. It's from a guy.

1113
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:07,790
I know I don't say names,

1114
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:11,870
but what are the odds that some Jesus
freak would have a first name? Travis.

1115
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,040
Um, I wish you would stop using Jesus
Christ's name in vain now. Old g.

1116
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,420
Uh,
what do you have against religion anyway,

1117
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,260
I think you are confused
about the whole thing.

1118
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,410
Attend a good Bible believing church.

1119
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,740
Talk to the pastor and
actually listened to them.

1120
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,790
I like how he assumes that I talked
to a pastor. I didn't listen. You see?

1121
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:37,040
Did you catch that little passive
aggressive talks in the past?

1122
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,570
And once you fucking listen this time,

1123
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,880
I would really appreciate it if you would
be open about Jesus and Christianity.

1124
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:48,560
It will change your life. Exclamation
point, guarantee, explanation,

1125
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:53,060
point yet spelled wrong.
He spelled guarantee g,

1126
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:57,680
U. R, a, n. T, and he's just name's
Travis. Garn take of tailing each.

1127
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:02,060
Get in the Jaycees. It's going to change
your life. What do you have against? Well,

1128
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:02,280
let me,

1129
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,990
let me read back this and let me give it
the most stereotypical horrific fucking

1130
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:09,020
accident I can. I wish he'd
stop using Jesus' name in vain.

1131
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,740
What do you have against religion anyway?
I find oppressive.

1132
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,370
That's what I like about it.
I don't like how they use fear.

1133
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:19,080
How they try to scare the shit out of me.

1134
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,830
Says the day I'm fucking born and don't
even fucking sit there and act like they

1135
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,220
don't. They do. It's fucking annoying.

1136
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,190
They don't know what
happens to you when you die.

1137
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,270
So stop scaring the shit out
of me. I think you go right
into the fucking ground.

1138
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,380
That's what you do and you have fucking,
you make the soil richer. Right?

1139
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:40,560
And then next thing you know, there's a
mosquito flying out of it. Thanks to you.

1140
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:45,030
It works for all of us. Do United
Way, right? That's what I think.

1141
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,960
I don't have a problem with religion.
Okay.

1142
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:51,210
I shit on it the way I
shit on everything else.

1143
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,930
Why do you just fucking
send me emails when I,

1144
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:58,590
when I talk about a old Jay star there,
you know,

1145
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:04,350
tend to good Bible believing church.
I did. I did it my whole fucking life.

1146
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:08,940
And you know what turned out
they were fucking kids, you know?

1147
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,300
Do you understand that Travis?

1148
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,600
Do you understand what they did
to society? The amount of fucking,

1149
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:23,350
just people who came forward
and how that's going to
affect the person that they

1150
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,830
marry and the way they raise their
fucking kids in the hangups that they are

1151
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:32,340
going to have. That shit is going
to last for fucking centuries. Okay.

1152
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:35,640
And forget about the
fucking Spanish inquisition.

1153
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:38,790
All these fucking wars.
What is wrong?

1154
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,910
Like I don't understand these fucking
people who can't see the, the,

1155
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,920
the ridiculous level of death
that has been caused because of,

1156
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:53,130
because everybody just trying to fucking,
I'm really preaching right now.

1157
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,990
I've got to shut up, but I just, it's just
how I fee fucking asked me. All right.

1158
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,700
I just, you know, I believe
in the be a good person,

1159
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,000
even though I'm not, you know, and I
can't even say I'm trying to be, I've,

1160
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:11,380
I've quit, I've quit trying to be a
good person. I've been living, uh,

1161
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:17,160
in accordance to the Church of Satan
and I have.

1162
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,320
All right.
And I know right now you're thinking,

1163
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:23,820
I'm in here and I'm fucking sacrifice in
a fucking lamb or some shit talking to

1164
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:28,100
old, a fucking LDL below there. I'm
not, that's not what the church is.

1165
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:31,530
Satan is about. That's what the
fuck you guys told me it was about.

1166
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,670
And then one day, back in the day, I
had a radio show with young Joe to Rosa,

1167
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,700
the teen idols sensation from the
opion Anthony Program. And we,

1168
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,280
it was Halloween was coming up.
We said,

1169
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:43,800
why don't we have some of these
satanist people come in here.

1170
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:47,760
Let's see if they could freak us out.
So he was sitting there asking them,

1171
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,370
what about the devil and all
that. And they go, yeah, we don't,

1172
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,850
we don't believe in that shit that's
organized. Religion came up with that.

1173
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,190
We don't believe, we don't believe
that there's a heaven or a hell.

1174
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,130
We don't believe in the devil.
We don't believe in any of that stuff.

1175
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,730
So I was like, all right, so what do you
guys believe in? And he's just like, uh,

1176
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,350
basically doing what feels good to you.
You know,

1177
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:13,060
which means, you know, fucking
bang a bunch of hobbies.

1178
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,900
You want a hot fudge Sundae.
You go on your fucking eat it.

1179
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:21,040
If you want peace and quiet,
you don't have kids. You
just, you live for yourself.

1180
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,040
That's basically what, that's,
that's their version of it.

1181
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,060
So that's what I'm saying.
I've been living for myself.
It's ridiculous. All right.

1182
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:32,980
I play hockey. I played drums. I tell
jokes. I go to fucking basketball games.

1183
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,910
I'm not passing any knowledge on to
anybody who half looks like me and half

1184
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:40,090
looks like my beautiful girlfriend.
I've lifted up very selfish fucking life.

1185
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:46,090
So, uh, but I don't need
Jesus. Do I? Travis,

1186
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,570
is that what you're yelling right now?
Um, no. That's what I have against it be.

1187
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,810
I'm, I'm, you know, I got to make
some of these funny. All right.

1188
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,680
I don't have a problem if you're an
organized religion. I don't, but I, I, uh,

1189
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,620
I don't understand why a

1190
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:03,030
okay.

1191
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:04,800
I Dunno.
People just don't see how

1192
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:10,290
that everything kind of says the same
shit and then you just have a different

1193
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:14,180
guy that you're, you're saying
it too. And then for some reason,

1194
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,980
if the other guys don't believe in your
guy, eventually you end up killing them.

1195
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Either one on one face to face or you
let some fuckhead tell you what those

1196
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:30,160
other people are like and how they're
going to get you when they're going to do

1197
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:32,930
all this fucking evil shit.
Right.

1198
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,630
And then you go over there
and you fucking kill them.

1199
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,940
Why those fucking rich countries
sit there? Yeah. You know,

1200
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:41,520
playing footsie with each other, you
know, resting their feet on bars.

1201
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,160
Gold Rolling. That's what they do.
They roll around in cash, you know,

1202
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,050
that's what they do. You think,
you think that's what bankers do?

1203
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:53,750
Just sit there just like change.
They just dive into it like a Jacuzzi.

1204
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,490
Just coins sitting there. Creepy giggle.

1205
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,780
Um, I, what the fuck? I'm tired. So that's
why Travis. All right. That's why I do it.

1206
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,920
Cause I don't fucking believe in it.
I don't believe in it.

1207
01:16:04,921 --> 01:16:07,770
I don't believe a fucking word of it.
I believe in a higher power.

1208
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,260
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I don't know what happens when you die,

1209
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,740
but I'm not listening to you or any
other fucking idiot who, you know,

1210
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:18,220
wants to rub one out to his teacher
because you'd do all right. Stop fighting.

1211
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,170
Thought you do. Just take it out.
Rub it out. Have a good fucking time.

1212
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:23,370
But your Goddamn Dick,

1213
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,450
stop having some other fucking person
tell you what you can jerk off too.

1214
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:27,643
All right.

1215
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,980
Yeah.

1216
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,340
Oh God. That was Cathartic. That
felt good. I feel good for you guys.

1217
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,580
How about you may match, um, match

1218
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,750
Travis Dakota. Um, all right.
What are we talking about now?

1219
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:49,160
What do I got here? Move on to, uh,
oh, I gotta read you this shit. Um,

1220
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:51,960
hello to everyone over there
in England. Um, I know,

1221
01:16:51,961 --> 01:16:56,340
I keep saying this tour's coming together.
It is, it is coming together. England,

1222
01:16:56,341 --> 01:16:58,650
Ireland,
Scotland is fucking,

1223
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,740
thing's going to come together and I'm
trying to tack on a Scandinavian tour.

1224
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:02,980
Yeah.

1225
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,970
As well.
And then maybe some Australia.

1226
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,290
Yeah,

1227
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,820
in the, uh, in the fall. All right.

1228
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,990
So by all means, I, I love
hearing from other countries.

1229
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,320
All right. And I don't give a
shit if you trash fucking America.

1230
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:21,050
I don't give a fuck. I just want
to hear what you think. I mean,

1231
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:23,180
I'm not going to agree
with you on a lot of it,

1232
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,690
but let me know what's going on over
your way so I can try to make this thing

1233
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:31,150
that's so specific to Jesus
freaks in Texas. All right. Uh,

1234
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:34,580
this is from England. Uh, [inaudible]
this is some sort of sport.

1235
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:37,120
This is kind of about sports
controversies this week. Um,

1236
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,970
I don't know if that was a controversy
between Chris Bosh and a guy,

1237
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:44,870
Kevin Durant. All I know it was,
it was, it was great. You know,

1238
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,150
I thought it was awesome. I liked
when they get in each other's face,

1239
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:48,500
they start fucking screaming,
yelling,

1240
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:51,470
and they played the game was
fucking awesome game. And, uh,

1241
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:55,100
I think I became a thunder fan dude.
By the way.

1242
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:59,540
Their mascot is the shit.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

1243
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:03,620
I get, I get why that one? Does it
make sense? You know what I mean?

1244
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,020
Like the Phoenix Suns, why they have
a gorilla? I have no fucking idea.

1245
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,000
I guess a gorilla like all living things
needs the sun. But other than that,

1246
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:18,650
that's the only connection I make
with a gorilla in the fucking sun.

1247
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,910
So, you know, whatever.

1248
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:23,960
San Diego had the San Diego chicken that
made no fucking sense for the Padres,

1249
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:28,590
but the dude was hilarious. So anyways,
this fucking dude for the, a was like,

1250
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:32,570
his name is rumble. Is that his
name? And I began with an R,

1251
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,570
I can't fucking remember.
He looks like a where the wild things are.

1252
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,500
I'm one of those things.
This fucking dude came out,

1253
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:45,800
head is at half court had his back
to the fucking rim to hand it,

1254
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:49,400
threw it over his head without looking
with the mascot shit on and nothing but

1255
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:52,790
net. All right. And then walked
off the court like it was nothing.

1256
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:55,100
I know he doesn't hit
it every fucking game,

1257
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:56,600
but it was pretty God damn impressive.

1258
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,520
And then later on he comes out on a
fucking drum kit in the goddamn costume.

1259
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,870
It starts jamming with these fucking,
this, this mini drum line killing it.

1260
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,440
And as he's fucking killing it
on the drum kit, the drum kit,

1261
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:14,030
I don't know how starts
going around the fucking, uh,

1262
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,580
the mini drum line people.
They're like standing basically where the,

1263
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,310
where center court is,
where the basketball is.

1264
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,400
And then this thing starts revolving
around it like a goddamn planet around the

1265
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:26,840
sun, like very fast, you know,
to the point that, you know,

1266
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,720
almost to the point where he could fucking
fall off and he's still keeping the

1267
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,140
beat. The stool was the
shit. Um, so anyways,

1268
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,450
how the fuck did I get into that?
Oh,

1269
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:37,310
I know we're talking
sports car traverses here.

1270
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,450
So this guy sends me the
sink from England. This is
hilarious. These two guys who,

1271
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:42,910
uh,
basically I,

1272
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,060
as far as I can tell that they commentate
for the Premiere League, which is the,

1273
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:51,170
uh, the, the English soccer
league over there for my money.

1274
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:54,530
It's the best one out there. You
know, if my little bit of knowledge,

1275
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,950
it's just fucking, you know,
150 years, a ton of 20,

1276
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:02,360
50 years of tradition with some of these,
these teams and fans go fucking nuts.

1277
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:06,230
People get trampled to death. It's, it's
everything that you love about sports,

1278
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:08,700
right?
So evidently these commentators,

1279
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:14,340
um, first of all, they got busted.
They didn't know them, Mike on,

1280
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,930
and they was shitting on this lady,
um, who was working on the sidelines,

1281
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:21,060
basically. Not even saying
like, like, you know,

1282
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:23,040
I'd love to fucking bang or basically say,

1283
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,840
and she didn't know what
the fuck she was doing.

1284
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:28,920
They just didn't know that
there. Mike's, we're on. So, uh,

1285
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,280
now of course one of them has to step
down to the other ones cast to like,

1286
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:36,040
apologize profusely. Here's basically
what happened. You guys got,

1287
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,820
I have the youtube videos to you get, you
got to, you got to watch these things.

1288
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:41,370
They're hilarious. I says,
hey bill here in England,

1289
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,640
there is currently a very funny
shitstorm surrounding to Sky Sports,

1290
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,510
premier league broadcasters. I'm
guessing spot sky sports is like their,

1291
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,000
their sports channel, ESPN or
something. Um, so anyways, they're raw.

1292
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:57,180
They're in trouble for sexist comments.
They made about a female official.

1293
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,710
See I, I mean I only listened to her
once but I didn't hear them saying like,

1294
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:05,880
Oh look at the tits on her.
They just said that she stunk at her job.

1295
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:07,710
You know,

1296
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:11,730
is it come to that if you just criticize
a woman for doing a job that a guy

1297
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:14,190
usually does that
automatically become sexist?

1298
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,290
I don't remember them saying anything
like that. Granted, I'm a fucking moron.

1299
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,173
But uh,

1300
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,890
I mean when these guys know who
would know better than these guys,

1301
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,080
these guys are the guys,
right? So anyways, he says,

1302
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:33,081
a new footage keeps appearing on Youtube
as people seem to be digging up shit on

1303
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:35,844
these guys.

1304
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,940
It is well funny as they are a pair of
cozy smug Kuntz who have such great jobs.

1305
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,740
Ah, you've got to fucking love
English people. Cozy smug cons.

1306
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:54,741
Can you please send me audio of you saying
that in your fucking accent so I can

1307
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:59,970
play it for my listeners next week.
Cozy smug clients who have such great job.

1308
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,740
Is that what a cozy smug countries.

1309
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:07,620
What a fucking tremendous description of
some douche who didn't earn his fucking

1310
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,600
positioned sits in a corner
office. Ah, hang on a second.

1311
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:15,450
I got to go talk to that cozy
smug cut down the fucking hall.

1312
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:22,890
Anyways, one has been a one has
been sacked. That means fired. Um,

1313
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:27,660
conspiracy theory is that it's linked
to the fact that he's suing a sister

1314
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:32,580
company newspaper for phone tapping.
Yeah. I don't know what happened there.

1315
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:34,470
Did someone tap his phone?
I have no idea. But anyways,

1316
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:38,430
he goes and the other one was eating
his own balls on the radio today.

1317
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:41,970
Apologizing like mad,
trying to save his career.

1318
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:46,560
I thought this story might appeal to you
as I know you love a good broadcast or

1319
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:50,880
balls up and a bit of bit of woman
trashing thrown in for good measure.

1320
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,010
Here are some clips from the story.
Okay.

1321
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:57,390
So he gives me the clips of them making
sexist comments. I'd play it for you,

1322
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,980
but a you really as an American got to
listen to it a couple of times to pick up

1323
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:06,850
everything that's saying. Um,
cause they're talking really. Um,

1324
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,110
but the best thing is he sent me
this other clip and it's the same two

1325
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,660
broadcasters and they're doing,

1326
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,960
they're basically speaking over
highlights of women's soccer,

1327
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,480
which as far as I can tell,

1328
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:24,810
the quality level is the equivalent of
the WWE NBA during the first two weeks

1329
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:27,640
that it came out. Right.
So they start doing,

1330
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:33,150
they start doing the highlights and these
fucking broads are so bad at play in

1331
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:38,410
football that they just start
laughing all right there.

1332
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:40,540
Do you understand that?
Not in a mean way.

1333
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,100
It's what made them laugh
was the level of, of,

1334
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:49,600
or lack of level of quality
of these fucking broads.

1335
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,560
The way they were playing the game. They
sucked. You should see this one. It,

1336
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,630
he got to watch this video.
I have it up on the MM podcast.com.

1337
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,280
This girl, right? The fucking goalie
falls down. I don't know what happened.

1338
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:07,610
She stepped on the stringer for fucking
Tampon. Sorry. That was mean. Um,

1339
01:24:07,611 --> 01:24:12,430
she fucking falls down or whatever.
She's horrifically out of position.

1340
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,950
So the other girl,

1341
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:20,250
she has basically three quarters of the
net to shoot this little fucking ball

1342
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:24,490
in. None of those. You don't know
shit about soccer. A goal in soccer.

1343
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:28,990
You could drive three of
those double decker fucking
Red London buses through it.

1344
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:32,230
So she's got three. You could
drive to fucking buses through it.

1345
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,410
She kicks the ball somehow
she gets underneath it.

1346
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:39,460
This thing fucking shoots up in the air,
hits underneath the crossbar,

1347
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,730
comes back out onto the field of play.
And then because of the, the row,

1348
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,640
the spin on the ball,
it's somehow by the grace of God,

1349
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,150
trickles into the fucking net.
It was one of the ugliest goals ever.

1350
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:55,600
And then the girl start celebrating
like she's fucking Paleo or something.

1351
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:59,500
So I think that that was the high, I can't
remember, cause I only watched it once.

1352
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:04,360
These two fucking cozy smug cons is this
guy says they start fucking one of them

1353
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:08,440
laughs and then the other one has to
continue talking and then he starts

1354
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:11,590
giggling. Ain't I'll fucking immature
guys. Our next thing you know,

1355
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:15,730
they're laughing their balls off and
you know what has saved their job.

1356
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,360
If one of these fucking broads can
actually play soccer, it wouldn't,

1357
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,610
would stop doing hilarious,

1358
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:25,270
horrific shit on the fucking field or the
pitch or whatever the fuck you call it.

1359
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:29,910
You know? So these guys got
in trouble for that shit too,

1360
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:35,160
which is hilarious to me.
And I'm also thinking why?

1361
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:39,300
That's why girls suck at soccer or
football, whatever the fuck you call it.

1362
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:45,000
See if you suck as a guy and guys
laugh at you, you have two choices.

1363
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:49,920
Either get good so they stop laughing
at you or quit the fucking sport.

1364
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:53,110
You don't have the option
of your thought being me.

1365
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:58,111
To me that [inaudible] stop it and then
everybody has to sit around and pretend

1366
01:25:58,981 --> 01:26:00,990
like you don't suck at
what you do for a living

1367
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:06,950
fucking nerve or those broads to get mad.
The fact that that, that, that, that,

1368
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:12,100
that shit is on TV is the level of
play that that actually makes it on TV.

1369
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,020
And some guy was 20 times as good,

1370
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,440
who can't make it into the premier league
is never going to get on television

1371
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:20,240
these fucking broads get on there.
Right.

1372
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,800
And that the level of fucking
play that they put that on.

1373
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,160
When does that air over there?
Does it come on right after Benny Hill?

1374
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,320
Is it like a comedy Thursday night?

1375
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:32,880
Yeah.

1376
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,360
I mean the highlights say literally
should've been playing that way.

1377
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:39,210
We may be back at eight eight eight ticket
that fucking Kazoo Song. So anyways,

1378
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,760
you've got to check it out and it's Ah,
it's fucking tremendous.

1379
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:44,550
And I'm not saying that women are
bad athletes, but these women were,

1380
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,170
they were horrific.
All right.

1381
01:26:46,171 --> 01:26:50,070
I'm not saying Laila Ali could not beat
the living shit out of me. She could.

1382
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:51,690
All right.

1383
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:55,500
And you know what I would expect you
guys to do laugh your ass off during the

1384
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:59,520
highlight of me getting my ass
kicked because I suck at boxing.

1385
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,750
I'm terrible at it. You
know, I got a good temper.

1386
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:08,400
I'll fucking spazz out and fucking throw
you on the ground if I can, you know,

1387
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,710
and start punching you through
tears. You know, that spare,

1388
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,850
that type of shit is what I
used to do when I was a kid.

1389
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,950
But I tried taking boxing. I just,
I, I, I'm, I'm not quick, I just,

1390
01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:23,670
I don't have that quick twitch muscle
fiber at all and I have a huge fucking

1391
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:28,410
heads, so that's not a good
combination. Slow and having a big head.

1392
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:33,020
You don't want to get into a boxing ring.
Um,

1393
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:36,030
anyways, thank you very much for
sending that. And like I said, yeah,

1394
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:39,120
if you're in any of those,
those countries, a over
there that I, that I go to,

1395
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:43,420
which is basically London, London, I'm
going to war on England. Fucking, uh,

1396
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,190
Ireland and Scotland.
Please send me some Australia.

1397
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:49,800
I'm coming your way in any
Scandinavian country. You're right.

1398
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,930
As far as the rest of year,
uh, you know, chime in.

1399
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:57,540
If you've got a fucking comedy zone over
there, eventually I'm going to go there.

1400
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,570
And it's not because I
give a fuck about you.

1401
01:28:00,571 --> 01:28:03,510
It's because I see what the banks
are doing. They're going global,

1402
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,200
they're going global, and I'm not going
to get caught flat footed. That's,

1403
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:08,130
that's my,

1404
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,320
that's my exit strategy for
when the shit goes down.

1405
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:14,671
All right.

1406
01:28:14,671 --> 01:28:18,090
I'm going to go out to van
Nuys and hopefully have a
fucking private jet by then

1407
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,510
and I'm going to, as, as the
shit starts burning over here,

1408
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:26,040
I'm going to jump in a Goddamn plane and
I'm flying to another country and I'm

1409
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,240
going to be booking gigs.
Hey,

1410
01:28:27,241 --> 01:28:30,900
remember me get a mate coming
down for a couple of weeks,

1411
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,380
uh, you know, book me in the old fucking
Foster's lager, a fucking comedy tour.

1412
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,370
Goddamn bullshit.
That depth charge level beer.

1413
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,540
Evidently none of them drink it
over there. Um, oh, by the way,

1414
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:48,990
thanks for Rupert Murdoch. All right,
thank you. Thank you very much.

1415
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:54,420
Jesus Christ. I thought you
guys were cool over there. Um,

1416
01:28:55,140 --> 01:29:00,090
you know, Rupert Murdoch is such a
Douchey, almost negates ACDC. Okay.

1417
01:29:00,091 --> 01:29:01,990
There's a fucking statement.
You all

1418
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,380
right, let's, let's go
onto the next topic here.

1419
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,180
I have a splitting fucking headache.
Um, oh, let me get a headache.

1420
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:12,850
You can feel your heartbeat
and your ears. Um, all right.

1421
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,760
Oh, here we go. Here's a new topic. This
topic really took off this past week.

1422
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:22,530
The new topic is this racist,
racist, racist, racist.

1423
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,240
Um, last week, uh,

1424
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:28,740
we had some people asking some questions
and I can't fucking remember what the

1425
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:29,574
hell they were.

1426
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,170
I remember I was saying when I drive
down the street and somebody cuts me off,

1427
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:38,220
I play a game out here in Los Angeles,
a game called a older Asian.

1428
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:40,650
And the person I'm writing with,
we both have to guess.

1429
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,480
One person picks all the other
person picks Asian, you know,

1430
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,780
and then you pull up alongside and
you take a look and I swear to God,

1431
01:29:48,781 --> 01:29:52,290
nine times out of 10 it's
one or the other, you know?

1432
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,080
And if it's all Dan Asian,

1433
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:57,870
that's like hitting the green
double zero in fucking roulette.

1434
01:29:57,871 --> 01:30:02,460
Nobody went unless you picked it,
unless you said Old Asian. All right.

1435
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:04,530
So I just be like, is that
fucking racist? Right?

1436
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:06,210
Never with somebody chimed in last week,

1437
01:30:06,211 --> 01:30:10,530
you said it's actually racist
and age just to say that.

1438
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,200
Okay.

1439
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:17,030
So yeah. So I guess I have a racist age
escape. But let me ask you this. Um,

1440
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,300
what about the factor that
it's just me and my car?

1441
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:24,080
Aren't you allowed to say
fucked up shit in your car?

1442
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,980
Doesn't everybody sort of become like
Michael Douglas and falling down when you

1443
01:30:27,981 --> 01:30:31,580
get in your car? Don't you say fucked
up shit. And when I say, don't you,

1444
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:36,090
I mean everybody, not just white
people come on. Black people.

1445
01:30:36,091 --> 01:30:40,710
You know what you say about us?
Ah, you know what you say Mexicans?

1446
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:43,170
Huh?
You know what you say?

1447
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:47,610
Everybody knows what everybody says
this stuff. Some more wins. Come on.

1448
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:53,730
You know what you say when you're out
there fucking tackle in a tree and turn it

1449
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,850
in. Do a fucking surfboard. Right?
Isn't that what you guys do?

1450
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,430
Are those the toughest fucking
people on the planet? I mean,

1451
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,940
my whole knowledge of Samoans is
basically professional wrestling,

1452
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:06,180
USC football and uh,
that dude on the Steelers,

1453
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:12,260
I've just never seen a
fucking pussy who's a Samoan.

1454
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:17,400
They just, you know, those are like the
actual, the real three hundreds people,

1455
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,970
you know, except they're
not in the snow. You know,

1456
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:25,170
they are a bunch of fatty so why don't
they do with Samoan fucking biggest loser?

1457
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,433
Yeah.

1458
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:34,820
That would be the shit. Some fat fucking
Samoan dudes. You bring them in there,

1459
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:38,270
you get them into insane shape
and then at the end of the show,

1460
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:40,670
rather than winning like 200,000,

1461
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:45,230
they just get drafted into the NFL and
they become millionaires. Look at that.

1462
01:31:45,231 --> 01:31:49,870
See that people, that's why I moved
out to La, cause I could just,

1463
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,780
I can create a show out enough to get,
get it on the fucking air,

1464
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:56,390
but I can create one.
Yes,

1465
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,670
I am the idea that is cryptic talk and
I'm not to talk about that failure in my

1466
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:05,220
career. All right, let's plow ahead.
Uh, so here we go. Is this racist? Uh,

1467
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,100
this is a question I have.

1468
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:10,090
Is it racist for me to root for a white
running back at this point? You know,

1469
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,480
considering the last good one
was like Jim kick and Larry Zaka.

1470
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,390
John Reagan's right. Who's the
last? That's a good, you know what?

1471
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,300
I don't know the answer to this.

1472
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:22,690
Who was the last white dude
to win the rushing title?

1473
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:28,510
All right, let me think
here. It's definitely nobody,

1474
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:32,470
and I mean nobody before Walter Payton,

1475
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,570
there is no fucking way.
It was Walter Peyton was in the league.

1476
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:42,370
Earl Campbell then came
Billy Sims.

1477
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:44,320
Dick then came into the fucking league.

1478
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,750
It was always guys and those
guys who were, were just,

1479
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,870
they weren't leading the league, but they
was still killing it. Like Joe Cribbs.

1480
01:32:51,871 --> 01:32:54,600
You remember him?
Who else?

1481
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,320
John Riggins was around them,

1482
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:59,540
but I don't think maybe the
strike season did he wanted,

1483
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:06,670
who else came after that?
George Rogers. Oj Anderson.

1484
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:10,180
Tony Doerr said,
how the fuck did I from Franco Harris,

1485
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:17,830
Rick up church now. He wasn't a rude,
wasn't running back. Wilbert Montgomery.

1486
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,690
I've gone right through all the fucking
teams. They all had uh, chuck Muncie.

1487
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,560
And you're fine. Jeff. Roger
Craig. Yeah, there was no way,

1488
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:31,650
but they had that psycho white dude.
It was fucking awesome on that team.

1489
01:33:31,651 --> 01:33:34,800
I forget his name, but he wasn't leading
the league. Who's the last guy? All right,

1490
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:39,300
let's go pre that.
Any guy who Floyd little gale Sayers,

1491
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,130
we're getting back to then
Jesus Christ

1492
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:49,550
as a white running back. Ever done
it. I don't even fucking know.

1493
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:52,060
So that's what I'm saying.
You know, it's like a,

1494
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,550
it's like a black people root for
like a black quarterback. I'll let go.

1495
01:33:55,551 --> 01:33:58,810
I'll all the fucking Asian people
freak out. When, uh, her deck,

1496
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:01,430
he met Zooey came to town,
you know,

1497
01:34:01,431 --> 01:34:04,890
and all of a sudden they give a shit
about the Yankees because they got,

1498
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,400
they got, they got one of their
guys on there because there's not,

1499
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:10,100
there's not a lot of Asian guys
in the major league baseball.

1500
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:15,890
I didn't look at them like
they were racist. So can I,

1501
01:34:15,891 --> 01:34:20,150
can I be excited about that fucking white
dude who runs for the Cleveland Browns?

1502
01:34:20,151 --> 01:34:24,140
Who has that facemash that looks like
the front of a dodge ram truck. Huh?

1503
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,110
Let me know. Answer that question. I'm
gonna ask you. I'm going to fucking,

1504
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:30,320
I'm going to work out all my
bullshit on this podcast. All right?

1505
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:34,040
So ever deadly older Asian
is ageist and racist.

1506
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,890
That doesn't mean I'm
going to stop doing it.

1507
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,870
There's no hate in my heart when I do it.
You know,

1508
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,770
like me be justifying it.
Um,

1509
01:34:42,771 --> 01:34:45,200
as I sit on a fucking bed
with white sheets on it

1510
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:52,160
for comfort, okay. There's none with holes
in it. I'm not putting it on my head.

1511
01:34:52,161 --> 01:34:56,510
All right, so relax. All
right, here we go. Uh,

1512
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:59,300
this is coming Japan,
but these are actually our troops.

1513
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:02,540
We have troops based over there cause
we're making sure that no one takes the

1514
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:06,170
Japanese people's freedom.
That's what we do. We just,

1515
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,970
we were so concerned about everybody's
freedom around the world that we, uh,

1516
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:15,080
we muscle our way in and we put a base
there that's like our Starbucks for the

1517
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:16,240
world.
We put a base there.

1518
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:21,200
We just make sure that everybody's all
Hunky Dory looking out for your best

1519
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:23,990
interests.
Um,

1520
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,470
fuck. Am I getting sick? Okay. Hey, Belk,

1521
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:34,760
your is it racist segment segment was
the source of much comedy and pain

1522
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:38,090
yesterday for us out here,
stationed in Japan.

1523
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:42,500
Racism is always a source of a headache
and particularly in the military where

1524
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:47,120
great lengths are taken to ensure
that it's not tolerated at all. Well,

1525
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:51,440
that's great. That's a good thing. Uh,
for the most part, they do a great job.

1526
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,810
Of course is always going
to be idiots everywhere.

1527
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:57,920
But here's a funny thing that happened
involved involving your previous podcast.

1528
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:03,440
Somehow I'm fucking implicated halfway
across the world. Oh, here we go.

1529
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:07,550
So I'm listening to your podcast.
Admittedly inappropriately at work.

1530
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:12,530
And My coworker who's also
black. All right, let's stop.
Let's look at the stats.

1531
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:16,850
This is a black guy. He's hanging out with
another black guy. Nobody get nervous.

1532
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:23,360
Uh, and my coworker who is also black
and I are laughing at your crazy ass.

1533
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:27,230
Now this guy is definitely black cause
I that how white did that sound coming

1534
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:31,520
out of my voice, out of my mouth at
me. Out of my voice. Sorry people,

1535
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,420
I'm laughing at your crazy ass.
Yo,

1536
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:40,760
you did the Belbiq Doba Doba thing about
the Indian reading from one of your

1537
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:44,900
fans letters. Uh, so my guy is
like, yeah, that shit is racist.

1538
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,400
And uh,
you know,

1539
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:51,230
he's going to get an email from some
idiot asking is would I click, click,

1540
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:52,640
click racist bill?
I Dunno.

1541
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:56,150
I Dunno what the fuck that is at some sort
of African accent. He goes, I mean, oh,

1542
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,590
I keep fucking that thing up.

1543
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:00,680
I actually did this podcast the
other day and I messed that up.

1544
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:05,060
Let me just read this entire quote. I'm
gonna read it as white as possible. Uh,

1545
01:37:05,061 --> 01:37:09,920
so my, my friend whose African American
said, yeah, that shit is racist. You know,

1546
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:13,970
he's going to get an email from some idiot
asking is bullied Boulay click, click,

1547
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:18,620
click racist bill. I mean, I know
I'm not racist, so I don't know.

1548
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:23,120
I just don't know.
Um,

1549
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,141
here's where it goes.

1550
01:37:24,141 --> 01:37:29,000
Twilight zone or warming passing by in
the hallway was evidently offended by my

1551
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:32,870
coworkers.
Insensitive impression of African dialect.

1552
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:38,360
So that is African. All right.
[inaudible] something like that.

1553
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:43,940
Shaka Zulu. Right. Um, so she will,

1554
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:47,390
this coworkers just walking by is this
dude's talking about my podcast and she

1555
01:37:47,391 --> 01:37:51,320
gets offended by the black guys.
Impression of an African.

1556
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:56,160
Alright. It's evidently it's a
white lady who gets offended.

1557
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,450
He tried to explain to her that he was
using it as an example and even offered

1558
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:03,840
to play back the portion of the
podcasts that it applied to,

1559
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,850
but it seemed a bit like
she was determined to take
advantage of this situation

1560
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:12,420
to make some sort of point.
So picture this visual bill,

1561
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,100
a white woman is sitting there preparing
a statement about a black guy making

1562
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:21,330
racist comments about black people
in front of another black guy,

1563
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:26,390
myself and all of this being presented
to the section commander who happens to

1564
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:31,060
be Japanese American.
I can't,

1565
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:34,920
I'm sitting there as a
witness biting my lip,

1566
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:39,150
trying not to laugh because I swear
I could see on the command his face.

1567
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:43,050
He was like, dear baby Jesus,
what the fuck is going on?

1568
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:45,151
I'm like,

1569
01:38:45,151 --> 01:38:49,290
he was trying to blink himself out of
the room and this entire situation.

1570
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,160
So we'll see where this goes
in the upcoming weeks. Um,

1571
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,850
he sent me another email and
the, uh, the commander there,

1572
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,690
the Japanese American commander told
the African American to handle it within

1573
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:05,500
his, uh, he just handled
himself with the, uh,

1574
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,730
Caucasian American. There was that
politically correct enough? Um,

1575
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,870
you hit it on the head in
your last podcast as far as
it's what's in your heart

1576
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:17,070
most times in regards to whether or not
something is racist. Uh, people know,

1577
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:20,700
fuck all that. Oh, I
was not aware. Shit. Uh,

1578
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:25,110
if you say something or do something and
then you wonder if it's racist or not,

1579
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,360
chances are it probably is.

1580
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:30,690
Slash was if the first thing
that comes out of your mouth is,

1581
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:32,640
I'm not a racist or anything,

1582
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:37,680
but I already know I'm in
for some bullshit. This, uh,

1583
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:40,920
the saying that anything you
say, oh, what's that saying?

1584
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:44,640
Anything you say before the word
but is automatically racist.

1585
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,730
And that is true at least 98% of the time.

1586
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,420
And nowadays the Internet has just given
people mostly idiots and cowards of

1587
01:39:52,421 --> 01:39:57,330
voice of anonymity for shit like
that. Yeah. That's something I really,

1588
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:02,390
I really depressing is the fucking level
of a racist comments or fucking youtube

1589
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:09,480
like that pussy shit where no one
can see you. No one can get you in.

1590
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:13,170
You're talking to all that
fucking shit. And uh, I dunno.

1591
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,710
That's depressing. It's really depressing.
Anyways, uh, on the flip side, the Sh, uh,

1592
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:21,450
is the shit some black people
say about any other race.

1593
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:25,320
Ah, Shit. Sorry. I was doing really
well reading out loud this week.

1594
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:26,580
When we blow through this last paragraph,

1595
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:28,730
I swear to God and I'll end the torture.
Uh,

1596
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:32,970
on the flip side is this shit some black
say about any other race offensive.

1597
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:38,040
Oh, that's not my fault. He
wrote that about any other
race, offensive and racist.

1598
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:41,820
Of course. Anyone that says no
is being an idiot. I'm a realist.

1599
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,980
It's why I don't tolerate any extra hip.

1600
01:40:43,981 --> 01:40:47,130
I grew up around black guys and
I have an Nwa cassette tape,

1601
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,530
white guys saying the n word around me.

1602
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,070
It's also why you never hear me say
cracker or any other ethnic slur even in

1603
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:58,870
just, um, so anyways, he's got a
question. He said, is it racist?

1604
01:40:58,871 --> 01:41:03,130
When you hear a story about an athlete
shooting someone in a strip club and you

1605
01:41:03,131 --> 01:41:07,630
assume you know what color he
was, maybe to some, is it racist?

1606
01:41:07,631 --> 01:41:11,800
When I hear about a polar bear slapping
the shit out of someone's kid or a video

1607
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:13,840
of a guy shitting in a girl's mouth.

1608
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,980
And I'm pretty sure I know what
color all of those people are not.

1609
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,660
Oh, I'm pretty sure I know what color all
of those people are not. Um, just my two,

1610
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,800
2 cents. While thank
you for chiming it. Um,

1611
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,790
that's funny that you bring up that whole
new story because someone else wrote

1612
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:38,590
in to ask me if they thought that this,
if this was like a racist game, they said,

1613
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:38,771
Bill,

1614
01:41:38,771 --> 01:41:42,790
I like to play a little game similar to
your Asian or old person driving game,

1615
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,130
except my game involves the evening news.

1616
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:50,320
It's called beaner black guy or
crazy ass cracker. Just to clarify,

1617
01:41:50,321 --> 01:41:52,600
I am Hispanic parentheses,
Latino,

1618
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:55,930
Mexican or whatever other dumb
ass term someone has come up with.

1619
01:41:55,931 --> 01:41:58,060
So saying beaner is okay,

1620
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,120
see now this is why I
wanted to do this segment,

1621
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:05,530
which is the exact fucking reason. Okay.
He says, beaner black guy and cracker.

1622
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:08,560
All right? And he goes, I can
say meaner because I'm Mexican.

1623
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:12,220
Well then why can you say
cracker ass cracker, right?

1624
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:14,710
It's because I'm white and no
one gives a fuck about that one.

1625
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:16,240
See what I'm saying?

1626
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:21,550
This is something that I learned from
doing stand up in front of all different

1627
01:42:21,551 --> 01:42:24,850
kinds of people. That's what I learned.
I learned that everybody, basically,

1628
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,480
it's not that they're selfish, they, they
just, they look out of their own head.

1629
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:32,140
You can't help but do that. So you just
see shit from your own perspective.

1630
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,970
Like one night I was doing this gig right
down at the old Boston Comedy Club in

1631
01:42:36,971 --> 01:42:41,650
New York City. And one of the acts
that was going up was this, uh,

1632
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,920
was this, I think I told
this story before, it was a,

1633
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:48,610
it was a comedy team is
this Asian Guy and girl.

1634
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,420
And they went up there and they
did this fucking rap. Okay.

1635
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,350
And they went up there and they stuck
their teeth out like they had buck teeth.

1636
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:57,071
And then they put,
you know,

1637
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:00,280
those glasses that you can put on those
joke ones that make your eyes look Asian.

1638
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:03,970
They had though they're Asian
and yet they still put those on.

1639
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:06,980
And then the other guy had on a,
uh,

1640
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:11,890
a fake gold chain with a fucking
fortune cookie hanging off the thing.

1641
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,790
So I'm sitting there looking at him
before they're going up going, oh man,

1642
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:19,360
this isn't going to fly. This isn't
going to fly with this fucking crowd.

1643
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:24,760
This is basically, uh,
what do you call that shit?

1644
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,970
What was that shit back in the
day and old time, Hollywood,

1645
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:31,750
it was almost like Asian black face.
Like what they were doing was fucking,

1646
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:34,000
was ridiculous. I was thinking
that black people watching it,

1647
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:37,510
we're going to be like, just all
the shit that they've been through.

1648
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:39,790
We look at and be like, what the
fuck? Why are they these fucking,

1649
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:42,940
why are they selling out their own
fucking race? This is horrific.

1650
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,870
This is fucking horrific.
And they didn't,

1651
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:52,220
that act went up there and they fucking
destroyed and everybody their balls off.

1652
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,480
They thought the fortune cookie thing was
fucking hilarious. And I was just like,

1653
01:43:56,481 --> 01:43:59,300
yeah, people, I don't know. Maybe it's
cause they're shitting on their own race.

1654
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:02,750
What the fuck you supposed to do? I Dunno.
I just found that shit. Fascinating.

1655
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,630
So what does that pertain to?
What the fuck? I just said,

1656
01:44:05,631 --> 01:44:08,630
I don't know if this colt
medicine's kicking in. Let
me finish this. So anyways,

1657
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:13,620
this is basically what this
guy does. He says, uh, uh,

1658
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,420
just to clarify [inaudible] okay,

1659
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,450
now this game started because I hate
watching the news and no matter what I'm

1660
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:23,930
watching sports center,
usually my wife will want to change it.

1661
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,590
I'm so naturally being
the asshole that I am.

1662
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:31,580
I had to figure out a way to ruin it for,
um,

1663
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:34,940
so what I do is turn away from
the news whenever they begin,

1664
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,500
begin explaining the crimes are events
of the day based on the description of

1665
01:44:39,501 --> 01:44:42,890
the crime or event and how it
was committed or performed.

1666
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,570
I yell either beaner black
guy or crazy ass cracker.

1667
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:50,700
Do that actually sounds like
a fun fucking game. Well,

1668
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:54,710
I wouldn't say crazy ass cracker. I
would just say fucking white dude. Um,

1669
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:58,850
example news report says what
I say. Bainer no, I wouldn't.

1670
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:04,370
That's one of the worst ones ever.
Beaner it's got no ring.

1671
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:08,630
It's got no flow. That must've been a
bad day with white people. You know,

1672
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:11,450
usually where a lot more
creative than that, you know,

1673
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:15,050
named me after her fucking vegetable
isn't a vegetables that have fruit.

1674
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:19,540
What the fuck is, I don't
know. Fucking anyways to plow
ahead. Example News report,

1675
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:22,430
it says a man was stabbed
and I yell out painter.

1676
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:27,050
I know it's being it because we Mexicans
can't afford guns and still pay for our

1677
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:31,250
legal extended family members. We have
living with us and our two bedroom house.

1678
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:36,260
If the news report says a drive by
shooting, I yell Black Guy, come on.

1679
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:38,390
Do I really have to explain
the reason behind that one?

1680
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:42,590
And of course if I hear the suspect
had body parts of his victims in the

1681
01:45:42,591 --> 01:45:45,770
refrigerator,
fucking crazy ass cracker.

1682
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:49,070
It's because of this game that my
wife has stopped watching the news all

1683
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:53,330
together and I now have peace and
quiet to enjoy my top plays of the day.

1684
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:57,830
Fix On sports center. Well good for you.
Good for you. And I'll see that something.

1685
01:45:57,831 --> 01:46:01,520
I don't, I don't think that
that's racist because what?

1686
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:04,850
You don't have any hatred
towards any of those groups.

1687
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:09,980
What you're doing is you're actually,
you don't want to watch the news.

1688
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:10,940
It's fucking depressing.

1689
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:14,180
You want to watch sports and then she
puts on a bunch of depressing shit.

1690
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:17,300
And what are you going to do?
Sit there and get depressed?

1691
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:21,320
Or are you gonna fucking
entertain yourself? So you
turn it into a fucking game?

1692
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:25,910
It's actually a a, you know,
I'm not offended by it.

1693
01:46:25,911 --> 01:46:28,940
I think that's fucking funny and
there's a lot of truth to it.

1694
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,560
Much as I hate to admit some
of the shit yet we're fucking

1695
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:39,710
body parts. Those scat
videos, I don't think,

1696
01:46:39,711 --> 01:46:43,370
I've never seen a black guy in a scat
video. Not that I've fucking, you know,

1697
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:44,270
watch those things.

1698
01:46:44,271 --> 01:46:49,271
But I have done the opiate Anthony show
and occasionally a weird video will come

1699
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:50,184
up.

1700
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:54,600
Eh,

1701
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,110
Jesus. I have scar tissue
in my brain from that show.

1702
01:46:58,111 --> 01:47:01,320
A couple of times they add, they
brought up one video one time. I,

1703
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,580
I'm not even gonna describe it.

1704
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:07,200
I just refuse to watch it and it still
haunts me and I never even fucking site.

1705
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:12,930
Um, and I'm not talking about two girls
in one cup because I did see that one,

1706
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:16,110
but they had another one
where a guy had a jar.

1707
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:19,860
And he did something with that jar
that you didn't think was natural.

1708
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:23,370
He somehow did it. And then the, uh,

1709
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:28,960
I'm gonna use an engineering term
here. The, the structure failed.

1710
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,910
The structure failed.
Um,

1711
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:42,570
the outside pressure was too much for
the structure and at which point it

1712
01:47:42,611 --> 01:47:47,560
reached a breaking point and it
failed the job. Broken the dude's ass.

1713
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,120
Okay.
I'm like,

1714
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,143
okay.

1715
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,380
And I refused to look at the video and
all I heard was everybody else in the

1716
01:47:55,381 --> 01:48:00,381
video screaming in horror as this guy
tried to avoid a trip and embarrassing

1717
01:48:00,781 --> 01:48:05,520
trip to the emergency room and clear
up the situation himself. All right,

1718
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:05,971
I'm sorry.

1719
01:48:05,971 --> 01:48:08,490
That's what the most disgusting things
I've ever described in the podcast.

1720
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:13,010
Let's plow ahead. Um, oh, here's a
guy responding to the da Ba da Ba.

1721
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:17,550
Um, is that racist? Um, anyways, so yeah,

1722
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:21,330
Indians aren't big white people fans
because the British controlled their

1723
01:48:21,331 --> 01:48:24,630
country for hundreds of years.
See that once again. See,

1724
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:28,500
we all can make ignorant statements.
So then you should hate the English.

1725
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:33,180
Why do you hate all white people?
See that we're all just as dub.

1726
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,380
Oh God dammit. This, this
is, this is enjoyable. All
right. It's plow ahead here.

1727
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:41,190
Um, you know what's some English
guy said to me the other day,

1728
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:44,430
I was out in Dallas. This guy from
Manchester was fucking hilarious.

1729
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,020
He said to me,
uh,

1730
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:51,300
I was talking about the
fucking revolutionary war
and I wasn't even trash in

1731
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:54,690
England. And when I brought
up the revolutionary war,
he goes, oh yeah. He goes,

1732
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:58,080
he goes, how's that tax free
country working out for you?

1733
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,630
Oh, that was such a fucking
good one. I was, I had nothing
to say. I was like, yeah,

1734
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:10,300
yeah, absolutely. Fucking right. The rich
people fucking stirred up the morons.

1735
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:14,650
They kick the fucking British out and
then the rich people just picked up where

1736
01:49:14,651 --> 01:49:18,700
the British left off evidently. Alright.
Plowing ahead. Indians racist. All right.

1737
01:49:18,701 --> 01:49:19,540
Anyways, Bill. So yeah,

1738
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:22,900
Indians are big white people fans because
the British controlled their country

1739
01:49:22,901 --> 01:49:26,800
for hundreds of years. Um, even as much
as I gave you shit. I understand that.

1740
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:31,330
So if you see me getting off the boat
with my fucking Goddamn red hair, right?

1741
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:32,561
You're just thinking,

1742
01:49:32,561 --> 01:49:35,080
I'm another God damn person coming
over there to fuck over your country.

1743
01:49:35,081 --> 01:49:36,430
I get that.
He says,

1744
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,510
the worst part is that it was
a company that ruled them.

1745
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:45,540
The British east Indian India trading
company pretty much controlled the country

1746
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:49,510
using soldiers to keep
the Indians in line.

1747
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:54,900
There was at least one really bad massacre
where in a British general had his

1748
01:49:54,941 --> 01:49:59,320
troops opened fire on a group of,
and I don't know how to say this,

1749
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:01,000
and I'm not going to
disrespect these people.

1750
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:05,410
S I k h s is that seeks,
I have no idea.

1751
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,600
I'm just, okay, so open up in a fire.

1752
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,530
These a group of these people
just for being in a group,

1753
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,730
something like 2000 people died,
including many women and children.

1754
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:18,970
Then Gandhi came and
peacefully drove the Brits out.

1755
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:23,500
Just thought I'd let you know,
Dude, you are just like me.

1756
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,800
You overheard that shit or
you read about it. 20 years.

1757
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:31,690
That was the most vague description of
a horrific event I think I've ever read.

1758
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:38,110
There was at least one really bad massacre
where a British general had a troops

1759
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,990
opened, fire on a group, a group,

1760
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:46,360
and like 2000 people died. Let me ask
you guys, other guys have question here.

1761
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:47,740
The other people listen to this podcast.

1762
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:52,150
When you think of a group of people at
what number do you stop calling it a

1763
01:50:52,151 --> 01:50:56,410
group before it becomes a crowd,
you know,

1764
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,320
before it just becomes mass fucking
murder. I mean, for me, uh, uh,

1765
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:05,080
a group of people's about seven or eight,
you get up to around 15.

1766
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:09,780
That's a crowd. 2000 fucking people.
Are you referring to the, uh,

1767
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,410
I actually read a little bit about that.

1768
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:16,740
I bought this book on a Winston Churchill
and Gandhi because I wanted to read

1769
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:20,770
about some other history other than the
same fucking stories that they gave me.

1770
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,380
It's like church, you know,
I heard all, all above Jesus.

1771
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,440
They read Jesus diary to me for
the first 17 years of my life.

1772
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:33,610
It got fucking tired of it. I want to
read something else. So I read. Yeah,

1773
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:38,320
there was, I was a lot worse
than that. Something I, I
remember reading about this.

1774
01:51:38,321 --> 01:51:40,330
I'm going to give you a vague
description of what I remember.

1775
01:51:40,331 --> 01:51:42,040
This is classic for my podcast,

1776
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:44,200
cause nobody knows what the fuck
they're talking about. See this,

1777
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:49,000
this is how we're all
coming together. Um, yeah,

1778
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:53,530
the British were fucking over the Indian
people and Indian people did something.

1779
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:58,770
They finally fucking snapped and they
went off and they did something really

1780
01:51:58,781 --> 01:52:03,640
violent to, uh, some of the
British people who were over there,

1781
01:52:03,641 --> 01:52:07,780
including women and
children, I believe. And uh,

1782
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:11,050
they went say, you know,
we'll say one to 10 evil.

1783
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:15,100
They went about five and
then England said, Oh yeah,

1784
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:17,050
we'll fucking show you what Eagle Evil is.

1785
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:19,120
And then they came back and they went 15,
and they were like,

1786
01:52:19,121 --> 01:52:23,050
fucking burning people alive. They just
went around just, just shooting everybody.

1787
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:28,210
Um, which is what you have to do
when you fucking occupy a country.

1788
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,850
You have to commit fucking genocide.
That's the only way,

1789
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:33,430
which is why you shouldn't do it.
You know?

1790
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:39,340
It's why you shouldn't fucking invade
another country because they ain't fucking

1791
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,120
leaving, played fucking leave.
And so Adam, what the fuck?

1792
01:52:43,121 --> 01:52:43,931
You know what this is like,

1793
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:46,280
that's part of a whole nother
big describe a discussion.

1794
01:52:46,281 --> 01:52:47,780
I shouldn't even have
fucking brought it up.

1795
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:51,170
But the only occupation I've ever seen
that ever fucking work was in this

1796
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:52,004
country.

1797
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:55,970
And the reason why it worked was because
we weren't leaving and we fucking

1798
01:52:55,971 --> 01:53:00,500
committed genocide that Ciri.
And I'm not for that on any fucking level,

1799
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:05,680
which is why when I look around the
world and I see certain people in certain

1800
01:53:05,691 --> 01:53:09,860
areas, I'm not surprised with
what the fuck's going down.

1801
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:14,150
Cause that's what always goes down.
It's what always fucking goes down.

1802
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,120
It's fucking, uh, I dunno.
It's fucking, it's evil.

1803
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:24,440
It's pure fucking evil. Um, so anyways,
a youtube videos of this week, they,

1804
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:26,360
you know, some, a lot of that
stuff deserve a lot of justice.

1805
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:29,720
I'm a lot more justice than Apophis
a little under the weather here. Uh,

1806
01:53:29,721 --> 01:53:34,410
youtube videos of the week,
um, kid dunks himself now,

1807
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:38,390
those douchebags who come out on the
court after the black guys of all fucking

1808
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,471
dunk from the foul line.

1809
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:43,190
And then the white guys come out with
trampolines to try to roughly duplicate

1810
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:48,170
what you just saw.
This fucking kid,

1811
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:50,960
he jumps too high and he goes
through the fucking hoop.

1812
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,540
I got to give it up to the
kid though, man. He fucking,

1813
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:55,310
he didn't go right through the hoop.

1814
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:58,040
He was part of the way through the hoop
and he realized that there was someone

1815
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:01,760
coming behind them. So rather than
fucking tried to go out again, he just,

1816
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:04,760
he just went right through.
The hope was a very heads up fucking play.

1817
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,910
A funny video or this one's great,

1818
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:11,690
funny video making fun of Lebron
commercial with Brett Farve.

1819
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:17,120
Um, this fucking guy in this
video doing Brett Farve. He,

1820
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:19,910
not only does he look like him,
not only does he sound like I'm,

1821
01:54:19,911 --> 01:54:24,620
he even even gets the facial expressions
down of Brett Farve. It's fucking great.

1822
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:29,630
Um, and I made fun of Djs last week. So
this guy sent me a DJ video to watch.

1823
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:34,190
It's called, uh, from Kid Koala. Skanky.
Pankey. I get it. It takes a lot of skill,

1824
01:54:34,191 --> 01:54:39,140
but I don't ever want to listen to
it again. Um, oh. And then somebody,

1825
01:54:39,141 --> 01:54:43,790
a few, about a month ago I talked
about drop d tuning, how that was a,

1826
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,050
that's how you make the devil.

1827
01:54:45,051 --> 01:54:48,950
Your bitch is you write a song and drop
d tuning and I've never heard a song

1828
01:54:48,951 --> 01:54:51,470
that did that,
that sounded bad and drop d tuning.

1829
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:54,290
So he sent me another video
of a great song and drop d,

1830
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:58,070
which is a nirvana negative creep.
I guess it's in that. I didn't,

1831
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:01,930
I didn't fucking look. Let's get to
overrated. Underrated. All right,

1832
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:06,590
this fucking podcast. What the Hell is
going on here? What are we up to here?

1833
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:10,910
Hour and six minutes. Jesus, let's
wrap this up. Let's go real quick here.

1834
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,470
Underrated local bands there.

1835
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:16,520
Always way more talented than actually
and actually write and play their own

1836
01:55:16,521 --> 01:55:20,330
music that should be heard instead
of all the popular lady Gaga,

1837
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:23,960
Beyonce bullshit. Go out to a bar
and enjoy the live music. I agree.

1838
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:27,470
Overrated horoscopes,
whore a scopes.

1839
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:32,000
Why do people think that some asshole
interprets the planets and stars and stars

1840
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:35,390
position is a good flow
influence on their lives.

1841
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:39,680
You could literally say whatever you
want is a justification for your actions.

1842
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:44,790
I'm not as slot. I'm a Scorpio and
Venus is aligned with the Milky Way.

1843
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,650
No, you're a slut because you fuck a
lot of people. All right. Stop blaming.

1844
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:53,070
The heaven should count.
Um, all the people, um,

1845
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,370
who freaked out because they thought
their horoscope was different due to the

1846
01:55:56,371 --> 01:55:59,010
new 13th sign can shut the fuck up.

1847
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:02,940
If you read further than one paragraph,
you discover your sign is different.

1848
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:06,570
If you were born when they announced it.
Um,

1849
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:09,520
I don't even know what the fuck that
means. I know recently that they, uh,

1850
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:12,420
somebody tried to say that everybody
signed was wrong and I guess people freak

1851
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:17,070
the fuck out. Um, oh,
here's another racist one.

1852
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:20,310
God Damn, I was to read this next week.
Everybody chimed in on that topic.

1853
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:24,510
Do you guys have time to listen to me?
Give somebody some of my bad advice? Well,

1854
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:26,820
of course you do. If you doubt,
just shut the fucking thing off.

1855
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:31,620
I'm not holding you hostage.
Um, let's see here. Bill.

1856
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,550
Uh Oh, this guy says
[inaudible] love the podcast.

1857
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:38,730
You're always answering questions, giving
out relationship advice about, you know,

1858
01:56:38,731 --> 01:56:39,610
between men and women.

1859
01:56:39,611 --> 01:56:44,250
So I figured I'd switch it up here and
actually asked for your advice about a

1860
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:45,420
band situation.

1861
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:50,280
I'm pretty drunk so I apologize in
advance if my punctuation is incorrect.

1862
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:54,180
I joined an established band on base
about three months ago and spent the first

1863
01:56:54,181 --> 01:56:58,590
couple of weeks busting my hump learning
tunes to open for a semi well known

1864
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:03,720
nation, nay national touring band.
Since then, I burned about three dozen,

1865
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,870
so I've learned about three dozen
songs in gigged once or twice a week.

1866
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:12,050
Some of them were high profile shows
opening for some semi famous bands in

1867
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:16,740
theaters, seeding a thousand to 1200
people. It's been a good steady work,

1868
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:21,060
but I should known that there was a catch
after the fifth gig. I finally said,

1869
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,620
do what the fuck's up with the money?

1870
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:27,840
Ask The bandleader and he said that all
the money goes into a band fund to pay

1871
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:29,910
for a recording of a CD.

1872
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:34,530
I never agreed to that when I joined
the band. So I was like, what the fuck?

1873
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:39,660
I asked what happens if I quit the band
before we record the CD? And he said,

1874
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:44,220
all the money goes to recording whether
or whether or not I'm in on it or not.

1875
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,450
Naturally, I got pissed. Yeah, Dude. What
the fuck? After a big balls out fight,

1876
01:57:48,451 --> 01:57:51,210
he finally offered to
pay me 35 bucks per gig.

1877
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,700
Nobody has it harder than musicians
other than fucking strippers or whores,

1878
01:57:57,390 --> 01:58:02,310
prostitutes, sweatshop labor.
All right. Whatever. It's
still fucking rough gig. Uh,

1879
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:05,940
we usually get paid between 400
to 600 bucks. So I said, no,

1880
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,240
I should get paid in equal one
fifth of whatever the band makes.

1881
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:13,140
I'll see you guys get 400,
six to 600 bucks a night. Yes,

1882
01:58:13,141 --> 01:58:16,620
you should get like a hundred
bucks a cell. Right? And
he's trying to give you 35.

1883
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:22,440
I like this guy standing his
ground. Um, but this shit bird says,

1884
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:25,560
since I haven't been in the band as long,
I don't deserve an equal share.

1885
01:58:25,561 --> 01:58:27,600
Basically they want to
treat me like a hired gun,

1886
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,040
but don't want to pay me fairly.

1887
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:33,240
Plus I come to find out the old bass
player quit in a huff with gigs on the

1888
01:58:33,241 --> 01:58:37,440
books because they were fucking of Oh
fuck. Fucking them all over on money too.

1889
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:39,900
I've been a professional,
reliable.

1890
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:42,610
I learned all the fucking songs
they showed up at Ben on time.

1891
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,820
And on top of all that, they're asking
me to designed posters, stickers,

1892
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:48,580
a press kit and go out and book more gigs.

1893
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:53,790
I feel like I'm being taken
advantage of all the, um,

1894
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:57,370
what, what do I give a fuck if we record
a CD? None of these songs are mine.

1895
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:59,320
All I have invested in it is my time.

1896
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:04,750
It's good steady work and play pays,
sorry.

1897
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:07,270
It's good to get steady
work and played big gigs,

1898
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:09,790
but we're not playing
too faggy chick music.

1899
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,930
So it's not like I'm even getting laid
out on the gigs and there's always a

1900
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:17,020
shortage of bass players in the world.
So I can have a couple of the bands.

1901
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,880
I've got a couple of other
bands nipping at my heels,

1902
01:59:18,881 --> 01:59:22,500
but none of them are as high profile.
You don't dump your girlfriends.

1903
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:24,580
He got another broad to bang on the side.

1904
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:28,900
So I feel like I should keep playing
with these twats to gain a reputation and

1905
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:32,860
then quit as soon as something better
comes along. So what do you think? Uh,

1906
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,920
I think you're absolutely right.
All right. Two things. One,

1907
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:39,520
never go into another situation unless
you've hammered out how the fuck you're

1908
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:43,240
getting paid. Don't just be like,
yeah, I'll do it. Good. You're hired.

1909
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:47,350
You got immediately talk about pay
because then after four or five gigs,

1910
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,750
you're already in, you're
committed, you've got time invested,

1911
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:53,050
and now they've got you by the Bulls.
So don't do that again.

1912
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,390
And as far as advice with the band,

1913
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:58,120
I would just do exactly
what they're doing.

1914
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,910
They're doing what's best
for them in fuck you.

1915
02:00:00,911 --> 02:00:04,330
So do what's best for you and fuck them.
All right.

1916
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:08,740
If staying in that band is going to
help you in the future by being on those

1917
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:12,340
high profile gigs that I'd stay in the
band and when something better comes

1918
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:15,790
along. See Ya. Right. But, uh,

1919
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:19,120
if getting the fuck out and that some
of these bands that want to fucking play

1920
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:22,540
with you actually seem like they're
going to go somewhere, you know,

1921
02:00:22,541 --> 02:00:26,590
you might want to do that
instead, but it's up to you.
But like I said, choose, go,

1922
02:00:26,591 --> 02:00:30,910
go church of Satan there. Do what's good
for you. Don't be a martyr like that. Uh,

1923
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:34,540
like that long haired dude there. All
right, that's the podcast for this week.

1924
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:35,800
Thanks everybody chime in.

1925
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:38,830
I apologize if this one was a
little bit scattered brained. I uh,

1926
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:44,230
I'm really feeling this fucking God damn
head cold coming on. So, uh, that's it.

1927
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:47,680
Have a good week and that's it. Uh,
who do you like in the Superbowl?

1928
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:50,530
Wait a minute. This always happens
to me all. He's got to wrap it up.

1929
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:53,860
Who are you like in the Superbowl? You
want a prediction? I, this is what I say.

1930
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:57,640
Take the Steelers in the over. All right.
Because I think in general people are,

1931
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:00,640
people gonna think the packers
are going to win. You know,

1932
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,790
I haven't watched any
ESPN for some reason.

1933
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:05,740
I think the PR people think
the packers are going to win.

1934
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,820
Whoever the fuck they say is going to
win better on the other team and bet the

1935
02:01:09,821 --> 02:01:12,010
over. Because I think that they're
gonna think that, you know,

1936
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:15,550
because of the defenses, if
it's going to be this, you know,

1937
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:20,080
all schools smash mouth football type.
No. Like those you, oh, I put ball.

1938
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:21,100
I think they're going to,
it's going to,

1939
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:24,250
everybody thinks it's going to be that
and it always goes to the other fucking

1940
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:27,490
way. So, uh, that's it. Um,

1941
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:32,260
that is the podcast for this week. Uh,
good luck to both teams in the super bowl.

1942
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:32,930
You know, they, they,

1943
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:36,280
I was in Dallas and actually said some
guy went on TV and said that they were

1944
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:39,530
10,000 strippers short.
You know

1945
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:44,280
what a sad state of affairs,
10,000 strippers, short game.

1946
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:47,270
You believe people still go to
titty bars unless you go into one.

1947
02:01:47,271 --> 02:01:50,000
We can actually get one rubbed out.
What is the fucking point?

1948
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:52,160
You know what I mean?
Then what do you do?

1949
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:55,460
Do you go to an ice cream parlor and
having fucking put ice cream on a spoon?

1950
02:01:55,461 --> 02:01:57,240
You open your mouth.
They put it in your mouth.

1951
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:59,600
Then right as you go to clamp down,
they pull it back out again.

1952
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:03,170
Is that what the fuck you do?
Overrated titty bars.

1953
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:09,490
There's no fucking reason to go to him.
You just get frustrated.

1954
02:02:09,491 --> 02:02:11,830
Then he'd get drunk and then
the end is some sort of fight,

1955
02:02:12,190 --> 02:02:14,920
and then that guy from the titans
comes in and somebody gets shot,

1956
02:02:14,921 --> 02:02:18,490
and then he just says, I didn't do it.
And then he plays for like the Falcons,

1957
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:23,840
right? Isn't that how it went
down? I don't fucking know. Uh,

1958
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,390
all right.
You know what?

1959
02:02:25,391 --> 02:02:27,490
Why don't I go fuck myself so
I could end this fucking thing?

1960
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:28,463
All right.

1961
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,413
[inaudible]

1962
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:14,250
[inaudible].
