Hey guys welcome back. I'm Nate

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.080
And thank you for joining us today on The King Of Random. A bullwhip is a staple tool of cowboys and movie action stars alike.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.319
Most bull whips are made from kangaroo leather and are carefully braided. They can take quite a while to make and cost quite a bit of money.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.299
The purpose of today's video is to learn how to make a bullwhip yourself in a lot less time and for a way lower cost.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.830
Here's the materials

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.830
we'll need to make our bullwhip. A piece of 3/4 inch PVC a piece of 1-inch PVC, some paracord, some bb's,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.029
Athletic tape, electrical tape, and a drill bit. With all the materials assembled,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.580
let's start by making our handle.The first step is to cut your 3/4 inch PVC the length that you want your handle.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm going to cut mine to be 9 inches long. We also want a 1 inch long piece of our 1 inch PVC.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.300
With the two pieces cut, press the small piece all the way onto the longer piece.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.589
Now that we have our basic handle assembled, it's time to start measuring and cutting our paracord.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.430
Our goal today is to make an 8-foot bullwhip.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.109
So we're gonna take a length of paracord.Run it through the handle and measure it so that it's 8 feet in front of the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.109
handle and about 2 feet behind.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
Four feet.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.020
Four feet.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460
Four feet again.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.740
We now have one length of paracord.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.150
That's between 10 and 11 feet long. With the paracord will now measure off nine more pieces of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.129
diminishing lengths so that our bullwhip will be tapered from the handle to the thinnest part at the end of the whip.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.610
I'll use a piece of electrical tape to mark off where the bottom of the handle is on our first piece of paracord

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.440
the first piece of paracord we cut will run the entire length of the whip and the last 18 inches of it will be what's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.740
Called the fall of the whip this is a very thin part that helps give it that distinctive crack that whips are known for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.410
Another piece of electrical tape measures the beginning of the fall our second piece of paracord should run the length from the first tape mark to

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.410
the second

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.979
For the remaining pieces of paracord we need to cut let's take off eight inches of length for each cord for example the second cord

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.869
We cut was just over seven feet long

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.489
We'll take ake that measurement and take off eight inches from it and that will be the size of the next piece of paracord

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
I now have all ten pieces of my paracord cut out in diminishing lengths

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.530
Don't be too worried about having it be

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.000
Exactly eight inches shorter every time if you're off by an inch or two here or there

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.950
It's not really gonna make a difference now

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.729
We do need to cut three more pieces of paracord traditional bull whips are made from leather often kangaroo leather because it's the strongest kind

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.179
However leather is a lot more dense and heavy than

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.110
Paracord so what we need to do is add something that gives our bullwhip a lot more weight

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.640
Let's cut three more lengths of our paracord matching lengths to three of our existing pieces

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.669
I'm going to cut one length that matches our third longest piece

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.059
Then come in three pieces and match that one and then come in three more pieces and match that one

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.569
With each of those three matching pieces of paracord that we just cut what we want to do is pull out the internal

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.359
Strands from the paracord completely the strings that were on the inside of the paracord are garbage for this project you can throw it away

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.729
With the internal strands removed we want to seal off one end of each of our cords with paracord the best way to do that

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.120
Is to melt them closed?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.579
Now what we're going to do with these three strands is fill them entirely with bb's this will give some good

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.418
Flexible weight to our whip to make it easier to fit the bb's into our paracord

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.869
I'm going to use the back of this drill bit to open up the unmelted end of our paracord

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.099
You need to make sure that you're using a drill bit a little bit larger than the diameter of a BB

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.489
I'm using a

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.499
3/16 inch drill bit fit the shaft of the drill bit into the opening of the paracord

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.639
Now to make this permanent

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.959
We're going to melt the end of the paracord while it's on the drill bit and then once it's cooled. We'll pull it off

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.399
With our three lengths of empty paracord fused on one end and melted open on the other end

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400
It's time to start filling them with bb's

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.209
With the mouth of the paracord melted open the bb's easily drop in you then need to force the bb's usually one at a time

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.670
From the mouth all the way back to the tail end

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.719
It can be fairly time-consuming filling up all three of these strands with bb's, but have some patience and keep at it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.720
And it'll be full before you know it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.079
With the first one done now you fill the other two of the same way

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.290
There you go all three strands filled completely with BB's these things have a really good weight to them

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.670
But they are still extremely flexible now. Let's just melt the ends so that the bb's can't fall out

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.860
Gather up the ends of your 12 shorter pieces and line them up with the tape mark on the first piece that you cut using

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.249
Electrical tape tightly secure all 13 strands of paracord together

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.260
Now starting about

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.379
3/4 of an inch away from the end of your handle drill a hole using the same drill bit you used on the paracord

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.520
We now want to take the extra piece of

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.979
Paracord from the first piece that we cut pass it down through the handle and then through the hole

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.309
We just drilled you might find it helpful to melt the end of the paracord

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.900
Pull that strand tight until it pulls the rest of the cords down into the handle with it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.519
Take the remaining end and wrap it around the bottom of your handle as tight as you can

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.069
Run the excess cord back inside the handle and use a piece of electrical tape to hold it in place

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.900
Quick update we have now cut several lengths of paracord to make our whip the longest one will extend about 8 feet beyond the end

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.119
of the handle and there are nine more pieces of

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.720
Diminishing lengths getting smaller and smaller to give our whip a nice taper

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.849
We then added three more lengths of paracord

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.230
Which we took the insides out and filled them up with bb's sealing off both ends by melting them

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.319
We've bundled all the different strands of paracord together tape them at the end and fit them inside the handle at this point the only

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.099
Step left is to use our electrical tape and our athletic tape to bind the whole thing together

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.240
Let's start by securing all of the different pieces of paracord at the top of the handle

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.789
As you can see I am not skimping out with the electrical tape

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.010
I'm making sure that there is a lot of connection between the handle and the strands of paracord now

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.140
I'll take some electrical tape and about every foot and a half

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.719
I'll wrap tightly around all of the strands of paracord this will help them prevent getting twisted when we apply our athletic tape

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.430
With our strands now attached to our handle

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.919
Let's take the athletic tape and starting at the base of the handle wrap it around all the way until we reach the fall of

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.799
The whip athletic tape is great for this because it's made of cloth

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.859
And it's very thin so it's extremely flexible and it's not so sticky that when you're using the whip the sticky bits will grip to

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.860
Each other and get all gummed up

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.970
It's important to try and keep your

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:28.079
Strands all pulled tight and parallel as you wrap them with tape you don't want them to be twisting or you could have trouble using

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.080
your whip later

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.979
There you have it now that the whip is all wrapped up in the athletic tape it is finished and ready to use but first

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200
Let's decorate it

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.870
Tape and rubber gloves do not really mix very well

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.610
There we have it our whip is complete and decorated, so now let's go test it out all right

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.470
Let's try out the whip for precaution

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.570
I am wearing a long sleeve jacket, and I'll be using my glasses as well the first thing. I'm going to try is something

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.570
That's called the Cattleman's crack

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.300
That worked very well that was a good crack, let's try that again. I'm gonna face a little bit more toward the camera

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:40.949
Boom that's awesome alright, I've got another one gonna try this is called the overhead crack

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.780
That went I love it that one just looks so stylish doing it I think I

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.590
Hope I look good. Maybe I look like a dork and now I'm gonna try something

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.220
I don't know the name of this

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.029
But I kind of just discovered that it works while experimenting with a whip and so I'm gonna try this too.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.950
I like that one. I like all of them

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.049
They're fun for just a second

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.750
Let's talk about what is happening here when I whip the whip in those special ways it gets a bit of a curl in it

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.750
And when that happens it starts moving faster

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.290
And faster and faster as it gets down to the end and then this part which is called the fall

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.330
Ends up rotating in a circle so fast that it breaks the sound barrier

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.640
so the crack of a whip is actually a sonic boom when this thing goes as much as

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.310
750 miles an hour

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:38.729
That's amazing it is believed that a whip is the first man-made object to ever break the sound barrier

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.130
Let's try this a couple more times

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.780
Now one thing left I want to try is I want to see what happens if this whip starts hitting some stuff

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.919
I'm gonna do some tests trying to whip a sheet of styrofoam to see what the effect is

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.030
I'm gonna start off pretty gentle to try and get a hang of aiming at the styrofoam

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.760
Okay that hit it

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.989
It might be hard to see but that actually put a dent in the styrofoam already try hitting a little harder, ooh

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.120
That is a significant dent right there big old line drawn right into the styrofoam

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.320
I'll see if I can really add some power and get it to crack and hit the board oh

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.299
That hit it took a chunk out of it there you go this styrofoam does have a

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.000
protective plastic layer kind of holding it all together and

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.859
So it might be even more impressive that it's been able to market this much, but that took a chunk right out of the top

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.680
That's exciting

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:47.969
Holy cow that one was like extra loud for some reason that made my ears ring

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:56.099
Wow and look at the market left this is nuts. I'm just gonna see if I can take out a small bit of branch

00:10:56.829 --> 00:11:01.739
Using the whip try and hit in that area can't aim well enough to be more precise than that

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.029
Ha nailed it

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:08.699
Bull's eye sniff it clean off

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.219
there you go that is how you can take paracord PVC some bb's and a little bit of tape and make yourself a

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.469
functioning bullwhip this thing is quite fun and

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.269
surprisingly easy to get it to crack it didn't take much practice before I could get it to crack every time a

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.890
Special shout-out to our friend Garrett who suggested and showed us how to make this kind of whip Thank You Garrett

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.260
Remember if you do make this whip always use

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:35.009
Precautions wear long sleeves wear protective eye gear and make sure there's no one else around you that you could possibly hurt or anything that

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.390
You could destroy thanks for joining us for this project and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.390
Leave splosions

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.640
Hey guys. I hope you're feeling happy today

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.279
I know I am because you're keeping this channel alive and well we really appreciate your support because we could not be doing this without
