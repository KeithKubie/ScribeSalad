00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.900
All right, pop quiz, Andy, where's that going to be?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.164
&gt;&gt; I'm going to click Related Lists over here

00:00:05.164 --> 00:00:09.950
and then drag down Open Activities and Activity History.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; Just for good measure, I mean, once you close tasks it'll start showing up

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.350
in the Activity History instead of Open

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.560
Activities, so good to have it all there.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.080
&gt;&gt; Sure. Now I'm going to Save and not forget

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.870
to Save. Cool, and there's our new maintenance ticket.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.976
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Assigned to you.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:24.339
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; Due today.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.070
Not started yet.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.430
&gt;&gt; So if I were a user and I wanted to find my tickets, how would I do that?

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see all your open tasks straight from the home tab.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.582
&gt;&gt; Okay, so home.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:36.750
&gt;&gt; So, at the bottom of the home

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170
tab, there's this calendar, and it talks about

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.200
all of the events or meetings that could

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.470
be coming up. Right there. There's your open task.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.940
&gt;&gt; Very cool. Okay, and if I, oh, I don't even need to, to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.800
click on it. I hover and it tells me the subject, the due date, priority

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.410
and that kind of stuff.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can even mark it as complete right there.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.412
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool, but I won't, because I haven't yet.

00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:56.484
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
