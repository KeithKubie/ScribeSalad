†CCUS 21 - The Civil War Part 2
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.529
U.S. history and today we return to...wait,
what are we talking about today, Stan?

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.229
Ah, the Civil War!

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:07.920
I can tell because Lincoln’s here.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.010
But this week we’re not gonna talk about
casualty counts or battles or its generals

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.660
with their heroic and probably fictional dying
declarations.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.119
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, wait did that one guy
not really say “Honeybun how do I look in

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.339
the face?” because that was the best part
of this whole class.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.289
Jeb Stewart did say that, Me from the Past,
but it probably wasn’t his last words, but

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.270
anyway today we’re going to try to focus
on what’s really important.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.739
In the end the really vital stuff isn’t,
like, Pickett’s Charge or Lee saying “It

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.000
is well that war is so terrible - otherwise
we would grow too fond of it” or the surrender

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.600
at the Appomattox Court House.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.470
That stuff matters and I don’t want to deny
it, but the Civil War and the way we remember

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.359
it is still shaping the world today, and that’s
what I want to focus on, because it’s the

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.010
stuff that might actually change the way you
think about your own life in your own country,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.480
whether it’s the United States or the Green
Parts of Not America.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.590
intro
So let’s start with one of the big questions

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.000
historians still ask about the Civil War:
Did Lincoln free the slaves?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.189
The answer, as with so much here on Crashcourse
is yes … and also no.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.990
Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble
today.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.060
So Lincoln’s reputation as the Great Emancipator
rests largely on his Emancipation Proclamation,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.670
an executive order which went into effect
on January 1, 1863.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.770
This order ostensibly freed all the slaves
in territory currently rebelling against the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.700
United States, i.e. in areas where the U.S.
government had no authority to free slaves.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.500
This is rather like the United States announcing
that from here on out, North Korea will be

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.700
ruled by Lady Gaga.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.049
Sure, it’s a great idea, but it’s not
really your jurisdiction.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.860
In areas where the U.S. did have the authority
to free slaves, the border states and some

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.799
of the areas of the Confederacy that had been
effectively conquered and occupied by federal

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.189
troops, those slaves were NOT freed.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.259
So Lincoln didn’t free the slaves that he
actually had the power to free.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.240
Many historians argue that, in fact, slaves
freed themselves.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
How?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.799
By running away to union lines and becoming
“contrabands.”

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.729
Because this was a time of war and slaves
were seen as a valuable resource to the enemy,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.970
when they escaped and sought refuge with Union
troops, Union commanders wouldn’t give them

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.790
back, despite fugitive slave laws still being
on the books.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.569
So many slaves escaped, the argument goes,
that Lincoln was basically forced to issue

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.290
the Emancipation Proclamation, because until
he did so, those contraband slaves were still

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.709
technically property of their Southern masters,
and the Union generals were breaking American

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.280
laws by not returning them.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.010
The Emancipation Proclamation then had the
added bonus of encouraging more slaves to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.590
come over to the Union lines, many of whom
joined the army, which eventually included

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.120
about 180,000 former slaves and free black
men.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.209
So Lincoln may also have issued the proclamation
in order to shift the focus of the war from

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.959
union to slavery to prevent the British from
recognizing the Confederacy.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.760
Arguably the Confederacy’s best chance to
win the Civil War was to get some kind of

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.810
foreign patron, and Britain was the likeliest
choice as it was very dependent on Confederate

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.810
textiles.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.909
But as you’ll remember from all those people
going to Canada, Britain had already abolished

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.810
slavery and it was the historic source of
abolitionist sentiment, and so it was very

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.780
shrewd of Lincoln to make the war about slavery.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.590
Off-topic, but if I may put on my world historian
hat for a moment.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.590
Thank you, Stan.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.519
The fact that the British did not recognize
the South had profound effects on the whole

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.870
world, because it meant that the British shifted
their focus to Egypt and India as sources

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.620
of cotton for their textile mills.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.319
All that noted, I think Lincoln does deserve
some credit for freeing the slaves for two

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.319
reasons.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.310
First, he pushed for the Thirteenth amendment
which actually ended slavery in the United

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.310
States.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.810
And perhaps more importantly, he continued
the war to its conclusion and demanded that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.159
the end of slavery and the return of the Southern
states to the Union be conditions for peace.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.340
This may seem obvious today, but in 1864 it
wasn’t.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.580
In fact, there were numerous calls in the
North for an end to the war that would allow

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.720
the South to exist as a separate country and
leave slavery intact.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.989
Now, of course, the rest of world history
indicates that at some point slavery would

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.799
have ended, but by prosecuting the war to
its end, Lincoln brought about slavery’s

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.799
end sooner.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.500
But the Civil War didn’t just end slavery.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.600
If it had gone differently, Me from the Past
might have been annoying teachers in a different

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.770
country from the one in which I now live.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.970
I might’ve need a passport to visit my parents
in North Carolina and slavery might have survived

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.629
for decades--Brazil didn’t fully abolish
slavery until 1888.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.420
And the south would be covered in green as
part of Not-America.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.230
Or, the north, depending on where you’re
watching this video, I guess.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.360
And, the people who lived through the Civil
War knew it was momentous.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.580
In his famous Gettysburg Address, Abraham
Lincoln fostered the idea that the Civil War

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.280
was a kind of second American Revolution,
or at least a culmination and reaffirmation

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280
of the first one.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.210
“From these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they gave

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.600
the last full measure of devotion--that we
here highly resolve that these dead shall

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.710
not have died in vain—that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.590
that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.590
earth.”

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.360
We tried to hire Daniel Day-Lewis for that,
but he was unavailable.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.280
That phrase “new birth” of freedom had
religious significance as well because it

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.720
was, like, the 19th century equivalent to
“born again.”

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.250
So, the Civil War was the first modern war
in terms of its scale and its destruction.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.560
Like, others have waged war on civilians to
break the spirit of their enemies (STAN!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.290
Mongoltage OPPORTUNITY!)
mongoltage

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.430
But new technologies made this one of the
most destructive wars yet recorded.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.980
And, yes, I know the Taiping rebellion took
more lives, and in terms of percentage of

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.840
population killed, the contemporaneous war
in Paraguay was worse, but bear with me.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.530
Rifles, and toward the end of the Civil War,
machine guns shifted the way that people fight.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.570
It became easier to defend a line, so cavalry
charges and huge waves of attacks started

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.740
to be just slaughtery although it would take
World War I for the rest of the world to figure

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.740
that out.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.590
And the incredible numbers of dead and wounded
really changed Americans’ relationship with

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.590
death itself.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.940
Like, the Gettysburg address was given to
dedicate a new national cemetery, and the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.910
Civil War helped to create a culture of meditation
on mortality itself that led to cemeteries

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.180
replacing churchyards as the final resting
places for most Americans.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.690
And the sight of slaughter and the sheer weight
of it had profound existential effects on

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.720
a generation of American intellectuals from
Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.900
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.850
The rules here are simple.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.910
I guess the Mystery Document and usually I
am shocked.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.750
Oh my gosh, today’s Mystery Document is
on an iPad!

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.400
This appears to be a photograph of wounded
soldiers in hospital.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.710
I’m gonna go ahead and call it as being
by Mathew Brady.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.710
What?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.710
I already got it?

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.870
But I didn’t get to say the name...

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.560
Oh, it’s called Wounded Soldiers in Hospital.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.890
Thank you for an easy one, Stan.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.400
So, Mathew Brady was a prolific photographer
during the Civil War, although, like a lot

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.730
of prolific people, he often took credit for
work done by his employees.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.880
And Brady really changed the way that people
thought about war.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.360
He and his staff created some 10,000 images
during the Civil War.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.660
And it was the first time that an event had
been photographically documented so thoroughly.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.970
By the way, lest you think that the unreliability
of images began with Photoshop, many of Brady’s

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.970
photographs were staged.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.500
He would move bodies, sometimes soldiers were
apparently told to act dead.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.160
But of course, at the time, photographs felt
inherently authentic and written accounts

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.020
of battles could now be accompanied by actual
images of the fighting and its aftermath.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.400
But, perhaps the most important impact of
the Civil War was the new nation that it created.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.800
Like, the American Civil War fits right in
with the global phenomenon of nation-building

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
that was happening.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.040
Soon we would have places on the map like
Italy and Germany, and older places like Greece

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.220
would be re-born as nation states.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.700
And then all of these places would be known
to Americans as Not-America.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.570
But, by the way, congratulations to Italy
on the recent election of their 732nd Prime

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.920
Minister in just 180 years of existing.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.090
By far, the most successful of these new nation
states were the ones that embraced industrialization

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.360
and modern ideas of organization and centralized
government.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.720
Northern victory in the Civil War meant the
United States would follow the path that the

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.990
North laid down.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.630
It would become an industrial rather than
agrarian nation, with a national government

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.770
pre-eminent over those of individual states.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.360
It would become a nation.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.460
And its not a coincidence that over the course
of the 19th century, people stopped pluralizing

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.680
the United States; they stopped saying, “The
United States are a great place to live,”

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.070
and began saying, “The United States is
a great place to live.”

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.100
The Civil War helped singularize what had
been until then a plural nation.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.220
And Abraham Lincoln was the first president
to truly expand the power of the executive.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.360
He ordered blockades and suspended habeas
corpus, in addition to emancipating the slaves.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.210
But the Republican dominated congress played
a role in this federalization too.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.170
Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862
that encouraged settlement of the west by

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.070
basically giving away land to anyone who had
$18 and was willing to live on it and farm

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.070
it for five years.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.070
Downside: you have to live in Oklahoma.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.070
Unless of course you’re an American Indian
in which case, downside: you don’t get to

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.070
live in Oklahoma anymore.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.070
You may be wondering, how were we able to
sell all of this land so cheap?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.070
It’s because we stole it!

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.070
Meanwhile, the Morrill Land Grant Act financed
colleges to offer training in new scientific

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.070
agricultural techniques.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.080
The Department of Agriculture was created
to generate statistics and share best practices

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080
in farming.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.090
Congress also helped unify the country with
the massive land grants in the Pacific Railway

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.450
Act of 1862.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.360
And during the war the Lincoln administration
gave away 158 million acres to railroads to

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360
tie the nation together.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.970
Get it?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.270
Tie?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.270
Railroad ties?

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.270
The nation toge-?

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.270
I’ll take my coat and go.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.350
Plus, as you may have noticed, wars are expensive.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.410
And in order to finance the Civil War, Congress
passed the first progressive income tax in

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.520
American history, as well as floating huge
bond issues to the public.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.420
And when that wasn’t enough, the administration
began printing federal money on green paper

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.530
called “greenbacks.”

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.280
These, along with notes issued by banks under
the National Bank Act of 1863 became the first

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.180
national currency in the United States.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.150
Altogether, the total cost of the war for
the Union was $6.7 billion.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.840
Interestingly, if in 1860 the federal government
had purchased every slave and granted a 40-acre

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.030
farm to each family, the total cost would
have been $3.1 billion.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.960
But a) it would have been hard to get that
bill through Congress, and b) at the time

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.590
the federal government had no way to raise
that kind of money.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.440
The federal government also actively promoted
the industrial economy that was to become

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.510
dominant in the United States after the war.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.110
In fact, industrialization was so healthy
that visitors to cities in the North during

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.990
the Civil War would have been hard pressed
to notice that they were even in a war.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.900
So, ultimately, the Civil War was a victory
for Alexander Hamilton’s federalist vision

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.120
of what America should be.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.490
I mean, Thomas Jefferson could never have
imagined the United States that emerged from

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:04.730
the Civil War, a government that supported
an army of a million men, carried a $2.5 billion

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.920
national debt, distributed public lands, printed
a national currency, and collected an array

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.960
of internal taxes.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.960
It sounds like Britain!

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.330
So, the Civil War wasn’t just a victory
of North over South or of freedom over slavery.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.490
It created the nation that the United States
of America has become.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.490
Thanks for watching.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.490
I’ll see you next week.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.141
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:26.060
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.060
Too far!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.620
Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.550
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.220
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.330
Every week, there’s a new caption for the
Libertage.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.340
You can suggest some in comments where you
can also ask questions about today’s video

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.460
that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.100
Thank you for watching and as we say in my
hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.600
