00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Now it's time for you to meet our second computer scientist Bob.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.310
Bob is working in biotechnology or bioinformatics

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.650
and the problem that Bob is working on is he's doing gene analysis.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.890
He is looking at bunch of different genes such as this one here.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.690
Bob is basically trying to figure out how genes work together.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.700
Which groups of genes get activated, say when a cell develops a disease

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.620
or when it's infected as oppose to the healthy cell.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.850
Bob will receive data from a laboratory that will tell him which genes work together

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.630
or which get activated under a certain condition and which genes don't.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.690
For example these two genes here will get activated more or less under the same conditions.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.390
Also these two here, but these two here they appear to be

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.210
kind of independent in laboratory research.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.850
Of course Bob does not only receive data on two genes but on a number of genes.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.170
And of course there are many more interactions so say group

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.930
of genes that tends to work together quite a lot.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.990
And so since Bob is trying to figure out which groups of genes work together,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.030
what he is basically looking for is a collection of genes that are all connected to each other.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.780
I'll just give you one example. This here. These three genes are all connected to each other.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.250
This is kind of the type of group that he is looking for.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.709
What he would not be looking for is for example something like this. These four genes here.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.390
Most of them are connected to each other

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.350
but not every single one of them is connected to every other.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.230
This gene here is not connected to that one.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.530
And the reason why he is looking for these clusters of genes is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
that when you find a group of genes where each gene displays a very similar behavior

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.110
to every other gene, then you have a kind of functional cluster so a large set of genes

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.450
that can be assumed to be involved in the same processes and you can then use this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.780
for drug targeting or figuring more out about the disease.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.170
This problem is a bit of a simplification of what you might

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.820
encounter in the real biotechnology setting.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.040
For example you'd normally be content with these four genes here that are not all fully connected

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.054
but looking for genes where every gene is connected to every other one

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:22.620
is a bit more convenient to work with and actually it doesn't really make much of a difference

00:02:22.620 --> 99:59:59.000
from an algorithmic perspective so let's say it's realistic enough.
