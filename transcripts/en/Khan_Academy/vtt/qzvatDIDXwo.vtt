00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
- [Tutor] Let's talk about one
of the most fundamental ideas

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.470
in science and that is
the notion of energy

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.010
and energy definitely has some
meaning in our everyday life,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.072
if we kind of imagine
things that are moving

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:15.409
or hot or bright as being energetic,

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.420
but what I wanna talk about in this video

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.130
is a more formal definition of it,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.840
a more scientific definition
and the most typical one,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.930
that's often given is
the ability to do work,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.500
ability to do and I'm
gonna put work in quotes,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.100
because the notion of work here

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.600
isn't the everyday notion of
work, where you go to your job

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.140
and you work nine to
five and you get paid,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.760
work in a physics context is a little bit,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.030
it's not completely unrelated

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.600
to our everyday notion of work,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.860
but I'll give you an example

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.930
just to get a better idea of it,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.950
so let's say that you
have some object here

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.065
and you were to apply a force,

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.853
you were to apply a
force in that direction

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.600
and the magnitude of that
force, let's say it's 10 newtons

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.170
and if the units, newtons in force

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.518
isn't too familiar to
you, don't worry too much,

00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:04.905
but you can also review it on
those videos on Khan Academy,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:08.160
but you apply a force to
the right on this object

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.040
and by doing that you're
able to move the object,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740
you're able to displace the object

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.547
in the same direction as that force,

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:18.370
so you're able to displace
it, let's say 10 meters,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.380
so after you've done it, the object,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.330
the object is right over here,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.010
so when you do this, you apply a force

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.241
and it's causing the
object to be displaced

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.106
in the direction of that force,

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:33.186
you would say that work has been performed

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.410
and the amount of work
that has been performed

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.430
would be 10 newtons times 10 meters

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.803
and so 10 times 10, it
would be equal to 100

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:45.480
and then the units are
newton meters of work,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.844
100 newton meters,

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:50.730
'cause you're multiplying
newtons times meters

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.110
of newton meters of
work and newton meters,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.450
that has been defined as the joule,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.090
which is the unit of work
and also the unit of energy,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.839
so this is the same thing as 100,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:07.430
I could write it out as joules, 100 joules

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.720
or we could just abbreviate it with a J,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.690
so 100 joules of work
has been performed here

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.832
by moving this, so we've
done something here

00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:20.080
and this is considered to
be work, 100 joules of work,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.518
if we move this twice as far,

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:24.540
then it would be 200 joules of work

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.540
and so energy is the ability
to do this type of work.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.812
Now let's look at these pictures here,

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.615
which are depicting
different forms of energy

00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:35.960
and let's see if we can
identify the forms of energy

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.900
and then think about how they can relate

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600
to actually doing work.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.974
So if we look at the fire here,

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:44.470
there's some maybe
obvious forms of energy,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.193
we have some thermal energy,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.691
fires are definitely
hot, so thermal energy,

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:51.860
but we should think about

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.750
what is thermal energy fundamentally?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.040
A system's temperature is really about

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.600
the average kinetic
energy of its molecules,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.450
so thermal energy is really
about the energy of movement,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.910
it's really about all these
little molecules here,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.418
because of the combustion
reaction going on,

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:09.393
they're getting excited and
they have higher kinetic energy

00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:11.850
and so the temperature goes up,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.660
their average kinetic energy goes up,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.740
so thermal energy is really a
form of energy due to movement

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.510
and the general term for
energy due to movement

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.830
is kinetic energy, so thermal
energy is really a form

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.003
of kinetic, kinetic,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.500
kinetic energy.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.510
You also have light being emitted,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.810
that has energy as well, we
call that radiant energy,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.550
so that light being emitted,
that's the reason why

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.550
we can see this fire,
radiant, radiant energy.

00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:42.837
Now you might say,

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:44.930
"Okay, maybe that's all of
the energy in the system,"

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.920
but I'll say no, there's
another form of energy

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.160
and actually even in this picture,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.370
that's probably where
most of the energy is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.930
and that's potential energy,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.930
so where is the potential energy?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.443
Well, it's sitting in the
bonds of the fuel over here,

00:03:57.443 --> 00:04:01.370
so these are either chips of
wood or charcoal of some kind,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.196
but these are formed
by carbon-carbon bonds,

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.263
so you have these carbon-carbon bonds

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:08.540
and they could be bonded to other carbons

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.210
or other things and they're
also going to be bound

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.145
to some hydrogens here and there,

00:04:15.145 --> 00:04:19.020
so you're gonna have, you're
gonna have bonds like this,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.210
that actually store energy in them,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.976
they have the potential to be released,

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.210
if you're able to break these bonds,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.638
those electrons are gonna get
into a lower energy state,

00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:30.155
or they might bond with other
things and in the process,

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:31.609
they're going to release energy,

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:36.070
that's gonna be radiant energy
and thermal/kinetic energy,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.241
so how does this happen?

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:40.470
How do these bonds actually get broken?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.520
Well, that's our good old
friend, the combustion reaction,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.110
that's our good old friend,
the combustion reaction,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.713
where you take some oxygen,

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:53.780
you take some heat or we
could say some energy,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.571
so it takes a little
energy to get started,

00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:58.300
that's why you might have to light this

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.670
with a match to begin with,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.090
so oxygen plus energy,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.690
plus energy

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.330
and then you could say plus
these carbon-carbon bonds

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.290
and you could say plus
you know, whatever it is,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.900
these fuels, which are made out of carbon,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.110
either charcoal or wood, so
plus, I'll do it like this,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.933
I'll draw some carbon-carbon
bond right over here,

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:21.663
that's going to combust and
I'll do this in a color,

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:26.090
so that is going to,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.350
I'm really having trouble changing colors,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.403
this is going to combust,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.230
combust

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.480
and it's going to release,
it's going to release

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.740
water, because the fuel
has hydrogens in it,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.220
it's going to release carbon dioxide

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.350
and it's going to release
a lot more energy,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.780
I'll do that in caps,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.910
it's going to release a lot more energy

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.310
and that energy we see in the form

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.587
of the kinetic energy of the molecules

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.539
and the radiant energy being emitted.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.727
Now you might say, "Okay, I can buy that,

00:05:58.727 --> 00:05:59.907
"I have this potential energy here,"

00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:01.340
and this potential energy

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.160
that's in the bonds between these atoms,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.240
we call that chemical potential,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.633
so we have chemical,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.363
chemical potential energy,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.740
potential, potential energy

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.317
is right over there, but you
might say, "Okay, I buy that,

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:22.257
"the chemical energy is being converted

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.210
"into the thermal energy
and the radiant energy,"

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.860
and this is actually an interesting point,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.960
energy, this is the law
of conservation of energy,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.880
energy cannot be created or destroyed,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.199
it can only be converted
from one form or another,

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.167
but you might be saying,

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:34.747
"Okay, I can convert
from one form to another,

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.677
"but how can this actually do work

00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:38.830
"in the way that I've even depicted here?"

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.450
Well, the entire Industrial Revolution

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.843
is all about trying to convert
from one form of energy

00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:46.130
to another and also to do work,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.160
so a steam engine is fundamentally
based upon combustion,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.893
heating up some steam and
then that steam can expand

00:06:52.893 --> 00:06:55.890
and then it can push a piston
to do all sorts of things,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.410
including move a train,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.007
combustion is what's going
on in your car engines,

00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:02.763
where the pistons are expanding
due to the thermal energy

00:07:02.763 --> 00:07:05.580
and then that helps drive the drive train

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.970
of the actual car, so
it can clearly do work.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.710
So here we have some other
examples, this is lightning

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.130
and so when you see the lightning,

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.760
there's something clearly
very kinetic is going on,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.980
you have electrons, you have electrons

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.040
moving from the cloud, from
the cloud to the ground

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.150
and you might say, so
this right over here,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.683
that is, you could say
that's kinetic energy,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.857
kinetic, kinetic energy and you might say,

00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:32.126
"Well, how can I do work with that?"

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:34.390
Well, that's what the
whole electronics industry

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.760
is all about, that's what
power lines are all about,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.660
movement of electrons, that's current

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.037
and current can be used to do
all sorts of amazing things,

00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:43.410
you can actually have an electric motor

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.210
is one way to actually do it,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.410
so that's kinetic energy there,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.370
there's clearly radiant energy going on,

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.960
we can see the lightning and
that radiant energies do,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.340
because the air gets
ionized and gets heated

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.800
and so there's also thermal energy,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.065
as the electrons go down,

00:07:56.065 --> 00:07:59.300
there's heat that is
actually being generated.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.202
Now, where did this energy come from?

00:08:01.202 --> 00:08:03.159
It just doesn't come from anywhere,

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.600
well, you have all of
this potential energy,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.960
that starts building up in these clouds

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.310
as the water vapor rises and the mechanism

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.770
isn't fully understood
of how this happens,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.165
but because of energy from the sun,

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:19.010
you have water vapor rising,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.530
as the water vapor rises
through the clouds,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.353
the bottom part of the
cloud becomes more negative,

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.530
it becomes more electron rich

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.030
and the top part of the
cloud become more positive

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.290
and so you have these electrons,

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.397
that really wanna get
down here onto the ground,

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:38.293
because the air above the
ground becomes more negative,

00:08:38.293 --> 00:08:40.679
the ground starts becoming more positive

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.237
and so you can imagine these electrons,

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:44.070
more and more wanna get down here,

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.913
but this air isn't a natural conductor,

00:08:45.913 --> 00:08:49.600
but once the electric
potential gets high enough,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.596
these electrons find a way, the
air essentially gets ionized

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.360
and the electrons are able to find a path,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.090
so while this is all building up,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.400
you have this electrostatic
potential building,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.903
so this is electrostatic,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.510
static, you can't see it that well,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.060
electrostatic potential
and how this forms,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.399
once again, it's an area
that people are still,

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:13.930
there's some good theories out
there about how this forms,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.540
but it's not 100% well established

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.433
and over here in this third old drawing

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.070
of this person doing a handstand dive,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.050
this is probably the most typical example

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.312
of potential energy being
converted into kinetic energy

00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:29.870
that you might find in a physics textbook.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.080
Over here at the top of the diving board,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.000
this gentleman has potential energy

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.751
by virtue of his position and over here,

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.657
it's very clear he has
the potential to fall

00:09:37.657 --> 00:09:40.140
and it has the potential to
turn it into kinetic energy

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.160
and so once he falls over, at this point,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.720
most of his potential energy

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.220
has been converted into kinetic energy,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.520
so here it's potential,
here it's potential

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.090
and here it is kinetic,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.130
kinetic energy.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.930
So the big takeaway is energy
has the ability to do work,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.166
it cannot be created or destroyed,

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.610
but it can be converted
from one form to another

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.847
and all of the forms at their essence,

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:10.215
you can really think about
them in two big buckets,

00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:12.770
you can think about
them as potential energy

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.293
or kinetic energy,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.520
or kinetic energy

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.837
and as a last example, you might say,

00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:24.410
"Well, how can this guy do work?"

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.250
Well, you can imagine if there
was some type of system here,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.030
new system here, where, you know,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.680
we'll create some machinery,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.840
maybe there's a pulley right over here

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.250
and then it's lifting a
weight right over here,

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.944
well, if he jumped on this,
he won't fall down as fast,

00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:43.770
but then if, as long as he's
heavier than this weight,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.310
it's gonna pull this down

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.080
and then this weight is gonna go up,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.720
so he has the potential to do work

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.747
by virtue of his position,

00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:51.800
there just isn't this pulley system there

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.563
to get that actual work done.
