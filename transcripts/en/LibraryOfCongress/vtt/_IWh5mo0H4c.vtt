00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Hello
everyone and welcome

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.580
to the Lessing J. Rosenwald
Room in the Rare Book

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.870
and Special Collections Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.780
Thank you for coming to
this month's Thursday

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.520
Afternoon Lecture.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.070
My name is Michael
North and I'm head

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.560
of the Rare Book Reading room,
which is right across the hall.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.210
Today I am pleased to
introduce Elise Friedland,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.570
who is Associate Professor
of Classics and Art History

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.370

and Near Eastern Languages

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.170
and Civilizations at the George
Washington University here

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.150
in Washington D.C. She
holds a B.A. in Classics

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.310
from Williams College and a
M.A. and Ph.D. in Classical Art

of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.280
Professor Friedland specializes
in Roman Marble Sculpture

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.270
that was imported and displayed
in the Ancient Near East

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.920
and she has published two
co-edited volumes on the topic,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.860
The Sculptural Environment
of the Roman Near East:

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.840
Reflections on Culture,
Ideology, and Power in 2008

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.200
and the Oxford Handbook
of Roman Sculpture in 2015

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.770
by Oxford University Press
as well as a monograph,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.640
The The Roman Marble Sculptures
From the Sanctuary of Pan

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.670
at Caesarea, Philippi/Panias
in Israel in 2012.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.170
Her current research, which
investigates American adoptions

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.960
and adaptations of
classical motifs grows

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.480
out of a course she developed

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.090
for George Washington University
entitled Greece and Rome

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.540
in Washington D.C.:
Classical Influences

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.660
on our Founding Fathers.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.030
In the fall of 2017 Professor
Friedland was granted a U.S.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.690
Capitol Historical
Society Fellowship

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.150
to study Constantino Brumidi
Pompeiian style 19th century

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.860
fresco cycle in the Senate
Appropriations Committee Room,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.990
S127, in the Senate wing of
the U.S. Capitol Building.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.790
Please welcome her.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.830
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.550
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Thank
you so much, Michael,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.330
and thank you for
this opportunity.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180
Thank you all for coming.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.940
I'm delighted to be here and
Michael did a pretty good job

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.550
of giving you some background
but I just needed to go

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.520
through some thank yous
before we get started.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.700
So, a lot of people have been
very wonderful and gracious

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.040
and supportive and, first,
I have to thank the team

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.240
from the Office of the
Curator of the Capitol.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.270
So we have a curator of the
Capitol here, Michele Cohen,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.400
and some assistant
Curators of the Capitol,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.940
Jen Blancato and Vickie Villano.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.530
And I also want to
thank the former Curator

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.730
of Capitol, Barbara Wolanin.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.380
As Michael said, I had a had a
U.S. Capitol Historical Society

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.350
fellowship and I'd also like to
thank William diGiacomantonio

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.780
for that and all his
support and also a colleague

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.330
at George Mason University,
Carol Mattusch.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.040
My own institution also supplied
some funding for this so got

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.150
to give GW a little shout out.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.010
But also, there was an
entire team from the Library

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.520
of Congress who has been
incredible in helping me

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520
on my magical adventure that
I've been on since last August.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.100
So starting with
Michael North here,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.130
who retrieved these giant books
from Fort Meade on my behalf,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.600
and then Stephanie Stillo and
Jeff Flannery, Barbara Natanson

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.040
in prints and photographs,
Cheryl Fox the archivist here,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.910
Michelle Krowl, who you'll see
helped me with Megs journal,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.120
John Cole, the historian,
and Jan McElvey.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.960
So it's been a fabulous
experience conducting research

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.180
here but it's taken quite
a lineup of specialists

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.420
and experts to support me

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.540
and I'm incredibly
thankful to everyone.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.160
As Michael said, I don't usually
deal with books, rare books,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.000
because we don't have any
more of those from when I work

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.300
and where I usually live.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.290
I usually live in
the Roman world

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.170
because I'm a Roman sculpture
specialist and, in particular,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.210
I work in the Ancient Near
East, in Israel and Jordan.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.080
So you can just see
what I'm doing there.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.500
So your question is probably
what are you doing talking

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.310
about 19th century painting
and 19th century publications.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.430
Well, as Michael
pointed out, when I moved

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.710
to GW exactly ten years ago, I
developed a course called Greece

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.300
and Rome in Washington
D.C.: Classical Influences

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.000
on Our Founding Fathers.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.460
And as part of that class
I called up the curator

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.910
of the Capitol and asked if
she would give my class a tour

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.610
and that was Barbara Wolanin.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.770
And she took us all
around the Capitol

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.070
and showed us architecture

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.900
but she also showed
us some painting.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.230
This famous fresco on the
underside of the Rotunda

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.220
by Constantino Brumidi, right?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.840
The Apotheosis of
George Washington.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.400
And then she took
us into another,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.510
she took us into the Senate
corridors and this room, S127.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.480
And we were there for
about ten minutes.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.520
And when we came out
I said to her, "Whoa.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.950
There's a lot going
on in that room."

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.490
And she said, "Yes!

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.430
And no one has ever studied
it before completely.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.840
Would you like to do that?"

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.940
And I thought to myself, dude,
that is after Constantine.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:17.910
My world ends in 324
A.D. I am not responsible

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.690
for anything after Constantine.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.380
And besides, that's
painting, I do sculpture.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.250
So in my head I had this whole
dialogue and I said, "Oh,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.810
that's an interesting thought."

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.640
And then I moved on.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.390
Three years later I'm
teaching the class again,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.180
I try to email Barbara to
get a tour, no response.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.520
I call the office, Vickie
answers and says, "Oh,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.230
I'm sure the new Curator
of the Capitol would

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.700
like to give you a tour."

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.940
And so then I met Michelle and
she took our class in there

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.470
for 45 minutes and while she
was talking to my students

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.540
about Brumidi finally got
a look at that room, S127.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.420
It was originally made for
the Naval Affairs Committee

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.270
and today is the Senate
Appropriations Committee

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.570
Meeting Room.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.820
And we had this fabulous
exchange

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.980
about some things I was seeing
in the room and she said,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.980
"You know, I really think you
should work on this room."

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:32.050
She had no idea what Barbara
had said and so then I thought,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.260
okay, that's two Curators
of the Capitol in the space

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.940
of three years, somebody is
trying to tell me something.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.010
And the rest is history.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.220
Right? So here is the room
that we are talking about.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.580
This is S127.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.050
Today this is the Senate
Appropriations Committee

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.350
Meeting Room.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.140
But originally, as I said,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.140
it was made to house the Naval
Affairs Committee, right,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:10.380
and it did that from
about 1860 until 1897.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.550
Then it housed a variety
of different committees

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.260
until it became the Senate
Appropriations Committee Meeting

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.390
Room in 1912.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.610
This room is pretty important
in terms of its decoration

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.230
because it is the first
full-scale commission done

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.080
by Constantino Brumidi,
right, the guy who was famous

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.720
for the Apotheosis right here.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.270
This is actually his first
full-scale commission.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.120
And it is pretty
different than many

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.510
of his other painted
rooms in the Senate wing.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.480
Why? Because if you look at
it, for example, in comparison

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.530
to the Senate Reception Room,
it is much more coherent,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.370
this Naval Affairs Committee
Meeting room is much more

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.630
coherent in terms of
its style so this tends

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.480
to mix a variety of
different styles.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.150
It is also much more coherent in
terms of its narrative program,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.130
what is the story it's trying
to tell through the paintings.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.800
So, this is a pretty important
first thing by Brumidi

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.520
in the Capitol to study.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.650
And, in fact, I want to give
you a little bit of background

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.950
about our artist, Brumidi.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.660
He was actually Italian, right?

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.050
so he was born in
Rome and he went

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.930
to a very famous
art academy there,

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.240
the Academy di San Luca and,
unfortunately, he got caught

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.540
up in the Italian
Revolution and sort

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.840
of became a political refugee,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.140
such that in 1952 he came
to the United States.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.440
And he was here because
he had commissions

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.740
in churches in New York.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.040
He also painted in
Philadelphia, Baltimore,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.340
Havana, and even Mexico City.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.640
And at one point he was on
his way, at one point in 1854,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.940
I think, he was on his way back
from Mexico City to New York,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.240
his sort of home base when
he met Montgomery Meigs,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.540
who had been hired as the
engineer of the Capitol

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.840
to complete the construction,
and the believed,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.140
decoration of the
Capitol Building.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.440
And so Meigs, it was perfect
timing because Meigs was looking

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.740
for someone who could
decorate the interior

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.040
of the Capitol Building with
elaborate, Roman style frescoes

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.340
and he was having a dreadful
time finding any American

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.640
painter who was able
to fit that bill.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.940
And along came Constantine
Brumidi.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.060
So he, Meigs hired Brumidi
to do a little test panel

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.030
on the House side apparently
the Senators were very favorable

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.330
about it.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.060
Meigs liked it and
the rest is history.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.340
He hired Constantino Brumidi,
who is today sometimes known

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.200
as the Michelangelo
of the Capitol

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.040
or the artist of the Capitol.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.860
Now, what I wanted to do is
give you a quick orientation

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.640
to the room because then I want
to get to well why are you here

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.120
in the Library of Congress,
like what does this got to do,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.780
why shouldn't we be in the
Capitol Building right now.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.100
So let me just sort of give you
a quick visual tour of the room

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.830
and then I will explain
what we're doing here.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.000
So this is the room from
another angle and you can see

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.570
that the decorative program,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.150
the fresco cycle involves
sort of four main areas.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.070
It involves the walls, right?

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.800
So there are nine of these
sort of solid background panels

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.410
with floating maidens in them

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.330
and then it involves
these lunettes.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.050
I'm actually just go like this.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.740
So there are nine of these kinds
of panels and then the lunettes

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.840
over them that, today, have
architectural scenes in them.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.510
They were originally meant
to have famous naval battles

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.780
from American history in them.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.950
There are two bays in the room,
actually I'm going to back

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.250
up just so you can see that.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.920
Can you see that there's one bay
here and then another bay here?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.500
And on these bays there are sort
of four areas that have niches

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.090
in them and each niche is filled
with its own marine deity right?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.380
Because you're in the Naval
Affairs Committee Meeting Room.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.280
So, you know, you can
see there's Neptune

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.530
and we have Amphitrite,
and we have Aeolus.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.220
So there's one who is
the Goddess America

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.350
so she's a little aberration.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:56.090
But anyway, and each deity is
in a niche and then flanked

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.150
by two attendants, right?

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.640
And then finally,
there are these bands,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.940
there are three bands.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.200
One up here, there's one
in the center of the room,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.500
and there's one on the
other side of the room.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.680
So that is Brumidi's
decorative scheme for this room.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.160
Now, it was known to the former
Curator of the Capitol, I mean,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.470
this room obviously looks
very Roman in style, right?

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.750
But, in fact, the former Curator

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.470
of the Capitol had identified
one part of this room

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.950
that seemed to be a dead ringer
for or was definitely based

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.870
on an actual painting
from Pompeii.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.430
And so you can see
that right here.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.960
I'm just going to test this
but I know [inaudible].

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.520
The pointer doesn't
work on this,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.950
you need a reflective surface.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.660
Anyway, so this is a floating
[inaudible] right here

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:51.780
and if we look she is
actually based on this fresco,

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.030
this Roman wall painting,
that is from the House

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.600
of the Ship at Pompeii, okay?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.500
And her question was, the reason
she had approached me was she

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.110
wanted to know were there
other matches in the room

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.670
or did Brumidi sort of
start with this and kind

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.550
of make the rest of
the room up, right?

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.750
So that was the big
question and that's sort

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.100
of why Barbara Wolanin and
Michelle Cohen hired me

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.950
to study this room, right?

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.190
And I began in August
of 2017 and I kind

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.570
of was getting panicked
by early October

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.920
because I wasn't
finding any other matches

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.110
and I started getting
really nervous that a bunch

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.870
of people are going to be
very disappointed in me

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.180
and then I realized,
let's think about this.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.790
Naval Affairs Committee
Meeting Room,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.400
this is from the
House of the Ship.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.520
I wonder if Brumidi had some
publication of the House

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.430
of the Ship and took a bunch
of other figures from that

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.730
and altered them, right?

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.890
But then I couldn't find
any publication of the House

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:04.470
of the Ship but I did
find this drawing,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.740
which is in Volume
One right over there.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:14.120
Okay? And it turns out that this
is the only complete drawing

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:22.560
of the entire wall in which are
floating maenad figures, okay?

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.120
It is very common to see just
this floating maenad reproduced

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.000
in several publications
from the early 19th century

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.650
of wall paintings from Pompeii.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.460
But this is the only complete
drawing of the entire wall,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.270
which was the south wall of
a dining room in this House

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.730
of the Ship, the
Casa de Naviglio.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.880
And it turns out
that this drawing is

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.120
from the very important
publication by Wilhelm Zahn,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.170
the most beautiful ornaments and
the most fancy wall paintings

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.760
from Pompeii [inaudible], okay?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.960
And as I was looking at
this drawing and saying yes,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.840
there's are maenad, I
started realizing, hold on.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.130
I recognize other things
like these columns, right?

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.290
So, oops, sorry, so there's
our floating in maenad, right?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:24.170
You can see, but I also
recognized those columns

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.870
and then I realized
that it turns

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.970
out that Constantino Brumidi
based his entire design

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.910
of the room on this one drawing.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:41.650
So you can see that he not
only adopts flanking floating

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.900
maenads, he turns
them into maidens,

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.770
but he's got the
flanking columns

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.280
and the secondary scene got
turned into a doorway, right?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.650
So less work for him creating
complex figural scenes.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.690
Not that he couldn't take that
on, he was fabulous, right?

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.540
And, in fact, this
scheme, the design scheme

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.560
for the walls goes even
further because you can see

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.250
that the wall in the
Pompeiian dining room had this

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.950
vegetal border.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.970
Well, we have that here,
a version by Brumidi.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.250
It was originally topped by
some fantastic creatures;

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:23.180
they got turned into swans
and it had some vegetal motifs

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.370
in the lower corner
and those got turned

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.650
into cornucopia by Brumidi.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.730
So he really did look
very carefully at this

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.030
and match what he
was doing one to one.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:42.300
So the question for me was
then okay, I began to read

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.530
about this book by
Wilhelm Zahn and I realized

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.340
that this was a big, large,
fancy, expensive book.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.170
It is not something that a
political refugee is going

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.910
to be carrying from Italy
across the ocean with him.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.310
So I thought, how did
he have access for this

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.610
and what is this book.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.580
The other thing that struck
me was that, you know,

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.990
I teach a course on Pompeii
and I do a little part of that

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.090
on the history of Pompeii
and the transmission

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.400
of Pompeiian art, you
know, the dissemination

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.850
of the images and things.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.830
And I thought why have I
never heard of Wilhelm Zahn?

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.620
I mean, I know William Gell,
I know Francois [inaudible].

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.780
I know all these
characters, I'll introduce you

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.270
to them in a little bit.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.690
I'd never heard of Wilhelm Zahn.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.060
And I started asking some of my
colleagues, oh, Wilhelm Zahn?

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.370
And they'd say, yeah, I've
never really heard of him.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.840
And I thought well that's weird

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.580
because Brumidi has
heard of him.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.350
And where is his book because
I also had spoken with somebody

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.510
that I got connected to through
the U.S. Capitol Historical

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.980
Society, who is a painter
who does historical paintings

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.210
of D.C. and I said, "So,

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.020
could Brumidi have done
this from his head?"

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.780
And he said, "Absolutely not.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.940
He would've needed a
model to design something

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.740
that complex, absolutely not."

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.410
So I decided to start looking

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.410
around where could
I find this book

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.630
and I thought did the Library
of Congress own this book.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.970
And that's why we're here today
because I ended up getting

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.800
in touch with Michael
North and I said, "Look,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.270
in your catalogue it says
you have these books,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.570
could I see them?"

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.160
And he heroically got them from
Fort Meade where they've been

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.170
in storage for goodness
knows how long and behold,

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.830
I was able to find
tons more matches.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.040
So these columns here that
Brumidi painted in the room,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.320
you can see that this
lower part comes directly

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.460
from this drawing
by Zahn, right?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.760
On plate 16 and we're
going to watch

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.230
because another part he also
takes from the same place, okay?

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.020
So not only does he base
architectural features,

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.390
he also has an individual
drawing

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.930
of just his favorite
floating maenad

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.260
and there are other floating
figures that match as well.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.660
So she was a victory
goddess, carrying a trophy.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.300
So you just, you know, lose
the wings and change the trophy

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.500
into a pennant and you've got to
put clothes on all these people

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.970
in 19th century America.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.290
And there you have
another floating figure.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.070
Some of the attendants
also come directly

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.900
from Wilhelm Zahn's drawings so,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.790
and here we have the
original still today

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.400
in the Naval Archeological
Museum,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.700
and you can check this out,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.610
even down to this tongue
sticking out, right,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.840
Brumidi has based
this on this drawing.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.930
Right? Brumidi, we can't
guarantee, would know this

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.600
but we can see that he was
looking at Wilhelm Zahn

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.910
and just another
attendant flanking Neptune.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.630
You can see here, okay, so
it was Europa and the bull

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.590
but he changed the
bull into a hippocamp

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.440
and then the horse
turned his head away

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.450
because it was this sort of
romantic myth behind [laughter].

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.940
So, but you can see, right?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.700
You believe me that Brumidi was
actually using Wilhelm Zahn's

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.090
drawings, right?

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:15.750
Okay, so how did Brumidi
get a hold of this book

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:23.420
and the real question is could
these books be the exact copies

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.690
that Zahn was using?

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.670
And he had the commission
for this room in 1856

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.650
and he completed it in 1958.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.250
So the hunt was on.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.780
Here I am when I first
met Michael and the books

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.110
by Wilhelm Zahn, right?

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.420
And I wanted to try
to figure out whether

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.870
or not Brumidi could've
used these.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.080
And this is one of the funniest
stories of this whole mystery.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.250
I mean, I'm an archeologist
and an art historian

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.550
and I've worked in museums.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.530
You know, I've been a
visiting assistant curator here

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.830
and blah, blah, blah.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.680
So I turned to Michael
when I got a hold

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.470
of these books finally
and I said,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.260
"Could I see your
file on these books?"

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.020
And he looked at me and he
said, "File on the books?"

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.320
And I said, "Well, yeah.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.620
Where have these things been?"

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.920
Like, I don't know,
where did you get them,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.220
when did you get them,
who's used them?"

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.910
And he said, "We don't
keep files like that."

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.210
And I thought, what do you mean?

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.330
Because in a museum every object
that walks in the building

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.350
and belongs to your collection
has a file and you know

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.740
where it's been every second
of every day basically.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.290
And he said, "We have a
lot of books like this."

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.170
So I was like, right,
okay, I'm going to have

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.820
to reconstruct the
provenience of this book.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.710
So there were several
things that were helpful

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.950
like when I began
sleuthing together, right?

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:44.600
It turns out that there is
a blind stamp in the front,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.560
on the frontis page
of both of these books

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.020
and that blind stamp
is actually tied

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.780
to the first international
copyright law.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.080
This is all very exciting.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:03.740
Because you can see it says
Vertrag Vom 13 Mai 1846.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:09.040
So in 1846 on the 13tth

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.830
of May there was a convention
established between Prussia

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.720
and Britain that had
to do with the export

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.120
of books and paying taxes.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.210
And so if a book was meant to
be exported to Britain it had

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:28.810
to have this kind of stamp on
it and so we know, therefore,

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.090
that the book, which
incidentally was printed

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.580
in Berlin by a very famous
publisher, Gaylord [inaudible]

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.680
and the Volume One
was printed in 1829,

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.650
Volume Two that you
see there 1841 to 44,

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.460
Volume Three we don't have
because it was after Brumidi

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:54.330
and he didn't use it, but
that was 1852 to 1859.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.490
So we know that the same
Volume One, at least,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:03.030
was printed in 1829 and it had

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:08.140
to have left Germany [inaudible]
term after September 1st,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.920
when this went into
effect, of 1846.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.220
Okay, that's good, right?

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.540
So we kind of have an idea
of when the book left.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.840
We know that it must've gone

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.620
to Britain otherwise it wouldn't
have had that stamp in it.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.800
But Michael said, yeah,
not to worry there are tons

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.640
of book sellers, right,
selling to America in Britain

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.670
so that's cool, that
could've taken that path.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.600
There's also this stamp on
this book stamp of the Library

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.340
of Congress and it turns

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:40.030
out that this was a common stamp
used in the mid 19th century

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.990
and actually the
archivist, Cheryl,

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.230
told me one of the dead
ringers here said this is listed

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.350
as Library of Congress
City of Washington,

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.270
as opposed to Washington
D.C., that the name tends

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.570
to change after the Civil War.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.980
Okay? So that was good but
here is the dead ringer.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.620
Then I began searching
through published catalogues

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.500
of the Library of Congress to
try to determine if I could see

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.480
when we acquired
this book, right?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.720
And that also required
Michael's help

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.330
because although the HathiTrust
has a lot of the catalogues,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.910
the published catalogues of
the Library of Congress online.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.290
They didn't have
anything between 1830

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:27.750
and like 1850-something
and so, after my time,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.460
like 1859 or something.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.760
I was like, "I have this gap,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.950
Michael do you have your
catalogue from 18," you know.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.170
And so I looked through all
the catalogues and, behold,

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.070
we can see that in 1849, here's
the first record of the Library

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.800
of Congress's ownership
of Zahn's publication.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.280
And we have Volumes
One and Two here,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.460
note that they're classified
under gardening, painting,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.320
et cetera, according
to Jefferson's category

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.010
of imagination [inaudible].

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.250
I thought that was very
funny [inaudible], et cetera.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.550
But there they are.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.370
So we know that they made their
way here by 1849 and that's

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:07.910
in plenty of time for our
hero to consult them in 1854

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.420
or 56, so that's exciting.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.720
So that's good.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.880
So I think I can make
a pretty sound argument

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.940
that he could've used
these exact volumes.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.510
But then I decided to
try going a step further.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.430
So it turns out that
Montgomery Meigs, who was kind

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:29.570
of Brumidi's patron if
you will, kept a journal.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.230
Fortunately, I mean,
and he wrote

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.640
down every matter of detail.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.750
It was unbelievable.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.490
Well, it's only unbelievable
if you read

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.810
if in the transcribed
version because it turns

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.630
out that the guy wrote in this
thing called Pittman shorthand.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.610
[inaudible] anyone ever tried
to read Pittman shorthand?

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.590
So, okay, my daughter is taking
Arabic and you saw that some

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.890
of my research is in Jordan.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.270
It's like scarier than Arabic.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.570
Here, look [laughter].

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:02.200
Even more impenetrable
to me than Arabic.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.300
So I went over to Madison
and I met with Jeff Flannery

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.890
and he got the journal out
for me and we tried to look

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.410
at it because, see, what
happened was in 2000

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.900
for the anniversary of
the Capitol Building,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.640
they hired this incredible
person

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.760
who could still read
Pittman shorthand

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.450
to transcribe the diaries
of Montgomery Meigs,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.850
especially the ones
that had to do

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.550
with the Capitol
Building, right?

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:31.080
So I had this searchable
pdf and I could see,

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.060
in English you know
[laughter], that I could see

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.300
that on June 22nd, 1858,
when my room is completed,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.410
Brumidi is all done
with the room,

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.630
Meigs is in there admiring
a room and he says,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:51.270
"The Pompeiian rooms are better
than the examples from Pompeii

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.630
in the book of blank
and the other styles are

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.270
as well represented as in
any of the plates given

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.690
in any of these books."

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.810
Well, what happened was our
transcriber was going along

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:14.080
doing his thing transcribing
but he doesn't know names

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.730
like [inaudible], Gell,
Zahn, Niccolini, [inaudible],

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.530
he doesn't know those names.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.640
So he came across a word
that was a proper name

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.250
that he didn't know
and he left it blank.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.620
And there are blanks like this
throughout the transcription.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.310
You can understand, right?

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.530
It's hard to keep up
with Montgomery Meigs.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.330
So Jeff and I thought maybe
we could look at the diary

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.140
and we could figure this out.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:51.470
And then we looked at the
diary and we were like, yeah,

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.440
you pretty much need to
read Pittman shorthand

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.740
to figure that out.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.040
So then I met Michelle
Krowl and she said, "Well,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.350
I have an elderly woman who
used to do some things for us

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.920
who lives in Quincy,
Massachusetts.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.200
Here's her email address."

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.730
So I emailed her
and she was amazing.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.880
She emailed me back.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.100
I sent her color
printouts of these images

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:30.930
with stickies everywhere
and I could tell that this,

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:37.400
because it's the last sentence
of the June 22nd journal entry

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.030
and this is the last sentence
because there's an x here

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.370
that means the end of the
sentence and here's 23rd

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.930
for the start of the next
journal entry, right?

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.760
So I could see there's the
end of the previous sentence.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.870
So I knew it was this sentence
and I could kind of see

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.600
that some of the words
were being repeated,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.200
Pompeii or Pompeiian.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:13.450
So I was able to narrow it
down and she read it for me

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.070
and she said, "Hey, guess what?

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.950
There's your word and it says,"

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:23.360
it's like phonetic
shorthand, so it says, "Zahn."

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.310
So in case you were doubting
[laughter] my art historical

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.690
sleuthing and all the other
words that everyone else

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.890
at the Library of Congress
had been doing to help me,

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.190
Montgomery Meigs went
and confirmed it for us.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.490
Should've just read
the journal, well.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.790
In any event, so that
pretty much tells us

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.090
that these volumes, you know,
there was the slight question,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.390
did they make it
through the fire in 1851?

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.690
But I've sort of
left that alone.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.990
I chose not to go
down that rabbit hole.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.290
This is filled with
rabbit holes.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.590
So anyway, I don't know,

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.890
I believe that I can make
a fairly strong argument

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.190
for the fact that our hero
was, and Meigs as patron,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.490
were looking at these
exact volumes.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.790
So, then my question
was well how did we know

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.090
to buy those things in 1849?

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.390
Because I don't know about them
and I'm a scholar of, you know,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.690
Roman art and I teach
a course on Pompeii

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.990
and I've never heard
of this dude.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.290
So how do they know to buy these
volumes by Wilhelm Zahn, right?

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.590
And so what I thought I should
do is put this in a little bit

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.890
of a context of the history
of excavations of Pompeii.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.190
So here's a map of Pompeii and
I don't know if you can sort

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.490
of read this from where you're
sitting but it has the dates

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.790
of all the excavations
of the city.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.090
And you can see that we are
sort of, we're, so the House

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.390
of the Ship is discovered
in 1826

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.690
and that's this blue
part, right?

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.990
And Brumidi is alive
and sort of learning

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.640
to be an artist during the
largest excavation campaign

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.480
to date, which occurred
between 1850 and 1860, right?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.720
I mean, Pompeii gets
discovered in 1748,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.490
initially they thought it was
actually another little town,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.790
[inaudible].

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.090
So it took them a while to
figure out where they were

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:35.190
and these first excavations,
which you can see here,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.350
it's a light grey but it doesn't
show up very well on the screen,

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.970
were in this theater
area triangular forum

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:46.020
and a little piece up here but
then there was a second wave

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:54.990
of excavations in 1806 to
1815, so-called French decade.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:31:00.340
But then the Bourbon
Restoration from 1850 to 1860 is

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.070
when there's really the
largest scale excavations

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.650
that had ever been
conducted at the site.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.930
And this is the lifetime
of Brumidi, right?

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.770
And the other thing that's
important for you to know,

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.700
just here's a little marker
to show you where that House

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.800
of the Ship is located, right?

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.280
So it was excavated in three
different years and our room

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.530
with its wall painting
is found in 1826.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:31.820
So this means that this is also
the era of huge publication

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.800
of the site of Pompeii.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:42.180
And this is the time when all
sorts of, you know, artists

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:48.550
and architects and elites were
going to the Bay of Naples area

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.460
and looking at the discoveries

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.770
that were being made
before their very eyes

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.730
at Pompeii, right?

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.790
So this is the, you know, still
the era of the grand tour.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.530
I don't know if you've
heard of the grand tour.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:05.970
And so here are some examples
of the kinds of publications

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.050
that were beginning
to appear, right?

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.100
And it's just three
of the most important

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.970
and well known publications

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.650
from the first half
of the 19th century.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.950
So we have William Gell,

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.450
who writes something called
Pompeiana and it's published

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.950
between 1817 and 1832.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.070
French, Francois Mazois
[inaudible] Pompeii from 1824

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.030
to 1838, and then the
famous Niccolini brothers,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.410
Fausto and Felice
Niccolini in 1854.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.270
And what I wanted you to see was

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.450
that these volumes are
very similar to one another

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:50.360
because while they do have some
plates in them and some drawings

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.510
and some of them are these
very alluring reconstructions

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.810
that get populated by
ancients, you know.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.950
So you can, they sort of
reconstruct the houses

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.350
that have been excavated and
they install Romans in them,

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.210
you know, swishing around
the atrium or whatever.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.250
Most of what's in
these volumes is

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.180
that [laughter] narrative
discussion

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.200
of what they are discovering.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.650
Very helpful, extremely
important but as I began

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.140
to dabble in 19th century
publications from the University

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.490
of Heidelberg and the
Getty Research Institute,

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.120
thank God for digitization
of these things,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.280
and then I was looking at these,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.750
I thought Zahn doesn't
look like these guys.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.790
He's different, right?

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.550
And in fact, Zahn is
different in a lot of ways

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.630
and so here's just the frontis
from Volume One that you can see

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.330
on the screen and we could
look at later if you wanted.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.860
So how is Zahn different?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.280
First of all, Zahn
is bilingual, right?

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.220
So those others that I
had shown you, you know,

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.910
one was by a British guy,
one was by a French guy,

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.250
the Niccolini brothers
are Italian,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.250
and they're in their
respective languages, right?

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.160
We are bilingual, we're
in German and in French

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.110
and the real difference is these
are really virtually all images.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:21.040
He has one page of "texts" that
are mini catalogue entries.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.760
So you have some minimal
information about the background

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.890
for each image, that
appears at the front,

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.620
and then there are a
bunch of plates in between

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.260
and then there's
another set of 10

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.590
and a bunch of plates
in between.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:39.190
So there's only one
page of text per folio.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.230
It is not at all a narrative
in any way, shape, or form.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.580
And the other thing
that's radically different

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.630
about these is the color.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.060
Okay? And you can see that
as you look at the table

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.420
and you can see that here.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.830
And it really makes Zahn,
oops, where's my color?

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.110
There you go, it really
makes Zahn stand out, right?

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.850
So who was this guy and, you
know, I figured I'm going

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.360
to have to put this guy
on the map a little bit

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.200
for the general discussion.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.390
Certainly, specialists who
work with this era know

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.890
about him but, you know,

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.750
people who are just general
Roman art historians seem

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.480
to not have heard of him.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.400
So he was a German
decorative painter.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.300
He was born in 1800 and he
trained at the Casell Academy

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.770
of Fine Arts, after which he
went to Paris for about a year

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.040
and hung out with Antione
[inaudible] very famous

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.380
neoclassical painter.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:48.720
And then Wilhelm Zahn lived in
Pompeii from 1824 or 25 to 1829

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.530
and again from 1830 to 1840.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.540
And he was just hanging

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.470
around while things were being
discovered and drawing them.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:02.080
Okay? And he says in his
introduction that his goal

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.710
at Pompeii was "to
copy as faithfully

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.840
as possible ancient paintings
and to reproduce the original

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.850
with the accuracy
that science demands".

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.500
So he's responsible not
only for this set of, well,

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.940
you have two volumes here
but there is a third one,

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.880
but he also published many other
things, several other volumes.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.730
And he is an extraordinary
character in many ways.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:38.900
He was befriended by
Goethe in 1829 and, in fact,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.660
when Zahn returned to Berlin
for this break in between,

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.320
he goes to Goethe and Goethe
immediately befriends him

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.970
and he spends weeks at a time
with Goethe and gets introduced

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.170
to all kinds of important
people like, you know,

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.640
the future King of Prussia.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.910
And he is also extremely
important

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.450
because he is a major
figure in the development

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.340
of color lithography, which
I had no idea until recently.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.370
I mean, this is all a
whole new world to me.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.570
I moved to the 19th century,
little did I know how big

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.730
that move was going
to be, right?

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:27.660
And so he really used the
publication of these volumes

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.110
to push forward the
technology of lithography

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.540
and chromolithography
and apparently you can,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.910
now I'm not trained to see
this so I can't point this out

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.210
and I'm sorry for that,

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.820
but apparently you can see
him develop the technology

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.960
from volume to volume to
volume, which is fascinating.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.130
This was also a massive
effort and expense.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.220
I read that it turns
out that Gerheimer,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:02.480
who was a pretty well known,
large publisher in Berlin,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.140
when he agreed to
publish Volume One,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.610
this wasn't originally
conceived as a three-volume set,

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.030
it was just going
to be one volume,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.330
when he originally agreed

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:15.120
to publish Volume One he
withheld the payment from Zahn

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.980
until he could see that it was a
financially successful endeavor.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.700
And so once he saw that people
were buying these he paid Zahn

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.990
and eventually Zahn came
back and did Volume Two

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.800
and then Volume Three.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.560
But we have some descriptions
by Zahn himself, which we know

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.910
about because Goethe includes
them in a review he does

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:42.070
of Zahn's Volume One, in
which Zahn talks about setting

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.700
up the lithography workshop
because this didn't exist.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.800
And talking about 20 printers
and four to five artists

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.590
and it was incredible.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:57.820
Now, there are some
other interesting things

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.220
that I just want to point
out but I am going to wrap it

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.090
up so I don't keep people
too long and I can try

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:07.140
to answer questions, and that is
this is only a connection I made

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.360
just recently so Zahn talks
about being most proud

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.730
of some specific plates in each
of the volumes that he's done

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.400
in terms of the challenge
that it was to produce them

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.500
and get the color just right and
things, and this is one of them.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.080
This is plate 99
from Volume One.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.950
And it turns out that
that's blue, right?

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.810
Because we have blue in our room

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.290
and everybody is always
saying 'oh it's American blue,

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:42.380
you know, Brumidi just
Americanized the background',

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.230
he took the black, right,

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:48.230
he took away the black Pompeiian
background and he made it blue.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.020
And we actually have
a water color study

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.700
in which he also tried
out a red background.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.830
But I never, I mean, I was
always thinking it's just sort

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.570
of American blue
background, right?

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.550
Well now, I'm pretty convinced
that he picked this blue

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:09.680
up from actual Pompeiian wall
paintings that he had seen.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.510
And there's a whole debate
actually about this plate

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.120
that I'm currently
reading about,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.390
because we not only have
Zahn's depiction of it

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:22.890
but have a 19th century
wash of it

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.350
and the blues are
slightly different

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.820
and the painted one is much
closer to our blue in the room.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.300
So it's just fascinating
to look at that.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.720
But anyway, so that's one thing.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.370
Another thing that I'm
looking into is I wonder

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:43.630
if Brumidi actually
knew Wilhelm Zahn.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.470
If you look at their
lives, so firs to fall,

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.440
they're both artists, right?

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:53.190
And there are areas
that are listed in red

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.400
where they overlap, right?

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.390
And so Zahn is known
to have stopped in Rome

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.720
for a bit before he
went down to Pompeii.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.150
He came from Paris, stopped
in Rome, and went to Pompeii.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.820
And so I'm in touch

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.310
with a former U.S. Capitol
Historical Society fellow

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:14.880
who has worked before in
the archives of the Academy

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.510
of de San Luca, the
famous art school

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.480
where Brumidi was trained,
and would know this, you know,

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.660
is this something that
might be recorded.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.060
My question is, if you were
an artist and you hit Rome,

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.600
would you stop by this
famous art school?

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.200
I mean, I think you
would, right?

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.450
And so they could've
met maybe there,

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.260
certainly Brumidi would've
gone down to the Bay of Naples,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.360
Zahn was hanging out
there with, you know,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.970
admittedly other artists.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:43.230
But still, I want to see if
that's a rabbit hole I would

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.580
like to do go down to see
if I can find some way

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.580
that they are connected,
if they are connected

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.800
or knew one another
or met one another.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.100
So that's one idea.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.040
The other thing that I need to
do some more work on is I would

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.600
like to see if I can
understand the circumstances

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.570
under which the Library of
Congress acquired those volumes.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.110
So it turns out, right,
that there are notes

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.590
from the Committee of the
Library or the Committee

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:18.090
for the Library that are
in the National Archives.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.810
Oh boy, anybody got
any leads over there?

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:26.010
But you can read the discussions
about acquisitions and what

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:31.000
to spend your money on and so
that I also want to follow up on

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.260
because I'm fascinated
by how they thought

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.360
to acquire these volumes.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.240
And I've been looking
at the catalogues

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.460
and I'm still doing this to see.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.800
So, in 1849, we did own
Gell, the British guy.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.030
We owned [inaudible], a
different Italian guy,

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.960
and we owned this sort of
catalogue of the Bourbon Museum,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.930
but we did not own the French
volume by Francois Masois.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.000
We did not own another
German volume

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.400
of Pompeiian wall paintings
by this guy named [inaudible]

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.630
and the Niccolini brothers
hadn't published their thing

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:04.930
yet in 1849.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:08.000
But I might look to see if
we purchased that in 1854

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.010
or shortly thereafter
when it came out,

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.530
whether, you know, they.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:15.410
But the question is, why
did they pick these volumes

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.800
as opposed to Francois Masois,
as opposed to somebody else?

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.530
It's interesting so that's
another thing that I want

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.590
to look into and the last thing,
of course, is I have a lot

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.980
to learn about color
lithography,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.720
which is very complicated
[laughter].

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.620
And it will be interesting
to see what we can then learn

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.100
from the samples
that we have here,

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.820
these copies that we have here.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.180
I have done a little bit
of sleuthing using OCLC

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:48.860
and I can see 26 entries, 26
other volumes around the world.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.070
So the other interesting
thing would be to know more

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.350
about how many of
these were printed,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.400
how rare is this,
things like that.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.900
So, anyway, I thank
you all for listening

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.080
and I really enjoyed figuring
out how we went from sort of,

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:11.630
you know, discovering Pompeii
in 1826 to publishing it in 1829

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.160
in Germany, in Berlin, to
painting it in adapted form

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.340
on the walls of the
U.S. Capitol Building.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.140
Thank you.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:29.010
[ Applause ]

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:30.310
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: [inaudible].

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.350
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Yes, please.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.650
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Hi.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.770
What an amazing research
project [inaudible]

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:43.600
of investigation [inaudible],
just a stupendous job.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.900
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Thank you.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:53.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I am very curious
to know, I know that the Brumidi

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:58.270
in the dome of the Capitol is

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.510
of one fresco painted
on wet fresco.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.940
Were these paintings also
painted on wet plaster?

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.780
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: I have my
backup right here [laughter].

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: No, no,
they're not true fresco.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.720
Not the wall paintings,
not the maenads.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.440
The ceiling is a temperate.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.910
Nothing actually in that room
is true fresco, actually.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.690
Well no, that's not true.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:23.990
They've been scratched out

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:28.180
but the naval scenes
would've been true fresco.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.830
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: That's a
whole sort of drama on the side

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.850
that didn't really
relate so I just left it.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:39.120
There was an artist who
got asked, commissioned

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:45.940
to paint these and they
weren't happy with them

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:55.540
and he was disgruntled because
he wasn't getting paid enough

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.170
and he scratched
out his paintings

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.580
in those architectural.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:05.450
But we have his names
scratched in, he was angry

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:15.340
so his name is scratched
in deeply into the plaster.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:24.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But those
panels were actually painted

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.320
in one fresco whereas the rest

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.890
of the room was painted
on dry walls?

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.190
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Mmhmm.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Interesting.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.790
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: And with
different kinds of, yeah,

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.520
with different kinds of paint.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.380
Isn't there some oil?

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, there
were different artists

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.000
that worked with Brumidi.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.300
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Brumidi, right.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.190
I mean, he had a cast of
people working with him

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:57.310
because he covered an
incredible amount of territory

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.680
in the Capitol Building.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thank you.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.840
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: I see a
question back there then I'm

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.750
going to come back to you.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You might've
said this but I [inaudible].

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.600
So it went from these
frescos in Pompeii [inaudible]

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.240
and then was that, the line
goes Pompeii to Zahn to Brumidi

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.440
or did it go to Meigs?

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:29.360
Did Meigs get ivolved, did
Meigs point Brumidi to Zahn

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.340
or the other way around?

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:37.020
Or is that the crux
of the problem?

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.040
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
That's a great question.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, I mean,
Meigs clearly did point Brumidi

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:50.330
to a lot of sources so, I mean,

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:58.580
I think they had a mutual
admiration society going there

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:05.210
and I think they really, you
know, Meigs really was a conduit

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:10.950
to helping Brumidi gather this
information and access it.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:16.930
But it's hard to
know the concept

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:22.670
if it really came
from, I don't know.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:26.410
I mean, I felt like your theory

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.810
of perhaps they did
know each other-

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.110
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Yeah.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: in Rome and, I
mean, every artist is looking

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.140
for images, that's what,
you know, artist do today

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.080
but they go online
instead of, you know,

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.400
looking for a folio print.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.060
So I think that it
is hard to know,

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.940
it may be that Brumidi
had this idea

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.240
and then Meigs just
encouraged him.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.100
I don't know the origin
of, I don't believe

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.810
that Meigs originated the
idea for this Pompeiian style.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.510
But it's a good question.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:05.230
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Well
here is something that I did,

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:10.750
and I didn't think to put
an image of this in here.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:16.290
Here's something that I did also
do in the Library of Congress.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.580
There was another proposal
drawn up for this room

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.880
by another artist
named James Leslie.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.260
And we have that in the Prints
and Photographs Division

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.560
in the Madison Building.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.860
And they found them and
they uncovered them for me

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.160
and it was, I made a scene

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.460
because they uncovered
these and I was like, "Oh!

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.760
Those are horrible!"

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.060
They're not Pompeiian at all.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.360
It's like a [inaudible]
artist trying to do Pompeii.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.660
It was not at all right, okay?

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.960
And it's clear to me that
Meigs, who had the choice

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.260
of Brumidi's proposed thing,
the drawing, and James Leslie,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.560
was discerning enough to
know this is Pompeiian style,

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.860
that is a [inaudible]
artist trying to look like.

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.160
I mean, so he had the proper
positions of the walls and,

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.460
but then he had these kind
of hokey subjects in there.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.760
I mean, like little
coral, things of coral,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.060
something that we don't have
that in the ancient world.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.360
It just was all wrong.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.660
And so in that degree I know

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.960
that Meigs was clearly
discerning and we know a lot

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.260
about Meigs as a patron and
the fact that Meigs, you know,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.560
used the library in
New York extensively

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.860
and clearly was using
the Library

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.160
of Congress extensively
and was very learned.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.460
And that's another path, I have
a lot of other rabbit holes

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.760
but I really want to look at
the curriculum of West Point

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.060
when Meigs went to school
there because I want to see

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.360
where he got this direct
link to the ancient world,

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.660
where he got that knowledge.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:49:59.960
And we also have
another quote from him.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.260
I sort of put some extra slides
in here, hang on one second.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.560
That's it.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.860
You know, there was, this
was, to decorate a room

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.160
in Pompeiian style was all
the rage in this period,

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.460
and particularly in palaces
as far north as Oslo.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.760
So this wasn't just in, you
know, France and Italy and Spain

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.060
but I can show you in Oslo

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.550
and I've also been reading an
article recently by a scholar,

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.950
a colleague of mind who does
usually Roman wall painting

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.890
but Ludwig of Bavaria

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:21.940
who actually had the
interior decoration

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.910
of this palace he built modeled
directly from Wilhelm Zahn,

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:30.880
built the first reconstruction
of a Pompeiian house,

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.590
you know, outside of Italy.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:37.380
So one of his castles is the
Pompeianum in a southern area

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:42.790
of Bavaria and he was basing it
directly on images from here.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:46.660
So Meigs says in one of
his diaries that I want

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.130
to build a palace
for the people.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:54.290
So his goal was to decorate the
U.S. Capitol Building the way,

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:57.880
you know, royalty were
decorating their palaces

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.180
throughout Europe.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.720
So my question is
how does he now that?

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.020
How does he know that?

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.320
Because at this point

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.900
in his life he had not
been to Europe yet.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.200
Yes ma'am?

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I think it was
essentially, I was trying

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:14.160
to figure out how did Brumidi
know about these [inaudible]

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.480
and that's essentially what
you just struggled to answer.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.780
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Yeah, and I just hope

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.080
that this colleague
[inaudible], I did hear from him

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.380
but it was a 'I'm
opening a big exhibition,

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.680
I'll get back to you'.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.970
But I really hope
that he can help me

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.480
because I just don't know
enough about the culture

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.950
and how things worked in the mid

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.100
or early 19th century
in Rome or in Europe.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.090
But it seems to be me
that if you're coming

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:40.550
from the Casell Academy and
you're going to Paris, you know,

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:44.170
Paris to study with this
neoclassical painter,

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.040
that when you go to Rome
you're going to know

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.340
where the academy is

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.430
where Canova is the teacher
and things like that.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.770
So it seems to me
that he would've had

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.110
to have had a connection.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.080
I mean, he would've known this
academy and stopped there.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.380
But I don't know.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.000
I'm going to ask [inaudible]
who wrote a giant dissertation

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.270
on the Italian Revolution
and its impact

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.580
on the artist community of Rome.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.340
So he's going to have a
handle on this for me.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You know,
this other question though

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.760
about the Meigs and the Pompeii
connection, thinking back

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.910
that there was this competition,
if both artists were informed

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:18.480
or trying to approximate
a Pompeiian style then

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.430
that really would mean
that Meigs was driving

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.100
that because he would've
created the parameters

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.480
and this was Naval Affairs.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.780
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Right.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So Brumidi,
knowing the source, really,

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.340
I think, sort of had
the ace in the hole

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.800
because he was going
back to these, you know,

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.700
think about this, you
know, house of the.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.000
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
The House of the Ship,

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.300
the casa del [inaudible] yeah.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yes.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.900
I mean, that was the
perfect source [inaudible].

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.200
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Isn't that cute, yeah.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.300
Now, mind you, he didn't,
that was the only thing

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.050
from the house of the ship that
he took that floating maiden

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.010
and the columns, and
the sort of design.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yep, that's
the key decorations.

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.310
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Right.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:57.880
But the other figures that I
showed you come from all over

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.780
and some we don't even have
their original context anymore,

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.700
they just got cut out of their
walls and he saw them in the.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.870
He said, Zahn says,
Archeological Museum

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.330
in Naples, you know, sorry.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:11.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Because the
competition sketches are just

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.310
for those logs.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.610
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Right, right.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.910
That's a good point.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:16.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: What's the
dates for the proposals?

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.280
I'm curious, for
the other proposals

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.330
that Leslie put [inaudible].

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.810
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: I don't
think there's a, well,

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:25.700
we got to just pdf it; I've
just got to search the PDF.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.000
It's 54.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Perhaps
[inaudible].

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.660
It took that many,
I'm trying to, no.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.780
Not, I'm not sure actually.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.080
I'd have to check.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.570
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
I think its 54-55

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.350
but it's in his diary because.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.820
So, this is just
full disclosure.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.590
The yucky thing that I saw,
it's not yucky but you know,

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:51.820
the thing that's not right
that I saw by James Leslie, is,

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.950
was purchased by the
Library of Congress.

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:57.500
And I was like how did
you know to purchase that

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:02.030
and how did you know that
this was a drying submitted

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.350
for this contest,
if you will or this.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:05.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Competition.

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.950
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Competition.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:10.500
And it seems that I had a
hard time getting anybody

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.560
to reconstruct that but what
I do know is I've talked

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.040
with Barbara Walonin, the
former Curator of the Capitol,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.720
and she is the one who said,
"Look, this says James Leslie,

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:24.030
we have James Leslie and we
have this entry in Meigs' diary

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.770
in which he describes, I
looked at this and it's,

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.830
he's not appropriate
for the room.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.360
He's more of a decorative
painter."

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.420
This is what Meigs says, "He's
more of a decorative painter

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.280
and I'll hire him
to do other things."

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.190
And he does do other things in
the Capitol Building very well

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:43.090
but he says he's not for
the design of this floor.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.960
So, I can get you that, I
just have to search my pdf

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.400
of the transcribed [inaudible].

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I was just curious
the trajectory and how long

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.410
between the [inaudible].

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.020
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: I think
it was 54 or 55, I really do.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So not long.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.620
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Not long.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.920
Yes?

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Quick question.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.580
Brumidi is painting
in oil, is he not?

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.880
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Ooh, not always.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well he's painting
a lot of different media.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:09.320
In this room it is
oil on plaster.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Okay, fine.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.920
And.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Oil and casing
I think, it's a mixture.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Okay, thank you.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.470
And one of the questions
about books in the Library

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:21.060
of Congress is oh, did he
have borrowing privileges?

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.360
[inaudible].

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:24.960
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: No, l

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.260
[ Cross Talk ]

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well that
would've been Meigs.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.860
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Yes.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I mean,
Meigs would have.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.460
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Well, and
I also started this, right,

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:35.340
because Cheryl gave me the
log, the checkout registry

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.690
and that was interesting too
because I said to the guys

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:40.630
as they handed me this,
"Can I look at this?

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:42.540
Is this legal?"

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.760
Right? Because I can't
go into the Library today

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.820
and say what does this
student of mine, you know,

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.640
what does she have checked
out from Gellman, right?

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.050
But they said hmm,
that's a good question.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.210
But you know, these
are from 1855

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:54.510
so you're okay, take
it [laughter].

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:59.350
And I started reading through
it but but it's hard to read

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.200
because it's different
[inaudible].

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Sure.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.460
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: And also,
it was, I didn't see anything

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:10.250
like this and I decided that's
another rabbit hole to go back

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:15.510
to for sure but we do have
some letters in the files

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.280
in the Office of the Curator
of the Capitol that talk

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.730
about certain senators checking
out books on behalf of Brumidi.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.380
So Brumidi had a couple
of senatorial friends

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:30.680
who would check these out

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.310
but Brumidi himself had
no borrowing privileges.

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:34.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: So the
real question behind

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.330
that is would he
have had Zahn next

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.650
to him while he was
doing his art?

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.710
&gt;&gt;Elise Friedland: So
now we have to ask about,

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.560
and that's another thing I was
talking with John Cole about

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.320
but I have to do more reading
and understand but maybe one

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.260
of you guys from the
LOC can answer this.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.790
I mean, what was the
reading room like

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.740
and at this point we are
still in the Capitol Building.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.700
Could he have taken one of
these volumes down the hall

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.600
to his room where
he was working?

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:11.970
Didn't he have a room in
the Capitol, a studio-ish?

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I don't know that
Brumidi had his own studio.

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:20.970
I guess he had a place where he
could sort of keep his stuff.

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.580
Like the sculptors
had real studios.

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.880
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Uh huh.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But since his work
was all murals, but yes, I mean,

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.500
he had a place for his stuff.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.090
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Could
he have taken these down?

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: There were
large tables kind of running

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.070
in the center of the room

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:42.690
and I think these
were probably shelved,

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.720
to help answer your question,
these were probably shelved

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.020
as folio and not in the regular

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.320
because architecture gets
wiped out in the fire.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.620
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Right.

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: But
the folios don't

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.220
and it may have been
saved by size.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.520
So, but I think,
given the size of it,

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.820
I would guess he'd
be more inclined

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.120
to work there just
by the nature of.

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.420
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: And can an
artist bring his water colors?

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Well
that's another question.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.020
If he's.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.320
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Into
your library at that point?

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.620
&gt;&gt;Speaker 9: Well, their library
library isn't quite the same

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.920
as my library.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.220
[ Laughter ]

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.520
But if you want a contemporary
answer to that, no way.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.820
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
No, I got that.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Yeah.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.310
Maybe, I'm sure there must've
been some kind of, I'm not sure.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.130
I would imagine it wouldn't be
that difficult to make that kind

00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.790
of arrangement if need be.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.300
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And
what about [inaudible]?

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.360
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Okay,
so this is something.

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.400
I think hanging out with
Michael and these books

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.550
because every time I
come here, Michelle,

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.120
that second one is open for
you and I to look at afterwards

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.640
and Michael just
happened to open it here.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:36.540
I'm like, "Oh my God,
there are the heads!"

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.840
But there are the heads.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.320
But, we, I came in and I
said, "Michael, the books,

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.620
I want to see plate 99."

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.850
Which is way back here but,
you know, this blue thing

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:48.880
that I was talking about,
because I wanted to see

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.270
if I could, Zahn talks about
being very proud of this

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.990
in particular because, I don't
understand this well enough

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:58.340
because I don't do
color lithography

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.120
because it doesn't occur in
the Roman world but you had

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.720
to print it and then he had
to fill in some colors by hand

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.010
and I was interested to see
could I see that, you know,

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:15.010
but I'm not trained
enough to see that.

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:20.090
So I said, "Can I see plate 99?"

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:24.050
So Michael opens it and
he's like, where's plate 99.

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.350
It's missing.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:26.650
It's cut out.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:28.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, now we know
exactly what he did [laughter].

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:31.170
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Well,
except that he, wait, it's more,

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:34.620
at first we were like,
oh my God, Brumidi!

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:39.440
But these seem to
have, again, Cheryl,

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.760
these seem to have been
bound, like it's in my notes,

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.060
like 1910 or something.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: They had
been re-bound, yeah.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.660
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Okay so re-bound.

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Possibly re-bound

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.260
or may have been
re-bound [inaudible].

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.560
I would check the
inventory of the Capitol.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.860
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Right.

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.160
Well, that's what
I said to Michael.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.460
I said, "I've got to
talk to Michelle and find

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.760
out what's in the archives.

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Yeah,
I mean framed

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.360
on some senator's
office wall [laughter].

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: With
an LOC stamp.

00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: With an LOC stamp.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.260
[ Laughter ]

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.560
And they'll get a letter from
us any day now [laughter].

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
Oops, I just got myself

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.160
in trouble on multiple fronts.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.460
But anyway, that was a pretty
cool discovery we just made

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.760
standing here.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: So, how
would he have done it?

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.970
Are you suggesting he would
have the book there in the room

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.870
and designed it on the wall?

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:18.170
He would've sketched
it on the wall

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:20.360
or he would've sketched
it down in advance?

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.660
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: We
know that he had cartoons

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.960
that he sketched out in advance.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.800
So we have this one watercolor
that is in the Archives

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.970
of the Architect of the Capitol,
that was his proposal to Meigs.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.980
But what's really lovely,

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.940
and then he would make larger
cartoons and transfer them

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.460
to the wall and blah,
blah, blah, right?

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:43.410
But what's really interesting
about this is that he,

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.730
in a sense, is mirroring
what Zahn used to do.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:50.510
So one of the things that I
read about that's so important

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:55.050
about Zahn's books is that Zahn
was standing there in front

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.210
of these walls, right?

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:03.060
And so what he would do was
put tracing paper on there and,

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.850
you know, take down the design.

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.360
I'm going, don't look,
you'll get dizzy.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.370
I'm going back to my whole wall.

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:12.670
Okay, here.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:18.500
And then he could
transfer that to the stones

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.010
to create these lithographs,
right?

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:24.850
So that was the allure
of lithography, right?

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:31.010
It took out an intermediary step
going to a copper plate, right,

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:36.620
that would therefore make the
resulting print less direct,

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.730
less of an exact
copy if you will.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.520
This is going to get really
complicated because you're going

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.990
to get into the whole issue
of copies and copying,

01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:46.590
which is a total nightmare.

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:49.230
I know enough about
that from Roman copies

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.820
of Greek originals, right?

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.490
so this is going to get dicey

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.260
because any time you
start is this a copy,

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.260
how accurate is Zahn, blah,
blah, blah, well, you know,

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.090
some of these wall paintings
we don't have anymore

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.390
so how do we know?

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.690
Some of them we do.

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:03.530
In any event, that's
kind of neat

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:05.180
because that's how
Zahn was creating these

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.730
and that was the
lure of lithography

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:09.650
and that's why he wanted to
use this medium and he worked

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:13.310
so hard to push the medium
to create these volumes.

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:14.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So
he's the first one

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:18.550
to really record color
in that way, I guess.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.970
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
He certainly, yes.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:21.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Paintings that
were water colors probably.

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:23.130
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Yes.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.500
I'm going to be careful.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.690
Like, come back to me
in like, after the end

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:28.990
of the summer once I've waded

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.780
through several more German
articles on this topic

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.490
and also I don't know
enough about print making.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:36.920
My last job was in a Department
of Art and Art History

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.840
and my office was across
from the print studio

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.600
and I was friends
with that professor

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.770
but I did not pay enough
attention [laughter].

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:44.400
And she is now at
the University,

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.910
I was telling Michael, she
is now at the University

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.440
of Richmond, that's right there.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.060
I'm calling Ms. Tonya
[inaudible] and I'm going

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.770
to say, "Can I come
for the weekend

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:53.040
and can you teach me
all about lithography."

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.930
Because, you know,
what do I know?

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.770
Anyway, okay.

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: So
were Zahn's volumes

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.320
in the Academy de
San Luca [inaudible]?

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.620
&gt;&gt; Elise Frieldand: That's good.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.830
Hopefully [inaudible] will
reply to my email, yes.

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.910
That's a great question.

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.030
I mean, I don't know.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.400
Yeah. There is something
at National Gallery

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.160
that I just realized
that's some sort of study

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.410
of the holdings,
what does that mean?

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.000
Does that mean art or
does that mean library

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.730
of the Academy de San Luca
and that's another trail.

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.340
This is a lot of
stuff to follow up on.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.640
Yeah, I don't know.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.940
Okay?

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Sorry, one more.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.540
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Okay.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: So the color.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.140
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Yes.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Zahn's doing
an overlay and a tracing.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.740
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Mmhmm.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: When does
he put the color on?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.340
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: He
describes the color.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.640
So part of the catalogue
entries that are

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.410
so cute is that he describes.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:53.340
He'll say the wings were
yellow and the this was red

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.440
and the background was that.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Red?

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.040
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: I
know, I know, I know.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.350
I know it's not very exact.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:00.650
I know.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:04.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: And so therefore
when he recreated his work

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:08.940
in Berlin he decided
what blue would be blue

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.220
because it's a gorgeous
blue and it's a unique blue.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.720
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Mmhmm.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.060
Yeah I know.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.980
I know. I know.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.280
Mmhmm.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Cool.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.110
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: And, by
the way, there's all sorts

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:26.470
of important new research
that, and this is not

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:29.130
to effect Zahn although it's
interesting they noticed this,

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:30.990
they recognized this.

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.120
There's all sorts of new
research about the effects

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.040
of the pyroclastic flow
on the colored walls

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.240
in Pompeiian wall painting

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.620
and how some yellows turn
red, so Pompeiian red-

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Oh.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.680
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
might be, oops, you know?

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.790
And it is interesting that
something I was reading said

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:53.470
that some of these
artists noticed some

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.240
of this, like walls were-

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Transitioning.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.050
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland:
transitioning.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:59.350
That's a good way
to describe it.

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.830
Like, part of the wall
was still yellow, ochre,

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.210
and part of it, you know.

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:05.200
Anyway, so, right.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.540
It's complicated but anyway.

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.840
Okay.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.140
&gt;&gt; Michael North:
Well, thank you Elise.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.780
&gt;&gt; Elise Friedland: Thank you.
