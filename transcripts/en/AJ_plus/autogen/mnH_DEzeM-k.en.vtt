00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.060
we can't just say that we support them

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.920
and then block them from coming to the United States,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.860
or block their ability to 
do business with the rest of the world.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.900
While I am very angry about what was
done to my family and me,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.080
When the people that did this to
me were still

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.180
For as many criminal acts as this regime
will undertake,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.115
and has undertaken for years,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.840
if we truly support the democratic
aspirations of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.800
the people of Iran,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.580
we should be showing that in deed.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.680
with the rest of the world

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.060
creating a situation where their

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.945
currency tumbles in value,

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:36.280
to such an extent that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.740
My hopes for the people of Iran,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.020
are that they are able to experience

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.860
a freer, more integrated life in the future.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.520
And that they experienced less impediments

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.900
to their natural rights and aspirations

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.740
to living a life just like people in every
other country in the world.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.060
My hope also is that the powers that be in this country

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.560
and around the world realize that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.320
and help to prop those regimes up

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.380
and amplify their bad behavior.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.680
to many of these countries, 
and Iran is just one of them.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.664
I was told that I would be released

00:02:32.664 --> 00:02:35.260
in the beginning of January of 2016.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.220
While I found it hard to believe because my captors

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.120
had been so dishonest about so many different things,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.020
it made some sense.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.660
What was going on were secret negotiations for me

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.760
and other Americans being held.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.780
I understood, during that time,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.260
there are lots of
people all over the world

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.520
But their imprisonment and the
struggle over their release could

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.940
actually have larger implications 
beyond themselves.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.280
If I was gonna be on the ground telling
these stories,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.960
if I couldn't infuse the stories 
of everyday Iranians into it,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.520
Every country, every society

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.640
has some realities that we can 
see and some that we can't.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.629
We can fall very easily into
stereotyping and

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.960
the human element gets lost.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.680
But I learned over time 
that if I found

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.440
a compelling way to tell a story

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.255
and could relate it to the larger puzzle of

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.760
trying to understand this country

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.600
that has been so isolated so long and
has such

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.260
that I might have an opportunity to infuse my news stories

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.373
with some of these things.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:03.470
And I'm very proud of the work that I did for

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.840
the Post during the time that I was
working for them in Tehran.
