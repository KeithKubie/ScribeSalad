00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.490
In the last video, I showed you
that if someone were to walk

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.010
up to you and ask you what
is the arcsine-- Whoops.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.190
--arcsine of x?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.360
And so this is going to be
equal to who knows what.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.100
This is just the same thing
as saying that the sine of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.470
some angle is equal to x.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.520
And we solved it in a couple
of cases in the last example.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.230
So using the same pattern--
Let me show you this.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.810
I could have also rewritten
this as the inverse sine

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.540
of x is equal to what.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.140
These are equivalent
statements.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.480
Two ways of writing the
inverse sine function.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.790
This is more-- This is the
inverse sine function.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.460
You're not taking this to
the negative 1 power.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.340
You're just saying the sine of
what-- So what question mark--

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.920
What angle is equal to x?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.470
And we did this in
the last video.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.020
So by the same pattern, if I
were to walk up to you on the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.770
street and I were to say the
tangent of-- the inverse

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.010
tangent of x is equal to what?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.140
You should immediately in your
head say, oh he's just asking

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.080
me-- He's just saying the
tangent of some angle

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.440
is equal to x.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.380
And I just need to figure
out what that angle is.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840
So let's do an example.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
So let's say I were walk
up to you on the street.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.150
There's a lot of a walking
up on a lot of streets.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.790
I would write -- And I were
to say you what is the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.970
arctangent of minus 1?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.190
Or I could have equivalently
asked you, what is the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.510
inverse tangent of minus 1?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.190
These are equivalent questions.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.430
And what you should do is you
should, in your head-- If you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.200
don't have this memorized, you
should draw the unit circle.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.640
Actually let me just do a
refresher of what tangent

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.330
is even asking us.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.890
The tangent of theta-- this is
just the straight-up, vanilla,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.630
non-inverse function tangent
--that's equal to the sine of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.690
theta over the cosine of theta.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.670
And the sine of theta is the
y-value on the unit function--

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.010
on the unit circle.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.730
And the cosine of
theta is the x-value.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.600
And so if you draw a line--
Let me draw a little

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.110
unit circle here.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.770
So if I have a unit
circle like that.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.980
And let's say I'm
at some angle.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.940
Let's say that's
my angle theta.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.640
And this is my y-- my
coordinates x, y.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.380
We know already that
the y-value, this is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.880
the sine of theta.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.780
Let me scroll over here.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.210
Sine of theta.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.730
And we already know that this
x-value is the cosine of theta.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.200
So what's the tangent
going to be?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.670
It's going to be this distance
divided by this distance.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.970
Or from your algebra I, this
might ring a bell, because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.520
we're starting at the origin
from the point 0, 0.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.250
This is our change in y
over our change in x.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.700
Or it's our rise over run.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.950
Or you can kind of view the
tangent of theta, or it really

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.570
is, as the slope of this line.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.730
The slope.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.660
So you could write slope is
equal to the tangent of theta.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.350
So let's just bear that in mind
when we go to our example.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.550
If I'm asking you-- and I'll
rewrite it here --what is the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.600
inverse tangent of minus 1?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.880
And I'll keep rewriting it.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.440
Or the arctangent of minus 1?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.830
I'm saying what angle gives
me a slope of minus 1

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.320
on the unit circle?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.830
So let's draw the unit circle.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.960
Let's draw the unit
circle like that.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.880
Then I have my axes like that.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.440
And I want a slope of minus 1.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.450
A slope of minus 1
looks like this.

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.430
If it was like that, it
would be slope of plus 1.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.580
So what angle is this?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.710
So in order to have a slope
of minus 1, this distance is

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.580
the same as this distance.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.940
And you might already recognize
that this is a right angle.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.410
So these angles have
to be the same.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.250
So this has to be a
45 45 90 triangle.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.630
This is an isosceles triangle.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.880
These two have to add up to 90
and they have to be the same.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120
So this is 45 45 90.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.680
And if you know your 45 45 90--
Actually, you don't even have

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.250
to know the sides of it.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.440
In the previous video, we
saw that this is going

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.810
to be-- Right here.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.040
This distance is going to be
square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.610
So this coordinate in the
y-direction is minus

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.380
square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.210
And then this coordinate right
here on the x-direction is

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.500
square root of 2 over 2 because
this length right

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.960
there is that.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.430
So the square root of 2 over 2
squared plus the square root of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.170
2 over 2 squared is
equal to 1 squared.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.806
But the important thing
to realize is this is

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:50.690
a 45 45 90 triangle.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.700
So this angle right here is--
Well if you're just looking at

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.670
the triangle by itself, you
would say that this is

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.360
a 45 degree angle.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.060
But since we're going clockwise
below the x-axis, we'll call

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.980
this a minus 45 degree angle.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.710
So the tangent of minus 40--
Let me write that down.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.250
So if I'm in degrees.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.910
And that tends to
be how I think.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:25.160
So I could write the tangent of
minus 45 degrees it equals this

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.167
negative value-- minus square
root of 2 over 2 over square

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:31.200
root of 2 over 2, which
is equal to minus 1.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.670
Or I could write the arctangent
of minus 1 is equal

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.110
to minus 45 degrees.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.920
Now if we're dealing with
radians, we just have to

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.350
convert this to radians.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.530
So we multiply that times--
We get pi radians for

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.880
every 180 degrees.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.890
The degrees cancel out.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.960
So you have a 45 over 180.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.160
This goes four times.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.570
So this is equal to-- you
have the minus sign--

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.710
minus pi over 4 radians.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.450
So the arctangent of minus 1 is
equal to minus pi over 4 or the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.850
inverse tangent of minus 1 is
also equal to minus pi over 4.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.350
Now you could say, look.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.930
If I'm at minus pi
over 4, that's there.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.540
That's fine.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.360
This gives me a value of
minus 1 because the slope

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.320
of this line is minus 1.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.120
But I can keep going
around the unit circle.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.880
I could add 2 pi to this.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.890
Maybe I could add 2 pi to this
and that would also give me--

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.090
If I took the tangent of that
angle, it would also

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.640
give me minus 1.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.170
Or I could add 2 pi again and
it'll, again, give me minus 1.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.100
In fact I could go to
this point right here.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.420
And the tangent would also
give me minus 1 because

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.790
the slope is right there.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.460
And like I said in the sine--
in the inverse sine video, you

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.960
can't have a function that
has a 1 to many mapping.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.190
You can't-- Tangent inverse
of x can't map to a bunch

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.830
of different values.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.280
It can't map to
minus pi over 4.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.270
It can't map to 3-- what it
would be? --3 pi over 4.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.730
I don't know.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.310
It would be-- I'll just
say 2 pi minus pi over 4.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.200
Or 4 pi minus pi.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.550
It can't map to all of
these different things.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.740
So I have to constrict
the range on the

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.270
inverse tan function.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.570
And we'll restrict it very
similarly to the way we

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.100
restricted the sine--
the inverse sine range.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.510
We're going to restrict it to
the first and fourth quadrants.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.010
So the answer to your inverse
tangent is always going to be

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.470
something in these quadrants.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.950
But it can't be this
point and that point.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.810
Because a tangent function
becomes undefined at pi over

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.350
2 and at minus pi ever 2.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.110
Because your slope
goes vertical.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.260
You start dividing--
Your change in x is 0.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.890
You're dividing-- Your
cosine of theta goes to 0.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.560
So if you divide by
that, it's undefined.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.730
So your range-- So if I--
Let me write this down.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.430
So if I have an inverse tangent
of x, I'm going to-- Well,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.330
what are all the values that
the tangent can take on?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.800
So if I have the tangent of
theta is equal to x, what are

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.810
all the different values
that x could take on?

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.900
These are all the possible
values for the slope.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.810
And that slope can
take on anything.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.700
So x could be anywhere
between minus infinity

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.870
and positive infinity.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.250
x could pretty much
take on any value.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.050
But what about theta?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.950
Well I just said it.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.910
Theta, you can only go
from minus pi over 2 all

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.260
the way to pi over 2.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.680
And you can't even include pi
over 2 or minus pi over 2

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.790
because then you'd be vertical.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.910
So then you say your--
So if I'm just dealing

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.310
with vanilla tangent.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.470
Not the inverse.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:50.940
The domain-- Well the domain of
tangent can go multiple times

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.410
around, so let me not
make that statement.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.580
But if I want to do inverse
tangent so I don't have

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.610
a 1 to many mapping.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.870
I want to cross
out all of these.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.180
I'm going to restrict theta, or
my range, to be greater than

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:10.160
the minus pi over 2 and less
than positive pi over 2.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.710
And so if I restrict my range
to this right here and I

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.190
exclude that point
and that point.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.720
Then I can only get one answer.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.670
When I say tangent of what
gives me a slope of minus 1?

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.360
And that's the question
I'm asking right there.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.320
There's only one answer.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.320
Because if I keep-- This
one falls out of it.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.440
And obviously as I go around
and around, those fall out of

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.680
that valid range for theta
that I was giving you.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.270
And then just to kind of
make sure we did it right.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.700
Our answer was pi over 4.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.430
Let's see if we get that
when we use our calculator.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:50.340
So the inverse tangent of
minus 1 is equal to that.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.460
Let's see if that's the same
thing as minus pi over 4.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.760
Minus pi over 4 is
equal to that.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.100
So it is minus pi over 4.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.280
But it was good that we solved
it without a calculator because

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.160
it's hard to recognize
this as minus pi over 4.
