00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: My name is Ilya Eliashevsky.
I am an Android Product Manager for DataViz

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
Inc. We have actually two applications for
Android currently. We have RoadSync which

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.430
is a Microsoft exchange ActiveSync client
that provides secure, wireless and direct

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.110
push synchronization with Microsoft exchange
2003 and 2007. And it pushes your e-mail,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.500
your contacts, and now we’re demoing support
for calendar, as well. The other application

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760
that we have for Android is Documents To Go,
which is available on a wide variety of mobile

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.260
platforms as well. And Documents to go is
currently available on Android market supporting

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.410
Microsoft Word and Excel Office 2007, viewing
and editing. And what we’re demonstrating

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.000
at Google I/O is our upcoming support for
PowerPoint and PDF.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.500
&gt;&gt; So, you just used Android for this App.
Tell me what is your motivation behind choosing

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.140
Android?
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: Well, Android is a great opportunity.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.229
At DataViz we see a lot of potential behind
the current devices that are in the market,

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.170
as well as where we think some of our partners
are going to be headed with that. And it’s

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.240
just a great device, it’s really easy to
use and I think our engineers have been pleasantly

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.389
surprise with developing on Android and the
flexibility that it offers. So, we’re excited

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.570
to bring some productivity to the Android
platform.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:31.223
&gt;&gt; And so, is there any particular “war
stories” that you already collected as part

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.223
of your development for a difficult period
and how you got through that.

00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:33.810
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: Actually, it’s, you know,
it sounds cheesy but really there aren’t

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.740
too many horror stories. There’s something
that we like to see, for example, we like

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.369
to plug in to the built-in calendar and have
your exchange data go in to the same where

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.149
your Google Calendar might be synchronizing
and that’s not currently possible. But it’s

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.829
not a horror story, you know, we have clever
work around of how we’re going to be supporting

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.909
that feature. But to be honest our development
as we’ve taken some of our solution and

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.189
ported them to Android has gone a lot quicker
than we ever expected. We had prototype, the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.349
concepts for both applications and the prototype
went so quickly that we—-the project actually,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.769
it’s hard to catch up with an order to speck
out. It was almost, you know, it was nearing

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.360
completion without actually defining it, which
is totally unusual and actually great. You

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.420
know, there’s no way around that.
&gt;&gt; So, with new features were kept to date

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.159
were you able to use it in your application?
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: So, we have a couple of new

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.379
features, the primary one that probably sticks
out and is the most useful is in Documents

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.879
To Go. We’re now supporting live folders.
And what that means is that you can add on

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.590
the desktop of your Android device, you can
add a live folder for your recently used documents

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.380
in Documents To Go. So, with that and having
support for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.379
any file that you downloaded as an attachment,
or you open on an expansion card will show

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.159
up in this dynamic list. So, you have quick
access in all your files right at your fingertips.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.120
So, that’s a cool enhancement and I actually—-I’ve
been using quite a bit not just demoing but

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.060
as for traveling for the show.
&gt;&gt; What specific tips and tricks did you use

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.709
in developing your applications?
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: I’m not really sure what

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.209
tips and tricks we used. We have some clever
things that we’re doing or things that are

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.340
nice on Android. So, for example with RoadSync,
when we’re synching your contacts information

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.400
down to the device to support e-mail addresses,
home addresses, business addresses and what’s

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.200
nice is that we’re populating the built-in
contact application. We then, by default get

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.920
support for Google Maps. So, you just click
on the contacts address and it will show where

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.709
they live and how you get there. And now with
Cupcake, we’ve also added support for the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.570
on-screen keyboard and new selection mode
with Documents To Go so if you don’t have

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.139
a physical keyboard you can now access menus
and things accordingly.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.959
&gt;&gt; So, these are features that you can do
in your App that you weren’t able to do

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.829
in other platforms?
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: Well, like I said, just going

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.300
in to the built-in contacts database, the
one thing with integrating with Google Map

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.560
is nice. With RoadSync, it’s a push e-mail
solution and it also supports HTML messages.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.590
So, one of the things that we found is quite
nice and really easy to integrate with was

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.650
synchronizing HTML e-mail messages to the
device. We tapped into Google’s APIs to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.099
do that. And we’re able to turn that feature
on relatively quickly. And so, that was a

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.850
nice enhancement.
&gt;&gt; So, since you are here at I/O, is there

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.699
anything that you particularly enjoyed or
anything that’s going to stay with you when

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.430
you go back?
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: Yeah, I guess, this I particularly

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.449
enjoyed is the free HTC Magic Device that
all attendees got. And for my engineers and

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.150
my product team, this is going to stick with
me when I go back. But now it’s really good,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.930
just to be able to test a lot of these new
features that we have been showcasing on the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.750
device that supports it, it’s really good.
&gt;&gt; Well, that’s great, thank you so much.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.219
&gt;&gt; ELIASHEVSKY: All right, thanks for having
us.
