What do you have, David?

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; So with the Morgan's Law,
we take the negation on the outside and

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.330
apply individually to the predicates
on the inside, and flip the operator.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.340
So has-wings becomes not-has-wings,
not-has fur because has-fur.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.530
And the and becomes an or.
