00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.540
You know, what kinds of operations
do you want to do on binary images?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.700
So, you know, often what you
want to do is you want to separate

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.900
objects one from another, that
are sort of accidentally touching, and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.820
you want to collect together pixels
that all belong to the same object.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.220
And then another thing you might
want to do is compute the features

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.670
of a binary object.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.880
And we actually did this also.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.365
Remember we talked about hue moments,

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.125
and we were talking about
moments in general?

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:27.830
And moments are a descriptor of
the shape of a binary patch.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.279
And so, again, those are things
that you would do on binary images.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.880
So here's an example.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
This was a thresholded,
red blood cell image.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.590
And by the way in the old days,
not so old, in fact mom, sorry.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.930
My mother, I think her first job out
of college was as a medical technician.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.250
One of the things you had to do
was count white blood cells in a,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.810
under a microscope and for a certain
amount, and you would count the density.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.140
Actually, people sometimes
still do that, even today.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.780
But what you'd really like to be
able to do is spread out a bunch of

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.709
blood cells and
have a machine do the counting.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.610
How many red blood cells?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.780
How many white blood cells?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
Especially, if instead of just
doing a patient at a time,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.730
you were doing a massive study, and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.620
you had tens of thousands of
samples you wanted counted, right?

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.870
So, here's an example of taking
an image, thresholding it.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.130
And, you know,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.910
if I were to ask you to count how
many red blood cells there were,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.008
you could probably find all of the, well
let's start with one that's easy, right?

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.410
You say a-ha, here's one that's
pretty separated, no problem,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.610
here's another one.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.190
Oh, but this is a weird one,
look at that.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.120
It's got a hole in it and here are two,
those are probably two, right?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.770
But it's one blob
connected by a thin thing.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.980
So you'd really like to be able to
take this image and then fix it up.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.740
You know, because, in this particular
image, there was 63 separate

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.040
objects detected and a normal blood
cell has an area of about a 50.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.310
But you'll notice there are some things
here, where obviously there were

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.600
things that were touching each other
that were counted as single cells,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.320
when actually, they were gobs.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.110
And then there were things
that were really small, right?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.364
And so here, they were just using
the number to determine which kinds of

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:10.490
things are cells.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.063
And what you'd like to do is you'd like
to be able to separate out each one of

00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:15.540
those cells.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.470
So, we're going to do some binary
image operations to do that.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.910
And what kind of operations are there?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.470
Well, first one we're going to talk
just a little bit about is thresholding.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.132
because in some sense, in order to get
a binary image, you have to go from

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:32.477
a color or a gray-scale image
that has continuous values or,

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:36.340
lots of values to something that
just has two zero and ones.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.240
So determining a threshold
is always a challenge.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.200
Then, what you'd like to do is you'd
like to find all the pixels that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.420
are connected.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.780
And that's called connected
components analysis, and we'll,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.500
we'll talk about that, that one's used
a lot also to find independent blobs.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.070
And then you want to sometimes
improve those blobs, and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.287
that's referred to as morphology, and
we're going to talk about a variety of

00:02:57.287 --> 00:03:00.540
morphological operators, including
some of the more important ones.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.790
Then once you've done all that,
then you may compute some features

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.600
on those blobs,
like I was talking about before.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.830
Moments, areas, these kinds of things.
