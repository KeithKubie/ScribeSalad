00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.490
Kinematics is the
geometry of motion.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.150
To simplify the motion
of a pointer finger,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.310
the three finger bones are
modeled as narrow cylinders.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.870
The two joints are
modeled as small spheres

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.820
each 0.1 centimeters
in diameter--

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.980
so they show this
right over here--

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890
and rotating from the center.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.260
The finger is mapped on a
Cartesian coordinate plane.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.749
So here's the first joint
of the pointer finger,

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.290
and while I'm doing
this I'm actually

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.940
looking at the side of
my left pointer finger

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.270
and it's pointing straight up.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.247
And this is what it looks like
although my-- this top section

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:36.830
right over here is
much longer for me.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.496
It's much closer to
this middle section.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.820
But anyway let's see
what they have to say.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.740
They say the first finger
bone is 2.4 centimeters long,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.510
which actually looks about
right for mine as well.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.980
The middle finger bone is
2/3 the length of the first,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.120
so that's this length
right over here.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
And 2/3 of 2.4 is
going to be, what, 1.6.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.690
So this distance right over--
if we do that in a color

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.140
we can actually see-- this
distance right over here

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.890
is 2.4 centimeters.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.080
This distance right over
here is 2/3 of that,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.390
so that's 1.6 centimeters.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.940
And the top finger bone is 1/3
the length of the first, which

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.490
does seem short, but I'll
just go with their numbers.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.560
So 1/3 of 2.4 , this
is 0.8 centimeters--

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.270
everything we're doing
is in centimeters.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.810
The center of the
tip of the finger

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.790
goes from open at 0.5-- so
that point right over there--

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.659
to a closed fist.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.950
So when the fist is closed--
and I'm looking at my hand

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.090
doing it right over
here-- the finger

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.250
will look something like
this-- the pointer finger.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.080
And so the tip
goes to x comma y.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.930
They want us to figure out
the x-coordinate of x comma y.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.760
So maybe we don't even have to
worry about the y-coordinate.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000
So let me draw this
a little bit larger

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520
just so that we can
make sense of it.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.080
So we have this first
section of the finger.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.030
It's 2.4.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.870
So this is 2.4 centimeters and
it's completely horizontal.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.890
I'll try to draw it
as large as I can

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
so that we can make
sense of all of this.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.669
So that right over there
is 2.4 centimeters.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.000
And then it hits this joint.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.250
This joint has a radius-- or has
a diameter of 0.1 centimeters.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.160
So it's radius right over
there is 0.05 centimeters.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.490
So the entire length of this
section you see here is 2.45.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.590
So this point right over
here is at 2.45 comma 0.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.430
Then you have the
next section, which

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.730
has a length of 1.6
centimeters, and they

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.530
tell us this is a
45 degree angle.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.510
So this right over here
is 1.6 centimeters.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.650
And of course you have
that 0.05 radius again.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.310
So this entire length
is going to be 1.65.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.870
But then we have
another joint here

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.070
which we can't forget about.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.670
We have this joint
right over here.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.220
So let's draw that.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.420
So you have this
joint right over here.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.920
Draw it.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.590
It has a diameter
of 0.1 centimeters,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.170
and I'm definitely not
drawing this joint to scale.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.730
I'm just trying to make sure
we pay attention to the joint.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.910
So let me draw a
little bit better.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.370
Something like this.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.040
And once again we
have another 0.5.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.490
So this entire length, if we
were to go from this center

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.520
to that center, is
going to be 1.6.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.300
Plus these two radii, which
add up to 0.1 diameter,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.250
which is going to
be plus 0.1 which

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.310
is equal to 1.7 centimeters.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.020
So this entire side
is 1.7 centimeters.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.120
This entire side is 2.45.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.060
So plus 0.05 is equal to 2.45.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.450
And then finally
this last section--

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.080
we have a right angle here.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.560
They tell us that
this is a right angle.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.590
And this section right
over here is 0.8.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.240
This is going to be--
let me make it clear--

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.570
so this section
right over here--

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.040
if we don't count
the joint--is 0.8.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.140
But then we have of course
this 0.05 centimeters.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.620
So plus 0.05 you get this
whole length right over here.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.900
I don't want to clutter it.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.900
This whole length to
the tip right is 0.857.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.151
Now how do we figure out the
coordinate of this thing?

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:53.233
And I encourage you to
pause the video at any time

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:55.000
to try to figure
out this and really

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150
just to save us work
let's see if we can just

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.440
focus on the x-squared.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.939
And I'm just going try to come
up with an expression for it.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.900
I don't feel like using
my calculator just now.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.640
So the first thing is, let's try
to figure out an x-coordinate.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.790
Let's try to figure out the
x-coordinate for that point

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.520
right over there.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.900
So where does that point
intersect the x-axis?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.980
So essentially what is this
distance right over here?

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:31.060
What's going to be 2.45 minus
whatever this distance is?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.980
And we should be able to
use this distance given

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.510
the fact that this
is a 45 degree angle.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.790
We know this length
right over here,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.310
and this is a right triangle.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.480
We could use a little
bit of trigonometry.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.030
We know that the cosine--
relative to this angle

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.950
this is the hypotenuse
and this side is adjacent.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.710
So we know the
cosine of 45 degrees

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.574
is equal to the length
of the adjacent side.

00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:59.740
So let's say that's what
we're trying to figure out.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.525
Let's just say that's
going to be a for adjacent.

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:05.040
Now let me do this in a color
that I haven't used yet.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.540
So it's going to be equal
to the length of that side A

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.790
over the length
of the hypotenuse.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.790
Over adjacent, over hypotenuse.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.065
The hypotenuse we already
figured out is 1.7 centimeters.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:30.540
Or we could say that a is equal
to 1.7 times the cosine of 45

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.040
degrees.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.560
That's this length.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.550
So if you wanted this
x-coordinate right over here,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.260
that x-coordinate is going
to be this x-coordinate,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.650
which is 2.45 minus a.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:53.700
So minus 1.7 times the
cosine of 45 degrees-- and we

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.570
don't know what the y-coordinate
is we haven't figured that out.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.512
But the question doesn't ask us
to.-- But let's see if we can

00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:02.970
just, going with
the x-coordinates,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.344
if we can get all the way to
this x-coordinate right over

00:07:05.344 --> 00:07:06.030
here.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.480
Well this x-coordinate, is that
x-coordinate right over there.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360
And so let's see, if we
can figure out this length,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.170
we could subtract that
length from this x-coordinate

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.557
and get to this x-coordinate.

00:07:17.557 --> 00:07:19.140
And how can we figure
out that length?

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.240
Well that length's going to be
the same thing as this length

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.290
down here.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.530
And this is a completely
a horizontal line.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.020
So this is going to be parallel
to that line over there.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.430
If you view this as
a transversal of two

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.830
parallel lines if this angle
is 45 degrees I'm running out

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.440
of colors here-- if this
angle is 45 degrees,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.970
then this angle is also
going to be 45 degrees.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.020
If this is a right angle,
which it is, that's a 90--

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.680
so then this is going to
have to be 45 as well.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.844
Because 45 plus 90 plus 45
are going to be 180 degrees.

00:07:55.844 --> 00:07:57.010
We've gone completely round.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.090
We're forming a
completely straight line.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.890
So this is a 45 degree angle.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.950
How do we figure out this
length right over here?

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:20.260
Well once again, the
cosine of 45 degrees

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.530
is going to be equal to the
length of the adjacent side,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.190
which is what we
want to figure out.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.010
We don't want-- it I know
this thing's getting messy--

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.300
We want to figure out this
length right over here.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.039
It's going to be equal--
let's call that length x--

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.640
it's going to be equal to x over
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.080
That's what this 0.85 is.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.820
So that 0.85, that is the
hypotenuse right there.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.520
And my apologies
for this messiness.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.140
0.85.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:53.700
Or we get x is equal to 0.85
times the cosine of 45 degrees.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.840
So that's this length
right over here.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.440
So if we want this
x-coordinate right over here,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.185
we just subtract this
distance from this distance.

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:12.560
So the x-coordinate--
that's what

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.480
the whole problem's
going to be about.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.770
The x-coordinate is going
to be-- let me just write it

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.850
in one color-- 2.45 minus
1.7 times the cosine of 45

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.780
degrees minus this.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.840
Minus 0.85 times the
cosine of 45 degrees.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.320
And so this is going
to be equal to-- we

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.850
deserve a drum
roll-- this is going

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:38.650
to be equal to 2.45 minus--
what is this-- 2.55 times

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.880
the cosine of 45 degrees.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.550
That's going to be
the x-coordinate.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.540
And we don't know what
the y-coordinate is,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.890
but all they asked us
for is the x-coordinate.
