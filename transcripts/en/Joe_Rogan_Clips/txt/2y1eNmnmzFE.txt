Speaker 1:          00:00          Butterflies. Beautiful. It isn't that crazy. Orange and black like we love them. Love them. You find a spider. You stomp it. You would never go to a zoo and go into the moth house. If you kill a lady bug, you're an asshole. Oh, completely. You're a type of person who kills lady bugs. Yeah, but if you don't kill Roach, I can't hang out with you because you let a roach run across your kitchen floor. You like sod nom roach, sadness. I save all. Kill that fucking thing. You got a roach in your kitchen, lady? Yeah. A lady has little couple dots on it. Why are we racist with bugs? Because there's such a thing as beauty. Okay. That's why I squirrels get a pass and rats don't. Yes. Bushy tail. Yeah. Looking Kewill style, like a fringe jacket. She's a tail was just because they found that if the tails group bushy people would stop killing them.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Yeah. I mean, what's more disgusting than just a skin tail with nothing on it. Awesome. Awesome. Tail possums don't even causing any problems. They just see us doing possum. Taylor do you little fucking get you bat. We'll give a little that little hands and your little reptile tail create a little beady eyes. Disgusting. Yeah, but like we have certain animals that we liked like raccoons. Look, we don't wreck like raccoons and they're eating out of your garbage button. No. If someone had a pet raccoon, you would think that's the dopest thing ever. Can we have, we secretly want relationships. Raccoons. If they would only be nicer to us, we would embrace raccoons. Raccoons don't want to have shit to do with us. They don't. I don't get it. We got smart. We're too smart for us. We're nice to them. I'd like these people are assholes.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Just wait til they go to sleep and either trash. We'll just eat their garbage. Savory ether garbage. They put lids on it. That shit doesn't work. They've got the cool black mass. You lift the lid, you throw it aside. He pulled the bag out of hands. I know if people and say to the little tiny people, hey, I know you can grab stuff. Smoke cigarettes, hang out. Yeah. The text, they also was kill chickens. Well, so do we. Do you know who's a real predator? Skunks. Skunks are predators. There's a skunk living in the back of my yard. Whew. Sprayed my dog. Oh No, it's still there. I think so. Come on Bro. Man Up. What am I going to do? Take out the skunk hazmat suit. He'd be gun time to go to war. I got to go crawl under the thing and find them crawling to the thing.

Speaker 1:          02:22          He goes, look at this fucking hand. That shit's crazy. It's like he's flaunting. He was like, yeah, look at that, huh? His hand is so much smaller than his face. It's crazy. Imagine if your hand was that small and relationship is the size of your head. He's adorable though, isn't he? He is cute little fellow. I'm just like, look at, look, you think I've stayed out of your garbage? No Way. Look what I'm working with. Do they have opposable thumbs? Because what I'm working with didn't quite seem like now it's just like five fingers with no thumb. Right. That's the thing. They never figured out. Look at his teeth. They never figured it out like they had meetings as hands to, we just need a thumb. Let me see the teeth there. He's got his mouth open. Your that. Whoa, that. Well that would really hurt your fucking suck.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Look, one of them's chipped. If, uh, yeah, from biting you in the head. Do you think if a rocket attack do you could fight it off? No. What do you think you could stomp it? What'd you do? What'd you give up? It might cut your neck. When would you decide we're going to to the death immediately. Immediately. He wouldn't try to talk to raccoon out of this. No. Fuck off. As soon as he makes a move. I'm ready because I've been thinking about it since childhood. Oh, look at that one. I don't want that one bite my nose. Yeah. Looks like a Hyena. The raccoon I made that thing. I've been thinking these things are coming after us my whole life, so if he makes a move, it's on, Bro. Those teeth are God damn terrifying. Yes. Look at those teeth now and they're sneaky.

Speaker 1:          03:47          That's a big thing. And they're filled with rabies. Filled. Yeah, to the top. Like their balls are heavy with rates. It's just oozing out of him to water balloons. Raccoons. Is it the sensus touch? Oh, I touched you. When raccoons rely on their hands more than their eyes and going through tachy study suggested their sensitivity to touch increases when their hands are wet, which might be why they always wash their food. Wow. I just washed my hands and now I am going to touch you when you sleep. I ain't going to do you and your children where he was sleeping with my finger hand.
