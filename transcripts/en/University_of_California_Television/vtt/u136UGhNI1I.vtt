00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.820
- [Peter] So I've been spending sometime
working on this question about the role of

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.440
climate change in early human evolution. I
think the best way to frame it is that our

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.550
best understanding of this problem is
really it's this relationship between

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.420
climate and life. That is how has climate
shaped life and how has life shaped

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.020
climate. I think the best way to convince
ourselves that this is something that's in

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.480
our blood, in our entire world is to look
at a seasonal map of primary productivity

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.540
in the oceans and on land over a multiple
year period. You can see the waxing and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.270
the waning of growth on the planet
following the seasons. The planet

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.090
literally breaths with life that's paced
by just the tilt of our Earth with respect

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.890
to the plain of the. . .of it's orbit
around the sun.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.470
Also if we take the longest possible
perspective, we also find that climate

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.170
shapes life. Each of the five major mass
extinctions in life on Earth over the last

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.130
500 plus million years, each of those five
has been associated with a change in the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.470
environment. Each one of these red lines
here are where these mass extinctions

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.660
occur where-- somewhere between 50 and 90%
of all species that were alive at the time

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.780
became extinct. Some would argue that
there should be another red line there for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.860
today.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.620
So the last extinction was the extinction
of the dinosaurs and that paved the way

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.400
for the rise of mammals, and today I'm
going to be talking about this last little

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.480
sliver of time that includes our history.
So if we look at this, this history of

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.590
human evolution. This is a greatly
simplified diagram of the human phylogeny

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.460
or the family tree, and you can basically
see these sort of red, yellow and green

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.370
sections. The human family tree has
sometimes been liken to a Y-shaped pattern

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.870
or a more bushy one if you're more of a--
not so much of a lumper.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.950
So we move from a single very long-lived
lineage of Australopithecines up until

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.360
about somewhere around three million years
ago where the family tree takes a branch.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.290
One lineage, the yellow which sometimes
referred to as Paranthropus. They are sort

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.590
of the line backers of the human family
tree. They ultimately were not successful.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.360
Then the blue lineage which is our own.
That's the genus homo. It's been

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.460
described-- actually Rick Potts and I were
part of a national research council

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.130
committee to evaluate these times of human
evolution, these main times of human

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.870
evolution and appeared there are two main
periods where there's a lot of action

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.240
going on, focused intervals of time. These
include this time interval from about

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.350
three million to about 2.6 million years
ago when there are at least several things

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.410
happening at this time, the extinction of
Australopithecus afarensis otherwise known

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.490
as Lucy. Also the appearance of these two
new lineages our genus homo and the genus

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.400
Paranthropus , and this is also when the
first stone tools appears sometime around

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.630
three million years ago.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.540
Then another event occurred sometime just
after two million years ago where we see

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.670
the appearance of-- or the extinction of
early homo, the emergence of homoerectus.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.840
The first time we start seeing the
Acheulian tool kit which is a much more

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.780
sophisticated tool kit that would become
the model for future stone tools, and then

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.170
this is also the first out of Africa. The
first time our ancestors left the African

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.090
continent, it was about 1.8 million years
ago.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.600
The point of my discussion today is to ask
this question, "If climate is shaping

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.310
life, did it also shape human origins?"
The question here really is not so much

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.490
just asking this question, "Did climate
shape life?" Did it shape human evolution.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.970
But really we have to ask the primary
question which is "How did African climate

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.690
change?"
That turned out to be a really challenging

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.050
problem for a number of very reasonable
reasons.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.100
So I'll let you know that the aim of this
talk is really to illuminate these two

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.060
main ways that African climate has changed
in the past. One is that, there have been

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.680
these very regular pendulum swings, if you
will, very rapid in geologic time roughly

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.050
every 20,000 years where African climate
oscelated between wet and dry conditions,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.450
and it's been like a pace maker throughout
millions and millions of years. The other

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.460
thing that's happened, super imposed on
these wet/dry cycles is this long term

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.150
shift toward more open, arid conditions.
So if you allow your mind's eye to

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.570
envision East Africa right now, you're
probably thinking about the Serengeti or

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:50.010
these open fields of grasses. That
ecosystem is actually a geologically very

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.420
recent phenomenon, only a couple of
million years old.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.260
So when we look at the past African
climate change, we see that variations in

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.360
the strength of the African monsoon have
been paced by variations in orbital

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.500
procession. This is basically that the
Earth has a wobble, wobble in it's orbit.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.180
Our northern hemisphere, our star Polaris
right now-- The orbiting star 10,000 years

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.340
ago was actually the star Vega which is
about 47 and a half degrees off in the

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.260
other direction. The Earth sweeps out--
The Earth's rotation actually sweeps out a

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.470
cone in the celestial sphere on a
20,000-year beat. What that does on Earth

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.720
is it changes the seasonal distribution of
sunlight such that over Africa, the

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.420
northern hemisphere summers would have
been about 7% more sunlight, and the

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.680
winters would have exactly the amount
less. What this means for Africa is that

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.980
it strengthens, invigorates the African
monsoon with this 20,000-year beat. It

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.370
acts really like a volume knob on the
strength of the monsoon. So these

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.160
intervals in green that are shown here
would be times of what we call an African

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.480
humid period of time when it would have
been wetter in the past. You'll see that

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.330
they would been paced at this 20-year beat
throughout this time period.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.510
Now we know this is actually true, so this
is actually predicted from theory and

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.290
what's amazing-- and this is one of the
reasons why I work in this field is that

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.990
when we actually look at the geologic
record for this, it shows that there were

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.050
these wet periods in the time. This is
actually from a sediment core in the

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.160
eastern Mediterranean where a sediment
core was drilled in this location. This is

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.520
a 10-meter core. This is one and a half
meters then it connects with the top up

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.550
there. The base of this connects to top of
there and so on. You can see that it has

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.630
these black and white layers. The black
layers are these organic rich sediments

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.090
that accumulated when the Nile river
outflow was much, much greater than today.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.670
So that made for anoxic, or low oxygen
conditions in the bottom of the

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.340
Mediterranean. So just like if you turn
off the bubbler on your fish tank, all the

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.470
fish die and the organic matter goes to
the bottom. That's what happened during

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.380
each one of these events. It happens not
only for this time period here

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.290
representing maybe 200,000 years of time,
but actually for millions of years.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.330
This is actually a record, this is
actually an outcrop that we see in Sicily.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.600
It's actually a shot from a bar in Sicily,
and these are actually people. These are

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.210
actually people working on this outcrop.
You can barely see it that little red dot,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.460
and each of these dark layers is one of
these sapropel units. You can see how

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.130
they're bundled into groups of four and
five which is this eccentricity modulation

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.430
of these processional cycles. Each one of
these dark layers would be at 20,000 years

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.940
apart. This represents one million years
of time going back 10 million years ago.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.650
So this has just been a heart bit of
African climate change going on for

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.090
millions and millions of years unbroken.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:40.580
So if we look at Lake Turkana for example,
Lake Turkana in Northern Kenya is nestled

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.590
in a desert environment today, but if you
go to the shores of Lake Turkana you'll

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.600
see these bathtub rings where Lake Turkana
was 50 meters or a 150 feet higher than it

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.630
is today during one of these wet phases
10,000 years ago. That's just one of these

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.820
little bars at the very top. You can see
there have been just hundreds of these in

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.870
the past. So African climate has been
nothing but continuously varying between

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.750
wet and dry, and wet and dry.
So we look at the grassland expansion,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.890
this is the second way that African
climate has changed over the time scale of

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.840
early human evolution. Again, I'll show
you this image if this grasslands from

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.530
East Africa. This actually cover something
between 80 and 90% of the East African

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:23.440
landscape today. This envision of, let's
say, of the Serengeti, this vision that we

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.080
all have of East Africa is actually a very
recent geological development. It's only

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.550
about two to three million years old.
What's interesting about the Savanna

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.990
grasslands is that they represent a very
specific ecological adaptation to a very

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:43.840
specific environment. That environment is
hot, dry, very seasonal rainfall and low

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.620
carbon dioxide. In fact the photosynthetic
pathway that-- this is called C4 because

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.150
it represents the four carbon compound
that's developed through photosynthesis

00:10:53.150 --> 00:11:00.720
versus the three carbon compound. The C4
molecules or the C4 photosynthesis is

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.990
adapted to very high temperature and low
atmospheric CO2 and generally dry

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:11.610
conditions. So these constitute the
tropical grasses that dominate Africa but

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.000
particularly East Africa today.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.110
They're there because the environment is
very harsh. It's dry and seasonally moist,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:26.650
only moist seasonally and it's also during
low CO2 environments. So how can we

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.900
reconstruct how vegetation has changed in
the past? Well the first thing that you

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.220
might say is, "Why don't we just look at
pollen?" The problem with working with

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.720
pollen is that pollen's often not very
well preserved in sediments. Any kind of

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.100
oxygenating environment, depositional
environment, the pollen will disappear. So

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.650
we have a much more elegant way to explore
it, which actually exploits the way that

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.920
photo-- the biochemical way in which the
photosynthesis works using the C4 pathway.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.390
So this is a brief overview of carbon
isotopes. These are the two stable

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.200
isotopes of carbon.
Carbon-14 is the radioactive or unstable

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.420
isotope of carbon. Carbon12, most of our
bodies are made up of that 90-- 99% of

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:14.440
our-- carbon in our bodies is carbon-12.
This is the most common isotopes of

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.130
carbon. Then carbon-13 is only about one
in 100, about 1% of the carbon in the

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:26.060
environment. What we do is we measure the
ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 using a

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.120
mass spectrometer and then express that
ratio as a change relative to a standard

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.910
using this equation. This is the only
equation I'll show for the day, but this

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.040
notation that we'll be talking about. So
what we see here is that the C3 versus C4

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.650
plant signatures, the grasslands have a
much more enriched or more positive C4,

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:53.030
carbon isotope value than do C3 plants. C3
plants would be trees and everything else,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.000
and C4 plants in the tropics are going to
be these Savanna grasses.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.330
If we jump forward to a really heroic
collaboration that existed with Naomi

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:09.870
Levin and Terry Cerling over the past
decade or so, they've measured carbon

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.140
isotope values from soil carbonates which
are these little carbonate nodules that

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.840
form in soils that record the
photosynthetic pathway of the plants that

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.160
are above them. So you go to a geologic
outcrop, you collect these soil carbonates

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.450
and you measure their soil carbonate. That
tells you what the vegetation was at the

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:32.120
time that thing that formed. What you can
see is this transition from lower values

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.120
to higher values, meaning an increase in
the grasslands. This transition is almost

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.000
about a 50% increase in grass cover, and
you can see that the time in that

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.830
transition is sometime around-- somewhere
between three and two million yeas ago.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.810
Compare that to this record of the
sapropels where you get very rapid cycling

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.880
between wet and dry conditions. So this is
a secular change. This is a very rapid

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.680
back and forth kind of like a pendulum
change. So the way that we can now explore

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.980
past vegetation changes, it's actually
very beautiful forensic tool that was

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.880
developed which allows us to look at
fossils, but these are not megascopic

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.290
fossils.
These are not fossil skulls, they're not

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.180
fossil shells, they're not fossil paleosol
carbonate nodules. These are actually

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.810
fossil molecules. The molecules derived
from plants, from ancient plants. All

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.630
higher plants have epicuticular waxes,
that is you waxes on the outer surface of

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.170
the leaves. You've seen a rubber plant?
That's nothing but wax on the outside.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:37.120
Those waxy molecules are very robust. They
last for a very long time. So we can take

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.590
a sediment. We can basically crush it and
then put it in something that looks for

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.100
all the world like an espresso maker but
it has very nasty solvents inside of it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.090
We'll extract the straw colored liquid
which is loaded with these plant wax

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.640
molecules. Loaded meaning one in a billion
of the carbon molecules in here will be

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.380
plant waxes. So they're not really loaded
but they're sort of loaded. When we look

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.330
at them, we can actually measure with a
chromatography what the compounds are, and

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.640
when you see these interdigitation between
low and high peaks, that just shouts at

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.700
you. It looks like a hand and it says, "I
am from a plant." This class of

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.170
molecules, this class of compounds are all
derived from photosynthesis.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:23.300
So what we can do is then we can take each
of these peaks and instead of blowing that

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.570
carbon out into the atmosphere, we then
direct it into a mass spectrometer. We

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.550
measure the carbon ratio of those
compounds, and that's how we can figure

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:37.230
out whether that fossil plant that made
those leaf waxes was a C3 or C4 plant.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.940
My student Sarah Feakins is now a tenured
professor at USC, did this at an ocean

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.900
drilling programs site here in the Gulf of
Aden. A place is very difficult to go to

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.770
today. This is the extent of Savanna
grasses there today. This is her record

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.680
of-- basically a snapshot record from the
site. You can see it shows that same

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.603
trend, that same increase in values
indicating the emergence of the

00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:04.701
grasslands.
So if you can pair her record to Naomi

00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:09.699
Levin's record, you see they both have
this transition. This both sort of secular

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:14.790
transition toward greater grasslands.
What's impressive is that these times,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.620
these green periods are the same green
periods of major events in human

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.730
evolution. You can see that these
transitions toward an initial expansion in

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.620
grasslands after about three million years
ago and then really their establishment at

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.290
around two million years ago is coincident
with some changes that we're seeing in

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.000
early human evolution.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.810
What for me was the biggest, the most
exciting discovery in this relationship

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.050
between climate change and human evolution
was what showed up in the proceedings of

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.370
the National Academy of Sciences about a
year and a half ago by Terry Cerling but

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.080
also a number of co-authors contributed to
this study. So these are the same records

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.760
that I showed earlier. This increase in
the indicators for grasses some time after

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.940
three million-- reaching peak values
around two million. So this is basically

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.230
the same figures that I showed earlier.
What Terry did and his colleagues, what

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.710
they did was to measure the carbon
isotopes of the tooth enamel in fossil

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:17.670
skulls. So they took the teeth and they
analyzed the carbon isotopes of the teeth,

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:23.670
and you are what you eat. You would see
this relationship. You can see that when

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.870
you look at early-- the ancestral humans
or ancestral hominids, you can see they're

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:34.200
basically tracking the environment. If the
environment changes, your chemistry

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.570
changes. So basically the hominids are
just tracking the environment. You say,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.130
"Okay, we're done." Right? It's working,
I mean basically they're just following

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.990
the environment. You can also say, "People
couldn't care less about the environment

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.050
because look, they're just tracking the
environment." Watch what happens. The one

00:17:52.050 --> 00:18:00.170
group that doesn't do that is us. These
blue dots are carbon isotopic analysis of

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:06.410
early and late members of the genus homo.
You can see that they are falling away

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:11.220
from their other lineage Paranthropus
which they shared the landscape with. So

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.140
Paranthropus , their diet was mainly
derived from grasses, from Savanna

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:21.710
grasses. Homo, early homo got-- had a more
variable diet and they were able basically

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:27.650
to extract a flexible diet from an
increasingly inflexible landscape.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.680
So more to come soon, this is my post doc,
Kevin Uno for those of you who want to see

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.490
some truly spectacular new results. I'm
happy to talk about that. But really, Rick

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.640
Potts and Andy Cohen have been leaders
because they've led a drilling program up

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.800
and down in the riff valley collecting
more, and more, and more of these sediment

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.960
archives. So what I'm showing you is just
a teaser for what they're about to do. So

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.400
thank you very much Charlie.
