00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.414
This is StarTalk, I'm your
host, Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:08.444
your personal astrophysicist,
and today's episode

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:13.414
is Cosmic Queries -
The Out There Edition.

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:16.624
We're talking about
not just astrophysics

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:21.494
but the extremes of
astrophysics - in space, time,

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:23.194
and dimensions.

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.234
While I have some
expertise on that topic,

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.794
I don't have all the
expertise necessary

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.804
to pull this off, so
we called in my friend

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:31.034
and colleague Janna Levin,

00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:32.974
Janna.
- Neil, hey!

00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:35.544
- Okay, thank you for coming.
- I love being here.

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:37.544
- Not your first rodeo.
- Yeah, not my first rodeo,

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:39.644
but I haven't been in your
office in a long time.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.014
- Okay, well,
- It's fun to see it.

00:00:41.014 --> 00:00:42.484
- It's gotten messier.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:43.984
- Yeah.
- Just so you know.

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:46.384
- In kind of a good way,
almost like a, I don't know,

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.654
curatorial way. (laughing)

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.154
- A curatorial way.

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:50.954
- And helping me bring
some levity to this topic

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.894
is the one and only Harrison
Greenbaum, Harrison.

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:55.394
- How you doing?
- Welcome.

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:57.194
- I do think we need to
get Marie Kondo up in here.

00:00:57.194 --> 00:00:58.494
- Oh really? (laughs)

00:00:58.494 --> 00:00:59.794
- To see which things spark joy.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:00.864
(all laugh)

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:02.004
- It all sparks joy.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.434
- There's a
conflagration of joy.

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:05.904
- Get the hell out of my office.

00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:07.174
- Exactly.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:08.404
We'll barricade,
we'll barricade it.

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:10.074
(all laugh)

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.974
- So you're a comedian
and a magician.

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:14.974
- Yes, absolutely.
- That's crazy,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.584
dude, stay here, I don't
want you to disappear.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:19.054
- Classic double threat.

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:20.584
- And don't make my guest
disappear today, right?

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.484
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:24.324
- I use my powers for
good, I'm a good witch.

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:27.154
- [Neil] And so we'll find
you at HarrisonGreenbaum.com.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.694
- Yeah absolutely.

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:29.894
- Your tour schedule
and everything.

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:30.824
- And also maybe Comedy
Central will book me

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.734
if this is my website dot com.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:33.994
Which I did register.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.264
- Oh really.

00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:36.234
(all laughing)

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:37.834
We all froze for a second.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:38.674
(laughs)

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:39.934
It's a very long domain,

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:40.904
for some reason
it was available.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:41.704
- There was a real beat there.

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:43.274
- Yeah (laughs)

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:46.174
- So Janna, you're an expert
on the large scale universe,

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:50.644
on black holes, your recent
book was Black Hole Blues,

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:51.914
was that?
- Yeah.

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:53.384
You know you've said it
better than anyone ever.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.524
I once got you to say the
whole title which you might not

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:57.184
remember was Black Hole
Blues and Other Songs

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.384
from Outer Space,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.024
and you did your
best DJ voice, Neil.

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.024
I can't... I don't even
know if I have it recorded.

00:02:02.024 --> 00:02:02.864
- [Neil] Really.

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:04.364
- Yeah.

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:05.364
- Let me try it again.

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:06.364
(Janna laughs)

00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:07.464
The Black Hole Blues ,

00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:08.904
wait a minute,

00:02:08.904 --> 00:02:09.834
- [Janna] and Other
Songs from Outer Space

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:11.304
- And other songs from outer--

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:15.544
The Black Hole Blues and
Other Songs from Outer Space

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:16.974
(laughing)

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:18.104
does that work for ya?

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.344
- Really working for me.

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:21.444
- You can put that on
your ringtone. (laughs)

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:22.684
- Exactly.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:23.614
- I'm a big fan of
the blues in general

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:25.954
so I was enchanted by the title.

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:27.514
So Harrison, if you remember,

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.954
this is also not
your first rodeo,

00:02:28.954 --> 00:02:31.384
but you're not a
regular on the show.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.124
For Cosmic Queries,

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:35.694
we solicit questions
from our fan base

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:37.624
through all the social
media channels and then some

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:41.394
and you the co-host
are the only one

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.634
who's seen these questions.

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:43.964
I haven't seen them,
Janna hasn't seen them,

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.434
and you're just gonna read them,

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.834
and Janna and I will
try to answer them,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.544
and if we can't answer
it we'll just say,

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.704
I'll say I don't know, she's
not gonna say I don't know

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.014
'cause this is--

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:53.944
- Yeah I might just
make some stuff up.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:54.974
(all laughing)

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.284
- Make some stuff up.

00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:57.284
- Who's gonna call me out on it?

00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:58.214
- I will call your stuff out,

00:02:58.214 --> 00:02:59.414
maybe I'll call you out on it.

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:00.654
- By then I'll be
home. (laughing)

00:03:00.654 --> 00:03:02.224
- So Harrison, so what
do you have for us?

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:03.324
- Since you haven't seen these

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:04.954
I could just be making these up.

00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:06.154
- That's true, too.

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:06.924
- That would be hard
though, I think.

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:07.924
Yeah, yeah, alright.

00:03:07.924 --> 00:03:09.564
- Alright so we'll start with--

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.664
- We got goood people who
listen in our stuff so.

00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:11.894
- The first question says

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:13.164
how do you make
Harrison a regular?

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:14.364
(all laughing)

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:15.304
I didn't know if that
came from my mom.

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:16.834
Definitely on the G.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.164
No, so here's a
Patreon question,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.174
- [Neil] Patreon.

00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:21.404
- Yes.

00:03:21.404 --> 00:03:22.874
- Oh so you out of
all those questions

00:03:22.874 --> 00:03:24.244
you went and found the Patreon
question and put it first.

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:25.444
- Absolutely, every time.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:26.874
- That is kissing
ass, you realize this.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:27.914
- Gotta do it.

00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:28.844
- Okay.

00:03:28.844 --> 00:03:30.944
- Zachary Spradlen from Patreon,

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.414
and thank you for supporting.

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:35.554
The question is, given your
vast knowledge of physics

00:03:35.554 --> 00:03:37.184
I'm sure they're talking to me,

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:38.694
(Neil laughing)

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.154
What are your thoughts on
a holographic universe?

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:42.024
Would 100% empirical evidence
of a holographic universe

00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:44.894
change how you behave
on a day-to-day basis?

00:03:44.894 --> 00:03:47.764
Imagine if we could
access the universal

00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:49.504
holographic database.

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:51.034
- [Neil and Janna] Ooh.

00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:52.004
- That's a good one.

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:53.774
- That's like a three-parter.

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:56.274
- Now Janna, I've tried to
fully understand the holographic

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.604
universe and I only kind of
skimmed the surface of it

00:03:58.604 --> 00:03:59.544
so if you have a deeper,

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:00.814
- It's pretty spectacular.

00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:01.874
- If you have a
deeper sense of this

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.414
I would totally wanna know.

00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:05.554
- Yeah, it's not something I
specifically have worked on

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:07.814
but I've paid very
close attention to it

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.484
in the hopes that one day
I'll have a good enough idea

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:11.454
to actually jump in the fray.

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:12.724
So the way that--

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.354
- Just to be clear, so
when you do your work,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.024
you're a theorist, and you're--

00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:17.594
- [Janna] Very pen and
paper, old fashioned.

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:19.064
- Old fashioned, wow.

00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:21.164
- [Janna] Totally old
fashioned, pen and paper.

00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:22.434
- So you're really
cheap. (laughing)

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:23.804
You're a not
expensive scientist.

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:25.534
- If you want to
give me a grant,

00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:27.674
I can do my research.

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:29.144
- Couple thousand dollars.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.104
- Seriously, lowest level
in terms of equipment

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.344
and supplies.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:33.274
- I think somebody'll
buy you a Mac Book.

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.774
I feel like somebody out there--

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.714
- At least an iPad.

00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:36.944
- Yeah.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.854
- And that's only to
check my social media.

00:04:38.854 --> 00:04:41.314
- A very large iPhone,
we can get this done.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.984
- We, you and I got
this, we got this.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.024
So just so people know,
you're a professor

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:47.624
of astrophysics
at Barnard College

00:04:47.624 --> 00:04:49.794
at Columbia University, which
is right up the street here,

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:51.624
which is great.
- Right up the street, yeah.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.794
- Okay, so go on.

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:53.894
- So--

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:55.094
- [Neil] The
holographic universe.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.564
- So a hologram, the
whole idea of a hologram

00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:58.334
is that you really have
two-dimensional information

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.704
but it creates the illusion
of being three-dimensional.

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:02.504
That's just what
a hologram means.

00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:03.704
- Yeah 'cause when
you look at it,

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.074
like your credit card
might have a holographic

00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:07.014
bird on it--

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:08.474
- [Janna] Right, but it's

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.844
a two dimensional object.
- My binder in middle school.

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:11.344
- It works in two dimensions
because it's flat.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.114
- It's flat, but it looks like
a full three-volumed thing,

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:16.384
okay, so the reason why
these physicists coined it

00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:20.094
holographic is precisely
because they're imagining

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:23.024
that all of the information
that is required

00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:24.924
to understand the
universe can be encoded

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.834
on just a surface as opposed
to in the full space.

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:30.304
So for a black hole this arose

00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:32.064
because if you
look, a black hole

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:35.074
doesn't physically have
anything at its surface,

00:05:35.074 --> 00:05:36.944
but we imagine the event
horizon as a surface,

00:05:36.944 --> 00:05:40.474
the region beyond which
no information can escape.

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:44.014
And the idea was that
everything about the black hole

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:45.614
that all the
information a black hole

00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:49.524
could possibly contain is
equivalent to the amount

00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:52.154
of information that can
be packed on the surface

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:53.694
and nothing more

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:56.694
and you cannot, and they've
proven this over many years,

00:05:56.694 --> 00:06:00.294
back since Hawking, you
cannot have more information

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:02.364
than the information you
can pack on the surface.

00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:04.034
And the reason
why this becomes--

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:05.264
- You're saying

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.734
more information can't
get into the black hole

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.204
than can be stored on the
surface of the event horizon.

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:11.304
- Yes, that you can prove
that the information

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.944
content of the black hole
scales like the surface area

00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:15.174
of the black hole,
the event horizon,

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:16.514
and not like the volume.

00:06:16.514 --> 00:06:19.214
And so the idea would be,

00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:21.114
well we could maybe
make an object--

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.424
- He shook his head yeah,

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.624
get that calculation.

00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:24.454
- I used to have those
hologram stickers,

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:26.824
of like, cats,

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:29.794
does that get me anywhere
close to understanding?

00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:32.864
- So you know it's one thing
to kind of think about that

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:34.764
but then it took really
years before people

00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:36.534
like Leonard Susskind
started saying,

00:06:36.534 --> 00:06:37.464
"Oh wait--"

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.564
- Is he a physicist at Stanford?

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.774
- He's a physicist at Stanford

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.434
and just an incredibly
creative thinker.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.574
- [Neil] Larry Susskind.

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:44.804
- Yeah and great New
Yorker from the Bronx.

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.544
He was a--
- Bronx in the house

00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:48.544
- Yeah.

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:49.544
- BX.

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:50.584
- Bronx in the hologram.

00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:51.644
- I love Lenny's accent.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.414
- We brought him a hat up there

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:54.914
I don't know if it
shows up in the thing.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.184
- He's got that tough
guy accent still.

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:58.354
So he really started
to think about this

00:06:58.354 --> 00:07:00.994
like let's say I try
to have information

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:02.524
that actually scales
like the volume

00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:04.264
like so that would be
a lot more information

00:07:04.264 --> 00:07:06.364
than you would think you
could pack on the surface

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.034
and you can prove that,
well then you'd just make

00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:09.464
a black hole, and we
know about black holes

00:07:09.464 --> 00:07:13.004
fundamentally that you
cannot have more information

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:15.334
in the black hole than you
can put on the surface.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.674
- But what does it mean to
put information on a surface

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:18.974
that does not exist?

00:07:18.974 --> 00:07:21.814
- That's very subtle,
so it's really the idea,

00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:23.344
there's two ways of saying it.

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.284
One is to just say, oh,
the information content

00:07:25.284 --> 00:07:28.354
of the black hole has been
proven to scale like the area

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:30.454
and then the string
theorists started to think

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:32.994
well maybe that physically
means it's like there

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.424
on the horizon,

00:07:34.424 --> 00:07:36.224
- [Neil] The event horizon.

00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:37.694
- The event horizon, that
as something falls into

00:07:37.694 --> 00:07:40.794
the black hole, it might
appear to the poor astronaut

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.364
that thinks they're
falling into the black hole

00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:45.104
that they have crossed
the event horizon

00:07:45.104 --> 00:07:46.874
and met their fate
in the interior

00:07:46.874 --> 00:07:49.374
but to us on the
outside it may appear,

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:50.774
and this is a string
theory suggestion,

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:54.174
that it's actually physically
smeared on the outside,

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.914
in the quantum string
states that are permitted

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:00.514
on the outside, and that
it never gets inside.

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.454
- So what about the
fact that if I watched

00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:02.384
someone fall into a black hole,

00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:04.854
I see their time slow down?

00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:07.654
And at the event
horizon it has stopped.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.124
- [Janna] Exactly.

00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:10.864
- So can we say that all
this stops at the black hole

00:08:10.864 --> 00:08:12.294
as far as I can see?

00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:14.334
- I mean it certainly is
driven by some of those early

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:17.134
confusion about that.

00:08:17.134 --> 00:08:20.134
So it does seem, as far as we're
concerned it never crosses.

00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:24.244
But to the astronaut themselves,

00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:25.814
- They just fall straight--
- they sail right through.

00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:30.414
So it's literally suggesting,
like quantum complementarity

00:08:30.414 --> 00:08:32.144
created this whole,
there are two things

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.554
that seem incompatible that
can exist at the same time.

00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:36.954
It's literally suggesting that
the astronaut both falls in

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.054
and does not.

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:39.494
- And is smeared on the surface.

00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:41.054
- And is smeared on the
surface, but there's no single

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.524
person in the universe
who would be able

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.864
to experience both things,
so no single person

00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:48.134
has a contradiction.

00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:50.734
Woo, I say it's--

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:52.234
- When you talk about encoding
information on the surface

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:54.204
do you mean like the way like
there's a California tattoo

00:08:54.204 --> 00:08:55.334
on Adam Levine?

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.604
(Janna and Neil laughing)

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:57.904
Where we know he's
from, California?

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.574
- He's only tattoos on
the surface, it just--

00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:01.714
- That's all he is,
there's nothing inside.

00:09:01.714 --> 00:09:03.844
- It looks like a
three-dimensional body

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.814
but it's really
just skin tattoos.

00:09:05.814 --> 00:09:07.384
- Okay.

00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:09.154
- So tell me something,
if I think people

00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:12.284
freeze at the surface,
then they're not living out

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:14.654
their lives, we're
living out our lives,

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:15.694
how could we be in the,

00:09:15.694 --> 00:09:17.194
every hologram I've seen,

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:19.864
it's a frozen image, it's not,

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:22.194
or it repeats in
some trivial way.

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.234
- So that's what we would see,

00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:24.504
we would see them freeze.

00:09:24.504 --> 00:09:27.174
- But I'm not frozen, so
how can I be a hologram?

00:09:27.174 --> 00:09:29.474
- So oh, I see what
you're talking,

00:09:29.474 --> 00:09:30.674
so it would be--

00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:32.674
- Wait, wait, I don't
think I'm frozen.

00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:34.074
(Janna and Harrison laughing)

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:34.874
- So you--

00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:37.784
- It's like the end of the Mary
Tyler Moore opening credits

00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:39.314
where she like
freezes with the hat?

00:09:39.314 --> 00:09:40.554
- Oh she freezes there
when she flips up her hat.

00:09:40.554 --> 00:09:41.814
- Right, is that what
we're talking about?

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:42.484
- Actually, how old
are you? (laughing)

00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:44.354
- I have no age.

00:09:44.354 --> 00:09:46.424
- You're just a fan
of Mary Tyler Moore.

00:09:46.424 --> 00:09:47.694
- Yeah.

00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:49.124
- She was off the air since

00:09:49.124 --> 00:09:50.294
- We're at the edge of a
black hole so my life is just

00:09:50.294 --> 00:09:51.694
- Since 1872 that
show's been off the air

00:09:51.694 --> 00:09:53.234
I just want you to know.

00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:54.994
- So I would say the idea
that holograms are frozen

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.264
is just a technology problem.

00:09:56.264 --> 00:09:58.064
You certainly could
make a hologram

00:09:58.064 --> 00:10:00.334
that was updating the
information on the surface

00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:01.634
and therefore moving in time

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.174
so it doesn't have to be
frozen to be a hologram

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:06.014
but it does have to
be two-dimensional

00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:09.544
and nonetheless appear
three-dimensional.

00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:12.284
- Why can't we be a
three-dimensional hologram

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:13.784
of a four-dimensional
space? That's good, huh?

00:10:13.784 --> 00:10:14.614
- Um, well, that's not bad--

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.454
- That was very good.

00:10:15.454 --> 00:10:16.254
- Not bad, Neil.

00:10:17.454 --> 00:10:18.884
- If a hologram is
one dimension less.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.224
- Yes, it could be the case

00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:21.554
that there's definitely--

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.394
- And are we four dimensions?

00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:23.594
- Well because

00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:24.564
- Three spaces in one time?

00:10:24.564 --> 00:10:25.764
- Yeah, so there...

00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:26.994
- [Neil] Don't go back
on us on that one.

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:28.494
- I'm not goin' back
on you on that one

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.434
but there is some confusion
about that time dimension

00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:31.904
but you know,

00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:32.904
- [Neil] Whether it behaves
as a space dimension.

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:34.674
- It clearly does to some extent

00:10:34.674 --> 00:10:35.844
- Whether it is a
full-blooded space dimension.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.074
- But to some extent it doesn't

00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:37.804
because I can turn
left and right

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:38.644
- in space

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:39.914
- but I can't, in space,

00:10:39.914 --> 00:10:40.974
- I don't think my
car has that setting

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.314
(Janna and Neil laughing)

00:10:43.314 --> 00:10:46.284
but I can't go forward and
backward in time, right?

00:10:46.284 --> 00:10:47.954
So I can't do both
directions in time.

00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:48.784
- You have mobility
in space coordinates

00:10:48.784 --> 00:10:49.624
and not in your time.

00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:52.854
- And I can see things
in both directions.

00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:54.594
I can see something to the
right, and I can see something

00:10:54.594 --> 00:10:56.024
to the left.

00:10:56.024 --> 00:10:58.064
I can see something in the
past, whereas all light travels

00:10:58.064 --> 00:10:59.464
to the universe and gets to me,

00:10:59.464 --> 00:11:00.994
but I can not see
something from the future.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:05.334
- So we are prisoners
of the present,

00:11:05.334 --> 00:11:10.344
forever trapped between
a past we cannot access

00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:11.904
and a future we cannot see.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:12.844
(Janna laughs)

00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:14.274
- Neil, you're such a poet.

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.544
- I think that's the new
opening to the Twilight Zone.

00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:16.544
(all laughing)

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:17.614
- [Janna] Cue the music.

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:21.354
- Okay so that's cool, so if we,

00:11:21.354 --> 00:11:23.684
so let's get back
to the question,

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:24.884
if we know.

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:26.254
- [Janna] This
one question could

00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:27.794
keep us busy the whole time.

00:11:27.794 --> 00:11:30.494
- A hundred percent, if we
are a hundred percent sure

00:11:30.494 --> 00:11:31.824
that we are a hologram,

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.564
should we behave
any differently?

00:11:33.564 --> 00:11:36.034
And who are we a hologram to?

00:11:36.034 --> 00:11:37.264
- Yeah so this is--

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.174
- On whose black
hole surface are we?

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:41.434
- Right so then well so
people have a harder time

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:43.304
understanding holography
in the cosmological context

00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:45.144
moving away from the black hole

00:11:45.144 --> 00:11:47.144
but the idea is that a
black hole is the terrain

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:48.714
on which we learn
fundamental thinking,

00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:52.654
so we should use the lessons
that we can only learn there,

00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:54.814
the evidence that
only exists there,

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.484
to understand the
whole universe.

00:11:56.484 --> 00:11:58.054
- As a cue, as proxy.

00:11:58.054 --> 00:11:59.694
- Right so then we turn
around and we say oh,

00:11:59.694 --> 00:12:01.124
the universe is
expanding so rapidly

00:12:01.124 --> 00:12:02.924
we have a cosmic horizon.

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:04.464
- [Neil] We do.

00:12:04.464 --> 00:12:05.664
- We do, there is a region
beyond which we cannot see

00:12:05.664 --> 00:12:07.664
as long as the universe
expands at this pace

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:10.364
and the light can never get
to us, race though it might,

00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:13.174
'cause the expansion of the
universe will exceed it.

00:12:13.174 --> 00:12:16.404
- So we are analogous
cosmologically to a black hole.

00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:17.774
We're inside it's event horizon.

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:19.544
- Yeah it's like an inverted
one and we're inside

00:12:19.544 --> 00:12:21.474
the event horizon, and
there's stuff beyond it

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.714
that will never know about us

00:12:22.714 --> 00:12:24.344
and we'll never know about them

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:27.254
and so can we make
a holography of that

00:12:27.254 --> 00:12:31.254
and then yes, can I make a
holography of just you and I?

00:12:31.254 --> 00:12:33.554
But you see we have so
much less information

00:12:33.554 --> 00:12:35.524
than the maximum we
could pack on us,

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:37.294
that that's why
we haven't tested

00:12:37.294 --> 00:12:39.094
whether or not we're
holographic animals.

00:12:39.094 --> 00:12:42.734
You see, holography requires
a more sophisticated thing

00:12:42.734 --> 00:12:44.564
than just, like printed
words in a book,

00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:45.904
which is not holographic,

00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:47.834
but it's way less than
the maximum amount

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.804
of information
that you can pack.

00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:53.014
And the hologram is an
example of packing a lot more,

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:54.314
right?

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:55.544
So if you made a human
being that was packing

00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:56.984
the maximum amount
of information

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:58.214
that they possibly could,

00:12:58.214 --> 00:13:00.584
they would turn into
a black hole. (laughs)

00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:02.114
- [Harrison] Or they'd have
a really full backpack.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.124
- Yeah, so holography
doesn't say

00:13:04.124 --> 00:13:06.024
you can't have things
with less information

00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:08.294
that are just not, you
know, as extraordinary.

00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:11.724
It just says that's the
maximum that we can have

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.594
and so it's all an illusion,
we really are two-dimensional.

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.064
- You're flippin' me
out a little bit here,

00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:17.164
so let me just say,

00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:19.104
and I'm an astrophysicist right?

00:13:19.104 --> 00:13:20.374
- Right.

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:23.244
- So why did you all of a sudden

00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:25.774
without anybody's permission
in this conversation

00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:29.714
equate matter with information?

00:13:29.714 --> 00:13:31.444
'Cause when I think of matter,

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:33.884
the concentration of
matter, as a star guy,

00:13:33.884 --> 00:13:36.854
I study stars, you
pack in the matter,

00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:38.224
and you get a black hole.

00:13:38.224 --> 00:13:40.524
Now you're saying you're
gonna pack information.

00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:42.394
You get a information
black hole.

00:13:42.394 --> 00:13:44.024
I mean is that the same thing?

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:46.964
- I think that the
shift that I'm feeling,

00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:49.194
and that I'm learning
from other people as well

00:13:49.194 --> 00:13:52.304
is that matter is
just information.

00:13:52.304 --> 00:13:53.674
So what does it mean to say,

00:13:53.674 --> 00:13:54.904
an electron is matter?

00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:56.644
What we mean is it
has a certain charge,

00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:58.074
it has a certain span,
- property.

00:13:58.074 --> 00:13:59.614
- It has a certain number
of quantum properties,

00:13:59.614 --> 00:14:00.814
and those quantum properties

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:02.574
qualify as information.

00:14:02.574 --> 00:14:04.744
- And it completely
defines what the thing is.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.184
- And it completely, there's
no such thing as an electron

00:14:06.184 --> 00:14:07.654
that's a little bit heavier,
or a little bit lighter,

00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:09.154
spins a little faster
or a little slower,

00:14:09.154 --> 00:14:10.284
has a little more charge
or a little less charge,

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.224
there's no such thing.

00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:14.094
- Every electron is identical
to every other electron.

00:14:14.094 --> 00:14:15.324
- Yeah, identical.

00:14:15.324 --> 00:14:16.264
There's literally
no history to it

00:14:16.264 --> 00:14:17.794
- It's like all the Kardashians.

00:14:17.794 --> 00:14:18.924
(all laughing)

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.164
- Which one is that one?

00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:21.934
- Yeah the only thing
that I need to know

00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:22.934
is its position in space.

00:14:22.934 --> 00:14:23.934
(Neil laughing)

00:14:23.934 --> 00:14:25.364
- Exactly.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.604
- So the idea there is
that the electron is simply

00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:26.734
the collection of
information about it

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:32.844
and that is its identity

00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:34.814
and so then we start to think,
well what else does it mean

00:14:34.814 --> 00:14:36.414
to be physically real is

00:14:36.414 --> 00:14:38.614
just that list of
quantum properties.

00:14:38.614 --> 00:14:39.814
- [Neil] Wow.

00:14:39.814 --> 00:14:41.214
- So I think that
the shift is to say,

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.154
look it's just math
and information.

00:14:43.154 --> 00:14:45.994
And we gotta stop thinkin' so
concrete you know, feelin'.

00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:47.224
- Like physically.

00:14:47.224 --> 00:14:48.454
- Like, we know that
this is an illusion.

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:49.694
I can't put my hand
through your leg

00:14:49.694 --> 00:14:50.964
even though we both know

00:14:50.964 --> 00:14:52.124
it's mostly empty
space, both parts.

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:54.294
- We are mostly
empty frickin' space.

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:55.964
- Yeah, voids, two voids.

00:14:55.964 --> 00:14:57.404
- That's the secret
to one of my tricks,

00:14:57.404 --> 00:14:58.804
I won't tell you which one.

00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:00.834
- 'Cause you're also
a magician, right.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.004
- [Harrison] It's all quantum.

00:15:03.004 --> 00:15:05.404
- There's a famous comment,
I'm gonna paraphrase it

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.944
and it might be apocryphal
but it's great anyway,

00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:10.514
Rutherford, was it
Rutherford who discovered

00:15:10.514 --> 00:15:11.984
that the atom was empty?

00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:13.214
I think it was Rutherford.

00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:14.514
- Yeah I mean wasn't he
doing the nuclear stuff?

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:16.024
- He did the gold
foil experiments.

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:18.024
So what you do is you get
a really thin gold foil,

00:15:18.024 --> 00:15:20.694
like aluminum foil,
this is gold foil,

00:15:20.694 --> 00:15:22.194
hammer it really thin.

00:15:22.194 --> 00:15:24.264
- That's what I've seen Trump
wraps all his sandwiches in.

00:15:24.264 --> 00:15:25.264
- I was gonna say, aah!

00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:27.464
- Trump gilded everything.

00:15:27.464 --> 00:15:32.334
So then you hang it there
and you fire particles at it

00:15:32.334 --> 00:15:36.244
and you ask, how often does
a particle hit a gold atom

00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:37.674
and how often does
it pass through?

00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:39.414
'Cause you make it
really, really thin,

00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:43.414
and it turns out most particles
pass right through the foil.

00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:44.644
- [Janna] No damage done.

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:46.184
- No damage done, not
deflected, nothing.

00:15:46.184 --> 00:15:49.784
And he concluded
that most of atoms

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:53.124
are completely empty
space, and he's rumored,

00:15:53.124 --> 00:15:55.224
the next morning, after
having contemplated this,

00:15:55.224 --> 00:15:59.434
that he was afraid to
step onto the floor

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:01.134
getting out of his bed

00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:02.334
- For fear of falling in?

00:16:02.334 --> 00:16:03.904
- For fear he might
fall through the floor.

00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:08.874
'Cause he alone on earth knew
how empty matter actually is.

00:16:10.274 --> 00:16:12.044
- I figured that out by
looking at Republican heads.

00:16:12.044 --> 00:16:13.144
(all laughing)

00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:14.214
They're very empty.

00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:15.814
- Reading their Tweets.

00:16:15.814 --> 00:16:17.444
- Yeah exactly.

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.554
- So in astrophysics
there's something called

00:16:19.554 --> 00:16:21.814
a degenerate state,
which is not a statement

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.654
about its moral fiber, but--

00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:24.884
- I was gonna say most comedians

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:26.424
are in a degenerate state.

00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:29.464
- Degenerate state has to
do with whether two atoms

00:16:29.464 --> 00:16:32.834
or particles can occupy the
same state at the same time,

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:34.434
the same configuration.

00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:37.704
And electrons, two
identical electrons

00:16:37.704 --> 00:16:39.504
cannot be in the same
place at the same time,

00:16:39.504 --> 00:16:40.974
they have to be separated.

00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:44.774
And so there's a pressure
because they will not,

00:16:44.774 --> 00:16:46.974
there's a limit to how
close you can get them.

00:16:46.974 --> 00:16:49.014
And now based on
how you describe it

00:16:49.014 --> 00:16:51.944
I'm thinking if you do that

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.614
you're putting too much
information in one place.

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.784
- Ooh that's an interesting
idea, look at you Neil.

00:16:55.784 --> 00:16:59.054
So the Pauli exclusion
principle would be caused by

00:16:59.054 --> 00:17:00.924
- An information--

00:17:00.924 --> 00:17:02.454
- An information limit.

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:03.924
- Wanna write a paper on that?

00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:04.794
- Let's do it, oh my God, I'm
gonna be up all night now.

00:17:04.794 --> 00:17:05.794
- Let's do that.

00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:07.264
- Ah, I love it.

00:17:07.264 --> 00:17:09.664
- All of the degenerate states,
it's an information problem.

00:17:09.664 --> 00:17:10.804
- I love it I think
that's a lovely idea.

00:17:10.804 --> 00:17:11.934
We'll talk about that later.

00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:12.764
- [Neil] We gotta take a break.

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:14.204
- Do I get co-credit?

00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:15.474
(Neil and Janna laughing)

00:17:15.474 --> 00:17:17.104
am I gonna be in a paper?

00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:19.544
- Yeah the credits,
yeah Harrison made
us laugh during this.

00:17:19.544 --> 00:17:20.774
During these paragraphs.

00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:22.374
- Moral support, I
was the cheerleader.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.614
- So when we come back,

00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:25.284
more Cosmic Queries,
Out There Edition.

00:17:25.284 --> 00:17:28.114
(futuristic music)

00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:02.174
We're back, StarTalk,
Cosmic Queries,

00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:03.814
the Out There Edition.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.414
All parts of the universe
that are far away and freaky

00:18:07.414 --> 00:18:10.254
and (laughs) we've got some
good expertise for that

00:18:10.254 --> 00:18:12.224
in Janna Levin, Janna,
good to have you,

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.654
and of course Harrison.
- Great to be here

00:18:13.654 --> 00:18:16.264
- So this is the second segment,
you're reading questions.

00:18:16.264 --> 00:18:18.324
The first segment we got
through only one question.

00:18:18.324 --> 00:18:19.564
- Yeah but it was a doozy.

00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:21.464
- It was a doozy,
all about holograms.

00:18:21.464 --> 00:18:22.904
So what else do you have for us?

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:27.004
- This is from Facebook,
from Nate Gadeoso,

00:18:27.004 --> 00:18:28.934
and he said could the
entire known universe

00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:30.844
be the result of a white hole?

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:32.304
- Ooh.

00:18:32.304 --> 00:18:33.474
- [Janna] Ooh, you wanna try it?

00:18:33.474 --> 00:18:34.944
- Ooh, ooh.

00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:37.014
Well let me put white
holes on the map

00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:38.714
and then you take
it from there okay?

00:18:38.714 --> 00:18:40.954
So back in the 1970s,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.654
when the mathematics
of black holes

00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:46.524
was being explored
and formulated,

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:48.854
it might have been late
1960s, but it was not deep

00:18:48.854 --> 00:18:52.664
back in the century, it was
like that late, if you will.

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:56.664
People noticed that the
equations that give you

00:18:56.664 --> 00:19:01.474
a black hole have a legitimate
opposite solution to them.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.744
So let me test, Harrison,

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:06.344
let me test your 9th grade
math knowledge, you ready?

00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:07.574
- Okay.

00:19:07.574 --> 00:19:08.174
- Okay what's the
square root of nine?

00:19:08.174 --> 00:19:09.414
- Three.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.684
- Okay so what's
three times three?

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.144
- Nine.

00:19:12.144 --> 00:19:16.524
- Okay, what's negative
three times negative three?

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:18.324
- Also nine.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.654
- So nine has two
solutions, doesn't it?

00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:20.494
- Right.

00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:21.724
- Right?

00:19:21.724 --> 00:19:22.524
Square root of nine
is negative three,

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:23.464
- Plus or minus, yeah.

00:19:23.464 --> 00:19:24.794
- Yeah, and positive three.

00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:25.724
So we only gave
you one solution,

00:19:25.724 --> 00:19:27.564
the solution you preferred,

00:19:27.564 --> 00:19:31.904
but there's the dark
side, the negative side,

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:35.334
so some questions in science,

00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:39.244
the mathematics of them reveal
that there are two answers

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.914
that are completely
authentic and legitimate.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.744
And when people were
studying black holes

00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:45.244
and the mathematics
of black holes,

00:19:45.244 --> 00:19:47.014
a second, in
Einstein's equations,

00:19:47.014 --> 00:19:48.754
a second solution emerged,

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.124
that was everything
a black hole is

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.984
except the opposite of that.

00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.294
So things only ever
came out of this space.

00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:59.294
And so it would be white,
if you were to look for it

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:02.564
in the universe.

00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:03.504
So they said let's
look for these things,

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:04.934
and people thought maybe quasars

00:20:04.934 --> 00:20:07.734
which are very bright distant
objects in the universe,

00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:11.644
maybe those are the white
hole versions of black holes,

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:12.944
and then so we have a
white hole and black hole,

00:20:12.944 --> 00:20:15.144
maybe they're connected.

00:20:15.144 --> 00:20:17.814
And this was the
introduction of a wormhole.

00:20:17.814 --> 00:20:19.954
Wormhole would connect a
white hole to a black hole.

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:21.914
Everything goes in the black
hole, comes out the other side.

00:20:21.914 --> 00:20:24.024
So we looked for the
properties of a white hole,

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:26.354
quasars did not satisfy
those properties,

00:20:26.354 --> 00:20:28.654
and we kind of gave up on 'em.

00:20:28.654 --> 00:20:30.124
So no one's lookin' for
white holes anymore.

00:20:30.124 --> 00:20:32.264
So that's the farthest
I can take it.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.664
- Wait, so it is a
really intuitive idea.

00:20:35.664 --> 00:20:36.704
- [Neil] Did I get
anything wrong?

00:20:36.704 --> 00:20:37.904
I think I got
- No, yeah,

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.604
that sounds great.

00:20:39.604 --> 00:20:42.604
It's very natural to imagine

00:20:42.604 --> 00:20:43.974
so let's say everything
falls into a black hole

00:20:43.974 --> 00:20:45.974
and you think, it goes where?

00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:48.774
And that's the whole
crisis about the black hole

00:20:48.774 --> 00:20:50.714
is not the event
horizon and all that--

00:20:50.714 --> 00:20:52.184
- That's a thing,
the hole crisis?

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.184
(all laughing)

00:20:53.184 --> 00:20:54.314
- The H, I dropped the W.

00:20:54.314 --> 00:20:55.884
- The hole crisis.

00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:57.824
- The word must have
gotten stuck in my head.

00:20:57.824 --> 00:21:01.854
So the idea would be that
you can sew on a white hole

00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:03.424
onto the interior
of a black hole

00:21:03.424 --> 00:21:04.864
and it kind of makes sense

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:07.394
because these singularities
that people run amok

00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:10.004
on the streets because
they don't want them

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:11.234
to exist in nature

00:21:11.234 --> 00:21:12.534
and they probably
don't exist in nature,

00:21:12.534 --> 00:21:14.404
and the singularities
are so problematic

00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:16.074
that wouldn't it be better

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.604
instead of having
this infinite energy,

00:21:18.604 --> 00:21:19.974
infinite curvature of space,

00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:21.444
- [Neil] Infinite density.

00:21:21.444 --> 00:21:23.144
- Infinite density,
literally a hole in space,

00:21:23.144 --> 00:21:25.084
like the matter gets
there in finite time

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:26.254
and then what?

00:21:26.254 --> 00:21:27.184
You don't know
what happens to it.

00:21:27.184 --> 00:21:28.714
Sort of like a cut in space,

00:21:28.714 --> 00:21:30.524
it's something where physics
breaks down, fundamentally.

00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:32.724
So people had the idea well
let's get rid of the singularity

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.894
and sew the black
hole onto the big bang

00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:36.294
which is also a singularity

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.994
and so you get rid of both

00:21:37.994 --> 00:21:40.934
and you repair it in some sense.

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:41.894
- Do you think at the
center of the black hole

00:21:41.894 --> 00:21:42.904
it births another universe?

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.234
- Yes, so that is really--

00:21:44.234 --> 00:21:45.764
- See how casually
she just said that?

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.404
(all laughing)

00:21:47.404 --> 00:21:50.044
Talk about inventing a
whole frickin' universe,

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:51.204
"Yeah, of course, you
get a black hole."

00:21:51.204 --> 00:21:52.674
- Yeah whatever, so.

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:55.174
- I'm still stuck on the plus
and minus negative three.

00:21:55.174 --> 00:21:56.944
- What I love the most
about that is it means

00:21:56.944 --> 00:21:59.384
that the black hole, small is
it might be on the outside,

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.414
So let's say our sun
became a black hole

00:22:01.414 --> 00:22:03.784
by some intervention,

00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:05.984
'cause it wouldn't naturally
collapse to a black hole,

00:22:05.984 --> 00:22:07.224
it's not big enough, but
if it were, it would be

00:22:07.224 --> 00:22:08.924
only about six
kilometers across,

00:22:08.924 --> 00:22:10.694
be a very small
object on the outside,

00:22:10.694 --> 00:22:13.934
but on the inside it could be
as big as a whole universe,

00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:15.534
so it's like Doctor
Who's TARDIS.

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.404
- I was about to say,
I was so excited,

00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:18.904
I was like that really
sounds like a TARDIS.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.904
- Yeah that's hittin'
geek buttons right there.

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:23.744
- It's bigger on the inside
than the outside suggests,

00:22:23.744 --> 00:22:25.374
and one way it could be bigger

00:22:25.374 --> 00:22:26.374
is it could be a whole big bang,

00:22:26.374 --> 00:22:27.914
it could be a whole universe.

00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.714
The reason that's sort
of fallen out of favor

00:22:29.714 --> 00:22:34.184
is because there are
reasons to suggest that

00:22:34.184 --> 00:22:36.354
if that were true the universe
would become very unstable

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:37.784
to these things.

00:22:37.784 --> 00:22:39.484
Because if there's just
some random probability

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:43.664
for a black hole spontaneously
creating a universe

00:22:43.664 --> 00:22:45.424
in its interior, it would be,

00:22:45.424 --> 00:22:47.494
even though seemingly unlikely,

00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:51.664
it would just be such a, what's
the word I'm looking for,

00:22:51.664 --> 00:22:54.604
such a enormous
proliferation of them

00:22:54.604 --> 00:22:57.174
that it would actually
make the world unstable,

00:22:57.174 --> 00:22:58.544
and so it's sort of
fallen out of favor.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:00.074
- We don't want that.

00:23:00.074 --> 00:23:01.444
- It depends on who you ask.

00:23:01.444 --> 00:23:02.874
- There's enough
instability in the world.

00:23:02.874 --> 00:23:04.684
- I'm all writing this
for my new screenplay

00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:05.814
called The White Hole.

00:23:05.814 --> 00:23:08.454
- So some old
fashioned relativists

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:09.854
who only think
about space and time

00:23:09.854 --> 00:23:11.154
still like the idea

00:23:11.154 --> 00:23:12.324
- Relativist is someone,

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.554
an expert on Einstein's
Relativity Theory.

00:23:13.554 --> 00:23:15.554
- Yes and studies
primarily space time.

00:23:15.554 --> 00:23:17.164
And those who study
things like string theory

00:23:17.164 --> 00:23:19.094
and particle physics
are more skeptical

00:23:19.094 --> 00:23:22.134
about the idea because
their work seems to suggest

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.434
this instability.

00:23:23.434 --> 00:23:24.934
So sometimes the counts
are split on this stuff.

00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:27.304
It can--

00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:29.644
- Could be a very
tense dinner party.

00:23:29.644 --> 00:23:31.104
- (laughing) yeah.

00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:32.544
- So what you're saying is
wherever there's a black hole

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:33.774
there's another universe.

00:23:33.774 --> 00:23:35.844
- [Janna] If that's
the case, yes.

00:23:35.844 --> 00:23:37.144
- So this'd be
like a Swiss cheese

00:23:37.144 --> 00:23:38.584
in the higher dimensional,

00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:40.354
- That's right,
but that universe,

00:23:40.354 --> 00:23:42.114
okay so space and
time switch places

00:23:42.114 --> 00:23:43.624
interior to the black hole

00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:45.484
so while you're imagining a
universe which is spatial,

00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:47.554
the black hole
would be in its past

00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:49.994
and therefore inaccessible.

00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:53.464
So it would look like the big
bang was solely in the past,

00:23:53.464 --> 00:23:56.094
it wouldn't be a place you
could go to in the new universe.

00:23:56.094 --> 00:23:58.104
It would be a time
in your history.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:01.604
(Harrison laughing)

00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:04.204
- We gotta take a
break, no (laughing)

00:24:04.204 --> 00:24:05.574
- And they're just now
getting rid of CBD products

00:24:05.574 --> 00:24:06.514
in New York?

00:24:06.514 --> 00:24:09.044
Oh man, the timing's terrible.

00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:13.584
- No, just if I repeat what
I think I heard you just say,

00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:15.054
if you fall into a black hole,

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:18.454
the universe you came from,
you will see the entire

00:24:18.454 --> 00:24:21.024
future history of the universe
unfold in front of you

00:24:21.024 --> 00:24:22.554
in an instant.

00:24:22.554 --> 00:24:24.364
- Yes, so the black hole's
bright on the inside.

00:24:24.364 --> 00:24:25.764
- Bigger and brighter
on the inside.

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:27.064
(Janna laughing)

00:24:27.064 --> 00:24:28.264
Yeah, there you go.

00:24:28.264 --> 00:24:29.564
- Yeah.

00:24:29.564 --> 00:24:31.064
- Alright gimme
another question.

00:24:31.064 --> 00:24:32.004
- That's good, I just don't
wanna let any of the alt right

00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:33.674
know about this white hole,

00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:34.674
'cause they'd be
like see I told you

00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:36.174
there's another one.

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:38.144
Alright, what's your, this
is from a Patreon candidate,

00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:42.114
contributor, Frank Kane,
which I think, is he related

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:43.684
to Bob Kane?

00:24:43.684 --> 00:24:44.514
That's the guy who made Batman.

00:24:44.514 --> 00:24:45.744
What's?

00:24:45.744 --> 00:24:46.814
Probably not but
Batman shout out.

00:24:46.814 --> 00:24:47.654
What's your take?

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.454
- [Neil] Probably not.

00:24:50.454 --> 00:24:52.124
- But if a whole universe
can fit in a black hole.

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:52.954
- [Neil] Plus he's The Batman.

00:24:52.954 --> 00:24:54.354
- That's your.

00:24:54.354 --> 00:24:55.894
- [Neil] The Batman, right?

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:57.564
- What is your take
on negative mass?

00:24:57.564 --> 00:24:59.064
I've read that if it exists

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.934
we can hold open wormholes,
travel backward through time,

00:25:00.934 --> 00:25:02.764
make a warp drive and
all sorts of crazy stuff.

00:25:02.764 --> 00:25:04.304
If the math says
possible do you think

00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:06.134
that means it
really is possible?

00:25:06.134 --> 00:25:08.234
- Woo, so start there first.

00:25:08.234 --> 00:25:11.374
If you have a mathematical
understanding of a theory

00:25:11.374 --> 00:25:13.614
that is working, does
everything that comes

00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:15.774
out of the math have to be true?

00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:19.484
- I mean, we don't
obviously know the answer

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:21.284
to that question but it
does seem like nature

00:25:21.284 --> 00:25:22.214
always finds a way.

00:25:22.214 --> 00:25:23.154
I mean we've been sitting here

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:24.824
- I've seen Jurassic Park.

00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:26.654
- talking about
black holes, yeah.

00:25:26.654 --> 00:25:27.654
(all laughing)

00:25:27.654 --> 00:25:29.124
- Right.

00:25:29.124 --> 00:25:30.624
So black holes were originally
just a thought experiment

00:25:30.624 --> 00:25:32.124
on paper and you know Einstein
thought nature would protect

00:25:32.124 --> 00:25:33.334
us from their formation,

00:25:33.334 --> 00:25:34.634
he didn't actually
think they were real.

00:25:34.634 --> 00:25:36.864
He thought the math was
accurate and beautiful

00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:38.364
and interesting and important

00:25:38.364 --> 00:25:40.704
but not that it
could possibly form.

00:25:42.034 --> 00:25:43.244
- He could have
predicted black holes

00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:44.674
and just the idea
was so preposterous.

00:25:44.674 --> 00:25:46.714
- He literally said well there's
much more important things

00:25:46.714 --> 00:25:48.144
to think about right now,

00:25:48.144 --> 00:25:50.214
and the fact that nature
figured out a way to make 'em

00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:53.044
by killing off a few stars
is just kind of amazing

00:25:53.044 --> 00:25:54.754
and it seems to happen
over and over again,

00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:57.054
these seemingly
implausible concepts,

00:25:57.054 --> 00:26:02.024
end up being challenged
by our limited intuition,

00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:04.294
our limited intuition
is challenged by nature

00:26:04.294 --> 00:26:05.694
actually doing it.

00:26:05.694 --> 00:26:07.364
- The point is the
universe is big enough

00:26:07.364 --> 00:26:08.834
with enough things happening

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:11.064
that even a completely
rare thing is gonna happen.

00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:12.304
Or unlikely thing.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.504
- Now I'm gonna
contradict myself

00:26:13.504 --> 00:26:15.074
and say now that I'm
playing devil's advocate

00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:17.244
I would say, you know,
the square root of two,

00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:18.874
you asked about the
square root of nine,

00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:20.874
the square root of two I
would say doesn't exist

00:26:20.874 --> 00:26:22.644
in physical reality
as far as we know.

00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:24.284
It's only in our
minds that it exists.

00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:25.784
- Right, it's not a thing.

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:29.054
- I can't make anything that
has length square root of two

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.824
because it will eventually
end at some finite digit

00:26:31.824 --> 00:26:33.894
which is an approximation
of square root of two

00:26:33.894 --> 00:26:35.554
but it's not square root of two.

00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:38.224
- The decimals go
on forever, like pi.

00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:41.234
- Yes in irrational numbers
the decimals go on forever,

00:26:41.234 --> 00:26:43.464
but any length of any thing

00:26:43.464 --> 00:26:44.964
or any measurement of any kind

00:26:44.964 --> 00:26:46.634
will only be a rational number

00:26:46.634 --> 00:26:48.734
and an approximate to
an irrational, maybe.

00:26:48.734 --> 00:26:50.374
So we can't measure pi, ever.

00:26:50.374 --> 00:26:51.744
And we can't measure anything

00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:53.514
with square root of two length.

00:26:53.514 --> 00:26:54.844
- Bummin' me out.

00:26:54.844 --> 00:26:56.044
- And so, then

00:26:56.044 --> 00:26:56.984
- I want a pie with
the diameter pi

00:26:56.984 --> 00:26:59.444
so it just goes on forever.

00:26:59.444 --> 00:27:02.054
You'd always be baking it.

00:27:02.054 --> 00:27:04.454
- So you can say well
that maybe I just gave you

00:27:04.454 --> 00:27:07.394
an example that proves that
not every mathematical concept

00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:09.754
can be realized in
physical reality.

00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:11.964
- Okay but I'll give
you a pass that one.

00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:14.964
What do you call it, in
golf what's it called?

00:27:14.964 --> 00:27:16.194
Give you uh, a...?

00:27:16.194 --> 00:27:17.034
- Oh God, you're asking
me sports questions.

00:27:17.034 --> 00:27:18.034
(Neil laughs)

00:27:18.034 --> 00:27:19.434
I remember in high school

00:27:19.434 --> 00:27:20.634
I was into the coach.
- Thank God you looked at him.

00:27:20.634 --> 00:27:21.304
- [Neil] Mulligan, I'll
give you a Mulligan,

00:27:21.304 --> 00:27:21.974
I think it is.

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.444
- There you go.

00:27:23.444 --> 00:27:26.174
- So alright, so now tell
us about negative mass.

00:27:26.174 --> 00:27:27.974
- So negative mass
is problematic.

00:27:27.974 --> 00:27:29.444
- Does it exist in anybody's --

00:27:29.444 --> 00:27:30.684
- Not that we know of,

00:27:30.684 --> 00:27:33.014
we have seen negative energies

00:27:33.014 --> 00:27:34.714
in very subtle contexts

00:27:34.714 --> 00:27:37.924
where you have two plates
that are very close

00:27:37.924 --> 00:27:40.024
to each other where
you can create

00:27:40.024 --> 00:27:41.524
a negative energy in the quantum
states between the plates.

00:27:41.524 --> 00:27:43.094
- So these are, this is when--

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:44.864
- I dated some girls
with negative energy.

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:46.364
(all laughing)

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:47.994
- So you're talking about
like a capacitor plate,

00:27:47.994 --> 00:27:50.634
like metal plates, you get
'em really, really close,

00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:52.404
so that they're
closer to each other

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:55.904
than the wavelength of the
particles in the matter

00:27:55.904 --> 00:27:57.044
that comprise them.

00:27:57.044 --> 00:27:58.744
- Yeah in some sense,
it's like saying

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:00.974
if I can't have a water
wave between two walls

00:28:00.974 --> 00:28:03.314
whose wavelength is longer

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.614
than the width
- Than the walls.

00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:06.014
- between the walls, exactly.

00:28:06.014 --> 00:28:07.554
I mean, not a standing wave.

00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:11.254
And so the idea is that
it prunes some energy,

00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:13.394
meaning that in some
sense there's less states

00:28:13.394 --> 00:28:15.224
on the inside because of this

00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:17.364
than there are on the
outside where you have

00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:18.794
a whole continuum
of possibilities.

00:28:18.794 --> 00:28:20.064
- So that's negative
energy between two plates.

00:28:20.064 --> 00:28:21.834
- It can create under
certain circumstances

00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:22.864
a negative energy, and
then you'll see a pressure

00:28:22.864 --> 00:28:24.334
on the plates.
- Alright, so--

00:28:24.334 --> 00:28:25.504
- The plates'll either push
apart or move together.

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:26.634
- If matter and
energy are equivalent,

00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:28.504
E equals MC squared,

00:28:28.504 --> 00:28:30.174
if you're gonna give
me negative energy,

00:28:30.174 --> 00:28:31.604
why can't you hand
me negative mass?

00:28:31.604 --> 00:28:32.974
- Yeah I mean, it--

00:28:32.974 --> 00:28:34.614
- There.

00:28:34.614 --> 00:28:35.844
(all laughing)

00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:37.244
- Well here's, okay,
so here's the problem

00:28:37.244 --> 00:28:39.954
with the negative mass

00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:41.654
is that it seems
highly unstable.

00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:45.024
So if I literally had a
particle like the electron

00:28:45.024 --> 00:28:48.554
whose fundamental mass
was literally negative

00:28:48.554 --> 00:28:51.294
and whose E equals MC squared
energy was literally negative

00:28:51.294 --> 00:28:52.764
in that sense,

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:55.534
then it would be possible
to make tons of these

00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:59.634
and balance it with the
generation of positive energy,

00:28:59.634 --> 00:29:02.074
respect conservation
of energy, right?

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:04.744
So then I could get an
infinite energy resource

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:07.514
by making negative
energy particles

00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:10.214
because that would have
to, by energy conservation,

00:29:10.214 --> 00:29:13.014
lead to the creation of a
positive energy somewhere.

00:29:13.014 --> 00:29:15.454
So runaway argument would be--

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:16.954
- And then when you
bring them together

00:29:16.954 --> 00:29:18.484
they annihilate,
and then you have--

00:29:18.484 --> 00:29:19.424
- Well I don't know, maybe
they're not antiparticles,

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.624
maybe they don't annihilate.

00:29:20.624 --> 00:29:21.854
They just might
have negative mass.

00:29:21.854 --> 00:29:23.424
So in other words, I
could have zero energy

00:29:23.424 --> 00:29:24.924
in my laboratory

00:29:24.924 --> 00:29:27.864
and I could have the best
energy company conceivable.

00:29:27.864 --> 00:29:29.394
- Starting with zero energy.

00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:30.934
- Zero energy, it costs me
nothing to make negative

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:33.804
energy particles because
I just have to create,

00:29:33.804 --> 00:29:37.074
whether I like it to not,
positive energy in response,

00:29:37.074 --> 00:29:40.114
meaning I can generate
incredible positive energy

00:29:40.114 --> 00:29:41.974
at essentially no cost.

00:29:41.974 --> 00:29:43.914
And that is just not,
it would be so unstable.

00:29:43.914 --> 00:29:45.384
- [Neil] It's not
stable in the universe.

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:47.414
- It sounds good at first,
like we power New York City

00:29:47.414 --> 00:29:48.784
at no cost.

00:29:48.784 --> 00:29:51.384
We get rid of fracking and coal

00:29:51.384 --> 00:29:54.154
and all of these you
know, fossil fuels,

00:29:54.154 --> 00:29:56.424
but we also destroy the universe

00:29:56.424 --> 00:29:58.024
in a completely unstable event

00:29:58.024 --> 00:29:59.994
where the negative energy
runs out of control,

00:29:59.994 --> 00:30:01.934
creating infinite
positive energy

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:02.894
and the whole thing blows up.

00:30:02.894 --> 00:30:04.164
- Harrison, I think it was--

00:30:04.164 --> 00:30:05.534
- That sounded like the
plot of a super villain.

00:30:05.534 --> 00:30:06.804
(all laughing)

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.274
I think I've seen this
in a Spider-Man film.

00:30:08.274 --> 00:30:10.344
- You're going to after
this episode airs, I'm sure.

00:30:10.344 --> 00:30:12.944
- I think it's Kurt Vonnegut
that one of his books,

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.114
I don't remember which book

00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:18.384
said the last
sentence ever spoken

00:30:18.384 --> 00:30:23.424
in the universe was by
a scientist (laughing)

00:30:24.284 --> 00:30:25.824
who says to the other scientist,

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.554
"Let's try it this other way."

00:30:27.554 --> 00:30:30.824
(all laughing)

00:30:30.824 --> 00:30:32.824
This is the scenario
you just described.

00:30:32.824 --> 00:30:34.334
- Yeah, exactly.

00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:35.794
- The whole universe goes
unstable and disappears.

00:30:35.794 --> 00:30:37.264
- So some people say,
look, I have an observation

00:30:37.264 --> 00:30:39.364
that proves that there's
not negative mass particles,

00:30:39.364 --> 00:30:41.674
and that's the fact that the
universe appears to be stable.

00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:42.904
- [Neil] And we're here.

00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:44.474
- For, you know, for
14 billion years.

00:30:44.474 --> 00:30:45.404
- [Neil] Wow.

00:30:45.404 --> 00:30:46.914
- Pretty good.

00:30:46.914 --> 00:30:48.144
- Alright, gimme another one.

00:30:48.144 --> 00:30:49.814
- [Harrison] Alright,
we got Mike Berry--

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.314
- This stuff is
out there, squared.

00:30:51.314 --> 00:30:52.484
- [Janna] I'm lovin' it,
this is right up my alley.

00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:53.754
- Man.

00:30:53.754 --> 00:30:55.214
- I was worried you were
gonna ask me about stuff

00:30:55.214 --> 00:30:56.454
that happened more recently
than like half a billion

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:57.954
years ago, in which
case I'd be lost.

00:30:57.954 --> 00:30:59.154
- Oh yeah, no, no, then
I'd take care of that one,

00:30:59.154 --> 00:31:00.254
I'm good with that.

00:31:00.254 --> 00:31:01.294
Alright.

00:31:01.294 --> 00:31:02.554
- We have Mike Berry on Facebook

00:31:02.554 --> 00:31:04.094
and he said, "I've never
heard this explained.

00:31:04.094 --> 00:31:05.464
"If the observable universe
is roughly fifteen billion

00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:06.734
"years old," as
you've just said,

00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:09.164
"and if a star like
ours lasts 12 billon,

00:31:09.164 --> 00:31:11.804
"how can our sun be a
third generation star?"

00:31:11.804 --> 00:31:13.304
- Oh!

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:15.334
- So I would say 14 billion
is a little bit closer,

00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:16.534
a little bit less
than 14 billion.

00:31:16.534 --> 00:31:18.344
Because what's a
billion among friends?

00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:19.644
- Between friends,
between astronomers.

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:21.374
- Yeah among astronomers.

00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:24.614
- Yeah, we're around a
third generation star,

00:31:24.614 --> 00:31:27.554
so the life expectancy
is not relevant

00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:29.014
to what generation you are,

00:31:29.014 --> 00:31:33.224
so there, because the
generation that we speak of

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:37.694
is we think of the stars
that create the elements

00:31:37.694 --> 00:31:40.494
that are then scattered
back into the universe

00:31:40.494 --> 00:31:43.764
and give another
generation this enrichment.

00:31:43.764 --> 00:31:46.534
Those stars live, hundred
thousand, a million years.

00:31:46.534 --> 00:31:47.974
- They're much shorter lived,

00:31:47.974 --> 00:31:48.774
- Much shorter lived
- Because they didn't have

00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:50.034
the heavy elements,

00:31:50.034 --> 00:31:51.244
precisely because they
were first generation.

00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:52.544
- Yeah, so you get
the high mass stars,

00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:53.944
don't live very long,

00:31:53.944 --> 00:31:55.414
and fortunately they blow up.
(Janna mumbles)

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:58.014
If they didn't blow up, they'd
keep their heavy elements

00:31:58.014 --> 00:31:59.984
and the carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, silicon

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:02.414
that's in our bodies, would
be forever locked in stars

00:32:02.414 --> 00:32:04.084
and the universe would
have never had life,

00:32:04.084 --> 00:32:06.384
would not have even had planets.

00:32:06.384 --> 00:32:07.954
- Mm-hmm.

00:32:07.954 --> 00:32:09.824
- Because these high mass
stars make these elements

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:13.094
and explode, scattering their
enrichment across the galaxy

00:32:13.094 --> 00:32:14.664
it enables the next
generation of stars

00:32:14.664 --> 00:32:16.594
to have slightly more of this,

00:32:16.594 --> 00:32:19.034
the next generation of
stars have even more,

00:32:19.034 --> 00:32:21.134
so that you'd expect
the frequency of planets

00:32:21.134 --> 00:32:23.274
and other interesting chemistry

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.974
to take place will all the
elements on the periodic table,

00:32:25.974 --> 00:32:27.374
the later your generation is,

00:32:27.374 --> 00:32:31.184
the more chemical
latitude you have.

00:32:31.184 --> 00:32:32.444
(Janna laughs)

00:32:32.444 --> 00:32:33.654
- This is also the story
of the Greenbaum family.

00:32:33.654 --> 00:32:35.184
- Oh is that right?

00:32:35.184 --> 00:32:36.754
- The previous generation
living shortly, exploding.

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.054
- Oh, I get it.

00:32:38.054 --> 00:32:40.394
And you are particularly
enriched. (laughs)

00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:41.954
- A lot of chemical latitude.

00:32:41.954 --> 00:32:43.824
- We've got time for one
more before we take a break.

00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:46.864
- Sure, we got Jezebel
Lorelei from Facebook

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.494
and she writes,

00:32:48.494 --> 00:32:49.434
- What, that's a real name?

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.234
Jezebel Lorelei?

00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:52.334
- [Harrison] Yeah.

00:32:52.334 --> 00:32:53.204
- Whoa that's a movie
name right there.

00:32:53.204 --> 00:32:54.434
- [Janna] Yeah.

00:32:54.434 --> 00:32:55.934
- What's the smallest
a black hole can be

00:32:55.934 --> 00:32:58.204
and is there a name for the
atom that is one neutron less

00:32:58.204 --> 00:33:00.274
than that atomic weight?

00:33:00.274 --> 00:33:01.944
- Wait, say the last part again?

00:33:01.944 --> 00:33:04.314
Is there an atom on
the periodic table

00:33:04.314 --> 00:33:06.144
that's one neutron less
than that atomic weight?

00:33:06.144 --> 00:33:07.584
Was that the question?

00:33:07.584 --> 00:33:08.854
- So it's, what's the
smallest a black hole can be

00:33:08.854 --> 00:33:10.084
and then is there
a name for an atom

00:33:10.084 --> 00:33:11.724
that is one neutron
less than that weight?

00:33:11.724 --> 00:33:14.124
- It's definitely less
than a neutron's weight.

00:33:14.124 --> 00:33:15.524
Wait, so no wait,
actually it's not, no.

00:33:15.524 --> 00:33:17.094
- Are those two
different questions?

00:33:17.094 --> 00:33:18.624
- There's a comma in it.

00:33:18.624 --> 00:33:19.594
- There's a comma?

00:33:19.594 --> 00:33:21.164
- They've been jammed together.

00:33:21.164 --> 00:33:22.334
- Don't you know the trick
of answering the question

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:23.194
you can and want to?

00:33:23.194 --> 00:33:24.734
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:25.804
- Regardless of which
one you've been asked?

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:27.304
- Yeah okay,

00:33:27.304 --> 00:33:27.974
she's just gonna answer the
one she knows she can answer.

00:33:27.974 --> 00:33:29.374
Okay, go.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.874
- So I can't remember
- Just the smallest black hole

00:33:31.874 --> 00:33:33.144
just the smallest black hole.
- The actual number.

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:33.944
So we do know that
it is conceivable,

00:33:33.944 --> 00:33:34.344
well we don't, okay.

00:33:35.544 --> 00:33:37.344
It is conceivable that
a microscopic black hole

00:33:37.344 --> 00:33:40.614
could be made under very
extraordinary conditions.

00:33:40.614 --> 00:33:43.014
Now, we say that the
limit of the mass of it

00:33:43.014 --> 00:33:44.984
is related to the
strength of gravity

00:33:44.984 --> 00:33:47.794
and that gives us a scale
of how heavy it could be

00:33:47.794 --> 00:33:50.794
and it's heavy compared
to things like electrons

00:33:50.794 --> 00:33:53.964
but it's incredibly
light compared to

00:33:53.964 --> 00:33:55.594
- [Neil] Golf balls

00:33:55.594 --> 00:33:57.634
- Anything, right,
else on the, exactly.

00:33:57.634 --> 00:34:02.004
So I think it's about the
weight of a little pile of sand.

00:34:02.004 --> 00:34:05.244
Imagine a modest pile of sand.

00:34:05.244 --> 00:34:07.914
That would be about the
weight it could maintain

00:34:07.914 --> 00:34:11.084
and be consistent with
what we think is the limit

00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:12.614
of the strength of gravity

00:34:12.614 --> 00:34:15.714
and it would be an incredibly
tiny, microscopic black hole.

00:34:15.714 --> 00:34:17.424
I mean, I can't even.

00:34:17.424 --> 00:34:19.454
- Oh yeah, it'd be
really small, yeah.

00:34:19.454 --> 00:34:21.194
The event horizon
size of the black hole

00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:23.154
- It would be really small.

00:34:23.154 --> 00:34:25.024
- But wait a minute.

00:34:25.024 --> 00:34:26.424
- I should know the number,
10 to the, what is it,

00:34:26.424 --> 00:34:30.604
10 to the minus 45
seconds after the big bang

00:34:30.604 --> 00:34:32.064
was around the time
of quantum gravity

00:34:32.064 --> 00:34:33.934
so if I multiplied that
maybe by the speed of light

00:34:33.934 --> 00:34:35.834
I would roughly get the
size of a black hole

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:37.004
or something like
that, but anyway

00:34:37.004 --> 00:34:38.004
you can ask me, ask me later,

00:34:38.004 --> 00:34:39.604
I'll crunch some numbers.

00:34:39.604 --> 00:34:41.274
- Okay, ten to the minus
fifteen meters or something.

00:34:41.274 --> 00:34:42.214
- Yeah.

00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.144
- So but, black holes evaporate

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:46.914
so they can become so small
that they don't exist at all.

00:34:46.914 --> 00:34:48.454
- Oh, good point.

00:34:48.454 --> 00:34:49.914
So those black holes
are incredibly unstable
to evaporation.

00:34:49.914 --> 00:34:54.924
Because the idea that
Hawking foisted on its head,

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.624
- [Neil] The late
Stephen Hawking.

00:34:57.624 --> 00:34:59.094
- The late Stephen Hawking,
the amazing Stephen Hawking,

00:34:59.094 --> 00:35:00.464
that black holes, although
they let nothing out,

00:35:00.464 --> 00:35:01.964
they somehow still evaporate.

00:35:01.964 --> 00:35:03.594
That tremendous paradox that
we've been grappling with

00:35:03.594 --> 00:35:05.134
since the 70s.

00:35:05.134 --> 00:35:07.634
He also realized that
the temperature is colder

00:35:07.634 --> 00:35:09.074
the bigger the black hole.

00:35:09.074 --> 00:35:10.844
So they evaporate more
slowly, the bigger they are.

00:35:10.844 --> 00:35:13.044
So we've never seen
astrophysical black
hole evaporate

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:14.574
'cause they're way too cold

00:35:14.574 --> 00:35:16.274
for us to perceive
the evaporation.

00:35:16.274 --> 00:35:17.484
- [Neil] That's
the big ones, yeah.

00:35:17.484 --> 00:35:18.744
- The big ones that are
made by dying stars.

00:35:18.744 --> 00:35:20.554
A microscopic one made
in the early universe

00:35:20.554 --> 00:35:22.284
would presumably
evaporate in an instant.

00:35:22.284 --> 00:35:25.524
And it would be, so people
have looked for that,

00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:27.294
they've looked for
little explosions,

00:35:27.294 --> 00:35:29.654
higher energy explosions
in the very early universe,

00:35:29.654 --> 00:35:31.094
to see
- Gamma ray bursts.

00:35:31.094 --> 00:35:32.564
- if there were
primordial black holes.

00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:33.664
- Small bursts, but we
haven't found them though.

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:34.864
Yeah yeah yeah.

00:35:34.864 --> 00:35:36.794
Oh right, yeah we gotta
wrap up this segment

00:35:36.794 --> 00:35:40.064
of Cosmic Queries
The Out There Edition

00:35:40.064 --> 00:35:41.604
We'll be right back.

00:35:41.604 --> 00:35:45.074
(futuristic music)

00:35:49.624 --> 00:35:52.564
- StarTalk, Cosmic Queries,
The Out There Edition.

00:35:52.564 --> 00:35:54.294
This is the first time we've
done an Out There edition,

00:35:54.294 --> 00:35:55.434
I think we have to
do this more often.

00:35:55.434 --> 00:35:56.994
- This is fun.

00:35:56.994 --> 00:35:58.094
- And Janna you are like
a neighbor up the street

00:35:58.094 --> 00:35:59.434
at Barnard in Columbia,
so we'll just.

00:35:59.434 --> 00:36:01.064
- Yeah absolutely, I
just take a stroll.

00:36:01.064 --> 00:36:02.604
- [Neil] Yeah yeah we'll have

00:36:02.604 --> 00:36:05.344
to like have a bat signal.
- Just stroll down the park.

00:36:05.344 --> 00:36:06.774
(all laughing)

00:36:06.774 --> 00:36:08.004
- Are you out there?

00:36:08.004 --> 00:36:09.474
We need you here
for an Out There.

00:36:09.474 --> 00:36:12.144
And Harrison again thanks
for bein' on StarTalk.

00:36:12.144 --> 00:36:13.614
My Pleasure.

00:36:13.614 --> 00:36:14.484
- So you got cosmic queries
for us, what do you have?

00:36:14.484 --> 00:36:15.954
- Oh yeah, we got--

00:36:15.954 --> 00:36:16.614
- Let's make this entire
segment the lightning round.

00:36:16.614 --> 00:36:17.914
- Absolutely.

00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:19.684
- Oh we're gonna be faster.

00:36:19.684 --> 00:36:20.924
- They used to give me a bell,

00:36:20.924 --> 00:36:21.694
I don't know what
happened to my bell.

00:36:21.694 --> 00:36:22.894
But a lightning round,

00:36:22.894 --> 00:36:24.254
so this will just be
more sound bite answers,

00:36:24.254 --> 00:36:25.464
just so you can get
to more questions.

00:36:25.464 --> 00:36:26.294
- Totally.

00:36:26.294 --> 00:36:27.294
- Absolutely.

00:36:27.294 --> 00:36:28.794
We have Tony_LE738 on Instagram,

00:36:28.794 --> 00:36:30.194
Says, is there an
opposite to a black hole

00:36:30.194 --> 00:36:31.804
that just spews out things?

00:36:31.804 --> 00:36:33.234
- White hole.

00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:34.634
(Neil and Janna laugh)

00:36:34.634 --> 00:36:36.274
- Been there, done that.

00:36:36.274 --> 00:36:38.174
- I think it just spews
out endless garbage.

00:36:38.174 --> 00:36:39.004
No, okay.

00:36:40.744 --> 00:36:42.044
Ben Ratner at Ben
Makes TV on Twitter,

00:36:42.044 --> 00:36:44.874
what is your favorite
recipe for a good soup?

00:36:44.874 --> 00:36:49.154
- Ooh, it would be,
primordial soup.

00:36:49.154 --> 00:36:50.854
- Nice. (laughing)

00:36:50.854 --> 00:36:52.924
- I didn't mean to step
on your announcement,

00:36:52.924 --> 00:36:54.184
I was reading it out loud.

00:36:54.184 --> 00:36:56.854
- Oh yeah for me a
good soup would be

00:36:56.854 --> 00:37:01.864
all the basic ingredients
that are foundational

00:37:02.464 --> 00:37:04.194
to biochemistry.

00:37:04.194 --> 00:37:07.804
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen.

00:37:07.804 --> 00:37:11.504
Carbon is the stickiest
element on the entire table.

00:37:11.504 --> 00:37:13.944
It can make more
kinds of molecules

00:37:13.944 --> 00:37:17.474
than any other elements combined

00:37:17.474 --> 00:37:20.684
so gimme a soup with carbon,
nitrogen and oxygen in it

00:37:20.684 --> 00:37:23.154
and I can show you life.

00:37:23.154 --> 00:37:25.454
- Can you read the ingredients
of the primordial soup,

00:37:25.454 --> 00:37:26.454
does yours have the

00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:28.024
- [Neil] The ingredients?

00:37:28.024 --> 00:37:29.454
I used to be able to, let's see.

00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:30.554
- Is this a real one?

00:37:30.554 --> 00:37:31.554
- Oh yeah, okay.

00:37:31.554 --> 00:37:33.124
Quick and easy instructions.

00:37:33.124 --> 00:37:34.664
Mix soup, one can
of sea water, okay?

00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:38.504
Lightning, heat, uncovered
in early years. (laughing)

00:37:38.504 --> 00:37:41.134
This is like the
early earth year.

00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:44.334
For two to three millennia.

00:37:44.334 --> 00:37:48.644
Save the simple molecules

00:37:48.644 --> 00:37:52.244
to form larger more
complex molecules.

00:37:52.244 --> 00:37:56.554
For creamier soup, use
one can of organisms.

00:37:56.554 --> 00:37:57.784
(all laughing)

00:37:57.784 --> 00:38:00.984
So that'd be the best
kind of soup at all.

00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:02.394
- I prefer a split pea.

00:38:02.394 --> 00:38:04.024
- [Neil] Alright
keep goin' Harrison.

00:38:04.024 --> 00:38:05.324
- Alright we got Joshua
Willham from Facebook.

00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:06.624
- [Neil] We're
still in quick mode.

00:38:06.624 --> 00:38:07.824
Lightning mode.

00:38:07.824 --> 00:38:09.294
- Yeah, if you could
suddenly know the answer

00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:11.094
to any question, what
question would you choose?

00:38:11.094 --> 00:38:13.334
- Suddenly knowing the
answer is so disappointing.

00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:15.374
As a scientist the whole
fun is figuring it out.

00:38:15.374 --> 00:38:18.004
I didn't know if I'd suddenly
wanna know the answer

00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:20.174
to any question other
than when's my Uber coming

00:38:20.174 --> 00:38:21.204
or something.

00:38:21.204 --> 00:38:22.444
(all laughing)

00:38:22.444 --> 00:38:23.974
- You just have to
look at your phone.

00:38:23.974 --> 00:38:26.314
- Yeah that's not a
mystery on that one.

00:38:26.314 --> 00:38:28.754
- They have physics
that are unbelievable

00:38:28.754 --> 00:38:30.454
where the car just
jumps through a building

00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:33.424
and you're like that was
some physic impossibility.

00:38:33.424 --> 00:38:35.954
- Or it just does a flip
around and you know.

00:38:35.954 --> 00:38:37.994
- Did Uber discover a
black hole in the city,

00:38:37.994 --> 00:38:39.264
I dunno how it jumped.

00:38:39.264 --> 00:38:40.764
- Worm hole, worm hole
through the building.

00:38:40.764 --> 00:38:45.134
Still, for me the answer
I want is to the question

00:38:46.004 --> 00:38:47.734
we don't know yet to ask.

00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:48.974
- [Harrison] Ooh.

00:38:48.974 --> 00:38:51.234
- Would you recognize
it if you heard it?

00:38:51.234 --> 00:38:55.174
- Because the day we learn
what that question is

00:38:55.174 --> 00:38:57.944
I no longer care.

00:38:57.944 --> 00:39:00.814
I'll await the day when
the next question comes

00:39:00.814 --> 00:39:02.384
that I didn't know to ask.

00:39:02.384 --> 00:39:05.354
And this is strongly
resonant with Janna's answer,

00:39:05.354 --> 00:39:08.254
where the quest to the answer,

00:39:08.254 --> 00:39:09.854
science is not so
much about answers

00:39:09.854 --> 00:39:13.094
but the search for answers

00:39:13.094 --> 00:39:14.194
and that's where you learn,

00:39:14.194 --> 00:39:15.394
you stumble on things,

00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.134
you discover the
structures of things

00:39:17.134 --> 00:39:18.804
you didn't even know
that was a question

00:39:18.804 --> 00:39:20.264
you needed to ask.

00:39:20.264 --> 00:39:22.934
So yeah I'm all into the search.

00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:24.404
So these are--

00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:25.874
- I'd like to have the
answer, just not suddenly.

00:39:25.874 --> 00:39:27.104
- [Neil] But not
sudden. (laughs)

00:39:27.104 --> 00:39:28.574
- I don't want it
to be never either.

00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:29.844
Never is frustrating.

00:39:29.844 --> 00:39:31.714
- Very good, that's a
very healthy posture.

00:39:31.714 --> 00:39:33.284
Otherwise there's
a psychological
problem you're having.

00:39:33.284 --> 00:39:34.784
- Yeah there is, yeah exactly.

00:39:34.784 --> 00:39:36.514
- I like an escape room
so within 60 minutes,

00:39:36.514 --> 00:39:38.184
that's when I wanna
get the answers.

00:39:38.184 --> 00:39:39.784
Alright we got Scott
York on Instagram.

00:39:39.784 --> 00:39:41.654
Could dark matter or dark energy

00:39:41.654 --> 00:39:43.424
be any indication
of alien technology

00:39:43.424 --> 00:39:45.664
that is beyond
human comprehension?

00:39:45.664 --> 00:39:46.724
- Ooh. Go.

00:39:46.724 --> 00:39:48.864
Don't look at me!

00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:50.594
- This feels more like a Neil.

00:39:50.594 --> 00:39:51.464
- Okay here's what I would say,

00:39:51.464 --> 00:39:52.634
I'll give you my answer

00:39:53.804 --> 00:39:55.234
but I wanna hear
your answer, okay?

00:39:55.234 --> 00:39:56.774
Just because there's
something in the universe

00:39:56.774 --> 00:40:00.844
we don't understand, doesn't
mean it's aliens. (laughing)

00:40:00.844 --> 00:40:02.214
It doesn't mean it's magic.

00:40:02.214 --> 00:40:04.074
- Otherwise my VCR
was made by aliens.

00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:05.884
(All laughing)

00:40:05.884 --> 00:40:07.114
- Right, you still have a VCR?

00:40:07.114 --> 00:40:08.614
- Exactly, the fact
that I have a VCR--

00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:10.284
- We really need to get
you that grant, my God.

00:40:10.284 --> 00:40:12.084
- Would reflect alien
intervention somehow.

00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:13.554
- First you talk about
Mary Tyler Moore,

00:40:13.554 --> 00:40:15.854
you're talkin' about VCRs,
how the hell old are you guys?

00:40:15.854 --> 00:40:16.854
No.

00:40:16.854 --> 00:40:18.594
- Oh sorry, my beeper went off.

00:40:18.594 --> 00:40:19.664
(all laughing)

00:40:19.664 --> 00:40:21.194
- Oh, the beeper.

00:40:21.194 --> 00:40:26.134
So I think, wait what
was the question again?

00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:27.704
- [Janna] Could dark
matter and dark energy

00:40:27.704 --> 00:40:29.374
be evidence of aliens?

00:40:29.374 --> 00:40:31.774
- It's tempting,
it's always tempting

00:40:31.774 --> 00:40:34.544
to ascribe something
completely extraordinary

00:40:34.544 --> 00:40:37.014
as the cause for something
we don't understand.

00:40:37.014 --> 00:40:38.884
We've been doin' that forever.

00:40:38.884 --> 00:40:40.714
But as a scientist you
have to resist that

00:40:40.714 --> 00:40:42.614
because the history
of that exercise

00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:46.254
is one of abject
failure persistently.

00:40:46.254 --> 00:40:48.754
So to say it was actually magic,

00:40:48.754 --> 00:40:51.094
or it's actually God, or
it's actually an alien,

00:40:51.094 --> 00:40:53.164
and then you study
it and it's reducible

00:40:53.164 --> 00:40:56.464
to known forces, or maybe
you'll discover a new force

00:40:56.464 --> 00:40:58.564
but it's still not magic,
it's still not God,

00:40:58.564 --> 00:41:00.034
and it's still not aliens.

00:41:00.034 --> 00:41:04.804
So if I'm betting I would
say it's probably not as much

00:41:05.974 --> 00:41:07.804
as we would really
love it to be.

00:41:07.804 --> 00:41:09.374
- Now the place we should
be lookin' for aliens

00:41:09.374 --> 00:41:10.844
is a place we actually
know where to look

00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:12.344
which is on exoplanets

00:41:12.344 --> 00:41:15.384
and that's where there really
is a very serious prospect

00:41:15.384 --> 00:41:16.484
that there are aliens.

00:41:17.384 --> 00:41:18.884
Now, having said that--

00:41:18.884 --> 00:41:20.154
- [Neil] These are planets
orbiting other stars.

00:41:20.154 --> 00:41:21.124
- Yes, exactly, planets
orbiting other stars.

00:41:21.124 --> 00:41:22.524
We think that in our Milky Way

00:41:22.524 --> 00:41:24.894
of which there are hundreds
of billions of stars

00:41:24.894 --> 00:41:26.424
that there are
probably more planets

00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:28.264
than there are stars
in the Milky Way

00:41:28.264 --> 00:41:31.694
and so that's suddenly
a stunning number

00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:33.434
that we didn't realize,
what, 20 years ago.

00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:35.334
- Yeah but you're
just talking about

00:41:35.334 --> 00:41:36.804
some kind of living organism.

00:41:36.804 --> 00:41:37.734
- Right, I was gonna say,
don't be disappointed.

00:41:37.734 --> 00:41:39.174
- We're talking about aliens,

00:41:39.174 --> 00:41:40.404
we're talkin' about
- yeah, we can talk to 'em

00:41:40.404 --> 00:41:41.374
- Serious ray gun
aliens, ya know?

00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:42.774
- Absolutely.

00:41:42.774 --> 00:41:43.844
- The aliens, right.
- Area 51.

00:41:43.844 --> 00:41:45.044
- I know.

00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:46.484
They're probably
- Abducted

00:41:46.484 --> 00:41:47.114
- More like the kind of
thing you wipe off your shoe,

00:41:47.114 --> 00:41:47.844
which is sad.

00:41:47.844 --> 00:41:48.514
- Yeah, exactly.

00:41:49.484 --> 00:41:50.984
- That's for sure.

00:41:50.984 --> 00:41:51.924
- Some primordial ooze that
is itself the mat of life.

00:41:51.924 --> 00:41:54.524
You're so un-fun with that.

00:41:54.524 --> 00:41:58.024
It's true but un-fun.

00:41:58.024 --> 00:41:59.264
- Who knows?

00:41:59.264 --> 00:42:00.194
- A book that says
How to Serve Man

00:42:00.194 --> 00:42:01.564
but turns out it's a cookbook.

00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:03.264
Alright, K Fudge from
Instagram, how many black holes

00:42:03.264 --> 00:42:04.134
are there?
- Kate Fudge?

00:42:04.134 --> 00:42:05.304
- K Fudge.

00:42:05.304 --> 00:42:06.764
- K Fudge.

00:42:06.764 --> 00:42:07.704
- [Neil] Oh excuse me I
thought you said Kate Fudge.

00:42:07.704 --> 00:42:08.534
- Somebody's hungry.

00:42:08.534 --> 00:42:09.534
- [Neil] Alright.

00:42:09.534 --> 00:42:11.074
- How many black
holes are there?

00:42:11.074 --> 00:42:13.344
- So in our galaxy,

00:42:13.344 --> 00:42:14.904
we just said that there
are a few hundred billion

00:42:14.904 --> 00:42:16.174
stars in our galaxy.

00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:18.144
About 1% of them at
the end of their lives

00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:19.684
are going to be big
enough to collapse

00:42:19.684 --> 00:42:21.214
all the way through
to become black holes.

00:42:21.214 --> 00:42:23.354
And so that's a lot, right?

00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:24.584
- Yeah 1% of a hundred billion

00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:26.124
is a billion black holes.

00:42:26.124 --> 00:42:27.624
- It's a billion black holes,

00:42:27.624 --> 00:42:29.124
and in addition to that we know
there are tens of thousands

00:42:29.124 --> 00:42:31.054
of black holes around the
super massive black hole

00:42:31.054 --> 00:42:33.364
at the center of our galaxy.

00:42:33.364 --> 00:42:35.224
So the center of our
galaxy harbors a black hole

00:42:35.224 --> 00:42:36.564
a few million times
the mass of the sun

00:42:36.564 --> 00:42:38.364
and it has tens of
thousands of black holes

00:42:38.364 --> 00:42:40.004
specially segregated around it.

00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:41.334
So that's just our galaxy.

00:42:41.334 --> 00:42:43.404
Now you're saying in
the observable universe

00:42:43.404 --> 00:42:44.674
there are as many galaxies

00:42:44.674 --> 00:42:46.104
as there are stars
in the Milky Way.

00:42:46.104 --> 00:42:48.674
You got a lot of
black holes out there.

00:42:48.674 --> 00:42:50.274
- And all evidence shows
that every red blooded galaxy

00:42:50.274 --> 00:42:52.514
like the Milky Way has got
a super massive black hole

00:42:52.514 --> 00:42:53.984
in its center.

00:42:53.984 --> 00:42:56.254
- Yeah so we've got hundreds
of billions of those

00:42:56.254 --> 00:42:59.184
and hundreds of
billions times a billion

00:42:59.184 --> 00:43:00.684
of the smaller ones.

00:43:00.684 --> 00:43:02.194
- Surrender now.

00:43:02.194 --> 00:43:03.424
(all laughing)

00:43:03.424 --> 00:43:04.654
- Is that like the
worst Milky Way?

00:43:04.654 --> 00:43:06.464
Like a Milky Way candy
bar that's realistic

00:43:06.464 --> 00:43:07.524
has a black hole in
the middle of it?

00:43:07.524 --> 00:43:08.524
No thank you.

00:43:08.524 --> 00:43:11.894
On the black hole tangent, Tony,

00:43:11.894 --> 00:43:15.534
I'm sorry, Jeek.2 at Instagram,

00:43:15.534 --> 00:43:17.804
wrote "can a black hole
eat another black hole?"

00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.004
And if so,
- Oh yeah.

00:43:19.004 --> 00:43:20.604
- Would it lead to its growth?

00:43:20.604 --> 00:43:21.804
- Absolutely.

00:43:21.804 --> 00:43:22.774
- Like a Pac Man
theory of black holes.

00:43:22.774 --> 00:43:24.244
- Absolutely, one of the most--

00:43:24.244 --> 00:43:25.714
- Pac Man, your references
are so classic old!

00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:27.884
I love it
- Pac man!

00:43:27.884 --> 00:43:29.814
- But I have to make
fun of it 'cause we had

00:43:29.814 --> 00:43:32.124
- Can we come to your house
and see what you've got

00:43:32.124 --> 00:43:33.654
the set up there?

00:43:33.654 --> 00:43:35.284
- I've been to a couple of
80's escape rooms recently

00:43:35.284 --> 00:43:36.694
so it's on my mind.

00:43:36.694 --> 00:43:37.694
- Do you have a cell phone?

00:43:37.694 --> 00:43:38.724
(all laughing)

00:43:38.724 --> 00:43:40.064
- It's very large.

00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:41.694
- Wait, what was the question?

00:43:41.694 --> 00:43:43.094
Oh yeah, black holes
eating other black holes.

00:43:43.094 --> 00:43:45.194
That is one of the most
exciting things that's happened

00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:47.834
this century, is
the direct recording

00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.674
of the sound of
space-time ringing

00:43:49.674 --> 00:43:52.704
due to the collision
of two black holes,

00:43:52.704 --> 00:43:55.104
which if you want to call
it them eating each other

00:43:55.104 --> 00:43:56.514
you could.

00:43:56.514 --> 00:43:58.884
They merged and they
created a bigger black hole

00:43:58.884 --> 00:44:01.114
so each one was about 30
times the mass of the sun

00:44:01.114 --> 00:44:02.784
and so we know that there
is a black hole out there

00:44:02.784 --> 00:44:05.624
in that rough direction,
as far as we can ascertain,

00:44:05.624 --> 00:44:08.454
that is 60 times
the mass of the sun,

00:44:08.454 --> 00:44:10.554
and yes they get
bigger, they get bigger

00:44:10.554 --> 00:44:13.024
by almost as much
as you would think.

00:44:13.024 --> 00:44:15.324
The energy that they lost
in terms of like, literally,

00:44:15.324 --> 00:44:16.464
E equals MC squared energy

00:44:16.464 --> 00:44:18.034
that wasn't the sum of the parts

00:44:18.034 --> 00:44:20.164
came out in this
ringing of space-time.

00:44:20.164 --> 00:44:23.504
And it was recorded by LIGO,
this fantastic instrument.

00:44:23.504 --> 00:44:25.444
It happened in,
must've been 2015.

00:44:25.444 --> 00:44:26.904
- It's a new window
to the universe

00:44:26.904 --> 00:44:28.774
that's measuring the ripples
in the fabric of space

00:44:28.774 --> 00:44:31.074
rather than the ripples
in the energy of light.

00:44:31.074 --> 00:44:32.614
- And this is what Black
Hole Blues was all about,

00:44:32.614 --> 00:44:34.484
I was writing it while they
were on this campaign, yeah.

00:44:34.484 --> 00:44:35.884
- Your book.

00:44:35.884 --> 00:44:37.114
- And they hadn't succeeded
while I was writing

00:44:37.114 --> 00:44:38.384
and I was really writing
it, precisely ties in

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:39.624
with what we were
talking about earlier

00:44:39.624 --> 00:44:41.424
about the pursuit.

00:44:41.424 --> 00:44:43.454
And you know it
was 50 long years

00:44:43.454 --> 00:44:45.794
that they strove to
build this instrument

00:44:45.794 --> 00:44:46.994
and get this detection
- So wait a minute

00:44:46.994 --> 00:44:48.524
your title of your book
is Black Hole Blues

00:44:48.524 --> 00:44:50.264
is that 'cause you didn't
think they would find it?

00:44:50.264 --> 00:44:51.294
- Yeah.

00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:52.534
- And then they found it

00:44:52.534 --> 00:44:54.004
and now your book
has the wrong title.

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:56.134
- Yeah, so amazingly, Rai
Weiss, who won the Nobel Prize

00:44:56.134 --> 00:44:57.504
alongside Kip Thorne
and Barry Barish

00:44:57.504 --> 00:44:59.144
for that discovery, said to me

00:44:59.144 --> 00:45:01.274
about a month before
the detection occurred,

00:45:01.274 --> 00:45:04.774
"If we don't detect black
holes, this thing is a failure."

00:45:04.774 --> 00:45:06.014
And so I got the title,

00:45:06.014 --> 00:45:07.814
really thinking about
Rai saying that.

00:45:07.814 --> 00:45:10.814
That he's now in his 80s, he
started this as a young man,

00:45:10.814 --> 00:45:13.024
and it was the Black Hole Blues,

00:45:13.024 --> 00:45:17.224
but they told me well
before the book came out,

00:45:17.224 --> 00:45:18.154
they told me about
the detection,

00:45:18.154 --> 00:45:19.424
so I didn't wanna re-write it,

00:45:19.424 --> 00:45:20.994
'cause I think it is
all about the pursuit,

00:45:20.994 --> 00:45:22.764
but I did have a lovely close

00:45:22.764 --> 00:45:24.234
where they make the discovery.

00:45:24.234 --> 00:45:25.164
- Okay, I didn't get to
that close yet in your book.

00:45:25.164 --> 00:45:26.434
- [Janna] Yeah (laughing)

00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:27.564
- Now I'm gonna go
ahead to find it.

00:45:27.564 --> 00:45:29.134
Gimme more.

00:45:29.134 --> 00:45:32.744
- Alright, we got Michelle
Akempura from Facebook,

00:45:32.744 --> 00:45:35.074
"if everything is supposed
to be expanding away from

00:45:35.074 --> 00:45:36.244
each other how come our galaxy

00:45:36.244 --> 00:45:37.074
is on a collision
course with Andromeda?"

00:45:37.074 --> 00:45:38.944
- Okay, I got this.

00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:40.244
I got this.

00:45:40.244 --> 00:45:42.084
- I'm gonna have to
throw down after.

00:45:42.084 --> 00:45:43.384
- I got this.

00:45:43.384 --> 00:45:45.114
So the expansion
of the universe,

00:45:45.114 --> 00:45:47.284
is think of it as
a stretchy fabric

00:45:47.284 --> 00:45:50.354
that if, and it doesn't
matter where you are,

00:45:50.354 --> 00:45:52.594
you'll think you're at the
center of that stretching

00:45:52.594 --> 00:45:54.694
and you'll see objects
moving away from you

00:45:54.694 --> 00:45:56.164
in every direction.

00:45:56.164 --> 00:45:59.534
Objects that are near you will
not be moving away as fast

00:45:59.534 --> 00:46:01.904
as objects that
are farther away.

00:46:01.904 --> 00:46:05.744
'Cause every, let's say for
every meter it stretches

00:46:05.744 --> 00:46:07.344
ten centimeters, okay?

00:46:07.344 --> 00:46:10.244
Well that means at two meters
it stretches 20 centimeters.

00:46:10.244 --> 00:46:12.244
At three meters
it's 30 centimeters.

00:46:12.244 --> 00:46:14.044
That's how stretching
works in the fabric.

00:46:14.044 --> 00:46:19.024
So, all galaxies have speeds
relative to each other.

00:46:20.184 --> 00:46:24.954
If you have a nearby
galaxy it's goin' faster

00:46:26.164 --> 00:46:29.634
than the stretching
speed of the universe

00:46:29.634 --> 00:46:32.204
in the space near me,

00:46:32.204 --> 00:46:36.334
so my gravity overcomes
anything the universe is doing

00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:37.804
for things nearby.

00:46:37.804 --> 00:46:40.374
So nearby galaxies are
goin' on like the universe

00:46:40.374 --> 00:46:42.144
is not expanding, they
don't really care.

00:46:42.144 --> 00:46:44.444
Their gravity is strong
enough to create motions

00:46:44.444 --> 00:46:48.414
that overcome the expansion
of the universe itself.

00:46:48.414 --> 00:46:50.884
But we're not gonna collide
with a distant galaxy

00:46:50.884 --> 00:46:52.554
'cause the stretching
of the universe

00:46:52.554 --> 00:46:55.324
is taking us away faster
than that can ever happen.

00:46:55.324 --> 00:46:56.524
- I just wanted to
make reference to,

00:46:56.524 --> 00:46:59.364
I think it's Annie
Hall, the line where

00:46:59.364 --> 00:47:01.194
- [Neil] Oh okay go on.

00:47:01.194 --> 00:47:03.564
- The character
won't do his homework

00:47:03.564 --> 00:47:04.394
because he's,

00:47:04.394 --> 00:47:05.534
- The kid, the kid

00:47:05.534 --> 00:47:06.764
- because the
universe is expanding,

00:47:06.764 --> 00:47:09.334
and his mother says
"you live in Brooklyn,

00:47:09.334 --> 00:47:10.874
Brooklyn is not expanding!"

00:47:10.874 --> 00:47:12.004
(all laughing)

00:47:12.004 --> 00:47:13.574
And it's true, Brooklyn
is not expanding

00:47:13.574 --> 00:47:15.144
for precisely the
reasons Neil just gave

00:47:15.144 --> 00:47:17.944
that the earth is bound together

00:47:17.944 --> 00:47:20.944
more strongly than the
expansion can tear apart.

00:47:20.944 --> 00:47:22.454
- [Neil] Universe
in this section,

00:47:22.454 --> 00:47:24.354
the expanding universe is not
gonna break apart the earth.

00:47:24.354 --> 00:47:25.684
- Yeah.

00:47:25.684 --> 00:47:26.924
- But now a bunch of
developers have bought Brooklyn

00:47:26.924 --> 00:47:28.154
and it is expanding
at an incredible pace.

00:47:28.154 --> 00:47:28.954
(Janna laughs)

00:47:28.954 --> 00:47:30.324
Alright so we got,

00:47:30.324 --> 00:47:31.324
- It's gotta be fast!

00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:32.724
- Kyle Toth from
Venice, Florida.

00:47:32.724 --> 00:47:35.494
"What lies beyond the
observable universe?

00:47:35.494 --> 00:47:37.964
"Do we have an estimated
size of the entire universe?"

00:47:37.964 --> 00:47:39.264
- Ooh.

00:47:39.264 --> 00:47:40.064
- I love this.

00:47:40.064 --> 00:47:41.564
- Janna take it.

00:47:41.564 --> 00:47:43.004
And by the way, but we're
still kind of in speed mode

00:47:43.004 --> 00:47:45.574
but we're gonna end with
your answer to this question.

00:47:45.574 --> 00:47:46.904
- Okay, lovely.

00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:47.844
- No pressure.

00:47:47.844 --> 00:47:49.344
- That's a lot of pressure.

00:47:49.344 --> 00:47:53.144
It is conceivable that the
universe is actually finite

00:47:53.144 --> 00:47:55.214
in the same sense that
the earth is finite.

00:47:55.214 --> 00:47:57.314
If I leave New York City and
I walk in as straight a line

00:47:57.314 --> 00:47:59.754
as possible, and I go for
as long as I possibly can,

00:47:59.754 --> 00:48:01.384
I come back to New
York city again.

00:48:01.384 --> 00:48:02.724
It is conceivable

00:48:02.724 --> 00:48:04.124
- Without ever
falling off an end.

00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:05.594
- Without ever
turning left or right,

00:48:05.594 --> 00:48:07.124
falling off an edge, going
forward and backward.

00:48:07.124 --> 00:48:09.034
- So you can walk
forward forever.

00:48:09.034 --> 00:48:10.264
- Forward forever, it
just keeps coming back

00:48:10.264 --> 00:48:11.664
around and around
- In a finite space

00:48:11.664 --> 00:48:12.834
- and around again.

00:48:12.834 --> 00:48:14.334
Now if the whole
universe is like this

00:48:14.334 --> 00:48:17.274
I literally would leave the
Milky Way in a spacecraft,

00:48:17.274 --> 00:48:18.634
I would travel in
a straight line,

00:48:18.634 --> 00:48:20.104
watch the galaxy
recede behind me,

00:48:20.104 --> 00:48:22.074
not turn left, not turn
right, never stop, forward,

00:48:22.074 --> 00:48:23.614
not fall off the
edge of the universe,

00:48:23.614 --> 00:48:26.084
but see the Milky Way
approach in front of me again.

00:48:26.084 --> 00:48:26.914
- What?

00:48:29.284 --> 00:48:30.214
(all laughing)

00:48:30.214 --> 00:48:31.454
How many, how many--

00:48:31.454 --> 00:48:32.284
- We need a mic drop
on this, alright here.

00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:33.924
(imitating banging)

00:48:33.924 --> 00:48:34.924
- There you go.

00:48:34.924 --> 00:48:35.894
(all laughing)

00:48:35.894 --> 00:48:37.124
- Did you hear it?

00:48:37.124 --> 00:48:38.354
- That was an audio
mic drop right there.

00:48:38.354 --> 00:48:39.524
- How many seasons
of this podcast

00:48:39.524 --> 00:48:40.324
would you have to
listen to before you saw

00:48:40.324 --> 00:48:41.564
the Milky Way again?

00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:42.794
- That's right,
we would look back

00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:45.664
and because light has
a finite travel time

00:48:45.664 --> 00:48:48.164
we would hear podcasts
from our past,

00:48:48.164 --> 00:48:49.604
like you could look
back and see yourself

00:48:49.604 --> 00:48:52.404
as a child if you
waited long enough

00:48:52.404 --> 00:48:54.804
for the light to come
back around again.

00:48:54.804 --> 00:48:55.874
- From the other
direction, yeah.

00:48:55.874 --> 00:48:57.374
- From the other direction,

00:48:57.374 --> 00:49:00.814
and so we could actually
resolve serious quandaries

00:49:00.814 --> 00:49:02.554
by being like, well if
we wait a billion years

00:49:02.554 --> 00:49:04.184
we can actually watch
it again. (laughs)

00:49:04.184 --> 00:49:05.984
- Just to get to
the arguments made

00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:07.324
about who said

00:49:07.324 --> 00:49:07.854
what over dinner.
- To see what really happened.

00:49:07.854 --> 00:49:09.024
Exactly.

00:49:09.024 --> 00:49:09.924
- Exactly.

00:49:09.924 --> 00:49:11.124
- Who broke the plate, right?

00:49:11.124 --> 00:49:13.264
- There's a sad
old astronaut alone

00:49:13.264 --> 00:49:14.494
like, "I told you, Janice.

00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:16.894
This was all worth it."

00:49:16.894 --> 00:49:20.834
- So but okay so that's
a finite universe

00:49:20.834 --> 00:49:23.304
but just as equally the
universe could be infinite

00:49:23.304 --> 00:49:24.304
and we're just our
own observable pocket

00:49:24.304 --> 00:49:26.404
within some infinite universe.

00:49:26.404 --> 00:49:29.314
- Right it is also possible,

00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:30.944
that the universe is infinite

00:49:30.944 --> 00:49:33.044
and beyond the
observable universe

00:49:33.044 --> 00:49:35.044
is this infinite
stretch of space.

00:49:35.044 --> 00:49:37.254
But you know, Einstein said
"only two things are infinite,

00:49:37.254 --> 00:49:39.014
"the universe and
human stupidity."

00:49:39.014 --> 00:49:41.284
And then he said, "I'm not
so sure about the universe."

00:49:41.284 --> 00:49:43.494
(all laughing)

00:49:43.494 --> 00:49:46.424
- That sounds like we should
end on that note doesn't it?

00:49:46.424 --> 00:49:47.994
- Einstein mic drop.

00:49:47.994 --> 00:49:51.134
- Wow, that was Cosmic
Queries, Out There Edition,

00:49:51.134 --> 00:49:52.964
our very first on that theme.

00:49:52.964 --> 00:49:55.634
But clearly we're gonna
have to do this again.

00:49:55.634 --> 00:49:57.174
'Cause there's no end to
those kind of questions,

00:49:57.174 --> 00:50:01.474
particularly if we get Janna
kinda answers right there.

00:50:01.474 --> 00:50:03.544
Janna it was great, and
I've been loving your book,

00:50:03.544 --> 00:50:05.274
- Thanks it was fun.

00:50:05.274 --> 00:50:06.484
- [Neil] The Black
Hole Blues. (laughing)

00:50:06.484 --> 00:50:08.514
Harrison thanks for
coming back on StarTalk.

00:50:08.514 --> 00:50:10.084
- Oh my pleasure.

00:50:10.084 --> 00:50:12.654
- [Neil] And
HarrisonGreenbaum.com,
look for where you,

00:50:12.654 --> 00:50:15.224
for your stand up gigs,
and you're also a magician.

00:50:15.224 --> 00:50:16.724
- Absolutely.

00:50:16.724 --> 00:50:17.994
- [Neil] Like as you said,

00:50:17.994 --> 00:50:18.794
that's the double
threat. (laughing)

00:50:18.794 --> 00:50:20.094
- Very common.

00:50:20.094 --> 00:50:21.294
- Very common, very common.

00:50:21.294 --> 00:50:23.094
And I've been your host,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:50:23.094 --> 00:50:24.334
This has been StarTalk.

00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:28.034
And as always, I bid
you to keep looking up.

00:50:28.034 --> 00:50:30.974
(futuristic music)
