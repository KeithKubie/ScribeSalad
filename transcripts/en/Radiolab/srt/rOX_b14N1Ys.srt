00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,420
You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,330
from [inaudible].

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,350
W. N. Y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Alright.
Three two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. O.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,910
K. I'm Robert Krulwich. You're
a cheery today. I was curious.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,900
This is radio land. This is our podcast
version. Yes, and today on the podcast,

6
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,110
stay in that cheery frame of mind because
we're going to talk about pain today.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,240
So here's the quandary.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,530
It is really hard to put words to pain,

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,240
like to describe to somebody. I have
this pain in my back and it feels like,

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,560
wow, like odd or really hurting.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,940
It's like it's really difficult
to describe to someone
in a way that would let

12
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,860
them feel it too. It's like one
of these classic empathy barriers.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,770
Right? That's true. But if you
could quantify it, measure it.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,550
If I could know exactly numerically
what you're going through,

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,530
maybe that would help. Maybe we could
be better friends if, if you could,

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,640
do you think you could is
that know Oregon to try?

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,380
See our producer,

18
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:14,090
Tim Howard over the last few months has
encountered three different people who

19
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:17,900
in different ways are trying
to measure pain, share it.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,960
So we're going to do three episodes
of pain calibration calibration,

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,080
a triptych of pain
calibration. Okay. Bring it on.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,510
You used to, uh, well

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,270
I got started with all this when I met
this guy. Yeah. I'm Justin Schmidt.

24
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm a research biologist,
but he's really a bug guy.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,250
I like to try to get into the
head of the stinging insect.

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,940
He lives in, in Tucson, Arizona, and um,

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,600
works in this one story building
on a residential street.

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,130
Right now we're in my
laboratory at southwestern
biological institute. Could we,

29
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,510
could we just, uh, take a quick
like glance around? I'd love to,

30
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,450
I'd love to just like what? No, no.
What it is though, we're looking at,

31
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,570
underneath those cabinets are
48 drawers of insect specimen.

32
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:08,740
So these are, wow,

33
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,650
he's got wasp that's a Poco and
it's a nocturnal wasp is terrifying.

34
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:18,240
This one here, different
kinds of weird foreign it.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,400
That's actually a flightless
grasshopper. It's got a lot of ants. Wow.

36
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:25,340
There's some little furry,
yeah. Those are velvet ants.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,520
They're huge of you pick up one
of these things and get stung by.

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,340
It's going to feel like, oh my
goodness. That could kill a cow. Okay.

39
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:38,140
So this all started for Justin back
in the 70s when he was a grad student.

40
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:42,650
And I just thought for a Lark, I took
a seminar course in entomology. We,

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,570
we had one entomologist in
the whole university. This
is of course in bug signs.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,010
This was in Georgia and he was outside
one day in the field and he was trying to

44
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:55,360
get a sample of, um, harvest strand
harvests or in, what does that look like?

45
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,840
About a third of an inch
long. And they're bright,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,540
pretty good sized ants actually.

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,650
And he was trying to get
one into a jar and uh,

48
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,720
I got stung by [inaudible]
the night I kind of,

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,800
oh, it's odd. It didn't
really hurt at first. Okay.

50
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,840
It sort of felt like
somebody was using a dental,

51
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,660
a syringe or really fine needles.
Slowly injecting a little bit of water.

52
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,900
It had this kind of Crystalyn feeling.

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,940
It wasn't an immediate pain. This was
a delayed thing. And so then I thought,

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,850
oh, okay. But after about a minute,

55
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,860
he started really hurting

56
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,603
[inaudible]

57
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,950
oh, this really hurts.

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,630
Is this really deep sort of visceral pain.

59
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:52,980
Something was going in and tearing out
your nerves and your muscles and your

60
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:53,814
tendons.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,843
[inaudible]

62
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,330
what struck me was how dramatically
different this was from anything that I'd

63
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:10,700
experienced from a Bumblebee, honeybee
sweat, B yellow jacket paper was in.

64
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:15,480
Once the pain subsided, he thought,
man, I need to study that. Yeah.

65
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,360
You know, he had all these kind of
higher level science questions about,

66
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,840
you know,

67
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,040
evolution of pain and insects and how
different stinging in sex develops.

68
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,710
But the problem was, oh,

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,200
O k pain.

70
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,630
What do we do about measuring pain if
he was really gonna get to the bottom of

71
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:39,050
why one insect was more or
less painful than another,

72
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,980
he couldn't do that with
just words like more or less.

73
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,330
I need numbers with numbers. He
could do all kinds of research.

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,740
Not to mention it would make working
with other bug scientists just a lot

75
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,800
easier. And I started looking
into this and found out, oh,

76
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,540
this wasn't anything new.

77
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,590
Nobody really knows how to
measure pain because you know,

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,930
no two people feel pain the same way.

79
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,650
Some people I'm hired pain tolerance
than others. On the other hand,

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,150
that harvest rent was objectively way
more painful than anything he'd ever been

81
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:12,380
stung by. Oh yeah.

82
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,410
So Justin realized what I need
is a universal insects thing,

83
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
pain scale [inaudible] so Justin starts
traveling all around the world and he's,

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,250
you know, every time he hears about
a bug, especially a stinging bug, uh,

85
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,060
he goes looking for it and in
order to be stung by it, well,

86
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,470
I don't like pain. And so he says
he's not trying to get stung,

87
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,310
but it usually happens. And as far as
he's concerned, that's a good thing.

88
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,000
For example, I was petrified
of this. The SINICA,

89
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,490
which I call the warrior wasp a sneaker,

90
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:52,491
is this a black wasp with this metallic
sheen down in Central America and

91
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,040
they're known for this warning sound
that they make with their nest.

92
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,930
They have this big carton carton being
kind of paper kind of goes, yeah.

93
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,650
[inaudible]. Justin

94
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,550
was there with another scientist and
they're tromping through the jungle and

95
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:11,330
then they find a nest. Here we are this
nest and it starts to make that sound.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,820
Well, sure enough,

97
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,100
we eventually got a kamikaze that
came out and nailed me. Wait,

98
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,150
where did this thing you kind of on my
forehead and I just sort of sat on the

99
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,750
stump and sir, Ooh, this really hurts it.

100
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,020
It hurt like a yellow jacket or a horn,

101
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,050
but it was just a whole lot more and
it kept hurting for an hour and so I,

102
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,200
you know, recorded what the
feeling was for this hour,

103
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,670
but you're sitting there in a stump or
something and your forehead is throbbing

104
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,640
and you're taking notes.
Well, what else can you do?

105
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,640
He talks about getting stung by something
that makes him hurt so much that he

106
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:57,050
just starts screaming and pain for like
an hour in lying on the ground because

107
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,740
that'll make the pain less I guess.
Then my left hands sitting here shaking,

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,110
it's trembling, you know, it's
going up and down and I say,

109
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,780
Oh darn your hand stop that.
Then with his other hand,

110
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,360
he's taking notes about exactly what,

111
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,040
how it feels this left
once you flapping away.

112
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,730
And I'm in any case, how
many times has he been stung?

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,770
He told me he's been stung by like 150
species and probably about a thousand

114
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,480
times and he's used all those
experiences to build up a scale,

115
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,770
which he could say is a five
point scale, zero one, two,

116
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,830
three and four zero being that's
essentially trivial and four being really

117
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,220
hurts. But wait, how does he deal
with the whole subjectivity thing?

118
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,860
Cause like your four is going to be
different in my fourth here's something

119
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,431
pretty clever,

120
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:45,431
which is that he took that one sting
that we pretty much all know and decided,

121
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,960
I mean he used that as a reference.

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,020
So I anchored it with the honeybee,

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,650
which is ouch, which I, you
can talk about with anybody.

124
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,990
Anybody who's been stung by a honeybee,

125
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,500
it also doesn't hurt too much
and it doesn't hurt too little.

126
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,750
So it's like a mid point. Exactly.

127
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,920
And a middle point in this case was
easier than a top or a bottom because I

128
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,450
didn't know what the top or bottom where.

129
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,640
There's no way to know where
the top or the bottom is.

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,920
So a honeybee was was that, and see,

131
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:20,921
give that a two two out of four the
prime meridian of pain and every time he

132
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:27,260
gets stung by a new bug, he'll ask
himself, is it more than a honeybee?

133
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:31,010
Less than a honeybee, about the same
as a honey bee, a whole lot more,

134
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,060
a whole lot less then it gives
that thing its own number. Big.

135
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,000
This 1.0 sweat like a
femoral almost fruity,

136
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,710
1.8 bullhorn occasion and a rare
piercing, elevated sort of pain.

137
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,630
Someone is fired. A staple into your
cheek. 2.0 bald faced Hornet. Rich Hardy,

138
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,380
slightly crunchy, similar to getting
your hand mash in a revolving door.

139
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,010
How three red harvests are
in bold and unrelenting.

140
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,680
Somebody is using a drill to
excavate your ingrown toenail. Huh?

141
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,360
This is his pain scale. Justin calls.
This is tongue in cheek first. That was,

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,300
you know, more fun. But yeah, these are
some of these things that he's measured.

143
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,320
And what's the, uh, what's the worst?
What's the top of the scale? Uh,

144
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,223
the bullet and

145
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,540
it sends excruciating waves of burning
pain that are undiminished for 12 hours.

146
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,550
And you get these
pulsations, you get this,

147
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,650
this pain crescendo that goes to
you just about wanting to scream.

148
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,890
It backs off a little
bit and say, say, ah,

149
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,340
you kind of give it a little bit of a
sigh or we leave and then it sends back up

150
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,390
and it keeps doing this,

151
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:38,391
these hills and valleys of ascending pain
and then decrease even the decreasing

152
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,590
to the lowest still hurts.

153
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,100
So this scale, uh,

154
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,830
works for him and he uses it to
communicate with bug scientists.

155
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, all
right. That's kind of cool.

156
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:55,040
But I gotta be honest. I, I, this is,

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm wanting more right now because I, uh,

158
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,890
I liked the scale, but I'm thinking
actually beyond bugs to like,

159
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,780
let me just put my cards on the
table, like childbirth. Okay. Like,

160
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,220
oh, okay. I know. But we talked
about the gap between like, uh,

161
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,190
to people feeling pain. And
being able to share pain.

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,840
That's where the rubber meets the road.

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,200
It's used in a lot of marriages
as a constant. You don't know.

164
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,190
You don't know what exactly.
Yeah. Thank you Robert.

165
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,070
This tame argues it the
way Carla uses it. Well,

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,850
I can't say that in another
recording. No, not at all.

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,650
It really never crossed my mind.

168
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,650
Carla, who is a very sort of understating
lady when it comes to this subject,

169
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,750
she'll be like, you have no idea.

170
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,470
You don't even begin to know what you
don't know about what we just went

171
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:50,610
through. Well that brings me
to my second store. Can I,

172
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,940
can I take it from the top for
this one? We go back a few years.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,520
So where in 1948

174
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,210
oh

175
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,520
well who is this lady?
This is Paula Michaels.

176
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,980
She's a professor of the
history of medicine. I teach
at the University of Iowa.

177
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,810
And she told me this story that takes
place in New York at New York hospital in

178
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:12,600
1948 right. So there's James D. Hardy,

179
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,200
there's Carl t Jeff air
hardy handover doctors,

180
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,930
and they're trying to test drugs.

181
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,770
You know what drugs are going to be useful
to alleviate the pain of childbirth.

182
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,890
And in this period there's a whole
range of things that are being used.

183
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,990
What are some of the ones
that they're using? Well,

184
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:32,190
like more Phoenix Cupola mean.
Um, demerol is a big thing.

185
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,180
Nice and heroin, which to
me sounds completely crazy.

186
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,110
They play on crack too. They, they
would have, if they knew about it.

187
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,760
The problem is they want to be able to
test all of these drugs so that they can

188
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,650
use them in a standard way,

189
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,760
but they weren't actually sure how
much pain women were really in.

190
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,710
And I guess you kind of have to know
that in order to know how much drugs to

191
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:58,450
give them. Yeah. They had no idea. And
it was a source of a lot of debate. Yes.

192
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,480
One man Grantly decreed a British
physician basically said straight out,

193
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,850
it's in women's minds, not their bodies.

194
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,470
What childbirth is a
completely painless experience.

195
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,680
Entirely psychological in origin. Wow.

196
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:19,360
That is an incredibly bold thing for
Amanda. Say yes, that's Chutzpah.

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,060
Now Hardy and Java or
didn't take it that far,

198
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:26,980
but they wanted to get past the whole
messy psychological part of childbirth and

199
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,130
eliminate that woman's subjective
experience of pain from the calculation of

200
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:37,060
whether these drugs are effective or
not and how are they going to do this?

201
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,400
Well, their method is pretty crazy.

202
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,523
Okay.

203
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,840
They had this apparatus
called a doll Ramadan.

204
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,280
It was this little wood box that had
dials and knobs plugged into the wall and

205
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,530
then was connected by
a wire to another part,

206
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,510
what they called the exposure unit.

207
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,230
That was like a heat gun with an
aperture that can shoot out heat.

208
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,380
Then they got some volunteers,
some of them are nurses,

209
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,150
some of them were the wives of
obstetricians or other physicians,

210
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,080
all very pregnant and they told these
women, this might not be very pleasant,

211
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:13,490
but by participating you are going to
be making childbirth just so much better

212
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:17,020
for every woman to follow. That's right.
And the women were excited to help.

213
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,280
And then when the woman went into labor,

214
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,530
hardy and Java would show up bedside with
the dolor arbiter and they'd wait for

215
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:25,700
the contraction to finish.

216
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,290
And then between contractions
during that pause,

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,010
they take the heat gun and they put it
against the back of the woman's hand and

218
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:38,920
they'd say to her, all right, we
want to know about that contraction.

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,880
The one you just had. Yeah, we want
to know how much it hurt. Nate. Say,

220
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:43,990
is it more like a

221
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,310
one more like it?

222
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,890
And then the woman would respond because
B as closer. Then they would say,

223
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,470
is it more like B or more like c?

224
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,320
See maybe that was a way
of then saying, okay,

225
00:13:57,321 --> 00:14:02,321
well that was a contraction of
three dolls dolls with the doll.

226
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,940
The Dole is their unit of pain.

227
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,940
They're their standard unit
that they use for everybody.

228
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,710
[inaudible] and so over the course
of labor, after every contraction,

229
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,710
they would repeat this
process. Same drill.

230
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,810
Is it more like a or more like bit again
a B and again beat one more like c and

231
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:24,890
again over the course of her whole labor.
So we on top of all the labor pains,

232
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:28,100
they're just cranking this
heat up and up. Yeah. Wow.

233
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,510
In the case of one patient,

234
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,080
Oh,

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,820
who insisted on going the distance at
pain intensity of 10 and a half dolls with

236
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,520
measured hardy and Java are
called this the ceiling.

237
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,430
This is the most intense pain
which can be experienced.

238
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,140
Second degree burns were inflicted upon
the hands of this patient by the four

239
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:54,110
tests made at levels than nine
dolls. Second degree burns. Yeah.

240
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,920
I mean I like what these guys are
trying to do, but wow, that is sadistic.

241
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,210
It seems totally twisted, but
it's in the name of science.

242
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
It's for a greater good. Uh Huh.
All right. So then the doctor is,

243
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,450
they took all of the data from all of the
women and they start going through it,

244
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,730
looking for patterns,
looking for things in common.

245
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,150
And then the most incredible part to
me is that they converted all that

246
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:23,890
information into a mathematical formula.

247
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Doles of pain equals 10.5 minus 1.5
times contraction intervals in minutes.

248
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,351
What? Well,

249
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:40,351
so they're saying if you tell us the
amount of time between the contractions at

250
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,890
any point in our labor,

251
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,430
we can tell you exactly how much
pain the woman is in no more mystery.

252
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,460
There's no more wondering problem-solve.

253
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,790
The code is cracked and what happens? Uh,

254
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,700
this is a breakthrough sweep.
The medical establishment,

255
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm guessing it doesn't, uh,

256
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,790
no other people could not achieve the
same results that they achieved using the

257
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,700
Deloitte, I don't know, like at the lot

258
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,700
[inaudible] using the dull ramen or
they were not able to achieve the same

259
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:18,320
results when other doctors tried to do it.

260
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,030
That formula didn't seem to apply
to the women that they looked at.

261
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:23,570
Shocker.

262
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,290
Obviously there's a lot of problems
with the entire approach that these guys

263
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,170
had, right? No. Yeah.
I mean, for starters,

264
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,740
they were trying to compare pain
in the abdomen to, you know,

265
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,470
like a burning sensation on the
arm. Yeah. I mean, that's a,

266
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:38,810
that's like a translation
problem. Yeah. Well,

267
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,130
I mean in my opinion there's kind of
a bigger translation issue happening,

268
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,250
which is in order to talk
about a pain you're feeling,

269
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,760
you need to be able to observe it and,

270
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,030
and kind of stand apart from it in your
own head, if that makes sense. Sure.

271
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,380
And when you hear women talk about the
pain of childbirth, my name is Sarah,

272
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm in Sacramento, California.

273
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,000
We asked people to submit theirs
through the radio lab app.

274
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,300
And when you listen to
these different accounts,

275
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,280
my experience of childbirth pain was,

276
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,080
it sounds like there's a certain point
where everything shifts and one woman

277
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,890
said it was at about late [inaudible]
seven centimeters dilated and that's when

278
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,880
you like lose your mind and
you can't think you can't talk.

279
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,690
Suddenly the pain
becomes so great, so bad,

280
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,010
but there's no more reference point.

281
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:30,011
I just remember there's no more objective
distance making these noises that were

282
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,850
just on earthly. And in these submissions,

283
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:38,840
it's usually at this point in the
story where the woman neither just

284
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,330
draws a blank wow.

285
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,320
Or resorts to some crazy analogy.

286
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,610
I felt like there was a freight train

287
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,640
bearing down on my vagina
from inside my body,

288
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,250
and then I could almost hear it building

289
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,440
to come to [inaudible]. I felt like
I was being dragged out to sea.

290
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,260
That's when I actually
heard a couple times waves,

291
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,660
waves of pain. And it was
kind of like that for,

292
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,450
for Paula too. I turned very
much inward in a way that,

293
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,610
that made time feel like it stopped.

294
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,260
[inaudible]

295
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,310
I was drowning,

296
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,990
drowning in this lake of pain and there
was a horizon and when the contractions

297
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:39,780
were intense, I would swim
towards the horizon. This is Eula.

298
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm Eula Biss. I'm a nonfiction
writer and she's our third pain.

299
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,260
Calibrator and for me,

300
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,300
you look kind of gets the closest at
finding a way to communicate pain.

301
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,260
If, if I could see you have a
relationship with pain, uh, when did that,

302
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:57,870
when did that start for you? Let's see.

303
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,320
About almost 10 years ago,

304
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,520
I think I was about 26 at the time.

305
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,160
Ula was a Grad student in Iowa and uh,

306
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,910
I just woke up one morning in the fall
and I had a terrible pain and the side of

307
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:19,860
my neck, upper back side of my
face, she had no idea what it was.

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,240
It was a burning pain with this
nauseatingly tingling sensation.

309
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,220
I've really never felt anything
else like it. And months past,

310
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,420
and it didn't go away and it was making
it very difficult for me to sleep.

311
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,920
It started to interfere with my
thinking too. I couldn't concentrate.

312
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,600
So one day she went to the hospital
and by this point she was a total mess.

313
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,100
So I was kind of teary and
shaking and I said, you,

314
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,600
you need to give me something to help
me with this. And so the doc said,

315
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,900
all right, well take a look at
this thing up here on the wall.

316
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,020
This is called the pain scale.
It had the numbers zero to 10.

317
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,470
At one end it said no pain at the other
end it said the worst pain imaginable.

318
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,280
And the doctor says to her,
okay, what number is your pain?

319
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,150
Ula starts to think about it. The
worst pain imaginable is kind of vague.

320
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,460
Is this the worst pain
you yourself can imagine?

321
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,650
Or is it the worst pain
imaginable on earth? You know,

322
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,730
this was around the time that I think
a man had died being dragged behind a

323
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:28,530
truck in Texas. And I, I remember sitting
in the exam room thinking about that.

324
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,050
And then I was trying to do
some rudimentary mathematics
if being dragged behind

325
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:38,010
a truck a to your death is the
worst pain imaginable. What,

326
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,170
what proportion of that
do I feel? And I thought,

327
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:47,220
you know, a third of that
seemed pretty significant to me.

328
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,840
So she says three, I
guess. And the is like,

329
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,400
all right. And he does some tests.

330
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,580
He tries to figure out exactly
what's going on, can't really,

331
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,660
but since she said three anyway,
he's like, all right, well, you know,

332
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,030
have some aspirin, go home.
And this happened a few times.

333
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,490
She wasn't getting any
better. So at a certain point,

334
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:10,120
she calls up her dad who's also a
doctor and she starts complaining.

335
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,270
I was telling him how
frustrated I was that, um,

336
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,890
the doctors didn't seem to be taking
this very seriously. And he said, well,

337
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,860
when they ask you to rate your
pain, what, what do you tell them?

338
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,370
[inaudible] and I said, I usually
say three. And he said, well,

339
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:25,360
there's your problem.

340
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,750
Her Dad tells her you should say
eight, even if you're not feeling it.

341
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:33,710
That's what you gotta say.
And Ula thinks, you know,

342
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:34,820
this is ridiculous.

343
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:38,780
Why do we even have a pain scale if
I'm not supposed to take the numbers

344
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:39,390
seriously?

345
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,850
And, um, he said, in part,

346
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:46,851
it's a tool that's meant to protect
practitioners because it's emotionally

347
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:51,030
difficult to have someone say to you, um,

348
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,300
it feels like someone's jamming a red
hot poker through my eyeball rather than,

349
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,380
I've got a nine.

350
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,070
But then he made a suggestion,
which I think is really clever.

351
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,080
He suggested one scale where

352
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,670
that would measure what you're
willing to do to get rid of your pain.

353
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,740
What would you trade for pain relief?

354
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,660
Would you give up your sense
of sight for five years?

355
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,590
Would you relinquish your ability to walk?

356
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,610
Did you come up with any
answers at that point? I did. I,

357
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,300
they were disturbing answers,
you know, when my father asked,

358
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:38,890
would you accept a shorter lifespan?
At that point in time I thought, yeah,

359
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,440
I would have how many years?

360
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,640
I was thinking I'd take
10 years off my life.

361
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,490
Wow. For me,

362
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,830
that was basically the first time
I felt like I understood her pain.

363
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,240
But you know,

364
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:59,241
I was 26 and life seems really long when
you're 26 now I'm in a much difference,

365
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:05,820
but my pain is not nearly
as bad as it was then.

366
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:09,960
So now I'm not really in
the bargaining mood anymore.

367
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,050
I bet. Like how about a bad haircut?
Would you take it really bad haircut?

368
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,513
A Mohawk?

369
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,713
Huh?

370
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,030
Okay. Yeah. Actually it would.

371
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,760
And these days you'll,

372
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:29,600
is kind of pessimistic about the idea
that we're ever going to really have a

373
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:30,950
useful pain scale.

374
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,120
At the end of the day, I'm not sure.

375
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,660
Pain is a quantity that is measurable.

376
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,280
Hmm.

377
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,930
Thinking that kind of bums her out

378
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,020
because part of me wanted to believe
in the project of quantification.

379
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,360
Y I, I'm not sure. Um,

380
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,470
I think because not believing
in it is a little bit lonelier.

381
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,410
The idea that we cannot feel,

382
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:05,411
cannot understand and cannot imagine
each other's pain is a really isolating

383
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,614
thought.

384
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,950
[inaudible]

385
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,070
by the way, what was her pain from?
Did she get a diagnosis? Well,

386
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,890
her doctor tried a lot of stuff
actually. They did a brain scan.

387
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:20,870
They checked for a spinal infection,
and ultimately he said, you know,

388
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,780
unfortunately, we, we don't
know what causes this.

389
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,820
We don't know how to treat it. We don't
know if it will ever get better. Um,

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,350
but we do know it's real.

391
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,390
And that was my final conversation
with him and he said, um,

392
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,280
good luck out there.

393
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,203
