00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.570
NARRATOR: 5,000 feet up.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.572
And for the first time ever--

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.308
It's good I got an
early start this morning.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.278
NARRATOR: --Morgan's staring
down an Alaskan monster.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.514
Daunting for even
a seasoned pilot,

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.416
the Great Alaska
Range is 40 miles

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.552
of treacherous ice cap peaks
and wind battered valleys.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.388
MORGAN: Got to get a
little closer up here

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.956
and get a better
idea whether I'll

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.391
be able to fly right
over the ridges

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.526
or I'll have to fly the passes.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.796
NARRATOR: The challenge is
choosing the safest route.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.499
Either up and over
or down and through.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.502
MORGAN: Mountain flying has
the potential for really strong

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.772
turbulence on even
clear, nice days,

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.206
if you get into some weather.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.842
Like, it puts you in a
real about situation.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.345
Route finding would
be really difficult.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.414
So I'm trying to
manage that risk

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.783
and make the safest choice.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.018
NARRATOR: With no firsthand
experience in the range,

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.621
Morgan's flying
into the unknown.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.456
MORGAN: If I have
to fly the passes,

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.291
it means you have to
fly a longer route.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.826
And as you get
closer to the ridge,

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.394
bit up against the mountains.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.463
So it's a little more dangerous.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.565
NARRATOR: But he
does not hesitate.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.401
MORGAN: Now approaching the
first line of ridges here.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.106
I'm climbing about 300 feet per
minute, doing about 83 knots.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.010
NARRATOR: And begins his
ascent to go over the top.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.344
MORGAN: The clouds
are high enough today

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.346
and the air feel stable.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.081
I think I'll be able
to just fly direct.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.417
Which is just a little
more straightforward.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.718
NARRATOR: To clear
the highest peaks,

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.321
he's climbing to 10,000 feet.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.925
Higher than he's
ever flown before.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.526
MORGAN: You know, you
really see it's definitely

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.395
still winter up here.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.763
NARRATOR: Staying
above the mountains

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.500
should be the safest route,
as long as the weather holds.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.302
MORGAN: I believe the
air is getting cooler

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.838
here as we gain altitude.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.107
And I'm showing a little
bit below freezing now.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.778
Probably time to turn on
some heat in this thing.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.013
NARRATOR: Morgan's first
trip through the range--

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.782
MORGAN: I pretty much
know right where I am.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.985
But nice to just reference
stuff on the map.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.188
NARRATOR: --is an opportunity
to scout the lay of the land.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.724
MORGAN: Try to learn any
extra landmarks I can.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.260
You never know when you're
going to be in a situation

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.796
where recognizing one
ridge or one little peak

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.865
might help you out.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.434
You know, if something goes
wrong, chance of survivability

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.034
is pretty low.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.473
It's a really
interesting combination

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:25.678
of trying to stay relaxed, calm,
but also very busy and focused.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.416
Whoa!

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.751
A little rough up here.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.090
Oh no.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.158
Where the hell did
that come from?

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.362
There are definitely clouds
coming in real quick now.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.963
That's not too good.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.670
Can't see very far ahead.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.510
I think I have to descend and
see what it's like in the pass.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.380
NARRATOR: Descending into the
pass in search of clear air,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.348
the lightweight plane
is now at the mercy

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.350
of the shifting winds.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.752
MORGAN: It's a
pretty narrow pass,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:09.556
so I need to be really aware
of any kind of potential wind

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.124
activity as I approach it.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:21.367
It's pretty nerve racking being
this close to two mountains.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.902
If I, you know,
were to encounter

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.038
a really strong downdraft
there, it could be pretty bad.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.144
All right.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.747
Heading up on the next ridge,
and there's still plenty to go.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.392
Gotta remember to breathe here.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.661
Yeah, just one ridge
away from home now.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.704
OK.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:02.842
Just crossed the last ridge and
I'm dropping down a tributary

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.043
here into our river valley.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:09.248
I'm getting pumped up
for landing at our place.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:12.085
But the closer I get, the more I
start to get a little low grade

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.920
adrenaline rush.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.589
You know, our runway
is pretty short.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.392
It's got some obstacles
on the ends, requires me

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:22.128
to have all my ducks in a row.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.429
NARRATOR: Morgan
and Margaret spent

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.633
the last six months clearing
a 1,200 foot dirt runway.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.234
But it's never been tested.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.004
MORGAN: I'm coming in,
getting them closer.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.473
All right.
The homestead is in sight.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.142
I've got to be right
over these trees

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.511
so I'm not too high as
I come into the strip.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.380
And I need to be
as slow as possible

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.017
so I get this plane to stall
and stick to the ground right

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.551
at the beginning.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.020
All right.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.389
Got to remember to breathe here.
