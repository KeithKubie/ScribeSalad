00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.923
we were in the year 656,
and the third caliph,

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.590
Uthman or Usman is assassinated,

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:13.829
and Ali is chosen to be caliph.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.510
And remember, Shias believe
that Ali should have

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.391
been caliph immediately
after the death of Mohammed,

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:22.026
and they cite the events of Ghadir Khumm

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:25.311
as evidence that that is
what Mohammed intended.

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.811
But Ali becomes caliph in 656,

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.749
but this sparks what is
called the First Fitna,

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:36.053
or the first Muslim civil war.

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:40.832
Because Uthman has a fellow
member of the Umayyad clan,

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.902
the Umayyad clan, they're also Quraysh,

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:47.356
just like Mohammed's clan,
the Hashem are also Quraysh,

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.740
and Uthman's family member, Muawiya

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.762
was has-been governor of
Damascus since the time

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:58.929
of the caliph Umar, and
when Uthman is assassinated,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.756
Muawiya is not happy, and
when Ali comes to power,

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:07.234
he thinks that Ali is
not making a solid effort

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.901
to put the assassins to justice.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.055
And he refuses to pledge his allegiance

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.809
to Ali as the caliph, now
the other context here

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:23.954
is that Muawiya has
already built a significant

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:26.589
military force, and that force is becoming

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:29.309
stronger and stronger and stronger,

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:32.297
and so this leads to a lot of tension.

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:36.391
Muawiya wants Ali to bring
the assassins of Uthman

00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:41.227
to justice, and Ali wants
Muawiya to pledge allegiance

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:43.488
to him, who is now caliph.

00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:46.553
Now just for a little bit extra context,

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:51.028
Ali also decides to move
the capital of the caliphate

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:54.111
to Kufa, which is in modern day Iraq.

00:01:56.252 --> 00:01:59.429
Now things are getting increasingly tense

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.028
and this is where we have Aisha entering

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:04.836
into the picture, and we talk about Aisha

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:08.481
in the previous video, she
is one of Mohammed's wives,

00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.677
married at a very young
age, and she is considered

00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:14.510
a very strong figure in early Islam.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.727
So she leads a delegation, really an army,

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:21.477
in order to convince Ali to bring

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.108
the assassins of Uthman to justice.

00:02:26.108 --> 00:02:30.191
The meet in Basra, once
again in modern day Iraq,

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:35.650
and while they're talking
about, or negotiating

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.483
what Ali needs to do,
some of Ali's followers,

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:45.139
as the narrative goes, were
a little bit more extreme

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.750
and really didn't want a peace brokered

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.417
between Muawiya and
Ali, and so they attack,

00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:56.317
and that's what leads to what is known

00:02:56.317 --> 00:03:00.295
as the Battle of the Camel,
which is depicted here,

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.462
named after Aisha's camel,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.418
and it becomes a very bloody battle.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:09.227
Aisha is really one of the
leaders in this battle.

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:11.990
Once again, you can imagine,
a very very strong figure

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.850
in early Islam, but Ali's
forces are victorious,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.738
and they send Aisha back
home and then she goes

00:03:19.738 --> 00:03:22.923
into something of a political retirement,

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:25.868
and it is somewhat inconclusive.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:29.526
But then that leads
later on to what is known

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:33.693
as the Battle of Siffin, the
Battle of the Camel was in 656,

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:37.115
the Battle of Siffin is in 657,

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:42.170
and in this situation, you once again have

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.337
a delegation, or really
an army on the side of Ali

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:51.551
meeting an army directly
now with Muawiya at Siffin.

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:56.556
And once again, they are not fighting

00:03:56.556 --> 00:04:00.647
for roughly 100 days, they
want to negotiate something,

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:04.706
but some of the more
ardent followers of Ali

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:08.435
don't want any form of peace with Muawiya,

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.644
so they attack Muawiya's army and you have

00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:14.290
a very bloody battle that ensues.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.070
Now both sides don't want
all of this bloodshed

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.951
in this burgeoning Muslim community,

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:25.118
so they decide to let it
be decided to arbitration.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.715
Now the arbitration,
according to the accounts

00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:34.840
that I've looked at, say that
they decided that neither

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.264
Ali or Muawiya should be caliph

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:41.935
and that it should be an election
from the Muslim community.

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:45.776
Now Ali refuses this, and
what's interesting about this

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:48.882
is the accounts I've seen is
that those same zealous folks

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:52.470
who you could say instigated
the Battle of Siffin

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.097
and the Battle of the Camel
during this Muslim civil war,

00:04:56.097 --> 00:05:00.180
they're no longer trusting
Ali that he can protect them,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.311
that he is the strong leader they need,

00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:05.581
and so they are the ones that then decide

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.890
to assassinate, and are
successful in assassinating Ali.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.057
So after the assassination
of Ali, his son, Hassan,

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.209
comes to power, officially as the caliph

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.188
based in Kufa, but remember,
you have this very powerful

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.997
leader in Muawiya with a
very significant military,

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:28.914
leading or in control of the Levant

00:05:30.256 --> 00:05:33.012
and the governor of Syria.

00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:35.679
And so they enter into a treaty,

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:40.237
clearly Hassan sees the
writing on the wall,

00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:42.506
he can't really fight Muawiya

00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:44.920
by force, he really
doesn't have strong control

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.241
really much further than
this region around Kufa,

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:51.192
so he gets into a treaty with Muawiya

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:56.166
where he gives control of
the caliphate to Muawiya,

00:05:56.166 --> 00:06:00.148
and according to that treaty,
as long as Muawiya allows

00:06:00.148 --> 00:06:03.504
the next caliph after
his death to be based

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:07.387
on some form of an election,
let the Islamic world

00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:10.054
choose the successor afterwards.

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:13.882
But then later Hassan,
he goes into something

00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:16.446
of a retirement, he dies in his mid 40s,

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:18.978
and some accounts say
that he was assassinated,

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:22.087
poisoned by his wife,
maybe due to the Umayyads

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:26.254
who didn't want him around,
and then in 680, Muawiya dies.

00:06:27.494 --> 00:06:31.855
Now according to the treaty
between Muawiya and Hassan,

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:34.806
it should have been some
form of an election there,

00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:38.032
but Muawiya says, or before his death,

00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:41.272
he makes Yazid the successor.

00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:44.772
And so Hussein, who is another son of Ali,

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:50.034
Hassan's younger brother, and
by this point Hassan is dead,

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:52.826
he says hey, this is a
breach of the treaty,

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:56.912
and does not pledge his
allegiance to Yazid.

00:06:56.912 --> 00:06:59.233
But there is a group in Kufa who say hey,

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:02.960
we will support you, and
so Hussein goes to Kufa

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.377
but on the way there, and
he is with his family,

00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:09.723
when Yazid catches wind of this,

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:13.634
he sends an army to stop
them, and Yazid's interest

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:17.801
is essentially to eliminate
Hussein and his family

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.419
so that you don't have any
other legitimate claimants

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.906
to the caliphate, especially
because, remember,

00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:28.489
Hussein is a living
descendant of Mohammed.

00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:35.148
And so you then have this
event where Yazid's forces

00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:38.398
intercept Hussein's caravan in Karbala,

00:07:39.602 --> 00:07:43.319
and this is known in the Shia tradition

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.152
as the Tragedy of Karbala,
because at Karbala,

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:53.092
you have Hussein's family gets massacred.

00:07:53.092 --> 00:07:56.074
There is an account that
his six month old son

00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:59.371
is beheaded and killed along with Hussein,

00:07:59.371 --> 00:08:04.193
and so this becomes he defining
event of the Shia tradition,

00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:08.028
the tragedy of Karbala, we've
already taught their belief

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:11.287
that Ali should have been the
caliph from the beginning,

00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:13.204
but now you have Yazid,

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:19.659
proported caliph, who
murders, who kills off,

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:21.950
according to Shia tradition,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.138
a significant member of Mohammed's family

00:08:24.138 --> 00:08:26.805
and does this in bloody, bloody fashion.

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:29.848
And so even to this
day, a significant part

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:33.583
of the Shia tradition
is mourning what happens

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:37.306
at the Battle of Karbala,
and this is not a part

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:40.150
of the Sunni tradition, the
Sunni tradition views this

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.030
as a tragedy, as an unfortunate event,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.610
but they do not view this
as a significant part

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.777
of their theology, and also
as part of Shia tradition

00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:55.402
and theology, Battle of Karbala
is the determining event,

00:08:55.402 --> 00:09:00.349
the thing that Shias mourn
in their religious faith,

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:04.436
and they also believe that the
leadership of the community

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:08.603
should be by imams who are
descendant of Mohammed,

00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:12.884
which is not believed by the Sunnis.
