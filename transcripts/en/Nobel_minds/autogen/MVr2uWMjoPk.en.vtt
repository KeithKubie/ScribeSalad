think you would agree with me on the
following point it it's entirely

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:32.790
following point it it's entirely
 

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.290
following point it it's entirely
possible for humans to produce less

possible for humans to produce less
 

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.310
possible for humans to produce less
carbon there's some trade-offs but once

carbon there's some trade-offs but once
 

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.290
carbon there's some trade-offs but once
we start to try and reduce carbon

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:42.300
we start to try and reduce carbon
 

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.160
we start to try and reduce carbon
emission will be surprised that it

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.170
emission will be surprised that it
 

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.870

wasn't as hard as we anticipated I read

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880
wasn't as hard as we anticipated I read
 

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.660
wasn't as hard as we anticipated I read
a little bit about the concern people

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:53.670
a little bit about the concern people
 

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.900
a little bit about the concern people
had when we addressed the problem of the

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:56.910
had when we addressed the problem of the
 

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.430
had when we addressed the problem of the
ozone hole caused by chlorofluorocarbons

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440
ozone hole caused by chlorofluorocarbons
 

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.130
ozone hole caused by chlorofluorocarbons
there were many people saying this with

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140
there were many people saying this with
 

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.510
there were many people saying this with
enormous ly expensive and difficult and

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520
enormous ly expensive and difficult and
 

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.120
enormous ly expensive and difficult and
and then once we actually said about

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.130
and then once we actually said about
 

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.440
and then once we actually said about
reducing emissions of

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:11.450
reducing emissions of
 

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.910
reducing emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons it was a non-event

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:14.920
chlorofluorocarbons it was a non-event
 

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.480
chlorofluorocarbons it was a non-event
so I think the danger with the very

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:19.490
so I think the danger with the very
 

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.860

giving for which there's real basis is
that it will make people feel apathetic

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480
that it will make people feel apathetic
 

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.310
that it will make people feel apathetic
and hopeless it's entirely doable for us

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320
and hopeless it's entirely doable for us
 

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.570
and hopeless it's entirely doable for us
even now to start bringing down the path

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:37.580
even now to start bringing down the path
 

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.080
even now to start bringing down the path
of emissions and to protect a better

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.090
of emissions and to protect a better
 

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.810
of emissions and to protect a better
future in climate and it's entirely

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:43.820
future in climate and it's entirely
 

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.720
future in climate and it's entirely
possible for us to have better standards

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:46.730
possible for us to have better standards
 

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.770
possible for us to have better standards
of living as far into the future as we

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:50.780
of living as far into the future as we

we can see so I said I was want a

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:55.929
we can see so I said I was want a

thing everything can keep going better
 

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.850
thing everything can keep going better
but it is time that we start doing the

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:06.860
but it is time that we start doing the
 

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:07.890
but it is time that we start doing the
right thing

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:07.900

human consequences and what I was trying
 

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.780
human consequences and what I was trying
to do was encourage people to think

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:13.790
to do was encourage people to think
 

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.509
to do was encourage people to think
about some possibilities

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:16.519
about some possibilities

they wouldn't be perfect but they would

they wouldn't be perfect but they would
 

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:26.349
they wouldn't be perfect but they would
be better than what we have now and I

00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:26.359
be better than what we have now and I
 

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:29.589
be better than what we have now and I
think better than any of the

00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:29.599
think better than any of the
 

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:32.440

also start to think a little bit about
 

00:22:56.829 --> 00:23:00.249
also start to think a little bit about
what could we do to give people who are

think that dealing with the protecting
the environment will be so costly and so

Nordic Chinese times and we could see
that both awards are given to the people

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.010
that both awards are given to the people
 

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.300

who trying to think and global

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:55.310
who trying to think and global
 

00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.060
who trying to think and global
macroeconomic issues so I wonder that

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.070
macroeconomic issues so I wonder that
 

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.530
macroeconomic issues so I wonder that
how the price were related to the

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:04.540
how the price were related to the
 

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.990
how the price were related to the
fluctuating and global economy

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000
fluctuating and global economy
 

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.790
fluctuating and global economy
especially in terms of trade

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:11.800

think there is a strong tie between the

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520
think there is a strong tie between the
 

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.670
think there is a strong tie between the
price and the areas that you brought up

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:27.680
price and the areas that you brought up
 

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.260
price and the areas that you brought up
they are important areas but they are

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:29.270
they are important areas but they are
 

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.040
they are important areas but they are
not really

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.050
not really
 

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.470
not really
they don't have much overlap with with

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480
they don't have much overlap with with
 

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.450
they don't have much overlap with with
this year's price so how do you think

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:37.460
this year's price so how do you think
 

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.300
this year's price so how do you think
that the price will improve the

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:40.310
that the price will improve the
 

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:48.790
that the price will improve the
efficiency in emerging markets I don't

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:48.800
efficiency in emerging markets I don't
 

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.770
efficiency in emerging markets I don't
think it speaks to that very much I mean

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:50.780
think it speaks to that very much I mean
 

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.020
think it speaks to that very much I mean
there what what what what the price

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.030
there what what what what the price
 

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.380
there what what what what the price
talks about to some extent is is the

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:56.390
talks about to some extent is is the
 

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.540
talks about to some extent is is the
importance of knowledge growth and

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:58.550
importance of knowledge growth and
 

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.270
importance of knowledge growth and
technology growth but it's not very

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:01.280
technology growth but it's not very
 

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.360
technology growth but it's not very
specific so obviously emerging markets

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.370
specific so obviously emerging markets
 

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:10.020
specific so obviously emerging markets
benefit enormous ly from the technology

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.030
benefit enormous ly from the technology
 

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.180
benefit enormous ly from the technology
revolutions that the leading technology

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:12.190
revolutions that the leading technology
 

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.800
revolutions that the leading technology
countries go through because because

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:14.810
countries go through because because
 

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.690
countries go through because because
they can ride on the wave of technology

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:16.700
they can ride on the wave of technology
 

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.590
they can ride on the wave of technology
that innovators in mostly you know the

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600
that innovators in mostly you know the
 

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.290

rich countries today contribute so in

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:23.300
rich countries today contribute so in
 

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.300
rich countries today contribute so in
that sense but I don't think it's it's

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:25.310
that sense but I don't think it's it's
 

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.520
that sense but I don't think it's it's
not a topic that we focus much on in

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:27.530
not a topic that we focus much on in
 

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.700
not a topic that we focus much on in
this particular price formulation yeah

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:30.710

if I can add to that both of these
 

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.060
if I can add to that both of these
prices are really about global problems

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.070
prices are really about global problems
 

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.880

that you know the whole world needs to
get together to solve how to get the

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:42.620
get together to solve how to get the
 

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.280
get together to solve how to get the
right amount of technological progress

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:45.290
right amount of technological progress
 

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.560
right amount of technological progress
how to solve the global problem of

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:47.570
how to solve the global problem of
 

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.600
how to solve the global problem of
climate change and I guess if there's a

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:49.610
climate change and I guess if there's a
 

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.730
climate change and I guess if there's a
message that's relevant here

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:51.740
message that's relevant here
 

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.510
message that's relevant here
it's that we need to get together okay

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520
it's that we need to get together okay
 

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.810
it's that we need to get together okay
to to get a global solution and to get a

00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:58.820
to to get a global solution and to get a
 

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.580
to to get a global solution and to get a
global solution we also need to realize

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:00.590
global solution we also need to realize
 

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.560
global solution we also need to realize
you know rich countries need to realize

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:02.570
you know rich countries need to realize
 

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.100
you know rich countries need to realize
the problems that emerging markets have

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.110
the problems that emerging markets have
 

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.390
the problems that emerging markets have
with implementing some of these

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:07.400
with implementing some of these
 

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.700
with implementing some of these
solutions you know how when it comes to

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:09.710
solutions you know how when it comes to
 

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.730
solutions you know how when it comes to
patent protection when it comes to

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:11.740
patent protection when it comes to
 

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.080
patent protection when it comes to
emissions and so on so I guess the

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.090
emissions and so on so I guess the
 

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.990
emissions and so on so I guess the
message is that you know it's needed for

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000
message is that you know it's needed for
 

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.510
message is that you know it's needed for
countries to cooperate globally to solve

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520
countries to cooperate globally to solve
 

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.370
countries to cooperate globally to solve
some of these big questions so okay one

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:24.380
some of these big questions so okay one
 

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:30.640
some of these big questions so okay one
last question thank you

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:30.650
last question thank you
 

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.820
last question thank you
both witness of the price I've been

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:33.830
both witness of the price I've been
 

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.890
both witness of the price I've been
expected for a quite a long time but not

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:35.900
expected for a quite a long time but not
 

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.810
expected for a quite a long time but not
that they would get it to price together

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:37.820
that they would get it to price together
 

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.370
that they would get it to price together
and well one interpretation could be

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:42.380
and well one interpretation could be
 

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.830
and well one interpretation could be
that some people in the press committee

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840
that some people in the press committee
 

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.330
that some people in the press committee
have found our climate and others have

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:46.340
have found our climate and others have
 

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.190
have found our climate and others have
found a growth and then we have made a

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200
found a growth and then we have made a
 

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.470
found a growth and then we have made a
compromise but another receptor answer

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480
compromise but another receptor answer
 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.980
compromise but another receptor answer
is something really connecting these two

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:52.990
is something really connecting these two
 

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.680
is something really connecting these two
great economists but could you tell what

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:56.690
great economists but could you tell what
 

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.500
great economists but could you tell what
is done the link between the two yeah a

00:29:59.500 --> 00:29:59.510
is done the link between the two yeah a
 

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.650
is done the link between the two yeah a
bit more than you've already told us

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:01.660
bit more than you've already told us
 

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.560
bit more than you've already told us
okay it's not the first interpretation

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:05.570
okay it's not the first interpretation
 

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:11.110
okay it's not the first interpretation
for sure I can also tell you that when

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120
for sure I can also tell you that when
 

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.310
for sure I can also tell you that when
Paul Romer received the call he was

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320
Paul Romer received the call he was
 

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.140
Paul Romer received the call he was
super happy that it was also given to

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.150
super happy that it was also given to
 

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.850
super happy that it was also given to
Nordhaus I mean he's clearly interested

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:18.860
Nordhaus I mean he's clearly interested
 

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.100
Nordhaus I mean he's clearly interested
in nor does this work they're interested

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:21.110
in nor does this work they're interested
 

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.540
in nor does this work they're interested
in each other's work and I think it's

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:22.550
in each other's work and I think it's
 

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.330
in each other's work and I think it's
because they are part they're part of

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:25.340
because they are part they're part of
 

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.230
because they are part they're part of
the same agenda to think about the long

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240
the same agenda to think about the long
 

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.770
the same agenda to think about the long
run and to think about global issues so

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:32.780
run and to think about global issues so
 

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.350
run and to think about global issues so
and they're they're asking fundamental

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360
and they're they're asking fundamental
 

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.580
and they're they're asking fundamental
questions extremely difficult questions

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:38.590
questions extremely difficult questions
 

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.350
questions extremely difficult questions
so they have these things in common but

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360
so they have these things in common but
 

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.880
so they have these things in common but
they also have in common that they built

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:42.890
they also have in common that they built
 

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.120
they also have in common that they built
these tools that that are very much

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.130
these tools that that are very much
 

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.000
these tools that that are very much
alike they built simulation tools that

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.010
alike they built simulation tools that
 

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.799
alike they built simulation tools that
the rest of us can use and look at and

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:50.809
the rest of us can use and look at and
 

00:30:50.809 --> 00:30:55.150
the rest of us can use and look at and
study and improve and so I think it's

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:55.160
study and improve and so I think it's
 

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.760
study and improve and so I think it's
it's this common base that they built

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:57.770
it's this common base that they built
 

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.669
it's this common base that they built
that's another thing in common they have

00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679
that's another thing in common they have
 

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:04.030
that's another thing in common they have
a similar view of how to think about

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.040
a similar view of how to think about
 

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.440
a similar view of how to think about
economic policy as well

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:05.450
economic policy as well
 

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.120
economic policy as well
as I am emphasizing the presentation

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.130
as I am emphasizing the presentation
 

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.220
as I am emphasizing the presentation
they both think in terms of market

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:09.230
they both think in terms of market
 

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.560
they both think in terms of market
failures but they're kind of different

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.570
failures but they're kind of different
 

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.210
failures but they're kind of different
in nature but it's the same type of

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.220
in nature but it's the same type of
 

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:18.370
in nature but it's the same type of
recipe that they offer so I think that

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380
recipe that they offer so I think that
 

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.830
recipe that they offer so I think that
there's there's a lot of things in

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840
there's there's a lot of things in
 

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.730
there's there's a lot of things in
common and and and in fact there is a

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:23.740
common and and and in fact there is a
 

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.980

new literature coming out that that I

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:26.990
new literature coming out that that I
 

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.289

think Paul was was Apple Roman was

00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:29.299
think Paul was was Apple Roman was
 

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:32.049
think Paul was was Apple Roman was
referring to which is that to address

00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:32.059
referring to which is that to address
 

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:33.730
referring to which is that to address
some of the climate change issues you

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:33.740
some of the climate change issues you
 

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.019
some of the climate change issues you
really need to think about new

00:31:35.019 --> 00:31:35.029
really need to think about new
 

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:37.060
really need to think about new
technologies that replace fossil fuel

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.070
technologies that replace fossil fuel
 

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.539
technologies that replace fossil fuel
maybe new technologies that can remove

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:39.549
maybe new technologies that can remove
 

00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:41.769
maybe new technologies that can remove
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:41.779
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
 

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:43.930
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
there's a range of technology solutions

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:43.940
there's a range of technology solutions
 

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.210
there's a range of technology solutions
I think without these technology

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.220
I think without these technology
 

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.399
I think without these technology
solutions it's gonna be very hard I

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:48.409
solutions it's gonna be very hard I
 

00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:50.470
solutions it's gonna be very hard I
think that was implicit in one what Paul

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480
think that was implicit in one what Paul
 

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.110
think that was implicit in one what Paul
Romer said so how can we think about

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120
Romer said so how can we think about
 

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.899
Romer said so how can we think about
those things without having roamers

00:31:55.899 --> 00:31:55.909
those things without having roamers
 

00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:58.899
those things without having roamers
shoulders to stand on so I think there's

00:31:58.899 --> 00:31:58.909
shoulders to stand on so I think there's
 

00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:01.269
shoulders to stand on so I think there's
a lot of connections I think it's only

00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279
a lot of connections I think it's only
 

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:04.200
a lot of connections I think it's only
superficially that they look different

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.210
superficially that they look different
 

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.389
superficially that they look different
thank you and I think with that we'll

business cycles about short-run
fluctuations in economic activity like

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.030
fluctuations in economic activity like
 

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.330
fluctuations in economic activity like
unemployment is up or inflation is up or

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.340
unemployment is up or inflation is up or
 

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.460
unemployment is up or inflation is up or
down

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:28.470
down
 

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.290
down
this type of macroeconomics is a little

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:31.300
this type of macroeconomics is a little
 

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.950
this type of macroeconomics is a little
different you find it in textbooks but

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960
different you find it in textbooks but
 

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.080
different you find it in textbooks but
it's very different because it's about

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.090
it's very different because it's about
 

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.730
it's very different because it's about
long-run where economic growth comes

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:38.740
long-run where economic growth comes
 

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.790
long-run where economic growth comes
from so so actually the textbooks have

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800
from so so actually the textbooks have
 

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.600
from so so actually the textbooks have
been changed quite a lot since Romer did

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:45.610
been changed quite a lot since Romer did
 

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:50.490
been changed quite a lot since Romer did
his work and so that actually the the

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:50.500
his work and so that actually the the
 

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.590
his work and so that actually the the
part of the book that is about the

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:52.600
part of the book that is about the
 

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.230
part of the book that is about the
long-run issues has become longer and

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240
long-run issues has become longer and
 

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.540
long-run issues has become longer and
many textbooks start with that now where

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:57.550
many textbooks start with that now where
 

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.280
many textbooks start with that now where
when they used to start with business

00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.290
when they used to start with business
 

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:07.950
when they used to start with business
cycles say about that he asks where it

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960
cycles say about that he asks where it
 

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.930
cycles say about that he asks where it
comes from I mean he wanted to

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:09.940
comes from I mean he wanted to
 

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.820
comes from I mean he wanted to
understand why some countries grow and

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:11.830
understand why some countries grow and
 

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.980
understand why some countries grow and
other countries don't grow and also why

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:13.990
other countries don't grow and also why
 

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.870
other countries don't grow and also why
though why the world grows at the rate

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880
though why the world grows at the rate
 

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.360
though why the world grows at the rate
it does and what explains technological

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:18.370
it does and what explains technological
 

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.640
it does and what explains technological
progress and I think it was by asking

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:20.650
progress and I think it was by asking
 

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.090
progress and I think it was by asking
the question that he came up with ways

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:24.100
the question that he came up with ways
 

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.950
the question that he came up with ways
of thinking about it that influenced a

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960
of thinking about it that influenced a
 

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.590
of thinking about it that influenced a
lot of other researchers and it led to

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:28.600
lot of other researchers and it led to
 

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.840
lot of other researchers and it led to
both empirical work and theoretical work

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:30.850
both empirical work and theoretical work
 

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:34.200
both empirical work and theoretical work
and actually an explosion in research so

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.210
and actually an explosion in research so
 

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.380
and actually an explosion in research so
what is the main motor of economic

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:37.390
what is the main motor of economic
 

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:40.050
what is the main motor of economic
growth it I think almost all economists

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.060
growth it I think almost all economists
 

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.840
growth it I think almost all economists
would say its technological change but

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:42.850
would say its technological change but
 

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.160
would say its technological change but
the question is where does that come

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.170
the question is where does that come
 

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.020
the question is where does that come
from like what why does it happen and

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:46.030
from like what why does it happen and
 

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.150
from like what why does it happen and
when does it happen you know nothing

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160
when does it happen you know nothing
 

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.900
when does it happen you know nothing
happened during the many hundred years

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:51.910
happened during the many hundred years
 

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.150
happened during the many hundred years
before the Industrial Revolution in

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160
before the Industrial Revolution in
 

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.950
before the Industrial Revolution in
terms of technological change and then

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960
terms of technological change and then
 

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.960
terms of technological change and then
it all exploded but it hasn't been

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:57.970
it all exploded but it hasn't been
 

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.390
it all exploded but it hasn't been
totally even and but it's been ongoing

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400
totally even and but it's been ongoing
 

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.460
totally even and but it's been ongoing
since the Industrial Revolution

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:02.470
since the Industrial Revolution
 

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.480
since the Industrial Revolution
and at 2% per year the the leading

countries are just kind of growing and

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.020
countries are just kind of growing and
 

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.450
countries are just kind of growing and
growing and it's because of

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:09.460
growing and it's because of
 

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.660
growing and it's because of
technological change in what we did Paul

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:12.670
technological change in what we did Paul
 

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.210
technological change in what we did Paul
Romer it's to think about why the

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:15.220
Romer it's to think about why the
 

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.450
Romer it's to think about why the
Kherson what are the good preconditions

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:18.460
Kherson what are the good preconditions
 

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:23.570
Kherson what are the good preconditions
for healthy growth and he thought about

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:23.580
for healthy growth and he thought about
 

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.790
for healthy growth and he thought about
things like how societies organized in

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800
things like how societies organized in
 

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.940
things like how societies organized in
terms of patent systems in terms of

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:29.950
terms of patent systems in terms of
 

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.310
terms of patent systems in terms of
subsidies to oranjee so it's not enough

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320
subsidies to oranjee so it's not enough
 

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.190
subsidies to oranjee so it's not enough
to have universities because

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200
to have universities because
 

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.410
to have universities because
universities are crucial and there there

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:37.420
universities are crucial and there there
 

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.630
universities are crucial and there there
are people there at universities like

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640
are people there at universities like
 

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.510

Rome himself they are rewarded by this

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520
Rome himself they are rewarded by this
 

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.640
Rome himself they are rewarded by this
wonderful prizes but you also need

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:46.650
wonderful prizes but you also need
 

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:50.370
wonderful prizes but you also need
research in the market and that's what

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.380
research in the market and that's what
 

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.230
research in the market and that's what
he focused on so what makes it happen in

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240
he focused on so what makes it happen in
 

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.770
he focused on so what makes it happen in
the market what what are the

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780
the market what what are the
 

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.150
the market what what are the
circumstances you know judicial system

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160
circumstances you know judicial system
 

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.550
circumstances you know judicial system
all kinds of things that create the

00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560
all kinds of things that create the
 

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.960
all kinds of things that create the
conditions for technological growth

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:00.970
conditions for technological growth
 

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.640
conditions for technological growth
that's what he was interested in then

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:02.650
that's what he was interested in then
 

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.760
that's what he was interested in then
you have to realize that once you come

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:05.770
you have to realize that once you come
 

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.280
you have to realize that once you come
up with great ideas it's important that

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.290
up with great ideas it's important that
 

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.810
up with great ideas it's important that
they spread that they spread to other

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:09.820
they spread that they spread to other
 

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.420
they spread that they spread to other
countries so so many countries I think

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.430
countries so so many countries I think
 

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.780
countries so so many countries I think
or or not original innovators but they

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:15.790
or or not original innovators but they
 

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:22.560
or or not original innovators but they
adopt technical ideas different kind of

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:22.570
adopt technical ideas different kind of
 

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:27.000
adopt technical ideas different kind of
products and ideas are different yes

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.010
products and ideas are different yes
 

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.910
products and ideas are different yes
exactly and by thinking deeply about why

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920
exactly and by thinking deeply about why
 

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.810
exactly and by thinking deeply about why
ideas are so different than regular

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820
ideas are so different than regular
 

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.150
ideas are so different than regular
shoo-shoo type products it's then you

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160
shoo-shoo type products it's then you
 

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.609
shoo-shoo type products it's then you
get some other clue to how to think

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:38.619
get some other clue to how to think
 

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:40.670
get some other clue to how to think
about it and it was led to think about

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680
about it and it was led to think about
 

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.880
about it and it was led to think about
many ideas are super cheap to replicate

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:44.890
many ideas are super cheap to replicate
 

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.220
many ideas are super cheap to replicate
once you get them but it's it's all

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:47.230
once you get them but it's it's all
 

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.750
once you get them but it's it's all
about getting the ideas and then that's

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760
about getting the ideas and then that's
 

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.750
about getting the ideas and then that's
when all these institutional

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760
when all these institutional
 

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.940
when all these institutional
preconditions come in that allow some

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:56.950
preconditions come in that allow some
 

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.040
preconditions come in that allow some
profits but not too much profits because

00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.050
profits but not too much profits because
 

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.660
profits but not too much profits because
you don't want to restrict it too much

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:00.670
you don't want to restrict it too much
 

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.270
you don't want to restrict it too much
and how to manage that is a central

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280
and how to manage that is a central
 

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.190
and how to manage that is a central
problem and I think all the people who

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200
problem and I think all the people who
 

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.750
problem and I think all the people who
are at governments around the world

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760
are at governments around the world
 

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.630
are at governments around the world
these days they think about it

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640
these days they think about it
 

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.430
these days they think about it
the way he thinks about it because

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440
the way he thinks about it because
 

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.660
the way he thinks about it because
they've read the textbooks

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:12.670
they've read the textbooks
 

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.940
they've read the textbooks
and they they understood that ideas are

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:14.950
and they they understood that ideas are
 

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.750
and they they understood that ideas are
different and that's just the framework

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760
different and that's just the framework
 

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.859
different and that's just the framework
for thinking so somehow you have to give

00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:22.869
for thinking so somehow you have to give
 

00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:25.200
for thinking so somehow you have to give
birth to ideas but who has the

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:25.210
birth to ideas but who has the
 

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.940
birth to ideas but who has the
responsibility for that

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:26.950
responsibility for that
 

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.210
responsibility for that
well they if we live in market economies

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:30.220
well they if we live in market economies
 

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.720
well they if we live in market economies
it's not that this anybody responsible

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:33.730
it's not that this anybody responsible
 

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.940
it's not that this anybody responsible
you need to happen by itself and that's

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:35.950
you need to happen by itself and that's
 

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.730
you need to happen by itself and that's
what the market does these things and it

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:38.740
what the market does these things and it
 

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.769
what the market does these things and it
does it usually fairly well but he also

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:40.779
does it usually fairly well but he also
 

00:40:40.779 --> 00:40:42.990
does it usually fairly well but he also
pointed to how it doesn't do it enough

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000
pointed to how it doesn't do it enough
 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.420
pointed to how it doesn't do it enough
maybe I'm in a case of ideas

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:45.430
maybe I'm in a case of ideas
 

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.710
maybe I'm in a case of ideas
so we've he emphasizes that you need to

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720
so we've he emphasizes that you need to
 

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.720
so we've he emphasizes that you need to
give people patents that last for a

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:51.730
give people patents that last for a
 

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.759
give people patents that last for a
while to give them proper incentives to

00:40:53.759 --> 00:40:53.769
while to give them proper incentives to
 

00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:58.529
while to give them proper incentives to
do things to to innovate and and and you

00:40:58.529 --> 00:40:58.539
do things to to innovate and and and you
 

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:01.109
do things to to innovate and and and you
may also need to subsidize research and

00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119
may also need to subsidize research and
 

00:41:01.119 --> 00:41:04.740
may also need to subsidize research and
development ideas so I think governments

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:04.750
development ideas so I think governments
 

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.349
development ideas so I think governments
are to some extent responsible but a lot

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359
are to some extent responsible but a lot
 

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:10.529
are to some extent responsible but a lot
of it happens by just market activity so

00:41:10.529 --> 00:41:10.539
of it happens by just market activity so
 

00:41:10.539 --> 00:41:13.259
of it happens by just market activity so
it's both and the other part of the

00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:13.269
it's both and the other part of the
 

00:41:13.269 --> 00:41:15.870
it's both and the other part of the
price has to do with climate change and

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880
price has to do with climate change and
 

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.990
price has to do with climate change and
this is really a very hard problem in

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000
this is really a very hard problem in
 

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.859
this is really a very hard problem in
both so many different parts of society

00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:22.869
both so many different parts of society
 

00:41:22.869 --> 00:41:27.019
both so many different parts of society
everything so how can one model with

00:41:27.019 --> 00:41:27.029
everything so how can one model with
 

00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:30.059
everything so how can one model with
well I think what what what Nordhaus did

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:30.069
well I think what what what Nordhaus did
 

00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:33.390
well I think what what what Nordhaus did
was that he became very interested in

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400
was that he became very interested in
 

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.400
was that he became very interested in
other sciences after his speech the in

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:35.410
other sciences after his speech the in
 

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.839
other sciences after his speech the in
degree maybe even before I don't know

00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:36.849
degree maybe even before I don't know
 

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:42.870
degree maybe even before I don't know
but he did this interdisciplinary thing

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880
but he did this interdisciplinary thing
 

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.150
but he did this interdisciplinary thing
which is very fashionable today but I

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160
which is very fashionable today but I
 

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.839
which is very fashionable today but I
think in the 1970s it was a very common

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:48.849
think in the 1970s it was a very common
 

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:51.599
think in the 1970s it was a very common
that an economist would dig deep into

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:51.609
that an economist would dig deep into
 

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:54.839
that an economist would dig deep into
Natural Sciences and also discover

00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:54.849
Natural Sciences and also discover
 

00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:56.999
Natural Sciences and also discover
climate change as a potentially big

00:41:56.999 --> 00:41:57.009
climate change as a potentially big
 

00:41:57.009 --> 00:41:59.309
climate change as a potentially big
problem I mean most people for sure most

00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319
problem I mean most people for sure most
 

00:41:59.319 --> 00:42:00.870
problem I mean most people for sure most
economists didn't think about it and

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880
economists didn't think about it and
 

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.480
economists didn't think about it and
many others didn't either so so I guess

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:03.490
many others didn't either so so I guess
 

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.309
many others didn't either so so I guess
you had the early realization that you

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319
you had the early realization that you
 

00:42:05.319 --> 00:42:07.549
you had the early realization that you
needed to connect all these things and

00:42:07.549 --> 00:42:07.559
needed to connect all these things and
 

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:09.930
needed to connect all these things and
build the framework for thinking about

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:09.940
build the framework for thinking about
 

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.089
build the framework for thinking about
them together so I think a lot of what

00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:12.099
them together so I think a lot of what
 

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:15.870
them together so I think a lot of what
he did was to simplify the natural

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880
he did was to simplify the natural
 

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.099
he did was to simplify the natural
science bits to the point where he could

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:19.109
science bits to the point where he could
 

00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:21.749
science bits to the point where he could
think about them jointly with economics

00:42:21.749 --> 00:42:21.759
think about them jointly with economics
 

00:42:21.759 --> 00:42:23.490
think about them jointly with economics
so there is sort of you need to take

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:23.500
so there is sort of you need to take
 

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.970
so there is sort of you need to take
existing knowledge

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980
existing knowledge
 

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.980
existing knowledge
make it digestible digestible for for

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:30.990
make it digestible digestible for for
 

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.570
make it digestible digestible for for
people like himself and for other

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:32.580
people like himself and for other
 

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.430
people like himself and for other
economists and ultimately for

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440
economists and ultimately for
 

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.250
economists and ultimately for
policymakers so that that was a quite an

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260
policymakers so that that was a quite an
 

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.910
policymakers so that that was a quite an
effort and in the in the early days he

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920
effort and in the in the early days he
 

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.970
effort and in the in the early days he
he he asked limited questions but still

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980
he he asked limited questions but still
 

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.589
he he asked limited questions but still
super interesting questions like what's

00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599
super interesting questions like what's
 

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:47.960
super interesting questions like what's
the best way of not exceeding two

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:47.970
the best way of not exceeding two
 

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.000
the best way of not exceeding two
degrees of warming a question that most

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.010
degrees of warming a question that most
 

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.620
degrees of warming a question that most
people are super interested in today he

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:51.630
people are super interested in today he
 

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:55.099
people are super interested in today he
asked like forty years ago but then he

00:42:55.099 --> 00:42:55.109
asked like forty years ago but then he
 

00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:56.810
asked like forty years ago but then he
asked more ambitious questions which is

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820
asked more ambitious questions which is
 

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.790
asked more ambitious questions which is
okay but what is the best thing to do

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800
okay but what is the best thing to do
 

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.620
okay but what is the best thing to do
overall let's not restrict attention

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:00.630
overall let's not restrict attention
 

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.960
overall let's not restrict attention
just to a particular temperature goal

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:02.970
just to a particular temperature goal
 

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.599
just to a particular temperature goal
how should we think about maybe what's

00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:05.609
how should we think about maybe what's
 

00:43:05.609 --> 00:43:07.700
how should we think about maybe what's
the right temperature golden and so on

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:07.710
the right temperature golden and so on
 

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.970
the right temperature golden and so on
so he he needed to invest for decades

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980
so he he needed to invest for decades
 

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.609
so he he needed to invest for decades
before he was ready to adjust these more

00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619
before he was ready to adjust these more
 

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:15.890
before he was ready to adjust these more
difficult questions and as I said in my

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900
difficult questions and as I said in my
 

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.180
difficult questions and as I said in my
presentation today in the press

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.190
presentation today in the press
 

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.640
presentation today in the press
conference it's we don't have final

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:19.650
conference it's we don't have final
 

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.710
conference it's we don't have final
answers but now can we can just follow

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720
answers but now can we can just follow
 

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.170
answers but now can we can just follow
in his footsteps and if you don't like

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180
in his footsteps and if you don't like
 

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.240
in his footsteps and if you don't like
exactly what it did on this we change it

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.250
exactly what it did on this we change it
 

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.190
exactly what it did on this we change it
and and that's what everybody's doing

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200
and and that's what everybody's doing
 

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.130
and and that's what everybody's doing
now around the world the most last

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140
now around the world the most last
 

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.230
now around the world the most last
report from this night is that we have

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240
report from this night is that we have
 

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.880
report from this night is that we have
to stop the growth of temperature to at

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:39.890
to stop the growth of temperature to at
 

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.270
to stop the growth of temperature to at
1.5 big yeah I haven't I haven't had

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280
1.5 big yeah I haven't I haven't had
 

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.510
1.5 big yeah I haven't I haven't had
time to read it because it just it came

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520
time to read it because it just it came
 

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.329
time to read it because it just it came
out at midnight so not too many hours

00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339
out at midnight so not too many hours
 

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:52.730
out at midnight so not too many hours
ago so I have to look carefully and see

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740
ago so I have to look carefully and see
 

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:59.060
ago so I have to look carefully and see
what it says 1.5 degrees is it oh yeah

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.070
what it says 1.5 degrees is it oh yeah
 

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.180
what it says 1.5 degrees is it oh yeah
there was to say what would it take to

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.190
there was to say what would it take to
 

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:07.130
there was to say what would it take to
get us to not exceed one and a half so

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140
get us to not exceed one and a half so
 

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.760
get us to not exceed one and a half so
it's I don't think that the point was we

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:09.770
it's I don't think that the point was we
 

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.589
it's I don't think that the point was we
mustn't exceed one and a half it was

00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599
mustn't exceed one and a half it was
 

00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:14.630
mustn't exceed one and a half it was
more what would it take is it even

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640
more what would it take is it even
 

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.359
more what would it take is it even
possible and I think they that's my

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:17.369
possible and I think they that's my
 

00:44:17.369 --> 00:44:18.829
possible and I think they that's my
reading without having studied it

00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839
reading without having studied it
 

00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:21.260
reading without having studied it
carefully and the question is they say

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:21.270
carefully and the question is they say
 

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.109
carefully and the question is they say
it's possible it's very very hard and it

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119
it's possible it's very very hard and it
 

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:28.490
it's possible it's very very hard and it
takes things like special efforts to

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500
takes things like special efforts to
 

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.960
takes things like special efforts to
remove carbon dioxide from the

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:29.970
remove carbon dioxide from the
 

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:35.300
remove carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere future technology to to do

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.310
atmosphere future technology to to do
 

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.359
atmosphere future technology to to do
the job and

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:36.369
the job and
 

00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:39.029
the job and
again that's that's the kind of thing

00:44:39.029 --> 00:44:39.039
again that's that's the kind of thing
 

00:44:39.039 --> 00:44:41.849
again that's that's the kind of thing
that Romer was interested in so the the

00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:41.859
that Romer was interested in so the the
 

00:44:41.859 --> 00:44:45.239
that Romer was interested in so the the
two areas are connected that way what

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:45.249
two areas are connected that way what
 

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:49.049
two areas are connected that way what
would be the answer to this ambition to

00:44:49.049 --> 00:44:49.059
would be the answer to this ambition to
 

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:51.450
would be the answer to this ambition to
limit the growth of temporary I'm not

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:51.460
limit the growth of temporary I'm not
 

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.109
limit the growth of temporary I'm not
sure because I just know that he has

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119
sure because I just know that he has
 

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:59.180
sure because I just know that he has
said that without advance new type of

00:44:59.180 --> 00:44:59.190
said that without advance new type of
 

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.789
said that without advance new type of
geoengineering or advanced types of

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:01.799
geoengineering or advanced types of
 

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:04.349
geoengineering or advanced types of
removing carbon dioxide he I don't think

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359
removing carbon dioxide he I don't think
 

00:45:04.359 --> 00:45:07.799
removing carbon dioxide he I don't think
he thinks it's possible but that doesn't

00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:07.809
he thinks it's possible but that doesn't
 

00:45:07.809 --> 00:45:09.120
he thinks it's possible but that doesn't
mean that he thinks we shouldn't try it

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.130
mean that he thinks we shouldn't try it
 

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.160
mean that he thinks we shouldn't try it
I think he says it's extremely difficult

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.170
I think he says it's extremely difficult
 

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.829
I think he says it's extremely difficult
and you have to rely on future

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839
and you have to rely on future
 

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:16.259
and you have to rely on future
technologies for doing these things to

00:45:16.259 --> 00:45:16.269
technologies for doing these things to
 

00:45:16.269 --> 00:45:18.569
technologies for doing these things to
work out and succeed I think what he

00:45:18.569 --> 00:45:18.579
work out and succeed I think what he
 

00:45:18.579 --> 00:45:21.749
work out and succeed I think what he
would say if I may guess is that you

00:45:21.749 --> 00:45:21.759
would say if I may guess is that you
 

00:45:21.759 --> 00:45:23.819
would say if I may guess is that you
should also figure out how much it costs

00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:23.829
should also figure out how much it costs
 

00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:25.680
should also figure out how much it costs
to do that it's not just a matter of

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:25.690
to do that it's not just a matter of
 

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.239
to do that it's not just a matter of
doing it at any cost so there is still a

00:45:29.239 --> 00:45:29.249
doing it at any cost so there is still a
 

00:45:29.249 --> 00:45:32.549
doing it at any cost so there is still a
cost-benefit calculation there I think

00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559
cost-benefit calculation there I think
 

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:34.710
cost-benefit calculation there I think
he would answer but you would have to

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720
he would answer but you would have to
 

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.109
he would answer but you would have to
ask him for the details but what are the

00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119
ask him for the details but what are the
 

00:45:40.119 --> 00:45:44.279
ask him for the details but what are the
policy recommendations to somehow curve

00:45:44.279 --> 00:45:44.289
policy recommendations to somehow curve
 

00:45:44.289 --> 00:45:49.470
policy recommendations to somehow curve
them for a long time been pushing the

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480
them for a long time been pushing the
 

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.410
them for a long time been pushing the
idea of just using global carbon tax I

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:52.420
idea of just using global carbon tax I
 

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.160
idea of just using global carbon tax I
mean try to agree that all countries

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.170
mean try to agree that all countries
 

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.739
mean try to agree that all countries
roll large regions of countries should

00:45:58.739 --> 00:45:58.749
roll large regions of countries should
 

00:45:58.749 --> 00:46:01.890
roll large regions of countries should
tax carbon and as an economist this is

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:01.900
tax carbon and as an economist this is
 

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.630
tax carbon and as an economist this is
can obvious solution

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640
can obvious solution
 

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.499
can obvious solution
I think it's gaining momentum the notion

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:07.509
I think it's gaining momentum the notion
 

00:46:07.509 --> 00:46:10.440
I think it's gaining momentum the notion
of using carbon taxes I think the ideas

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:10.450
of using carbon taxes I think the ideas
 

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:14.609
of using carbon taxes I think the ideas
a little bit that if you have a sizable

00:46:14.609 --> 00:46:14.619
a little bit that if you have a sizable
 

00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:18.269
a little bit that if you have a sizable
carbon tax it will do several things but

00:46:18.269 --> 00:46:18.279
carbon tax it will do several things but
 

00:46:18.279 --> 00:46:19.950
carbon tax it will do several things but
one of them is to eliminate a lot of

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960
one of them is to eliminate a lot of
 

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.079
one of them is to eliminate a lot of
fossil fuel that's not really so

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:22.089
fossil fuel that's not really so
 

00:46:22.089 --> 00:46:23.809
fossil fuel that's not really so
productive anyway where it's it's

00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819
productive anyway where it's it's
 

00:46:23.819 --> 00:46:26.160
productive anyway where it's it's
marginally profitable and then it will

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.170
marginally profitable and then it will
 

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.019
marginally profitable and then it will
not be used if it there's a tax on top

00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:28.029
not be used if it there's a tax on top
 

00:46:28.029 --> 00:46:30.120
not be used if it there's a tax on top
of that and that that's a good thing but

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.130
of that and that that's a good thing but
 

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.940
of that and that that's a good thing but
it might also induce more new

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:32.950
it might also induce more new
 

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.880
it might also induce more new
technologies that can replace fossil

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:35.890
technologies that can replace fossil
 

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.940
technologies that can replace fossil
fuel that will be out competed so I'm

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:38.950
fuel that will be out competed so I'm
 

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.559
fuel that will be out competed so I'm
guessing that this is what he would say

00:46:40.559 --> 00:46:40.569
guessing that this is what he would say
 

00:46:40.569 --> 00:46:42.450
guessing that this is what he would say
but I want to emphasize that the price

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:42.460
but I want to emphasize that the price
 

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.910
but I want to emphasize that the price
is not given for

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920
is not given for
 

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.100
is not given for
particular policy conclusions this point

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.110
particular policy conclusions this point
 

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.500
particular policy conclusions this point
it's more methodological price so it's

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:49.510
it's more methodological price so it's
 

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.050
it's more methodological price so it's
really kind of the tools we need to

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:52.060
really kind of the tools we need to
 

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.700
really kind of the tools we need to
answer the kind of question you were

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:53.710
answer the kind of question you were
 

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.980
answer the kind of question you were
asking me now no not to kind of say what

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:55.990
asking me now no not to kind of say what
 

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.580
asking me now no not to kind of say what
to do and that's it so in part I'm just

00:46:59.580 --> 00:46:59.590
to do and that's it so in part I'm just
 

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.170
to do and that's it so in part I'm just
speculating and we'll see what he has to

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:01.180
speculating and we'll see what he has to
 

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.510
speculating and we'll see what he has to
say when it comes to Stockholm

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520
say when it comes to Stockholm
 

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.480
say when it comes to Stockholm
thank you very much back yourself
