00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.520
Well, after "Fantasia" gave a disappointing turnout at the box office, it seemed Disney had to go back to the traditional narrative.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.280
"Dumbo" was the fourth film they ever released.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.880
It's a curious choice, because while it is artistically interesting at times, it's not anything really groundbreaking.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.780
"Snow White," "Pinocchio," and "Fantasia" you could definitely argue broke some new ground; "Dumbo"...is just sort of your typical kid's flick.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.340
But it's not bad.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.080
Actually, something I always noticed about "Dumbo" is that...Dumbo is never actually the focus.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.320
He doesn't even talk; he just sort of walks around looking cute.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.260
I mean, it works--he's big-eyed, curious, and all those other things you expect out of Disney characters.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.000
But the focus of the movie is the rest of the world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.720
The world of the circus, the world of the animals, the world of...getting drunk.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.620
It's all about strange visuals.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.700
He's very much the observer, not the focus.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.120
But hey, that's fine by me. I love weird imagery.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Especially if it's brought to us by Disney.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880
The story's very basic.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.900
An elephant gives birth to a little elephant that's born with big ears.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.920
He's considered an outcast and often gets into trouble for it.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.080
When one kid goes too far in making fun of him, the mother takes the guy and starts beatin' the crap out of him.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.480
Thus, she gets thrown away in the cellar and Dumbo is left on his own, just with one little friend: a circus mouse.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.180
The rest of the movie is just things going wrong, weird people and weird things approaching him, and Dumbo looking confused.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.020
Again, I don't have a problem with it if it's done well, and it's done reasonably well.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.220
It's just a weird, strange environment that they build for him.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.300
It's funny because most posters show Dumbo flying, but really, he doesn't fly until the last ten minutes.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.820
It just proves to be your basic "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" story.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.200
But it works well enough.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.640
Like I said, the weird angles and often bizarre tone really give the film a very interesting identity.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.320
It actually sort of sets it apart from the other Disney films.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.100
Now, there is big debate about whether or not the crows in this movie are racist.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.920
Obviously, they're all played by black actors and they do use slang and say the word "brother" every once in a while.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.980
But Disney never pulled it like they did "Song of the South" or some of the other racially insensitive cartoons.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.400
And from the standpoint of just a dumb white kid, I thought they were cool. They had style, they had class.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.740
They're the ones that made Dumbo fly. What's not to like? They're friggin' awesome.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.900
Now again, I'm speaking as a dumb white kid. Maybe there's something there I'm missing, but for me personally, I never saw the problem.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.540
The pink elephant scene, though entirely pointless, is friggin' awesome.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.580
I loved this scene as a kid, I love it now. It's weird, it's strange, it's kind of dark, it's almost creepy, but it's also very enjoyable.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.120
The animation is flowing, the weird designs they come up with are just surreal.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.740
It's just pure craziness. And, yeah, there's really no point to it, but I friggin' love it.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.020
They do have some emotional scenes, too.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.960
The scene where Dumbo hugs his mother is one of those big tear-jerkers that every girl I know always goes nuts whenever they see.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.520
And like I said before, the world they create for Dumbo is big, massive, and threatening.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.200
So when you get to the happy-pappy points, it's all the more enjoyable.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.280
Overall, Dumbo's a decent movie.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.540
It's not up to par with some of the more traditional Disney films, but I don't think it was meant to be.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.780
It sort of set its own rules and it stuck with it.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.780
And I think it's pretty awesome for that.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.220
It's a fun film with some fun sequences.
