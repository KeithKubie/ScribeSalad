Information gain and histograms that we looked at before clearly say that

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.230
mention distance and intertweet time are very strongly related.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.340
However, the covariance score that we just looked at seems to

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.290
say that they're are not related.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.480
