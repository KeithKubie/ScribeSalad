00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.150
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.700
give a big hand for John Waters.

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:10.556
MALE SPEAKER 2: Keep it going.

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:12.029
The man came a long way.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.520
JOHN WATERS: Has anybody
in this room ever actually

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.195
read from a book?

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.520
I mean, it seems like at
Google, everybody would read it,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.120
you know, on Kindle
and all that.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.661
OK.

00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:31.660
MALE SPEAKER 1: This is
a relic from yesteryear.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.689
It's called a book.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.335
You open it up.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.682
There are pages-- very similar
to the things that you scroll.

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.640
JOHN WATERS: I don't care
how anybody reads it,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.232
as long as they read it.

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:44.200
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, let's talk
a little bit about your book.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.630
This is called "Carsick."

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.700
Two years ago, John
decided to hitchhike

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.170
across the country from
his apartment in Baltimore

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.600
to his other apartment
in San Francisco.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.490
And so basically
what you have is,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.410
you've got this
into three parts.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.920
You've got "The Best
That Could Happen,"

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.879
which is a fictitious account
of the best possible outcome,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.820
which kind of, to me felt
like an X-rated "Pee-wee's Big

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.757
Adventure."

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:11.130
JOHN WATERS: That's a good one.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.710
MALE SPEAKER 1:
And then you've got

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.209
"The Worst That
Could Happen," which

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.360
is kind of a very dark
road horror story.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.318
And then the third chapter
is "The Real Thing,"

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:20.726
which is what actually happened.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.100
JOHN WATERS: Which
is optimistic.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.595
Yeah.

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:23.090
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.007
JOHN WATERS: Compared.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.465
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
I have to admit,

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.782
I was kind of relieved by
the time I got to that part.

00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:28.881
JOHN WATERS: My
assistant said, I

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.725
couldn't tell the difference
between the good and the bad

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.335
- they were all horrible to me.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.235
What you think is good--

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:35.985
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
I was thinking that.

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:39.750
I was like, the best outcome
felt like somebody else's worst

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.575
outcome.

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:42.495
JOHN WATERS: Yeah, well.

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:44.120
MALE SPEAKER 1: So,
did a lot of people

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.437
try to talk you out
of this adventure?

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:49.020
JOHN WATERS: As it got closer,
all the people that work for me

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.180
were horrified about it.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730
Yeah, and I was surprised.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.870
Even my friends
that are criminals

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.045
tried to talk me out of it.

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.005
I thought they'd be for it.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.390
The younger the person, the more
they sort of liked the idea.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.902
And all the younger
they were people

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:05.071
that had never hitchhiked.

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.405
Because no one hitchhikes.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.904
The whole way across the country
I saw one other hitchhiker.

00:02:08.904 --> 00:02:12.507
And I told my driver,
don't pick him up.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.300
I know, I know, but
you know, you've

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.087
got to be selfish when
you're hitchhiking.

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.128
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well yeah,
it's like, hitchhiking

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.400
is that even a thing anymore?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.830
JOHN WATERS: I had
a sign, always,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.670
and people thought I was so
stupid of a homeless person

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.907
that instead of standing
at a red light and begging,

00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:29.990
I was down on the freeway.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.760
Like, who could pull over
and give you a quarter?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.176
When they see you with a sign
now, that's what they think.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:36.800
They don't even know
about hitchhiking.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.595
A child once-- this was another
time I was hitchhiking when

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:41.755
I was, trainer wheels,
you know, training

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:44.725
to do this-- in Provincetown
a family picked me up

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.130
and the little kid was
in the car staring at me.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.010
He said, Dad, why is
this man in the car?

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.960
Why did you stop?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.844
Who is he?

00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.010
It was really embarrassing,
because they didn't even

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.180
know what hitchhiking was.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.605
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's like,
when was his last film?

00:02:58.605 --> 00:02:59.340
The kid.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.031
JOHN WATERS: Well, no, I don't
know if they recognized me.

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:03.530
I forget if they
asked me what I do.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.672
I never bring it up.

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:06.630
MALE SPEAKER 2: So you
did a series of training

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.140
runs in Provincetown.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.970
JOHN WATERS: Well, I used
to have hitchhiking dates.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.375
It was really a great come on.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.500
Do you want to go hitchhiking
with me to the beach?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.070
Because this one beach,
you have to have a sticker

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.106
or live in that beach.

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:20.230
And I didn't have one, so
the only way you could go

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.813
was hitchhike.

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:22.585
And it was a 15 mile ride.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:26.450
It was not that hard
if you didn't make it.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.080
And in Provincetown,
to be honest.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.140
People did recognize me.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.195
So it was like hailing
a limousine [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.055
But coming back wasn't.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:34.860
Coming back wasn't.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.000
And I did hitchhike
with Patty Hearst once.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.021
And I always met the
person, get in the back.

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:39.812
I get in the front.

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:42.206
And the man was looking
over like he recognized me.

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:43.890
And then he said,
are you John Waters?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.598
I said, yeah, and
that's Patricia Hearst.

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:47.144
And he looked in
the rearview mirror.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.040
And she said, he made me do it.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.130
And later, her husband
was really pissed off.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.562
He said, hasn't she had
enough trouble, John?

00:03:57.562 --> 00:03:58.750
And it's true.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.650
I said to her, look, but have I?

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.870
No.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.370
MALE SPEAKER 2: So
as somebody who's

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.300
done the whole gamut of
entertainment things--

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.770
books, movies, acting,
voiceover, everything

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.640
you can imagine,
this guy's done it--

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.347
what was the impetus
for this type of book?

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:17.430
JOHN WATERS: An adventure.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.290
You know, my life.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.029
It was my mid-life crisis.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.190
I don't want to buy a
convertible I won't even

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.260
get in a convertible at my age.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.150
But I needed an adventure.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.855
My life was so planned,
so controlled, so safe.

00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:32.821
Can I give all that up
and see what happens?

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:33.780
And I did.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.370
And I always felt my
street cred would go up.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.100
I was impressed--
at 66 years old,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.632
I hitchhiked across the country.

00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:40.104
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, come on!

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:40.604
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:43.408
JOHN WATERS: Just by
myself, with no backup.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.492
And there were horrible
days, you know,

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:49.870
when I'm sitting there,
waiting 10 hours for a car.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.990
And it was so hot one day--
I would call my assistant

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.480
and whine all the time.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.935
Just say, I have to
drink my own urine, now.

00:04:56.935 --> 00:04:57.917
And stuff like that.

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.635
Because I would
just be stuck there.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:00.863
And I would run out of water.

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:03.809
I didn't do that, but-- I
was like "Pink Flamingos."

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.800
I was living in camp
station laboratories

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.600
some days, which
was really humbling.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.520
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, you didn't
tell your mother before going,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.171
and then she found out later.

00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:17.170
Is she shocked by anything
you do at this point?

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.711
JOHN WATERS: Well,
my assistant Susan

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:21.140
said that she wasn't,
because you beat her down

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.740
into submission.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.834
But my mother always said that
she wasn't shocked by something

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:27.500
until then I'd say,
OK, well then, here.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.344
And then she'd say, why would
you do something like that?

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:32.810
So that wasn't completely true.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.550
My mom, unfortunately,
died this year.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.258
But she had a great
life, and everything.

00:05:36.258 --> 00:05:38.580
But she did say stuff
like, with my movies,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.750
what's this one about?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.170
And I'd say, sex addiction.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.400
She'd go, oh.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.100
Maybe we'll die first.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.330
The only good thing about
my mother passing away

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.620
is that she won't
read this book.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.950
Because there are parts in it
that would really kill her,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.746
right?

00:06:00.746 --> 00:06:01.246
Yeah.

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:02.662
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Well, yeah, I mean

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:07.100
this felt like this kind
of goes back to your roots,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.465
your really trashy roots
especially the first two

00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:11.990
novellas.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.625
How do you--

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.000
JOHN WATERS: Well, I did think
up the best and the worst.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.390
They are extreme, to me.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.230
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well,
a lot of people,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.114
say some of the more
housewife type of characters

00:06:23.114 --> 00:06:27.360
that you met recognize you from,
they know you from "Hairspray."

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.965
JOHN WATERS: Housewife is a
politically incorrect word.

00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:33.460
Is there such a thing
as a housewife anymore?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.780
Like, sitting around,
baking pies in an apron?

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.950
I don't even know about--

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.533
MALE SPEAKER 1: All
right, old broads.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.890
JOHN WATERS: Yeah-- no!

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.700
Working moms.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.750
No-- I don't know.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.490
But the people that
picked me up in real life

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.360
are the opposite of
the first two chapters.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.460
They were probably fairly
normal but really sweet,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.440
really progressive
in how they thought,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.670
completely different
than what-- I really

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.320
hate that expression, "flyover
people," because these were

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.410
what is snottily referred to.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.670
But to me, they were
more liberal and smart

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.640
than a lot of people
I know in Manhattan

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.760
and L.A. They were
open to stuff.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.260
They just didn't
bullshit, you know?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.490
They hated freeloaders.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.160
That's the main thing.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.860
And the most interesting thing--
I don't think a gay person

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.050
picked me up, which was--
but the straight men,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.890
the straight men all talked
about how much they love

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.886
their wife and how smart
she was and everything.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:31.680
It gave heterosexuality
such a good name.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.710
They have to feel good
about themselves, too.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.960
MALE SPEAKER 2: You want to--?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.740
We'll switch.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.000
JOHN WATERS: So that
was kind of amazing.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.200
And so all the women I
know in New York say,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.690
I can never meet a straight man.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.230
Go hitchhike on Route 70.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.146
The problem is they're
all happily married.

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:51.950
You have to move to the town
early and then find one first.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.696
MALE SPEAKER 1: Not to poke
too many holes in that,

00:07:54.696 --> 00:07:57.070
but do you think some of them
were like, I-- I'm married.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.440
I have a wife.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.439
JOHN WATERS: No, no, no.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.174
And the gay thing, one guy
was a total Republican,

00:08:01.174 --> 00:08:03.372
and he said to me, you
know, I'm for Obama,

00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:05.080
now that he said he
was for gay marriage.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.550
When he said he was evolving,
that was such bullshit.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.410
So [INAUDIBLE] not always
predictable about how

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.987
they felt about stuff.

00:08:14.987 --> 00:08:17.320
MALE SPEAKER 1: I guess if
they're going to pick you up.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.300
If they're picking
up a hitchhiker,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.557
they're probably
pretty open people.

00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:23.640
JOHN WATERS: I don't know.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.820
I got a ride in a
90,000 pound truck,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.870
and I never felt gayer
climbing up those steps

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.750
to get in that truck.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.265
I felt like a complete fool.

00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:35.630
You know, this is like
a porn joke, right?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.618
The guy couldn't
have been nicer.

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:38.159
He was great.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.444
It's what gay bears
wish they were.

00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:42.189
He was a straight bear.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.660
But he doesn't even
know about bears.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.050
MALE SPEAKER 1: Can you explain
for some of the mainstream

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.810
kind of straight people, the
fascination with truckers?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.821
JOHN WATERS: I-- I
didn't say I had--

00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:55.070
MALE SPEAKER 2: No, not yours.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.400
MALE SPEAKER 1: I
read the first--

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.108
JOHN WATERS: There's
not that many people

00:08:58.108 --> 00:08:59.120
you get a ride with.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.490
Oh, you mean the porn
fantasy of truckers?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.500
Well, truck stops.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.085
I wrote a great
best-case scenario

00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:06.850
of an illegal truck stop.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.940
And I do have a real trucker
friend who's out of his mind.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.010
I'd be scared for
him to pick me up.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.592
He says he carries fake
piss for the drug tests.

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:17.610
He dumps things on people's
lawn if they weight too much.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.170
He picks up runaway girls
and has sex with them.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.739
He jerks off in a sock.

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:23.238
And he says, want
me to send it you?

00:09:23.238 --> 00:09:24.226
I said, no!

00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:25.708
I don't want you
to send it to me.

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.178
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.178 --> 00:09:29.660
MALE SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.142
JOHN WATERS: Does that help?

00:09:31.142 --> 00:09:32.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:35.180
MALE SPEAKER 1: I'm fascinated.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.721
MALE SPEAKER 2:
That's the real part.

00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:39.607
JOHN WATERS: No, that's not
the real part-- in the book,

00:09:39.607 --> 00:09:42.012
I don't have-- oh,
the guy is real.

00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:43.303
The real trucker is real, yeah.

00:09:43.303 --> 00:09:44.508
God, no, yeah.

00:09:44.508 --> 00:09:46.829
The criminal one, yeah.

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:49.120
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, there's
a line early in the book,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.703
and you say this a
couple times, where

00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:52.967
you believe in the basic
goodness in people.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.800
Was that sort of like
your thesis statement,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.883
or was that what you set
out to prove, or was it--

00:09:56.883 --> 00:09:59.100
JOHN WATERS: That's about
as spiritual as I get.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.140
I do believe in the
basic goodness of people.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.510
There are people that are
born wired wrong, though, yes.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.105
But I have faith in people.

00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:08.250
I taught in prison.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.970
I can get along with
all kinds of people.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.340
I'm not scared of people.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.280
And I am a good listener.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.840
And people will
tell me anything.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.727
I mean, I've said this before.

00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:19.060
I get on an airplane and a
stranger will turn next to me

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.465
and say, my entire family
fuck me in an Easter basket

00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:23.740
on Easter morning.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.010
Why do they tell me that?

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.912
Because I'll understand.

00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:32.054
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:33.720
MALE SPEAKER 1: I
mean, isn't it so much

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.386
more interesting to
talk to those people

00:10:35.386 --> 00:10:37.776
than, you know-- us?

00:10:37.776 --> 00:10:38.442
JOHN WATERS: No.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:41.100
No, because-- I never understand
people say they're bored.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.704
Well, walk outside
and look at people.

00:10:42.704 --> 00:10:43.370
I'm never bored.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.000
That's the one thing I
never am, because I'm

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.530
interested in human behavior.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.210
And the most that I
made the movies about

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.700
and that I wrote
about are people

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.930
that think they're normal
but, to me, are really insane.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.305
Because most of
the people I know

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.760
in New York who think
they're insane are actually

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.975
kind of normal.

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:03.470
So it's always weird
how people conceive

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.410
of themselves and
their own beliefs.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.780
MALE SPEAKER 2: Did you find
any of that on the road-- people

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.020
that were more-- Were
people more insane

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.486
than you thought they
would be, or less?

00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:17.950
JOHN WATERS: They were neither.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.510
I don't know that I
thought they'd be insane.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.480
The people were-- I did
not get a scary ride.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.980
I didn't even get one
that was a bad driver.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.797
I got 21 rides, it took.

00:11:28.797 --> 00:11:29.630
I got a coal miner--

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.505
MALE SPEAKER 1: That
sounds surprisingly low.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:34.244
JOHN WATERS: Well, one
big character in the book,

00:11:34.244 --> 00:11:35.439
the Karate Kid--

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:36.689
MALE SPEAKER 1: The Corvette--

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:38.650
JOHN WATERS: Corvette Kid.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.437
He was a Republican
elected official

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:41.520
in Millersville, Maryland.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.310
And he picked me up
in the pouring rain

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.450
when he was going to get
his lunch at the Subway.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.931
He didn't know who I was,
even after I told him.

00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:50.020
We just kept talking.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.510
He drove me all the way to Ohio.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.080
His parents were,
like, horrified.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.890
Where is he?

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.390
And looked up John Waters.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.340
It's not good if you Google me.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.280
It's bad.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.280
Friends with one of the
Manson family, you know?

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.490
Like, oh, great!

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.460
My kid's with him.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.940
And then he went back.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.760
And then he kept texting
me the whole time.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.406
And then he said,
I'm coming to get ya.

00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:14.950
And drove 48 hours straight
at 80 miles an hour

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.330
and caught up with me in Denver.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.650
So he was great.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.330
We just had a--

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.322
MALE SPEAKER 1: And you
met him in Baltimore.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.738
JOHN WATERS: I didn't meet
him-- oh, afterwards I met him.

00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:22.790
But I didn't know him.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.400
MALE SPEAKER 1: But that's
where he first picked you up--

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.666
JOHN WATERS: We met
in Millersville.

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:26.582
It was the third ride.

00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.534
Which is about an hour
outside of Baltimore.

00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:30.577
I didn't even know
what Millersville was.

00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:32.702
MALE SPEAKER 1: It kind of
reminded me of the scene

00:12:32.702 --> 00:12:35.120
in "The Jerk" when you
were first getting started.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.490
I think with the first
guy took you, like,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.520
down the block or something.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.980
JOHN WATERS: Well,
the first ride

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.445
was a great, African-American
Tracy Turnblad kind of gal

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:44.874
with her baby, going to daycare.

00:12:44.874 --> 00:12:46.665
And she said, I can't
take you any further,

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.030
because I have to go to work.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.080
But she was lovely.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.412
And it was pouring rain.

00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:51.120
That's the thing.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.800
I did a lot of
research to find out

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.680
the most moderate
temperature on Route 70,

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.350
which was this week in May,
but the thing I didn't look up

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.460
is, it rains every day.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.480
So the first two days,
I stood there literally

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.280
in pouring down rain.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.190
I thought, I'm
gonna kill myself.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.047
What book is this?

00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:10.130
MALE SPEAKER 1: So you
never got sick or anything?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.920
JOHN WATERS: No.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.215
MALE SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:12.989
JOHN WATERS: Well,
I mean-- mentally.

00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:14.456
MALE SPEAKER 2: That
happened a long time ago.

00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:15.539
JOHN WATERS: Oh, car sick.

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:17.722
My friend told me
the other day--

00:13:17.722 --> 00:13:19.346
MALE SPEAKER 2: Just
lower it a little.

00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:20.012
JOHN WATERS: OK.

00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:23.260
He said, you know, when I was
a child, I always got carsick.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.830
And you take the
jacket off, look,

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.908
and it's the color
of the exact medicine

00:13:26.908 --> 00:13:28.740
I had to take as a child.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.110
I think that was accidental.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.806
MALE SPEAKER 2: Did
you learn about--

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:39.204
what did you learn to be the
best techniques to hitchhike?

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:41.120
JOHN WATERS: With the
sign, humor didn't work.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.640
I had one that said,
I'm not psycho.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.390
People laughed but
they didn't pick me up.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.890
"Writing a book"
really didn't work,

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.900
because then they'd
think, about what?

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.690
And they want their
own private life.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.372
Something that didn't
work if I was starting out

00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:57.090
in Baltimore instead
of San Francisco.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.880
It's like a joke.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.837
You had to have a possible
end, so "End of Route 70," even

00:14:01.837 --> 00:14:04.610
though it was 2000 miles
or something, at least

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.480
meant, please, take me a long
way, but it was possible.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.400
So it had to be.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.492
And at the end of
every day, I always

00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:13.950
never wanted to
hitchhike at night.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.064
So the trick was where
you get dropped off.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.564
So at the end of
every day, I wanted

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:19.400
a place that had a hotel.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.300
So I made this sign
that said, "Next motel."

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.960
I felt like a hooker, so I
just changed it to "hotel"

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.080
even though there
weren't any hotels.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.390
But it seemed much less tawdry.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:37.710
MALE SPEAKER 1: In "The
Best That Could Happen,"

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.965
you were immediately given--
what was it-- $5 million

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:44.070
by a drug dealer to make
your next film, "Fruitcake."

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.270
That's a movie that's--

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.900
JOHN WATERS: That
is a movie I've

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.608
been trying to make
that didn't get made.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:48.150
So who knows?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.441
Maybe someone will read the
book and send me the check.

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:52.936
They gave it to me
in cash and said

00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:55.220
that I would never have
notes, not to worry.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.628
You know, it was like a joke of
the best possible producer you

00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:01.282
could ever get. "We really
don't care if it makes money,

00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:01.782
but here."

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:07.140
And they own a criminally
corrupt FedEx office

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.030
that only deals in their drugs.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.902
And the people that
work there look

00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:14.426
like they escaped from
a Whole Foods jail.

00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:16.250
You know that look.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.102
MALE SPEAKER 1: Are we ever
going to see that film?

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:22.340
What's the state of low-budget,
independent film right now?

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.860
JOHN WATERS: Oh, it's bad.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.240
I mean TV is better now.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.730
More people see it.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.330
So no, the independent film
world that I know is no longer.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.950
They're looking for
me when I was 20.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.581
They'd like me to make a film
with the budget of "Polyester,"

00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:37.080
certainly.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.538
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Which was how much?

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:39.540
JOHN WATERS: $300,000.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.470
Which today would be
probably $600,000.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.970
MALE SPEAKER 1: Would you ever
consider doing a Kickstarter?

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.556
JOHN WATERS: No, public
begging, I can't, I can't.

00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:47.365
You know, I own--

00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:47.850
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Says the guy who--

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.305
JOHN WATERS: I own three homes.

00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:50.760
No, but I own three homes.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.947
As much as I wanted to
go to Occupy Baltimore,

00:15:52.947 --> 00:15:54.155
I can't be that hypocritical.

00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:00.910
And I don't hate all rich.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.778
There's asshole poor
people I know, too.

00:16:03.778 --> 00:16:05.770
There's good and
bad in both, really.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.415
But I liked Occupy Baltimore.

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:09.290
I get why they're going
there, the same way I

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.220
want to Black Panther riots
in the '60s-- to have sex,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.060
to take drugs.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.406
I understand the
tribal fun of a riot.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.232
MALE SPEAKER 2: In the fictional
part, you witnessed-- sorry,

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.689
you referenced-- sorry, I just
got off a plane from Russia,

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:26.940
so I'm a little stupid.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.012
I'm also stupid in real life.

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:32.300
But you reference the
soundtracks a lot.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.050
JOHN WATERS: Yeah, the
book has a playlist

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.660
at the end, which you can go
and look up online and play

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.340
all the music.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.960
And it's-- oddly enough, all
music about hitchhiking is

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.620
country music.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.440
Almost all of it.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.023
Except for the famous
"Hitchhike" song

00:16:44.023 --> 00:16:44.880
by Marvin Gaye.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.550
But I found some great ones,
really obscure hitchhike

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.050
records.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.690
I always have a soundtrack
to everything I do.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.168
Even when I'm walking down the
street, kind of in my head,

00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:55.096
I need a soundtrack.

00:16:55.096 --> 00:16:56.952
MALE SPEAKER 2: [SINGING] Going
to Google, going to Google,

00:16:56.952 --> 00:16:58.279
what the hell is this?

00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.987
JOHN WATERS: Is there
a Google Dance yet?

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:00.580
There should be.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.996
MALE SPEAKER 2:
Oh, yeah, totally.

00:17:01.996 --> 00:17:04.221
Nobody goes, but--
Everybody [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.470
with their computer and works.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.920
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, you mean,
like, a dance-- function or--

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.930
JOHN WATERS: Yeah,
like the twist.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.471
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Everybody's doing it.

00:17:10.471 --> 00:17:12.600
You know, there's a gimmick
dance, like the Google.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.050
You should make one.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.030
No, that's the hacker.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.480
You know, I always thought,
I want a hacker boyfriend

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.685
because they're always
home up there in that room

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:22.910
with the door closed, waiting
to put the food outside

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.855
while they're shutting
down the government

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:26.262
of foreign countries.

00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:27.720
MALE SPEAKER 2:
There's some people

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.761
doing a dance over there.

00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:31.115
You'll see everybody
doing that during the day.

00:17:31.115 --> 00:17:34.000
MALE SPEAKER 1: It's a
very anti-social dance.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.100
MALE SPEAKER 2: What were people
listening to in their cars?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.110
JOHN WATERS: Almost
never was the radio on.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.460
When I hitchhiked, when you
pick up-- they want to talk.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.720
So, I don't remember
ever the radio

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.440
being on on one car
that ever picked me up.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.695
With Here We Go Magic, a
rock group that picked me up

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.920
that I did not know, and they
accidentally picked me up,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.350
they played my mix tape.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.015
And they gave me
their tape, but I

00:17:57.015 --> 00:17:58.912
played that alone
in the motel, we

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.365
didn't play it in front of them.

00:18:00.365 --> 00:18:01.190
MALE SPEAKER 1: Were
they a good band?

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.390
JOHN WATERS: Yeah,
they are good, yeah.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.913
MALE SPEAKER 1: OK, because
I was really liking them

00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:05.612
in the book and I was
like, it would be terrible

00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:06.096
if they were--

00:18:06.096 --> 00:18:07.225
JOHN WATERS: Well, I
wouldn't have minded a ride

00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:08.926
with a terrible band, either.

00:18:08.926 --> 00:18:10.300
I would've gotten
in, believe me.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.732
I wasn't, like, [INAUDIBLE],
all right, let me hear a hit,

00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:13.231
first.

00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:13.731
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.731 --> 00:18:14.589
No thanks.

00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:16.213
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh,
oh it's Nickelback.

00:18:16.213 --> 00:18:16.754
Keep driving.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.480
Spoiler alert-- in "The
Worst That Could Happen,"

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.175
you actually describe your
own death at the hands of a--

00:18:27.175 --> 00:18:29.300
JOHN WATERS: Well, don't
tell them the whole thing.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.200
MALE SPEAKER 1: OK, OK.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.480
Can I tell--

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.800
JOHN WATERS: Well, if
you think of the worst

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.216
and you're
hitchhiking, obviously,

00:18:33.216 --> 00:18:34.192
you get killed, yeah.

00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:35.012
In Las Vegas.

00:18:35.012 --> 00:18:36.970
MALE SPEAKER 1: Can I
tell them about the movie

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.810
that's playing in Hell?

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.963
JOHN WATERS: Oh, no.

00:18:39.963 --> 00:18:41.935
MALE SPEAKER 1: Aww,
all right, all right.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.340
JOHN WATERS: But I do
imagine the person that

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.115
kills me-- always said that
most serial killers, their type

00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:54.686
isn't a 66-year-old
film cult director.

00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:58.090
But in the book, there is one.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.905
Who's only looking for that.

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:02.280
MALE SPEAKER 1: Is it, like,
Leonard Maltin or something?

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.405
JOHN WATERS: [CHUCKLES] No.

00:19:07.887 --> 00:19:10.345
MALE SPEAKER 1: What's the most
shockingly mainstream thing

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:12.339
that you're a fan of?

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:13.630
JOHN WATERS: That's a good one.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.240
I don't know.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.660
Oh, um.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.350
Hmm.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.550
MALE SPEAKER 2: Shoes

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.530
JOHN WATERS: 3D.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.810
I'm for all 3D.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.530
I like 3D, but I went
to see things like,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.190
what was the one with
the big tits in--

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.440
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, "Piranha?"

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.360
JOHN WATERS: "Piranha 3DD,"
that was what it was called.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.780
And I went, but last
night of the run,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.200
and I was alone in
a theater watching

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.218
"Piranha 3DD" with 3D glasses
on, looking like such a fool.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:41.466
I was the only person in the
theater for the 10 o'clock show

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:42.860
the last day.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.754
But I didn't miss it.

00:19:44.754 --> 00:19:48.090
I'm also a big fan of all
"Final Destination" movies.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.660
I love them.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.330
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh,
those are great, yeah.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.375
MALE SPEAKER 2: Are
there going to be

00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:53.082
any more hitchhiking
adventures in your future?

00:19:53.082 --> 00:19:54.200
JOHN WATERS: I hope not.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.644
If I miss a flight.

00:19:56.644 --> 00:19:58.836
No, once I did it, I
don't have to do it again.

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.070
But you all should do it.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.438
You should try hitchhiking.

00:20:01.438 --> 00:20:03.960
I think it is a
little adventure,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.570
you can do it on
your summer vacation,

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.462
and if you get murdered,
it's not my fault.

00:20:09.462 --> 00:20:11.655
But you could get murdered
in a care accident.

00:20:11.655 --> 00:20:13.895
I'm scared of staying at home.

00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:15.320
If you never go
out either, that's

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.255
more dangerous than taking
a chance hitchhiking.

00:20:18.255 --> 00:20:20.334
Because nothing new
will ever happen to you.

00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:22.250
MALE SPEAKER 1: Do you
think if you had done--

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:28.020
would this have been easier
to do in the '70s than now

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.250
even if you weren't famous?

00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:33.925
JOHN WATERS: In the
old days, the problem

00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:35.490
was, there was so
many hitchhikers.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.430
They were places-- New Haven
was a famous place where there

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.630
would be a hundred
hitchhikers there.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.360
So it was better for that.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.980
There was no competition.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.850
But the younger you
are, the better chance

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.880
you have a ride,
certainly-- to get 'em.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.049
And I was in the one truck stop.

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:51.590
I was talking to
the guy checking in,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.222
and I said that really
truckers can't pick you up now,

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:55.680
because they have
two in the truck.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.471
And this trucker who
was standing behind me

00:20:57.471 --> 00:21:01.508
said, if you had a
vagina, they would.

00:21:01.508 --> 00:21:02.008
Oh.

00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:12.250
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, I
want to talk a little bit

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.640
about the Corvette Kid.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.140
Do you still keep
in touch with him?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:15.465
JOHN WATERS: I do.

00:21:15.465 --> 00:21:16.915
He came to my Christmas party.

00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:17.960
He's looking great, yeah.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.990
MALE SPEAKER 1: Does
he really, does he

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.420
look like Justin Bieber?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.390
JOHN WATERS: No, but I'm a
fan of Justin Bieber's, too.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.984
Even more so now.

00:21:26.984 --> 00:21:28.220
When he's Bizzle.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.450
No, Bizzle's gonna
be his rap name.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.815
That makes me really love him.

00:21:32.815 --> 00:21:33.315
Bizzle.

00:21:33.315 --> 00:21:35.263
I wanna hear his rhymes.

00:21:35.263 --> 00:21:36.237
Oh, my God.

00:21:36.237 --> 00:21:37.698
I love it when he's black.

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:42.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.690
MALE SPEAKER 2: So just
looking at your body of work,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.160
it seems like
you're always busy.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.215
Are you thinking forward
to your next thing

00:21:51.215 --> 00:21:52.590
after you get
through this huge--

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.506
JOHN WATERS: Yeah, I got
next things, already.

00:21:54.506 --> 00:21:55.770
I'm booked for the next year.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.460
The spoken word show
called "This Filthy World"

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.670
I do all over the world.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.000
I have a Christmas show, I've
got 20 in December coming up.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.130
I'm having an art show at
Marianne Boesky Gallery

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.580
and one in London.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.655
I have another
big project that I

00:22:07.655 --> 00:22:09.030
can't announce
yet that's coming.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.155
And maybe another one that
I'm writing this summer.

00:22:11.155 --> 00:22:12.077
So, yeah, I got a job.

00:22:12.077 --> 00:22:14.410
MALE SPEAKER 2: Where do you
find the time for all this?

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.909
JOHN WATERS: That's
a good question.

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:16.900
I'm highly organized.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.900
MALE SPEAKER 2: Are you?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.650
JOHN WATERS: Yeah.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.830
Monday to Friday, I get
up every morning at 6 am.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.125
I read all the newspapers.

00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:24.610
I still read newspapers.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.450
And then my job is every
morning to think up

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.272
something fucked up, and I've
gotta sell it in the afternoon.

00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:31.510
Monday to Friday.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.980
I drink one day a week.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.982
So I'm a workaholic
five, an alcoholic one,

00:22:34.982 --> 00:22:36.190
and the other day I take off.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.760
And my shrink says, that
sounds like a good plan to me.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.730
MALE SPEAKER 1: Is there one
sort of guiding book or film

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:52.070
that you are aiming towards,
that sets the bar for you

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.970
in everything you do?

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.970
JOHN WATERS: No, not really.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.470
Because when I
grew up, certainly

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.230
Genet and Tennessee Williams and
all those kind of people which

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.271
I wrote about in my last
book, "Role Models," all

00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:02.350
the people that
kind of gave me the,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.815
I don't know, the courage to
try to do what I wanted to do.

00:23:05.815 --> 00:23:07.273
So no, I think
those kind of things

00:23:07.273 --> 00:23:08.990
happen to you when you're young.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.920
Today, I love
Michel Houellebecq.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.920
I love his novels.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.980
I'm reading this one from
Norway, the six volume

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.750
memoir, "My Struggle,"
which is great, by the way.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.540
So I like to read.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.585
Yeah, that's what I
do for relaxation.

00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:26.480
MALE SPEAKER 2: Do you write
your books in the same way

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.099
that you do your films?

00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:29.640
JOHN WATERS: Yeah,
I write everything

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.560
on a special kind of legal pad
with big pens and scotch tape.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.620
And then my assistant puts it in
the computer, the first draft.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.140
And then I cut it up again.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.324
Yeah, I do it the same way.

00:23:39.324 --> 00:23:40.490
MALE SPEAKER 1: In longhand.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.280
JOHN WATERS: In longhand.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.235
MALE SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:42.860
That's amazing.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.216
It seems like there's a
lot of guys that do that.

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.090
JOHN WATERS: Doesn't
matter how you write it.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.715
You could use your
head on a blackboard

00:23:48.715 --> 00:23:49.674
as a human typewriter.

00:23:49.674 --> 00:23:51.934
As long as you write
it, it doesn't matter.

00:23:51.934 --> 00:23:56.390
Nobody asks at the end,
how did you do that book?

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.460
Never in my life
has anybody that's

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.129
ever paid me one penny ever
asked me if I went to school.

00:24:02.129 --> 00:24:03.670
MALE SPEAKER 2: Did
you go to school?

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.576
JOHN WATERS: No.

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.614
I had trouble in school.

00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:08.730
But I was lucky, I didn't
want to be a doctor.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.990
I'm glad that I'm not a
doctor and no one asked.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.531
MALE SPEAKER 2:
Well, you were at NYU

00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:13.900
and then you got kicked out.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.930
JOHN WATERS: Yeah, well
they weren't used to me.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.882
Because I took acid every day
and just stole books and then

00:24:18.882 --> 00:24:22.907
resold them in the
bookstore in the afternoon.

00:24:22.907 --> 00:24:24.596
They should've thrown me out.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.290
MALE SPEAKER 2: But
you were working.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:25.980
It wasn't like you
weren't working.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.430
You wanted--

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.830
JOHN WATERS: Well, I
didn't even come to class.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.341
I just took drugs and went
to the movies every day.

00:24:30.341 --> 00:24:33.600
But not "Potemkin," which
they showed us over and over.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.229
But nowadays NYU is great.

00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:35.937
I could go there.

00:24:35.937 --> 00:24:37.845
You could make a snuff
film and get an A.

00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:40.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.332
MALE SPEAKER 2: On that
note, we have a mic there

00:24:43.332 --> 00:24:44.450
for audience questions.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.153
So if you have a question, you
can just kind of circulate over

00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:48.905
there and we'll call on you.

00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:50.405
JOHN WATERS: Or you
can yell it out.

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:51.840
You don't have to do the full--

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.050
MALE SPEAKER 2: I think
they're doing that for audio.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.169
JOHN WATERS: Oh, OK.

00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:55.210
MALE SPEAKER 2: Go ahead.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.052
AUDIENCE: So I have your
Christmas record compilation.

00:24:58.052 --> 00:24:59.010
JOHN WATERS: Thank you.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.435
AUDIENCE: It's a very
special place in my heart.

00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:01.385
JOHN WATERS: Aww, thanks.

00:25:01.385 --> 00:25:02.180
AUDIENCE: Can you
describe how you

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.370
chose all those songs,
where you found them?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.770
JOHN WATERS: Well,
I always liked

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.600
weird novelty songs
and hillbilly records

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.820
and old rhythm and blues.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.400
And so I just look for
every weird Christmas

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.680
carol I could find.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.480
And the one song,
"I'm Fat Daddy,"

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.650
was the main black disc
jockey in Baltimore

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.164
where, in "Hairspray," I
joked they had "Negro Day."

00:25:21.164 --> 00:25:22.570
They really did have that.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.700
And he was the host of "Negro
Day," and that was his song.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.820
"I'm Fat Daddy,
I'm Santa Claus."

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.910
And then the other song,
"Santa Claus Is A Black Man,"

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.850
I love that song.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.020
And the governor of
Maryland, O'Malley,

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.740
when he was the mayor, turned
on the Christmas lights

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.970
of all of Baltimore downtown
with me and the mayor

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.990
and they played that as
the introduction, which

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.870
was great and very
fitting for Baltimore.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.155
MALE SPEAKER 1: Anybody else?

00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:49.280
MALE SPEAKER 2: Just real
quick as he gets up here.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.820
Mark's from around Baltimore.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.855
And he does this--
we're always wondering--

00:25:52.855 --> 00:25:54.855
MALE SPEAKER 1: How do
you not have that accent?

00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:56.600
JOHN WATERS: I think
I probably do have it.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.360
MALE SPEAKER 2: Do the accent.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.944
Listen.

00:25:57.944 --> 00:26:00.152
MALE SPEAKER 1: Um, well--
let me try to do it again.

00:26:00.152 --> 00:26:02.970
JOHN WATERS: Here's
every person answers

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.167
the phone in
Baltimore-- one minute.

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:08.750
MALE SPEAKER 1: My family and
I, we go to Ocean City, Maryland

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.322
every summer.

00:26:10.322 --> 00:26:12.905
And there's this commercial for
this place called Purple Moose

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:16.060
Saloon, "The home of
hard rockin' Ocean City."

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.419
It's like everybody's mouth
seems like it's a small hole

00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:20.043
and they're trying
to get words out of.

00:26:20.043 --> 00:26:21.868
JOHN WATERS: In "Pink
Flamingos" I make fun of that.

00:26:21.868 --> 00:26:23.480
I'm the narrator
in the beginning.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:23.980
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.980
John Travolta actually
did a pretty good job

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.230
in the remake of the--

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.980
JOHN WATERS: Yeah.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.080
The Baltimore accent
is really grating.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.503
Philadelphia's
very close, though.

00:26:31.503 --> 00:26:32.370
It sounds similar.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.630
All regional accents
can be grating,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.008
unless you're in the
mafia-- except New York.

00:26:38.008 --> 00:26:39.850
Then they kind of sound good.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.946
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I
noticed they didn't-- none

00:26:40.946 --> 00:26:43.030
of the people in "The
Wire", they were like, yeah,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:43.904
don't talk like that.

00:26:43.904 --> 00:26:45.440
Nobody's gonna
think you're cool.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.120
JOHN WATERS: "The
Wire" is so great.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.957
It's my favorite
television show ever.

00:26:47.957 --> 00:26:49.540
And everybody down
there worked on it.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.740
But that's a black-- that's
a different kind of Baltimore

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.245
accent.

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:54.620
MALE SPEAKER 2:
Beyond the ocean.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.666
Yes, sir.

00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:56.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.835
So I've never actually
see any of your work,

00:26:58.835 --> 00:27:01.888
but I did see you
on the Big Thing.

00:27:01.888 --> 00:27:03.512
I did see an interview
on the Big Thing

00:27:03.512 --> 00:27:04.970
and I was really
intrigued by that.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.790
So where should I
start in the John

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.889
Waters oeuvre to maximize--

00:27:08.889 --> 00:27:09.764
JOHN WATERS: Depends.

00:27:09.764 --> 00:27:13.214
Do you want to go low or high?

00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:17.101
I would say, "Female
Trouble" and "Serial Mom."

00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:17.934
AUDIENCE: Say again?

00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:19.850
JOHN WATERS: And "Serial Mom."

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.670
One was very early,
one was very late.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.387
But I think they kind
of sum up everything.

00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:27.470
MALE SPEAKER 1: On a
personal note, the first time

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.067
I saw "Female Trouble,"
I felt like it

00:27:30.067 --> 00:27:32.650
was the first time I heard the
Sex Pistols, where I was, like,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.481
laughing but I was also scared.

00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:36.980
And my new roommate
showed it to me,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.766
so then I was scared of him.

00:27:39.766 --> 00:27:40.640
It was great, though.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.870
JOHN WATERS: Thank you.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.924
I hate asking questions in
talks so I wrote mine down.

00:27:47.924 --> 00:27:49.590
So I would've read
"Carsick" last night,

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.040
but it wasn't published yet, so

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.020
JOHN WATERS: Today's the date.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.960
So, congratulations.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.918
JOHN WATERS: Thank you.

00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:56.230
AUDIENCE: And I read
"Role Models" instead.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.368
And so you wrote about
Leslie Van Houten.

00:27:59.368 --> 00:28:01.658
JOHN WATERS: I did.

00:28:01.658 --> 00:28:03.235
That's kind of a
serious subject.

00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:03.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.800
Well, it was really
difficult for me to--

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.390
and your next chapter is
about your sense of fashion.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.931
It was really hard for me to go
from one chapter to the next.

00:28:11.931 --> 00:28:16.222
But so you talk about
how she's still in jail

00:28:16.222 --> 00:28:17.680
and she's repeatedly
denied parole.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.947
And you make it clear that
you think it's been too long.

00:28:21.947 --> 00:28:22.655
You even say that

00:28:22.655 --> 00:28:24.904
JOHN WATERS: I make it clear
that Leslie Van Houten is

00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:26.770
one of the three
original Manson women

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.050
that has been in
jail since 1969.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:34.650
She looks back on it with
horror at what she did.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.640
And has taken full
responsibility.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.650
She is my friend.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.360
I've visited her
for a long time.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.517
I believe she did not
get-- her first trial,

00:28:42.517 --> 00:28:43.600
she got the death penalty.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.240
Her second trial,
it was overthrown.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.590
She got a hung jury for
diminished capacity.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.500
And the third trial she was
found guilty so she got life.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.310
She did not get
life without parole.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.850
She said, if I got life without
parole, I would never ask.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.540
But she has done--
they have repeatedly

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.317
told for 40 years you're
eligible parole if you

00:29:02.317 --> 00:29:02.900
do everything.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.704
And she has a great record.

00:29:04.704 --> 00:29:05.620
She's done everything.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.380
The shrinks, everything.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.780
And they won't let her out.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.810
And I understand.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.280
I don't ever
criticize the victims.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.880
They have the
right-- I understand

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.635
why they don't think
she should get out.

00:29:14.635 --> 00:29:16.760
But from society's
viewpoint, I do

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.124
believe that she
has paid her price.

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:22.060
She met a madman, one of
the most notorious madmen

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.640
of all-- she doesn't say that.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.800
She says that she's
equally as guilty,

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.000
because you cannot have a
cult leader without followers.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.990
I question that.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.100
I think she was 17
when she met him.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.750
And 1969, which is probably
the most insane year that's

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.660
gonna go down in this 1900, the
whole, you know, hundred years.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.002
So and she does
well in prison, too.

00:29:44.002 --> 00:29:47.339
She teaches people to read,
she does all the stuff.

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.630
AUDIENCE: Which is an excellent
summary of the chapter.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.224
So, but--

00:29:50.224 --> 00:29:51.682
JOHN WATERS: But
your question is--

00:29:51.682 --> 00:29:52.650
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.618
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah,
do you have a question?

00:29:53.618 --> 00:29:54.909
AUDIENCE: I do have a question.

00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:59.532
It seems to me that-- so, you
have this chapter in your book.

00:29:59.532 --> 00:30:01.990
And only a number of people
are going to read that chapter.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.475
JOHN WATERS: Well, they read
the whole book, usually.

00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:07.870
AUDIENCE: But I mean to say
is that you would probably

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.217
make a better case you would
have a wider influence if you

00:30:11.217 --> 00:30:12.800
were to write an
entire book about it.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.640
And so I was surprised that
it's just in one chapter,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.740
as opposed to its own book.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.073
JOHN WATERS: Well, it's the
biggest chapter in the book.

00:30:18.073 --> 00:30:19.920
I think it's 40,000
words or something.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.034
It was run on the Huffington
but put in five different parts,

00:30:24.034 --> 00:30:25.728
it ran.

00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:26.675
I don't know.

00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:28.650
My book was about people
that influenced me

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.770
for surviving things,
including Johnny Mathis.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.760
You know, surviving great
success early and still having

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.740
a great life.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.380
Leslie having this terrible
thing that she did and how

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.930
do you live with that?

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.300
So it was all the people
that really affected me.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.235
So I didn't want to write
a book just about that.

00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:49.030
I wanted to-- yes, and the
next chapter is about fashion.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.430
Then there's a chapter
about Marine porn.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.080
It's very different
worlds to me.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.295
But they all are
brave in a weird way.

00:30:57.295 --> 00:30:58.295
They survived something.

00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:00.035
And I've always
liked people that

00:31:00.035 --> 00:31:01.860
have had more extreme
lives than I've had,

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.510
it's always interesting to me.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.919
JOHN WATERS: Thank you.

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:08.252
MALE SPEAKER 1: Does anyone
have a "Hairspray" question?

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.740
AUDIENCE: Where did you
discover Edith Massey?

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.020
JOHN WATERS: In a bar
called Pete's Hotel

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.654
that you can see in
"Multiple Maniacs"

00:31:17.654 --> 00:31:18.820
if you can ever find a copy.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.820
That's where she worked.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.810
She was a bar maid.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.680
And Vincent Peranio
and Susan Lowe

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.230
who were great friends that
were in my early movies

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.380
introduced me to her.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.780
And there is a chapter-- I
don't want to give anything

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:35.532
away-- very much about her
in the new book, "Carsick."

00:31:35.532 --> 00:31:38.385
AUDIENCE: Just as a side, I also
know a guy who did Marine porn.

00:31:38.385 --> 00:31:39.468
JOHN WATERS: Who did what?

00:31:39.468 --> 00:31:40.452
AUDIENCE: Marine porn.

00:31:40.452 --> 00:31:41.118
JOHN WATERS: Oh.

00:31:41.118 --> 00:31:41.928
Was it Bobby?

00:31:41.928 --> 00:31:43.076
The one I wrote-- OK.

00:31:43.076 --> 00:31:45.462
Well, I only know Bobby.

00:31:45.462 --> 00:31:46.920
But I don't know
where he is today.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.604
He's underground
so, I don't know.

00:31:48.604 --> 00:31:50.420
But I did get dropped
off hitchhiking

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.310
in some military community.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.754
I thought, maybe he's
here, I could see him.

00:31:55.754 --> 00:31:58.836
MALE SPEAKER 2: Oh, I thought
you meant, like, sea life.

00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:00.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:01.023
I swear.

00:32:01.023 --> 00:32:02.886
I really thought
that was-- You're

00:32:02.886 --> 00:32:04.668
talking about armed
forces military?

00:32:04.668 --> 00:32:08.612
JOHN WATERS: Talking
about "see food."

00:32:08.612 --> 00:32:09.528
MALE SPEAKER 2: Sorry.

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:10.986
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
did want to ask you,

00:32:10.986 --> 00:32:12.330
what do you think
happened to hitchhiking?

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.050
When I was a kid, I remember
my parents picking up people.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.470
And when I was in high
school and college,

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.360
and even through my mid-20's,
that's how people got around.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.481
JOHN WATERS: I think
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"

00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:25.655
that hitchhiker had
a lot to do with it.

00:32:25.655 --> 00:32:28.280
And "The Hitcher"
and serial killers

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.970
and the fact that there are
serial killer truckers that

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.800
have picked up women
and killed them.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.902
So I think it just got to become
a cliche of danger, really.

00:32:38.902 --> 00:32:40.630
AUDIENCE: So I
suppose, in a way we're

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.815
doing stuff like that
with things like rideshare

00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:45.970
and Airbnb and things
like that sort of

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.680
gives it a cloak of safety.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.750
JOHN WATERS: Maybe, yeah.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.435
But also, isn't
hitchhiking green?

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:53.560
AUDIENCE: I would think so.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.059
JOHN WATERS: Yeah,
it is, certainly.

00:32:55.059 --> 00:32:56.410
It's beyond carpooling.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.130
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.530
So, thanks.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.270
MALE SPEAKER 2: Thanks
for the question.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.770
MALE SPEAKER 1: Now
somebody's going

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.250
make the Airbnb horror
movie and ruin that.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.296
MALE SPEAKER 2: The
Craigslist killer.

00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:12.174
I think he was waiting,
back there-- Go ahead.

00:33:12.174 --> 00:33:14.006
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:14.006 --> 00:33:17.242
My favorite line from all movies
is from one of your movies.

00:33:17.242 --> 00:33:18.450
JOHN WATERS: Well, thank you.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.130
Which one?

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.020
AUDIENCE: It's from
"Female Trouble."

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.970
The line is, "I wouldn't
suck your lousy dick

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.430
if I was suffocating and there
was oxygen in your balls."

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:32.412
JOHN WATERS: That's
not a bad line.

00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:37.690
I like the one in
"Desperate Living"

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.190
when he says, "I'd like to stick
my whole head in your mouth

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.104
and have you suck
out my eyeballs."

00:33:44.104 --> 00:33:45.270
AUDIENCE: That's a good one.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.561
JOHN WATERS: Both are romantic.

00:33:49.325 --> 00:33:50.940
AUDIENCE: But I
wanted to ask you

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.540
what is your favorite
line from movies?

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.790
JOHN WATERS: Oh, I don't know.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.873
Because, you know, there's
a whole chapter in here

00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:00.170
where somebody I pick up and
they refuse to talk to me

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.398
except for lines
from my movies which

00:34:02.398 --> 00:34:04.570
drives me crazy in the book.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.260
That happened to me once,
I really exaggerated it,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.510
but-- The most obscure line is
when Mink asks David Lochary

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.412
something, and he just
says, "N," which means no.

00:34:15.412 --> 00:34:16.790
That's my favorite line.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.204
And we use it around my office
all the time-- N, we say it.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:21.870
AUDIENCE: I thought
of you the other day

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.066
because I was watching "The
Prodigal" with Lana Turner

00:34:25.066 --> 00:34:26.732
and I know you're a
big Lana Turner fan.

00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:27.219
Did you ever--

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.540
JOHN WATERS: Well,
I'm even more a fan

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.699
of her daughter, Cheryl
Crane, who is my friend.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:31.730
AUDIENCE: Did you
ever see this one?

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:32.380
JOHN WATERS: Yes.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.080
AUDIENCE: Oh, you know it.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.000
JOHN WATERS: But so
long ago, I don't

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.694
know what, I don't
know each line.

00:34:36.694 --> 00:34:38.360
AUDIENCE: No, but I
mean, it's hilarious

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.151
how it's ancient Judea
and she walks around

00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:42.453
in high heels and a
slit skirt, you know.

00:34:42.453 --> 00:34:43.619
JOHN WATERS: Lana was great.

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:46.380
I met her at a Thanksgiving
dinner with Lana Turner once,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.298
with Cheryl and her girlfriend,
and it was quite a night.

00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:50.214
AUDIENCE: Well thanks.

00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:52.190
JOHN WATERS: All right, see ya.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was just
wondering what inspired you

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.650
for the character
names [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.302
JOHN WATERS: The character
names, I love to name them.

00:34:58.302 --> 00:34:59.614
I have to think up their names.

00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:03.465
Like Ready Whip, well you'll
see why I named him that one.

00:35:03.465 --> 00:35:05.580
Lucas-- I like names.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.732
I like Tarantula's
somebody's baby's name in it.

00:35:10.732 --> 00:35:12.800
Randy Packard, that's
the one who kills me.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.090
So I don't know.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.780
I have to have their name first.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.862
And I have this one baby
book from the 50's names,

00:35:18.862 --> 00:35:21.484
that I've used for-- I've
almost used every one of them.

00:35:21.484 --> 00:35:23.650
There's little checks by,
you can see all the names.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.625
I used to have about
five or six of them.

00:35:25.625 --> 00:35:29.220
But there's one i like best, and
it's an old Dell book that was

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.026
$0.25 "Name Your
Baby," from the 50's.

00:35:32.026 --> 00:35:33.400
That's where I
get a lot of them.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.990
And the last name, I just
hear them or i meet somebody,

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.030
and I don't know.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.720
And the lawyers
always go through

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.820
and make sure there's
nobody with both names,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.120
first and last, in your city
at that point in movies.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.530
AUDIENCE: With
like, "Hairspray,"

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.488
most of their names are
like the first and last

00:35:49.488 --> 00:35:50.464
are the same letter.

00:35:50.464 --> 00:35:53.740
JOHN WATERS: Well, I had that
alliteration, yes, yes, yes.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.982
Yeah, Tracy Turnblad.

00:35:54.982 --> 00:35:55.482
Yeah.

00:35:55.482 --> 00:35:56.232
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:35:56.232 --> 00:35:58.458
JOHN WATERS: Thanks.

00:35:58.458 --> 00:35:59.946
MALE SPEAKER 1: Anyone else?

00:35:59.946 --> 00:36:00.950
No?

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.490
So, you seem to be very
fascinated by crime, just

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.314
in general.

00:36:05.314 --> 00:36:08.850
JOHN WATERS: Well, yes, I
mean I taught in prison.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.490
I would be a good
defense lawyer.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.930
But I've changed on some of it.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.327
I apologized that for
"Role Models," and kind

00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:18.326
of dedicating "Pink Flamingos"
to the Manson Family,

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:18.826
and stuff.

00:36:18.826 --> 00:36:21.460
And I realized later
that that was really

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.819
unfeeling to the victims.

00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:25.320
So I did change after I taught
in prison for a long time.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.700
I don't have a favorite crime.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.170
I'm not for it.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.635
But I must admit,
today I read this story

00:36:30.635 --> 00:36:33.230
that broke about these two
girls on the internet that

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.860
killed their girlfriend
believing that some fantasy

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.070
they were going to go to.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.697
And they're 12 years old.

00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:41.280
And they thought that they were
going to live with this wizard

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.779
somewhere.

00:36:41.779 --> 00:36:43.456
It's an amazing story.

00:36:43.456 --> 00:36:44.330
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.330
Has there ever
been any-- [LAUGHS]

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.830
JOHN WATERS: Well, to me it is.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.765
MALE SPEAKER 1: No,
I didn't read it.

00:36:51.765 --> 00:36:54.363
JOHN WATERS: I
need feel bad news.

00:36:54.363 --> 00:36:55.904
MALE SPEAKER 1: Have
you had any kind

00:36:55.904 --> 00:36:59.030
of rough interactions
with criminals?

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.060
And have you ever--

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.920
JOHN WATERS: No.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.060
What do you mean, rough?

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.393
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh I don't know.

00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:06.687
JOHN WATERS: No, I get
along with them, usually.

00:37:06.687 --> 00:37:07.770
MALE SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.940
JOHN WATERS: I mean, some.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.050
I pick and choose.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.160
MALE SPEAKER 1: There's
a part in the book where

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.000
you talk about,
possibly, well, it's

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.150
kind of as a throwaway
line of the next book maybe

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.410
being you retrying all
the drugs that you--

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.659
JOHN WATERS: Yeah, I don't
think I'm going to do that.

00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:27.356
I said, try every drug
I ever took, in order.

00:37:27.356 --> 00:37:31.660
But some of them-- do I
really want LSD at 68?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.320
I don't know.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.188
I think I've had
enough inner journeys.

00:37:34.188 --> 00:37:35.297
Yeah.

00:37:35.297 --> 00:37:36.755
MALE SPEAKER 1: I
think I just want

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.980
to ask one last thing before
we-- if anybody wants a book,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.520
they're did you know about that?

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:41.730
OK.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.720
MALE SPEAKER 2: The books,
there's a few more for sale.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.678
I know a bunch of you
have bought them already.

00:37:45.678 --> 00:37:46.580
There's a few more.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.034
I think there's actually
four for sale back there.

00:37:49.034 --> 00:37:50.200
[WHISPERS] I'm pushing them.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.780
JOHN WATERS: Very good.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.071
And I'll sign them if you want.

00:37:52.071 --> 00:37:54.150
MALE SPEAKER 2: And yeah,
he'll be here to sign.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.470
But we can take another-- do
you have another question?

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.845
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Oh, I just wanted

00:37:57.845 --> 00:38:01.660
to talk to you about
the tone of your films

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.800
seem to be very consistent.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.400
And I always wonder, you
know, we make videos.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.720
We make comedy videos.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.360
How do you get
people to, sort of--

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.400
is there a John
Waters acting school?

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.080
JOHN WATERS: Well,
it used to be,

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.033
shout it as loud as you can.

00:38:15.033 --> 00:38:17.260
It was like Sensaround.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.560
But today, I think I go for a
very different kind of style.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.326
Always the main thing I said
is, we're making a comedy.

00:38:24.326 --> 00:38:25.450
Don't wink at the audience.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.827
Say it like you believe every
line is completely true.

00:38:28.827 --> 00:38:30.410
That's why I, except
for Tracy Ullman,

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.227
I almost never hired
comedians to play the part.

00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:35.310
Because I don't want them
winking at the audience.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.070
So, It's the same.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.650
The tone in my book is the same.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.570
In "Carsick," I want to just be
like, I'm telling you stories.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.300
And I think it comes
across like that.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.680
The tone I always want is, this
is my world, and come in it.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.610
And I think you'll be
safe if I'm your guide.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.260
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, I noticed
like you worked with Johnny

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.260
Knoxville, and for some
reason I don't know why,

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.600
but that just seems right.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.940
He just seems like somebody
who'd be right for--

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.700
JOHN WATERS: If Divine hadn't
eaten dog shit, he would've.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.201
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:04.741
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Yeah, I mean, there's

00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:06.424
some obvious reasons for that.

00:39:06.424 --> 00:39:08.340
But there's people like
Kathleen Turner, where

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.160
you're like, yeah, I get it.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.291
What makes a great John
Waters leading man or woman?

00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:15.415
JOHN WATERS: Well, that
they have a sense of humor.

00:39:15.415 --> 00:39:18.750
They don't use the word
"journey" or "craft" too much.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.110
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well,
thanks for taking us

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.672
on this journey
about your craft.

00:39:26.672 --> 00:39:27.171
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:33.050
And if we want to, I think,
should we do books, now?

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.800
JOHN WATERS: Yeah.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.675
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:39:34.675 --> 00:39:36.850
John's going to be up
here to sign some books

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.125
and you can chat with him.

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:40.500
How about a round of applause
for John Waters, everybody?

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.550
[APPLAUSE]
