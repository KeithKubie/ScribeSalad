00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.210
Welcome back.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.700
Let's get started investigating a professional framework that you'll be able to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.660
use to put together some really awesome projects.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.680
Along the way, we'll be taking a look at some of the decisions developers have

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.660
to make to decide which framework they want to use.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.190
For the project for this lesson, you'll be using Twitter's Bootstrap framework to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.680
put together the portfolio you see here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.970
In the end, you'll be taking advantage of some of Bootstrap's JavaScript

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.570
features to make your pages really come to life.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.330
But don't worry,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.250
you don't need to write any JavaScript yourself, we'll be helping you out.
