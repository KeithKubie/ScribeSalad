JONAH BERGER: I can't thank
you enough, actually, for

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.780
spending time on this because,
obviously, you don't have to

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.320
be a great lover of the news
to sort of wonder why would

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.690
anyone be talking about startups
in the Middle East

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.610
with what's going on right now
here in Syria, and Egypt, and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.610
that kind of stuff.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.450
But I can tell you from my
experience, and the journey

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.760
that I've been on to see what's
been going on on the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.810
ground, it's actually the
perfect time to be

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.470
talking about it.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.790
Because there's a phenomenon
that you guys know very well,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.030
but a lot of people don't know
very well, about how

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.340
technology has unleashed
incredibly powerful things.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.720
I don't want to take away one
iota of the seriousness of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.620
what's happening here because,
obviously, we know

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.740
how serious it is.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.380
And I can tell you that there
are entrepreneurs that I know,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.440
amazing entrepreneurs who I met
in Damascus and in Cairo,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.400
who died in the last
couple of weeks.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
So it's a very, very
real thing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.350
I'm not going to be talking
about here's something nobody

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.770
knows about-- it's the only
thing that matters.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.430
Both matter, both co-exist,
but it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.900
something very powerful.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.910
I'm not an expert in the
Middle East, per se.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.780
So one of things I can't do is
tell you what's going to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.280
happen in the next six months,
or what's going to happen next

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.480
three years.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.770
But what I can tell you with
pretty close to 100%

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.680
certainty, which you guys, I
think, live in a very powerful

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.590
way, is that in three years
there's going to be a lot more

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.290
technology in a lot more
people's hands.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.410
And there isn't any scenario I
see where that's going away.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.990
Marc Andreessen wrote the
forward to my book, and he

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.270
wrote it how we are moving,
within the next 8 to 10 years,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.830
to a world of 5 billion
smartphones.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.360
And that almost becomes
a throwaway now.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.400
Eric Schmidt's used five billion
people with broadband.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.830
I mean, everyone sort of throws
it out as kind of a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.680
rough number.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.640
But it doesn't cease to amaze
me, whether it's in

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.920
Washington, in politicians,
and investors, here in New

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.960
York, or in Silicon Valley rock
stars who've invented so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.660
much of the stuff that the real
ramifications of what

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.510
that means is not as well
understood as one would hope.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.820
And in fact, even the question
of what does a world of $5

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.430
billion smartphones look like is
not something that I think

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.260
a lot of people spend as much
time thinking about overall.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.640
Broadly based, not in a
technology worlds like you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.100
guys, I think that, in many
ways, folks just think they

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.780
are highfalutin telephones
or entertainment devices.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.110
David Stern, who just is about
to step down as the head of

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.190
the NBA, is actually going to
retire from the NBA and travel

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.650
all over emerging markets
because he knows that a lot

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.120
more people are going to be able
to watch NBA games on a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.060
going forward basis.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.090
So there is that connectivity.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.670
But what smartphones really
are, of course, is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.710
supercomputing capacity, if Mark
is right, in the hands of

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.210
2/3 of humanity.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.630
And I could tell you among the
mobile providers that I've met

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.690
throughout the Middle East,
most of them thought that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.150
Egypt would have 50% smartphone
penetration in the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.220
next two years.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.360
In the Gulf right now,
it could be 80%

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.120
in places like Dubai.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.020
And you're just going to see,
I think, an incredibly

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.060
powerful world.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.760
Internet penetration is
unbelievable there right now.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.790
There are huge per
capita incomes.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.240
Unlike Turkey, which is a
fantastic ecosystem of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.950
startups, it is actually a
very large market of Arab

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.570
speakers around the region.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.490
350 million.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.230
Their location is just
unbelievable, North, South,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.980
and East and West.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.170
And so, in some respects, it's
not surprising that in that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.990
kind of locale, even with the
political instability,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.970
something incredibly powerful
will happen when people have

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.210
access to computing technology
and can begin to bottom up, do

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.560
things in terms of innovation
and problem solving, which

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.970
would have been unimaginable
in the narrative

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.570
that we have there.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.540
My journey, just quickly to
share it with you, I've run

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.910
several internet companies.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.760
I've outsourced technology
to pretty much every

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.170
corner of the Earth.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.830
I've traveled all
over the world.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.920
And I've even been to the Middle
East as a tourist.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.920
But my narrative has been so
strong in terms of one view of

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.360
the Middle East, and the Arab
world in particular, that it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.110
really did not fit my thinking
that, in the early days of my

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.340
journey, Mubarak's Egypt or
Saudi Arabia would really have

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.750
a technology ecosystem at all.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.385
I knew about Israel.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:35.500
I'd outsourced to Israel.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.900
But I just couldn't get it in
my mind, despite all my

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.060
experience in outsourcing
technology to so many parts of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.050
the world, that, of course, it
would be happening in the Arab

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.120
world as well.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.960
In 2010, I was invited by some
very dear friends of mine

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.550
who'd been talking about the
ecosystem to one of the first

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.780
large gatherings of startups in
the Middle East, or in the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.460
Arab world, called celebration
of entrepreneurship.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.850
And, in many respects, my view
of the world I think of as

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.260
before and after that event.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.460
Because it was 2,400 young
people, from North Africa to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.190
Yemen, 2,000 person
waiting list.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.900
Nobody really wanted to
talk about Israel.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.090
Nobody cared about Obama's
Cairo speech.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.490
These are guys you
know, right?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.620
And women that you know.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.250
I mean, that's the other thing
that surprises everyone.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.480
Almost every gathering that I
go to, and now studies have

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.440
backed it up, 35%,
40% are women.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.420
And you'd feel completely at
home in these events, and in

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.040
the problem solving, and the
challenges that they were

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.090
thinking about.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.170
And it just made me wake up to
my own stuckedness in the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.240
narrative that I have
and made me start to

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.950
think about the world.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.270
I expanded that trip and started
traveling around

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.160
Cairo, and Amman, and other
places where I'd

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.580
heard it was real.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.980
And I just saw it over, and
over, and over again.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.350
And I got called back to be a
judge of a startup competition

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.570
in January of 2011.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.510
And again, from all over Egypt,
these amazing young

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.790
people building amazing
things.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.110
In fact, one of my favorites
was a guy who kept talking

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.070
about this great, highest paid--
he said it was the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.200
highest paid weather
app in the world.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.510
And I looked down at my, forgive
me, I have an iPad.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.690
But I looked down at my iPad.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.110
And I had downloaded it six
month previous, and had no

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.140
idea that it was 30 young people
in Alexandria, Egypt

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.696
who had build it.

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:08.960
And I'd paid $0.95 for
it, or what have you.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.470
But when that was over,
I went to Damascus.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.910
And when I was there, I saw,
again, these unbelievable

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.500
young people.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.770
And that's when Ben Ali of
Tunisia left Tunisia and left

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.670
the country.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.670
And it just changed the
entire dynamic.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.720
And when I got back to Cairo
to fly back to the United

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.080
States, I could just see all
young people are saying, this

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.710
is something big.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.030
This is bigger than us.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.910
And of course, every one of
the entrepreneurs I met, a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.320
week later, were out in Tahrir
Square, changing everything

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.710
that happened overall.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.200
So that's it.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.660
I was hooked.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.170
It's a different thing
about the world.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.490
And it's an obvious place where
the world is going.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.770
And the caliber of the kids that
are building stuff in a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.060
world where the ecosystem, which
I'll come back to in a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.430
moment, is really a bottom
up ecosystem.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.880
I mean, the infrastructure
of education, government

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.940
supporting this, is, to
be kind, the minimus.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.070
The headwinds that these young

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.840
entrepreneurs are really important.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.850
But again, if you have
ubiquity of access to

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.600
broadband technology,
mobile devices, you

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.080
just build stuff anyway.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.910
And in every country that I've
seen, they've done it in the

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.430
most powerful way.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.470
The kind of startups that I've
seen, I'd bucket them in the

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.760
book into three categories.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.130
And they'd all be familiar to
you based on the things that

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.880
you use, overall.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.700
The first is also
very familiar in

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.690
emerging markets generally.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.620
I call them the improvisers.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.550
They're often called, elsewhere,
copycats, which I

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.280
think is uncharitable because
I think these companies have

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.440
done an amazing amount of effort
not just to merely take

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.930
that which has worked in the
West and bring it here, but

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.970
they're incredibly sensitive to
the dynamics of the region

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.170
and unique needs
to it overall.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.660
But as you know, Baidu in
China, and e-commerce

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.620
companies in Brazil,
and everywhere.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.800
It's not surprising that in
risky environments, people

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.760
take something that's already
worked and ameliorate some of

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.180
the risk by customizing
it to the market.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.500
So Matu was a Yahoo of the
Middle East, which was bought

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.700
by Yahoo for almost $200 million
a couple of years ago.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.340
Souk.com, MarkaVIP are these
juggernauts of e-commerce

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.300
which would look very familiar
to you, to Amazon and that

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.190
kind of stuff.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.280
There's a WebMD of
the Middle East.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.580
There are probably 20 of them.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.810
And they're doing
very, very well

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.770
they've raised some capital.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.455
They've been very successful.

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:01.880
And they've been scaling
in powerful

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.470
ways across the region.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.580
The second category of people
that really have almost blown

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.040
me away personally, as much as
from looking at it from a

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.350
business perspective, I call
the problem solvers.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.390
And these are folks who look
at these infrastructure

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.600
challenges, and where guys my
age or older say, oh, it's

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.660
going to take a generation to
fix it, and the governments

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.600
are too fucked up to figure
out how to do it, they're

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.530
like, we'll solve it.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.140
It is an area that we're in
that I see in startups who

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.600
pitch me here.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.090
And it's something that's
amazing to watch in emerging

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.440
growth markets, which is to
look at infrastructure

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.580
problems and software
problems.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.980
So traffic is terrible.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.196
People say, well, you've
got to fix the roads.

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:38.640
Well, you've got to
fix the roads.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.550
But that doesn't mean that
they're not ways, like

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.000
navigation devices and crowd
sharing, that allow people to

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.380
navigate traffic the way they
never could before.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.900
Garbage and recycling is in its
infancy, to be generous.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.580
And again, amazing young people
from all over the

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.410
region who are saying, I've got
a great idea to build a

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.010
platform where people
know where to

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.990
deliver their garbage.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.670
And I'll figure out a way
to send to China.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.710
Because then I'll make
some money on it.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.070
And we can get the garbage clean
while building a really

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.970
great green company.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.220
We can do amazing things and
solve that problem overall.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.190
As you can imagine, there's
just amazing

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.290
amounts of sun there.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.550
So solar, there are unbelievable
ideas.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.750
Not just big infrastructure in
solar, but really kind of

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.970
basic, small use, like in
agriculture and cities, which

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.830
are really very powerful.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.860
And I'm going to come back
to that in a second.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.930
But it's very moving.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.360
Probably the most moving of all,
because it is, in many

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.080
respects, the biggest challenge
of that the region

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.240
faces, is an education.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.900
I was very surprised to find,
when I was over there, that,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.960
actually, a significant
amount of

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.789
money is spent on education.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.950
But it is almost invariably
the wrong education--

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.559
very heavy on rote learning.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.110
Particularly in the poorer
parts of some of these

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.450
regions, there could be a
classroom of 70 kids with not

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.670
really any discipline.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.750
They're all taught to tests, but
the tests are pretty much

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.400
for the 20th century, not for
the 21st century and all.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.000
So this is a very, very
significant infrastructure

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.230
issue that pays a multiplier
price, as you

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.730
guys know so well.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.560
And again, if you're in
your 20s, you say,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.480
well, that's terrible.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.700
So I'm going to hack
the system.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.440
And the number, probably in
Egypt, 15% of the startups

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.130
I've seen have been some form
of use of video or other

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.980
social capacities, even at the
texting level, where people

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.800
could help tutor each other,
share each other course

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.680
curricular, and put
it up online.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.540
And it's just been unbelievable
to watch.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.120
And it's getting amazing
traction because Egypt alone,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.480
in response to the problems with
education, Egypt alone is

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.240
somewhere between a $2 and $3
billion tutoring country-- $2

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.800
to $3 billion.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.220
And as you can imagine, most
of the people who are

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.040
forwarding the tutoring are
pretty well heeled.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.190
Well, all of the sudden, you
have these Khan Academies in

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.490
Arabic that are springing up all
over that are really not

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.880
charging anything for it.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.230
And instead of the elite being
able to get tutoring to get

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.700
around a lousy system, if they
haven't already sent the kids

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.520
abroad somewhere, you now have
anybody, anywhere, who can get

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.070
ahold of it, share it, and do
really kinds of interesting

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.620
things with it.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.990
And so it doesn't solve things
overnight, but most people

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.820
don't focus on it.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.390
And it's just a very powerful,
powerful thing.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.190
Third thing, the third
group of companies I

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.210
call the global players.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.370
And they not unlike
the app guy that I

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.450
described to you before.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.020
They know, as you all know,
we all know, the world is

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.330
literally a click away, which
means that, literally, women

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.540
at home who have little crafts
business that they used to

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.180
sell within their neighborhood
are now shipping

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.560
stuff around the world.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.690
And larger, scalable businesses
are creating

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.850
really, really interesting
enterprises that allow them to

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.050
do manufacturing in Asia or sell
things on platforms all

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.595
over the world.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:26.050
And so I've talked a lot about
difference of them as I've

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.510
been going about over
the last few months.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.850
But there's this wonderful woman
from Beirut who is just

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.020
an awesome swimmer.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.030
I mean just like college
grade college swimmer.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.450
And it drove her crazy that
there really was not a great

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.220
way, while she was training,
to watch her vital signs.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.060
Like most of the stuff, if any
of you guys are swimmers, you

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.000
know this, still now a lot of
ways you can do that is

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.780
devices that were for running,
then they adapted them to

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.570
being waterproof.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.380
But if you're swimming, who
the hell wants to look at

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.030
their wrist to see
what's going on.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.350
So she-- forgive the analogy--
but she build kind of a Google

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.980
Glass of goggles.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.700
So it's a very smooth, very easy
thing, very streamlined.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.260
And you could look up to it
and you can see your vital

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.320
signs in real time as it's
measuring off of your temple.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.880
She's being manufactured
in China.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.220
And it's big distribution
contracts now in the United

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.870
States, all done
out of Beirut.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.290
She thought a globally
from the beginning.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.610
She had a very local
need as a swimmer.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.330
But she immediately said that,
in the age we live in now, we

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.540
can become global players in
very, very interesting ways.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.880
I want to not blow smoke at you,
as generous hosts, and as

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.160
a shareholder, I admire
you guys greatly.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:30.400
But I can tell you that in these
ecosystems, the value of

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.730
big technology players to have
an enormous impact is

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.260
unbelievable because, as I
suggested to you before, the

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.790
ecosystems really are still
unbelievably nascent.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.340
They really are happening
autodidact, right?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.910
There are all these wonderful,
wonderful, and some of them

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.470
enormous, conferences that
happen that gather people.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.960
There are startup competitions
all the time.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.950
There are startup weekend
all over the place.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.390
The last Startup Weekend in the
Middle East, last weekend,

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.590
or the weekend before
was in Gaza--

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.460
Gaza.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.770
Entrepreneurs in Gaza cut
through all the stuff that

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.940
they're dealing with and
said, we're going

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940
to host this thing.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.690
We're going to invite some
unbelievable entrepreneurs

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.130
from Jordan.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.360
They are going to come here, and
we're going to make this

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.790
whole thing happen.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.300
250 young people in Gaza showed
up to Startup Weekend.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.170
So it's happening.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.560
The education institutions are
beginning that significant

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.120
investment in technology and
infrastructure, particularly

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.760
in the Gulf.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.420
Entrepreneurship programs
are building.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.820
So there's something
in motion.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.520
But there's a ways to go.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.790
So when you have a group like
Google over there, it just

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.060
makes an unbelievable
difference.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.310
An a lot of tech companies,
now, are doing this.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.520
Though first and foremost,
they're obviously a sales

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.820
operation, which is completely
understandable.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.430
But when you look at Google, if
you look at Paypal, if you

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.920
look at LinkedIn, they're all
doing what they're doing for

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.650
their businesses.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.130
But they're saying, man, if this
ecosystem grows, we're

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.770
all going to help each other in
unbelievably powerful ways.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.280
So Google Egypt was
a mine blower.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.420
The guy who runs it is just an
amazing guy, very decent man,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.220
very creative.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.040
And they put together, two years
ago, this thing they

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.380
called Ebda2, which was the
first major startup

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.580
competition put on by a great
technology company anywhere in

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.570
the Middle East.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.420
And this wasn't just a startup
competition, right?

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.040
They either bought or rented
buses and drove all over Egypt

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.550
to effectively evangelize about
entrepreneurship, and

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.740
startup, and tech.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.630
So a lot of times, what happens
is people go to Dubai,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.040
or people go to Amman, or they
go to Cairo, and Alexandria is

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.760
an amazing thing.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.200
But no one goes to Tanta, which
is actually an amazing

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.510
engineering town, kind of a
little town two or three hours

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.160
outside, let alone to other
parts of the rural areas.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.720
And the team at Google Egypt
literally just got in buses,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.630
went around, had thousands of
people who came up with ideas

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.100
and competed.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.840
And they had a big event in
Cairo and picked 5 or 10, I

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.800
can't remember, finalists.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.015
And the winner, who got $250,000
or something, and

00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:41.190
that's a lot of money for
the ecosystem there.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.330
So it's about the money.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:42.975
It's about awareness.

00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:44.890
It's about helping
each other out.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.500
It's about bringing people
together in physical ways.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.900
And the multiplier effect of
that is hard to describe.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.600
But you watch it happen.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.880
And it's just wonderful.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.230
It's a mind blow.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.150
Investment money is still
pretty nascent.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.740
I mean, the Middle East there's
been a tradition for

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.400
some time of sorts of private
equity-- in other words, a

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.130
cash flow business of a
certain size that you

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.170
can put money in.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.260
There have been a few venture
capital firms

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.975
that have been there.

00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:07.820
There have been some Western
venture capital firms,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.210
certainly, who have dipped their
toes in Istanbul as a

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.470
platform for the region, but
others who are looking at it

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.490
in very powerful ways.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.190
But, excitingly, in the last
two years, there has really

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.850
been a rise in angel investing--
so really, really

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.850
early stage stuff.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.380
You've got kind of the
late exit stuff.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.110
You've got the early,
early stuff.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.191
What they're really struggling
on now is what we, here in the

00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:28.140
states, call the A round.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.730
So in other words, a company
may raise a couple hundred

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.160
thousands dollars.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.420
They are starting to kick ass.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.710
Things are looking good.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.460
Now they need that one the two,
what would for us would

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.790
be three to five, maybe
one to two over there.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.780
And where do you go?

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.580
And that's depressing if you're
ready to take off and

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.580
you have that thing.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.060
And so they're coming.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.590
They are building.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.700
I know several multi $100
million funds that are being

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.110
raised solely for this.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.960
They are a lot of main
companies, like

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.020
mobile players and all.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.460
Vodafone is an example of this,
is actually funding now

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.780
in the early stage, but
moving to the A round.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.430
So it's all happening in really,
really interesting

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.040
ways, despite the chaos that
is also very real and very

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.080
tragic at the same time.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.190
That chaos cannot
be understated.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.390
These amazing entrepreneurs
face real headwinds, and I

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.850
would suggest that any
entrepreneur in an emerging

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.970
growth market faces
headwinds, right?

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.970
It's not easy to do a
startup in India.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.660
It's not easy, lord knows, to
do a startup and then to

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.340
repatriate capital in China.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.310
Friends of mine who are
investors in Brazil have armed

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.420
guards when they go
to the movies.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.870
I mean, emerging markets are
not for the faint of heart.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.190
But as we all know that there's
an incredible rise of

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.880
middle class and an amazing
ability of technology for

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.910
people to see how each other
live and to share different

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.620
ideas and collaborate
in different ways.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.040
It's not going back either.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.930
So it's just a different kind
of mental outlook to the

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.890
challenges, knowing full well
that the top 10 guys, the guys

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.400
who are playing the 20th century
rules, like Syria, are

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.190
squashing what is really a
generational opportunity.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.190
So both are true.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.180
Both are to be considered.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.960
But I think we, in the West,
tend to think about the bad

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.980
one, not about this hopeful
one as much.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.000
I'll close with a very
interesting thing that, when

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.270
Benghazi happened--

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.520
our consulate was attacked,
and Chris was killed, and

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.250
three other people were killed,
and Cairo embassy was

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.880
attacked, I got a phone call
from a "New York Times"

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.050
journalist, who effectively
said to me, OK,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.640
you're done, right?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.900
I mean, you are going to stop
talking about this.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.910
There's no way this is
ever going to happen.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.330
And I said to him-- this is a
very smart, well-traveled guy,

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.440
knows more about the Middle
East than I'll know--

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.710
and I said, how many
people were

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.340
involved in those attacks?

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.550
And he said, I don't know, maybe
2,000, 3,000 people.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.830
In a point of fact, it was
probably about 200.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.400
And I said, look, I mean, these
attacks were terrible.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.370
I knew the ambassador.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.930
These are terrible.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.810
But four months earlier, I was
in Beirut for the MIT startup

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.790
competition.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.590
And it was 5,000 or 6,000
companies from all over Middle

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.150
East, 40% of them were women,
that represented 14,000 or

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.140
15,000 entrepreneurs.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.160
And there ideas are
unbelievable.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.100
And he just kind of froze
and said, well this is--

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.530
there's something else
that's going on.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.090
And so in many respects, as I
thank you a lot for spending

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.150
time on what is a counter
narrative, I also know that

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.805
you know that this is where
the world is going.

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.275
That again, we know, in three
years, there's going to be a

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.920
lot more technology in a lot
more people's hands.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.420
And the ramifications on
politics, on culture, on

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.349
society, on debates about
religion, about debates about

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.510
women's roles in society, and
about how people seize their

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.910
economic future, I don't think
it's ever going to go back.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.090
Thank you for listening.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:30.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.850
JONAH BERGER: I would love if
you have any questions or,

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.420
more importantly, any thoughts
from your own

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.534
experiences, or--

00:17:35.534 --> 00:17:37.160
AUDIENCE: So it's been
demonstrated in the past few

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.460
years that social technology
in particular can be very

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.702
disruptive to government
operations.

00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:44.040
In Egypt, we saw that
with Twitter.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.720
I was just wondering, as you've
seen entrepreneurship

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.140
develop in these regions, is
there any sort of effort by

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.470
the governments to stymie it, to
get in the way of it, or to

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.290
make it not as easy
to do stuff?

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.032
JONAH BERGER: So you're, in a
lot of respects, hitting what

00:17:56.032 --> 00:17:59.860
is maybe the most important
dichotomy that one sees here,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.820
and, I would suggest, across
emerging markets, which is

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.890
that, I think, at the end of the
day, so many governments

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.260
and regimes who rose in the days
of consolidating wealth

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.740
and power to a small minority
people in order to keep

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.980
control are trying to figure
out what do you do is

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.260
something which is so, by
definition, bottom up.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.910
And to compound the point that
you're making, they really

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.910
think about it is a political
tool first and foremost.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.620
So their idea is, if we can
just contain enough of the

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.660
free flow of political stuff, so
we can stay in power, then

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.770
all is going to be fine.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.325
And maybe a few good things
will happen about and

00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:30.990
everything else.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.180
What so many of them miss, in my
view, is that it's not just

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.670
about the freedom of speech,
but this is the economic

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.620
force, platform,
of the future.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.440
So that what you're doing is not
only constraining voice,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.120
and trying to divvy out economic
gain, you're actually

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.330
constraining the entire way
folks compete in other parts

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.280
in the world.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.120
And so folks--

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.350
I mean, I've had amazing,
interesting conversations with

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.420
folks who are much smarter
than I'll ever

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.930
be in emerging markets.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.800
And they'll say, maybe,
governments can

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.110
pull that off, right?

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.790
Look, when I was in business
school, Tienanmen Square just

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.950
happened a couple years
before that.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.700
Everyone said, look.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.090
That's it.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.490
They're done.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.030
China will never be
anything now.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.970
If you don't have political
liberalism, you'll never have

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.620
economic growth.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.020
I mean, that was the
conventional wisdom then.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:18.960
And obviously, despite their
political stuff, something

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.520
happened there.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.000
So right, a lot of people
said maybe you

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.440
can have dual things.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.930
My own belief is that you can.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.170
This is not say a
paradox at all.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.050
That you have an ability
in doing this

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.780
to constraint stuff.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.000
It's one thing, maybe, if you're
a country driving 150

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.380
miles an hour to think, maybe,
you can take it down to 130 at

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.980
least for a period of time,
in control, maybe.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.720
But the countries I'm dealing
with, a lot of them are going

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.210
40 miles an hour.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.190
And if you take a generation
out, then I don't know

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.600
how you catch up.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.950
So it's an unbelievably profound
choice compounded by

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.820
the fact that this generation
is more

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.590
mobile than ever before.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.740
So at some point, they'll
say enough.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.530
No mas.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.790
The only thing that I can tell
you, despite everything I've

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.910
said, Syria is a perfect
example of this.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.620
I just know literally
dozens of these

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.970
entrepreneurs who got out.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.970
They are in Beirut now.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.920
Or they are in Dubai.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.850
And they can't wait
to go home.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.760
And they just figure, the
governments will mess with us,

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.900
but we'll always find
a work around.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.210
And so that's why I
remain hopeful.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.870
But your question is the
central question that

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.450
constrains us in ways that
are-- it's a missed

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.780
opportunity is the thing
that's so frustrating.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.570
AUDIENCE: Are there any leaders
in the Middle East, in

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.370
government, that you found are
more open to this idea?

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.060
It seems like Amman has been
developing somewhat as a tech

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.610
hub, and King Abdullah is
somewhat more open.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.610
But at the same time, it
seems like a facade.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.880
And I'm just wondering,
traveling, do you see that

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.530
there is, even if it's not
established leaders, that

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.630
there are people in power
that are looking to this

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.520
opportunity, and to actually
embrace it?

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.100
JONAH BERGER: I think the answer
is fundamentally no.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.960
The King of Jordan is a very
remarkable guy and has been

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.470
backing the information
technology, from an

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.710
infrastructure basis, for
many, many years.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.360
The talent that you see in
Amman, and the incubators

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.950
there will blow you away.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.010
And you can't take it away
from his government in

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.630
thinking about that.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.960
But at the same time, Jordan
passed some pretty tough news

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.450
rights and freedom of speech
rights stuff on the internet

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.440
that had a chilling effect on
a lot of young people there,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.920
like I didn't think you were
going to do this, and now

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.210
you're doing it too.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.970
Dubai has all the

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.240
infrastructure and all the wealth.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.090
E-commerce is going to be an
enormous opportunity in the

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.680
Middle East in the next
couple of years.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.050
And Dubai is a fantastic hub for
that, logistics as much as

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:22.950
anything else.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.800
They've got their internet
crackdown stuff as well.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.610
And so what I would say to you,
at least in the case of

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.970
the Emirates, at least in the
case of the King of Jordan, I

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.220
think they're doing
a balancing act.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.150
They know that there's
something here.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.250
This is not just lip service.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.780
I don't believe it's
just lip service.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.200
But they are in a tough
neighborhood, and they're

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.010
trying to balance that
in different ways.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.280
And history will tell whether
they can pull off that balance

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.760
in a very, very powerful way.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.820
But this is a golden opportunity
for some leader to

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.350
step up, and relate to this
generation, and see what

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.290
happens here.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.970
The new head in Cutter and
all, you've got a whole

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.060
generation of people in their
30s and 40s coming to power.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.480
They're going to be
making choices.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.685
But I don't have a crystal
ball on it.

00:22:00.685 --> 00:22:02.840
Can I ask you guys a question?

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.980
If I can cold call on it,
why are you here?

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.330
I mean, I'm thrilled to see
you, but why are you here?

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.800
You've got nothing
better to do?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.310
Get a break?

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.810
Or startups in the
Middle East?

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.927
I mean, why are you here?

00:22:13.927 --> 00:22:15.300
AUDIENCE: It's interesting.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.552
JONAH BERGER: Why?

00:22:17.552 --> 00:22:18.635
AUDIENCE: Well, I might be a
little [INAUDIBLE] but I'm on

00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:20.500
the localization team
here, and I

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.740
studied in Amman in college.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.500
So it's something I'm
very interested in.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.210
JONAH BERGER: So you've
met these people.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.162
You know.

00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:29.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was actually
wondering, because I studied

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.865
there, I went to University of
Jordan for a time in college.

00:22:33.865 --> 00:22:36.800
And most of the people I
interacted with came from

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.132
incredibly wealthy backgrounds
who are in university.

00:22:39.132 --> 00:22:43.520
At most of these conferences are
people college educated,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.725
in the university background?

00:22:44.725 --> 00:22:47.890
Or are you really seeing more
of the common people getting

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.822
engaged in want to pursue it?

00:22:49.822 --> 00:22:51.560
JONAH BERGER: You know, as
across the board, and, I

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.200
think, I can't prove this, too,
somewhat chronological.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.480
Meaning it is not surprising
that young people have been

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.220
gotten a very good education and
have had the resources to

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.900
experiment with technology.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.800
And I think, as importantly, if
parents who are willing to

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.180
let them take risks so they know
where things are going,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.180
is very powerful.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.350
Someone who read my book said,
main, did all these guys study

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.830
in the West?

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.860
And in fact, I interviewed
over 200 startups.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.840
And I could only write about 30
of them without losing the

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.940
audience totally.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.080
And of that, probably only a
third of them studied in the

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.630
West, meaning that they really
were doing things on the

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.480
ground a very powerful ways.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.930
So what to me is so exciting at
these gatherings is you do

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.760
see the wealthy.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.600
You do see Western educated.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.140
And you see everybody
from everywhere who

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.450
is with their devices.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.810
And they are like,
this is cool.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.310
We can make it happen.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.810
So I believe that you'll
see some action from

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:36.960
folks who have that.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960
And then they start
giving it back.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.830
I love this one great
entrepreneur Samih Toukan.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.210
Did you meet him at all when
you were in Jordan,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.090
or hear about him?

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.110
So he was the founder of
Maktoob, which was the first

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.370
big exit over there, the Yahoo
of the Middle East.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.460
And what did he do?

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.360
Which has happened
100 times here?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.520
He could've taken his
money and run.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.675
He could have done
what ever he did.

00:23:51.675 --> 00:23:53.260
He formed something
called Jabbar.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.450
A lot of the best entrepreneurs
from that

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.460
company went out to form
other companies.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.510
Souk.com used to
be part of it.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.260
And with Jabbar, he's funding
startups all over the place.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.940
And the stars of his management
team are now

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.850
starting other stuff.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.840
And they, trust me, they
come from everywhere.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.290
So that's the cycle that if, in
fact, it happens at scale,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.066
I think changes everything.

00:24:15.066 --> 00:24:17.020
Why are you here?

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.565
AUDIENCE: I have two
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:20.565 --> 00:24:25.750
One was I read about the stuff
at week end happen in Gaza, a

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.195
really interesting
article about it.

00:24:27.195 --> 00:24:29.845
It was the first time I
considered startups as a path

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:31.720
to peace and a path
to creating a

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.520
more progressive world.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.760
I've always seen startups as
a way of allowing people--

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.535
like, the way that we do
startups now, a way of

00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:40.730
allowing anybody to
create a business.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.610
But not necessarily, I've
always seen social

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.200
entrepreneurship, but never
something that has quite such

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.080
a big political change
as well.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.958
So I'm really interested
to find out your

00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.200
viewpoints on that.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.820
And then, the other thing was,
I've often found that,

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.890
generally, the best ideas come
from desperate times.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.700
I think now, like, in the West,
I think everyone, akin

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.990
to sort of like empires,
everyone has just gotten used

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.100
to being a certain way.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.111
And it's only when, life is at
its worst that actually real

00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:10.520
innovation happens.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:10.910
JONAH BERGER: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.470
AUDIENCE: I definitely think
that, like, as you were saying

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.050
this, I literally just wanted
a list of all the great

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.690
startups that you were talking
about, I wanted to go through

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.980
each of them and see all these
things that we could bring in,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.900
whether it's bringing to Google,
or starting, I always

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.750
wanted to start my own
company as well.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.380
So the idea of taking these
great ideas and, I think, one

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.020
of the things you pointed out
was a lot of these companies

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.820
beforehand had taken ideas
from the West and had

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.780
localized them to a point
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.280
I think now we're starting to
get to point where there's so

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.480
much great startups that we're
going to see a reversal of

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.425
people taking the great ideas
from these emerging markets

00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:47.780
and starting to move
back over.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.290
JONAH BERGER: You've asked so
many unbelievably exactly

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.960
right questions about some of
the stuff that's going on.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.780
And by the way, in the book, and
I think we're handing them

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.750
out to you guys on your way
out, I have a list in my--

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.950
I have very long people
criticize me, I have a very

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.010
long list of thank yous.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.380
I actually listed every company
that I spoke with,

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.820
whether they are in
the book or not.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.130
So it's actually a very easy
guide for you to look at least

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.310
some of the-- and remember, it's
only a fraction of the

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.010
folks that are out there.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.520
And I have friends who are
pissed off because they're not

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.140
in there at all.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.360
I mean, that's kind of
the nature of things.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.950
And that's my fault,
not theirs at all.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.080
So I think it's a very
powerful thing.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.570
And I think the ideas that you
do independently, or to think

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.660
about your role in Google, is
very, very profound here

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.380
because it's, the impact, as I
suggested before, is great.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.570
The second just quick thing that
I would say is I actually

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.670
spent-- it was some of the more
interesting interviews

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.770
that I did, I've interviewed my
buddies in Silicon Valley.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.455
Because I effectively wanted
to ask them, I'm like, you

00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:36.380
invented this stuff, for all
intents and purposes.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.670
How are you thinking about the
world for the next 10 years,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.350
as opposed to last 10 years?

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.510
And what was amazing to me is
that a lot of them are still

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.340
thinking about it in a framework
of the last 10

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.890
years, meaning, well, we'll
invest in an emerging market

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.610
if the market cap is so big.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.900
We'll lose our ass in China.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.260
But it's so big, we've got to
be there, so we'll be there.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.390
Second, we definitely are going
to outsource cheaply.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.300
And OK, fine.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.130
I mean, that's fine.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.600
But then I said, do you
understand that you have a new

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.860
generation of folks who are
now innovating, right?

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.590
And they're not just innovating
for local markets.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.570
I mean, sometimes they are.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.610
Sometimes they are doing stuff
which are very, very local.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.310
And they are going to be very
nice little businesses, and

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.620
they're making impact.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.590
Other stuff will be 350
million people.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.190
Other stuff will be emerging
market to emerging market.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.240
And we're going to be using
stuff made in Mina in the next

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.130
three years and just think about
it as a way of course.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.320
So how are you thinking
about that?

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.430
And often, the answer was, well,
if they're that good,

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.960
and that innovative, we'll
convince them to come to

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.160
Silicon Valley--

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.270
which is a very 10 years
back kind of a thing.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.680
Look, Silicon Valley, it's easy
to try to poke fun at it.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.075
But it's an amazing, I mean,
it's, like, in world history,

00:27:37.075 --> 00:27:39.130
like Florence, I mean there
have not been a lot of

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.310
geographic locations that have
just put together this network

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.820
effect of unbelievable
talent, right?

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.040
So I don't want to-- with all
the hubris that we also know

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.700
about, I don't want to take
away one iota of that.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.365
But the world is changing.

00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:51.780
A lot of people ask me, what is
the Silicon Valley of the

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.345
Middle East, and I saw, it's
the wrong question.

00:27:53.345 --> 00:27:54.950
There's one Silicon Valley.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.880
Now there are going to be lots
and lots of hubs of really,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.260
really interesting innovation.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.180
How are we going
to get into it?

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.480
How are we going
to support it?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.750
And how are we going
to co-author it?

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.560
This is, to me, in some
respects, the most important

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.440
thing because if you're over
there, no one liked me for our

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.640
government, OK?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.700
But they loved Steve Jobs.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.950
They love Sergei and Larry.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.890
And they'd love to connect with
them, but as co-authors.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.580
They don't want anybody patting
them on the head.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.860
I mean, the most offensive
line--

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.220
and this is usually coming
from the government.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.520
Every so often, I've heard
private equity investors use

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.520
it, but not anymore.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.340
But they'll say the greatest
American export is

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.810
entrepreneurship.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.550
And the folks are like, are
you out of your mind?

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.400
We've been entrepreneurs
for 10,000 years.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.890
I mean, so there is an
engagement of co-authorship

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.250
of, you know lots of stuff
I'm never going to know.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.540
And it's not just about
your markets.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.346
I mean, think about it .

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:45.180
These are, as I said before,
mobile first societies.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.310
Do you think maybe they've got a
few things to teach us about

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.130
mobile that we're not
thinking about?

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.000
So it is a real sense
of co-authorship.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.170
It's really a sense that we have
things that we can bring

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.230
to bear that might of use.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.670
You've got things to
bring to bear.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.940
And now we're two seconds
away on a device.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.600
Let's see if we can do stuff.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.850
And people are beginning
to get it.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.680
So I don't know if you guys have
done a stuff with McClure

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.810
and the 500 startup people.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.870
But he does what he does.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.390
And the [INAUDIBLE]
do what they do.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.690
It's really interesting.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.890
But he also has this thing
called geeks on a plane, where

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.630
they just get people to get on a
plane and go see other parts

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.420
of the world.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.590
His next trip, in November,
is going to be

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.480
in the Middle East.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.070
That never would've been talked
about two years ago.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.500
AUDIENCE: So you've spoken a lot
about, like, these are the

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.990
questions that are coming up.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.880
How do you envisage the world,
the Silicon Valley v2, of the

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.020
very fact of like a world that
is made of, almost, most

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.120
people will become self-made
people working in either a

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.840
startups that they created or
are working on a small startup

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.190
with a small group of people.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.032
How do you view the world being
with everybody having

00:29:46.032 --> 00:29:48.750
the power at their laptop to
start and do whatever they

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.760
want to learn whatever
they want?

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.200
JONAH BERGER: So I'm old
enough to appreciate

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.820
revolutions and also appreciate
entropy, right?

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.800
I mean, we're still
sitting here.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.090
And not to take a shot at
YouTube, who does amazing

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.690
stuff in the region by the--
we're still talking about 30

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.000
second ads in front of
three minute videos.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.830
I mean, stuff doesn't,
everything, change overnight.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.040
So Silicon Valley is
going to be a force

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.270
in any kind of sense.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.610
And the way they do business
will be highly successful for

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.860
many women and men in many,
many different ways.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.510
The amount of innovation,
because of the ecosystem that

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.260
is the United States, isn't
going away any time soon, no

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.680
matter what people
like to say.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.670
So there are things that exist
now that are going to exist,

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.550
and if you and I have a beer
three years from now.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.070
But what is also going to happen
is that we're going to

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.890
be shocked by innovation that
comes from different

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.930
parts of the world.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.110
And we're going to be shocked
when, all of the sudden, these

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.080
products are serving 2 billion
people markets, and it has

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.110
nothing to do with us at all.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.780
And so, again, it's not unlike
what describing what I said--

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.840
both will be true, but the
opportunity lies, I would

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.930
suggest, much more
interestingly, mutually, in

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.180
the second part of it.

00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:55.170
Why are you here?

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.612
Why are you here?

00:30:56.612 --> 00:30:57.968
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.968 --> 00:31:00.576
AUDIENCE: That's a
good question.

00:31:00.576 --> 00:31:04.950
My longtime interest and
graduate study research all

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.540
had to do with forced migrants
and displaced

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.746
people in East Africa.

00:31:09.746 --> 00:31:14.320
And actually, have had to do
with, basically, the effect of

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.030
being displaced on a creative
music process.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.890
JONAH BERGER: Wow, meaning
what exactly?

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.470
More creativity because of it?

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:28.140
AUDIENCE: So my dissertation was
on, basically, Palestinian

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:35.515
hip-hop music and comparing
musicians in Gaza and the West

00:31:35.515 --> 00:31:37.915
Bank, as well as Israeli
citizens, and

00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:38.622
Palestinians in a sense.

00:31:38.622 --> 00:31:45.080
So the 48s, as well as a band
that were British citizens and

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.700
Palestinians.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:53.130
And analyzing different bands,
basically, the limitations on

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.780
being able to collaborate due
to physical limitations--

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.815
bands not actually being able
to travel, being stopped at

00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:02.080
the border, and then the role of
the internet being able to

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.410
promote their own music and the
idea of the end of music

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:11.120
as a way to promote peace over
violence as a way of

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.380
expression.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.840
So through that, I also have
an interest in how being

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.380
displaced, or being a refugees,
in particular, the

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.610
setting of a refugee camp, and
what can be done [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.490
There's a lot of interesting
things happening right now in

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.500
refugee camps in terms of
learning trades, and

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.830
education, how that happens,
limitations on resources.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.220
And I'm interested in, for
entrepreneurs who are

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.635
displaced, and are in those
situations, Syrian refugees,

00:32:42.635 --> 00:32:44.360
how it has an influence on
their creative process.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.350
Does it stop it?

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.710
How do they continue to, in
particular, I don't think

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.440
there's many out there.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.650
But I'd be interested in
startups ideas in refugee

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.610
camps themselves.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.468
How can you, in very limited
time constrained, space

00:32:56.468 --> 00:33:01.476
constrained settings have a
productive environment that

00:33:01.476 --> 00:33:03.640
also sustains people?

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.800
JONAH BERGER: You guys have just
asked the best questions

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.920
and had the most amazing
experiences.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.766
I'm blown away.

00:33:07.766 --> 00:33:10.630
Just a couple of observations,
for what it's worth.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.960
And it ties, one part question
that you asked, and I don't

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.850
think I addressed it, because
sometimes this is a

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:15.490
particularly--

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.290
you know, I live on an airplane,
but I'm based in

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.110
Washington.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.860
So a lot of times, people
ask me, is this part

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.760
of the peace process?

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.000
Or could it be part of
the peace process?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.050
And I come at it a little bit
differently, meaning that,

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.740
when you're able to see a
future, and attain a future,

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.690
if you're able to sit with
someone or be connected to

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.880
someone, and you'll see that
you share much more than

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.240
you're opposed to.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.590
As to, as I said before,
particularly in the case of

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.470
entrepreneurs, but I'm sure it
must be the case with artists,

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.160
when you speak a language which
is unique to yourself by

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.740
the activity that you
do, peace will come.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.300
You are at peace with yourself,
and you're at peace

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.280
with the people around you, and
you can see a future that

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.350
you can actualize, you tend to
be a more peaceful person.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.500
And so I don't look at
it is as a thing

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.070
to be jammed through.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.810
And I can tell you that,
particularly now, I know some

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.760
great Palestinian entrepreneurs
who could

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.920
probably benefit by connections
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.650
because of technology,
skill in Israel,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.150
is just a mind blow.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.400
But it just, all of the sudden,
the very act of that,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.290
right now, today, almost
politicizes it.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.580
And they're like, we're
about building.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.870
No politics now, right?

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:11.440
No religion.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.389
No politics.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:13.170
Let's build.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.850
But that doesn't mean that, one
day, it couldn't open up

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.199
in a very exponential way
as people get to do it.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.659
So that's sort of the way that
I think about it in terms of

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:20.909
the framing of it.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.130
I call to your attention, if
you write it down on your

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.960
mobile device or whatever, this
amazing woman named Nina

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.520
Curley, C-U-R-L-E-Y, is the
editor in chief of another

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.800
amazing enterprise called
Wanbda.com, which if you guys

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.820
don't go to, you should go.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.449
Wanbda.com--

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:39.889
and the founder is a great
Lebanese entrepreneur who gets

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:41.710
ticked off when I say it, but
it's the best way I could do

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.870
it by analogy-- is sort
of like Tech Crunch.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.380
I mean, it's like the definitive
portal of content

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.550
of what's happening in the
ecosystem over there.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.670
But it's much more than that.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.000
It's a social community where
people can share ideas and

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.389
best practices, the resources
that you can get there.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.540
They hold events, usually
smaller unconferenced events,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.500
or they have this thing called
mix and mentor where they

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.940
bring together people who have
been there with young people.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.700
And they can brainstorm and
do that kind of stuff.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.790
Anyways, Nina is the
editor of content.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.150
And she did this amazing piece
where she interviewed Syrian

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.550
expats who escaped with their
lives, effectively, and I

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.780
think they're in Dubai now, and
how they think about their

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.870
experience, and what they've
learned, how they're keeping

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.490
their creativity alive, and
how they're counting the

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.020
minutes to be able to go back.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.880
And it was in the "Washington
Post" about two weeks ago.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.340
So if you Google it,
it's very findable.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.410
And it's really moving.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:24.510
And it's really provocative.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.240
And it falls right into
the category that

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.760
you're thinking about.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.320
All I would tell is a couple
things is that, I mean, the

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.660
hunger is just a mind blow.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.550
So I don't know if this is still
happening now, but I can

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.090
tell you that, less than a year
ago, there are amazing,

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.870
amazing engineers in Damascus
who literally snuck--

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.565
I was going to write about them,
but I realized I might

00:35:42.565 --> 00:35:43.735
put them in jeopardy
by writing about

00:35:43.735 --> 00:35:45.210
them, so I never did.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.590
But they literally would sneak
over the border to have

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.970
quarterly meetings with
their Beirut partners.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.460
And then, in between, whenever
they could find access to a

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.840
proxy server, they did.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.110
And when they could find
broadband, they did.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.950
And if not, if they found
electricity, they would do.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.170
And they just don't stop.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.690
And this Oasis 500 that you
mentioned, which is an

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.770
incubator in Jordan, has these
amazing sessions of

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.120
training and so on.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.360
They are amazing.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.690
But guess what happens.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.830
They're based in Jordan
for Jordan.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:12.190
And folks in Ramallah hear about
it, and they are like,

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.090
come to Ramallah.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:13.530
We've got to do this.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.450
Do you do it here?

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.440
And can we send some people?

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.300
All of a sudden, a bunch
of Syrians show up.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.850
They say, can we participate
also?

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.170
Because that's the kind
of hunger and the

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.420
appetite that's there.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.940
And I don't think that
gets stifled.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.200
I think it just almost gets
magnified in a broader sense

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.470
of mission, as well as a passion
of what they do.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.490
In terms of the refugee camps,
I don't know the answer to

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.840
that with precision.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.500
But what I can tell you is
that when people have

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.240
technology, they do unbelievable
things.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.450
So one of the most amazing group
of entrepreneurs I met

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.930
anywhere were these
five young women--

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.190
I feel like I'm rambling,
so forgive me.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:44.690
But it's cool stuff.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:49.250
Anyways, so there's this thing
called INJAZ Al-Arab, which is

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.000
based, a little bit, on junior
league, I think.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.380
But anyhow, they do
entrepreneurship classes all

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.030
over the Middle East.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.370
That's their purpose in
life, for Arab-based.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.630
And I think a million or two
million kids have been through

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.670
their programs in elementary
school and high school.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.350
And they may have 30,000 a year,
or something like that,

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.250
directionally, who do
these programs.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.330
So every year, they have big
startup competition, the best

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.240
of the best high school kids.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.580
And so the five young women in
Yemen learned that one of the

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.350
biggest problems in a tent
community near them was that

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.260
because that because
of kerosene

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.930
lanterns, there were fires.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:20.735
And they said, well,
this is ridiculous.

00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:21.980
There should be solar panels.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.575
They should all have little
devices that are chargeable.

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:25.690
And they can have
light that way.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.160
Why would anybody use
kerosene lanterns?

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.170
So their high school project, it
took them 10 months, was to

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.390
build sure charging stations
with solar panels and to get

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.640
distribution of these electrical
lanterns to this

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.920
community, which they did.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.990
All right, unbelievable in and
of itself, but it gets better.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.300
So one of the judges, I was
there, asked these amazing

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.920
young kids, they just said, wow,
but what where did you

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.220
get the solar panels, right?

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.730
Did some NGO give them to you?

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:49.590
The UN give them to you?

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.080
How'd you get them.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.130
I get what you put together.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.200
And you really did a great
system integration here, but

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.640
where did you get the
solar panels?

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.520
And they didn't skip a beat.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.840
They said, well,
we built them.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.830
And they are like, what do
you mean you built them?

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.200
They said, oh, yeah, yeah, there
are these great videos

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.700
on YouTube-- this is where
you guys come in.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.420
And if you search around-- you
know, it took a while.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.970
But there are literally, if you
search effectively solar

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.820
panels, materials, at
home, there are all

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.920
these ways to do it.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.740
And it took them 10 months
to do it, but

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.670
they figured it out.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.220
And they built like little
solar panels to put in

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.320
umbrellas so that people could
have fans in the heat, and

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.010
that kinds of stuff.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.340
These are 16-year-old--

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.030
five 16-year-old girls
in Yemen, OK?

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.920
So that's not quite the refugee
camp analogy, except

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.440
that they found a way to bring
something to bear in what is

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.560
equivalent to those
circumstances there.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.990
There's in Egypt, but I also an
amazing version of this in

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.830
Uganda, folks that are using
texting capabilities to report

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.690
things like sexual violence,
which is

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:40.060
unbelievably important.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.870
And then I remember the
entrepreneur saying, I think

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:43.570
I'm a journalist.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:44.560
I never meant to be
a journalist.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.470
I thought this was a service.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.390
But I'm getting all this insight
and stories that's

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.430
helpful to the community about
what's happening on

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.840
a day to day basis.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.360
And so I haven't seen,
specifically, examples like

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.410
that coming out.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.320
But they certainly are in the
kinds of circumstances that

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.790
would talk to what you're
talking about.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.650
I think I've taken
a lot of time.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.940
AUDIENCE: What is the real world
potential of a landscape

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.110
changing piece of tech or app
coming out of the Middle East.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:19.070
And should that happen, like a
Twitter or a Facebook coming

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.520
out of this development?

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.360
And should that happen?

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.070
How does that affect the sort of
Western civilization of the

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.640
modern landscape
of technology.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.190
JONAH BERGER: The Western
centralization, from a

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.670
structural prospective, like
the success breeds success

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.000
ecosystem that I talked about in
terms of Silicon Valley, I

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.350
think, wherever great innovation
comes from, still

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.030
will have a sense of that
structurally, physically, and

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.490
realistically, right?

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.800
But where I think the impact is
so profound is in psyche,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.930
both in terms of folks here but,
frankly, with folks on

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:52.360
the ground.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.620
I cannot tell you how much
success breeds success is

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.630
important anywhere, but has a
particular power in emerging

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.800
growth markets.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.490
When Maktoob went public, it
just changed the whole--

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.190
I mean this was $2 million
exit, $175

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.580
million, whatever it was.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.490
And it just changed-- there were
just a whole generation

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.320
of kids who said, oh my god,
we can do it here.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.130
And when these kids got Mubarak
to fall, they all

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.630
looked at each other and said,
oh my god, we can do-- my

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.490
parents were wrong.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.550
We could do this kind
of a thing.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.170
So it has this kind of
multiplier effect that's very,

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.910
very powerful.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.430
So for example, if this young
woman really does have the

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.970
definitive goggle of swim
training, I can't describe to

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.350
you not only the multiplier
impact there, but then folks

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.020
over here say, well, we should
be distributing that.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.170
Oh, of course, we need to be
thinking about this in a

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.420
different kind of a way.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.850
Put it another way.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.400
If we were sitting here in this
room 20 years ago, 10, 20

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.130
probably, and I said to you that
the biggest, or among the

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.410
biggest player in gaming, and
consumer electronics, and in

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:53.200
mobile, structural devices, were
Korea, Japan, Finland,

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.545
we'd look at each other
and say, what

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:56.300
are you talking about?

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:01.630
And things like that then take
on a life of their own if they

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.270
continue to scale and continue
to have, I think power.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.700
But the biggest paradigm shift,
which is so stunning to

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.440
me, that people across
generations and across

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.340
geography still seem to have a
problem really coming to terms

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.480
with is this construct that it
can happen anywhere because

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.000
the tools are now available.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.950
And the thing that I think
sometimes we don't focus on,

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.540
and again, this is where my age
comes in a little bit to

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.330
it is, I mean, I remember when
there was a lot of great

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.160
technology, but a lot of it
didn't work that well.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.670
I mean, it really works now,
unbelievably, easily, and

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.320
well, and accessible.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.420
And when that happens,
then it changes

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.670
everything that you're asking.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.290
Thanks for asking that.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.630
Thank you guys for spending
time with me.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.430
It's really been a treat.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.130
If I can be helpful
to you in anyway.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.240
If any of you, they've got
my contact information.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.140
If you ever go to the region,
you have to ping me because I

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.150
know a lot of really fun,
interesting people who would

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.120
kill to do it.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.370
Take a look at what
McClure is doing.
