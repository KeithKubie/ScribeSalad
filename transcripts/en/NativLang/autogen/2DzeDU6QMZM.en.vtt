00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.550
 Some languages ​​have scary long words! 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.600
 Hawaii has been directly cut off from people's driving. . . first name. 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.780
 An ancient comedian spelled the meat dish of this mystery class. 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 And the German word can become so long that it lost its longest word in 2013. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490
 Almost no traces left. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.890
 So what is going on with these words? How long can a word be? 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.090
 A few years ago, I lived this life, 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 Ten hours a day, I went to a table, worked on weekends, and went for lunch breaks. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.600
 Snorkeling with sea turtles in the coral reef! 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.949
 Oh, did I not mention that I was lying on a table in Hawaii? 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.170
 So I had a very enjoyable swim and I was heading home. 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 I must have been fascinated by the scenery, singing with the birds or something, because somewhere 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.050
 I turned the wrong way. 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.230
 So now I am facing this never-ending street card. 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.800
 Seriously, the letters continue to do so! 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.489
 In this case, if you are a normal person, you will know that you are lost, so you turned around. 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.649
 Take another route. 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.800
 But linguistic nerd? 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.710
 We threw away our ice cream and sat there fascinated by phonemes. 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 Oh, do you think that a man alone will roam the street while walking and licking ice cream? 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.809
 That's really creepy! 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.330
 No, we eat ice. 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 The most interesting thing is that if you open a Hawaiian dictionary, you will never find such an infinitely long word. 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.730
 In fact, most of the terms look very short. 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.000
 So where does this extra letter come from? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.760
 Play with me for a while and you will hear taboos from the Pacific island countries. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.610
 Oh, there are some interesting "kapu" stories, but this is a story. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.540
 So remember "kapu", but now look at the syllable "ho'o". This is called verb in my grammar book. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.060
 Add "kapu" and you will get "ho'okapu", which may mean making a thing sacred or taboo. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.921
 But these affixes only add a few letters to us, and they make me "grammar headache", so 

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:44.510
 This is not a big victory. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.700
 In addition, most Hawaiian grammars are made up of separate small parts called particles. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.130
 And if you think that anatomy of the "letter monster" is a painful process, here is a chance for you to tame a group 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.680
 The word "insects" everywhere! 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.200
 But how beautiful they are. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.850
 Is there anything longer than adding it to your base words by adding some attachments? 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550
 Add another basic word! 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 This is called a compound word and it will win you a lot of extra letters. 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 Is there a flaw? 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.939
 Have a brain? 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.500
 How about the lightning brain! (computer) 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.200
 This is some feces from the spray. (sulfur) 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.200
 Why not a blunt pig nose nose squid! 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.340
 Amazing words to build, Hawaii. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.659
 So, is Hawaii the longest word in history? 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.100
 It is 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.700
 No. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.159
 So what about German or Greek mentioned before? 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.849
 The same strategy: compound words, compound words, compound words... 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.030
 Unfortunately, there are no record-breakers here. 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.819
 This award belongs to... Drums from l .... 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.100
 a master of compound words, a 16th century writer, 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.739
 She uses compound words to have an entire chapter in her Sanskrit masterpiece. 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.519
 Go and say, "So this person passed the part of passing Tamil Nadu." 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.630
 But she rushed through the area, I mean she really focused on the place. 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.319
 One of them (just one!) describes the gorgeous Sanskrit word in this place. 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.129
 Dozens of compound words. 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.879
 This is how the Sanskrit compound is used to make the longest word on the Guinness Book of World Records. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.150
 Are we celebrating a special moment? 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.209
 Does this idea also flash your mind: in theory, can we always add 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.569
 Compound words with hyphens? 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.879
 Ah, you are right! 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.040
 It’s not fair, right? 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.739
 If we just play this, it's good. 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.599
 This is a hyphenal verbal speed race. 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.099
 The problem with these words is that they are not really used. 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.540
 The truth is that even if there are compound words, Hawaiian German, or even Sanskrit, they have not won. 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.200
 Any average number of letters in the game. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.129
 Around the world, where do people really use long words for almost every sentence? 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.379
 Oh, they built a completely different way to build words. 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.109
 When should I go back to that point. 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.400
