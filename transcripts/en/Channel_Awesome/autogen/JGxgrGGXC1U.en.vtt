00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.310 align:start position:0%
strong point and the first two-thirds I
 

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
strong point and the first two-thirds I
think<00:13:55.490><c> are</c><00:13:55.579><c> still</c><00:13:55.760><c> really</c><00:13:56.209><c> good</c><00:13:56.360><c> and</c><00:13:56.540><c> really</c>
