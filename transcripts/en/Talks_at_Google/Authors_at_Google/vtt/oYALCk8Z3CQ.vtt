KENNETH TURAN:
Well, first of all,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.860
thank you Julie,
and thank whoever

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.900
was responsible for
inviting me here.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.200
I've driven by this building for
a long time, never been inside.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.340
So thank you for the
opportunity to be inside.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.020
I have a job-- my job is
film critic of the LA Times.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.660
People are always
interested in this job.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.100
I think of it
sometimes as like a job

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.740
like working inside
the sewers of Paris.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.960
You know, if you've met
someone on an airplane who

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.840
worked in the
sewers of Paris, you

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.780
have a lot of
questions for them.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.577
So I want to kind of reverse
the way this usually goes.

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:41.910
I want to talk for a little bit.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850
But I really want to
devote most of my time

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.031
here to answering
questions, because I

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.030
think that's what people
are more interested in.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.340
And frankly, that's what
I'm more interested in.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.760
And not only questions
about the book,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.440
just questions about film,
questions about reviewing,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.070
anything that you think I
might have an answer to.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.310
So I'll talk a little bit.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.172
I'll read a tiny
bit from the book.

00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:04.630
And then we'll
mostly do questions.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.090
I've seen-- I don't know
how many films I've seen.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.870
But I have a good friend, a
man named David Ansen, who

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.320
was for many years a
critic at "Newsweek."

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.660
And David, when
he was very small

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.590
and started being
interested in film,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.440
he started writing down the
names of every film he saw.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.270
So he has an exact
total of how many films

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.810
he's seen in his life.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.350
And he has seen,
at this point, he's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.760
closing in on 10,000 films,
which is a big number.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.420
I don't think I've
seen that many.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.330
But I've seen thousands
and thousands of films.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.890
And most of them are
really forgettable.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.110
Any kind of film, independent
film, foreign language film,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
there are forgettable
ones, all those genres.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.440
But I wanted to do a book really
about the films that I love.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.900
I wanted to do essays
about the films that

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.630
meant the most to
me, that I really

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.690
wanted to maybe take with
me on a desert island.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.410
If the desert island
had a DVD player,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.930
these are the ones
I'd want with me

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.090
that I can watch
over and over again.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.140
When I went to college, I took
a course in the New Testament.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.620
I didn't know anything
about the New Testament.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.610
And they told me that
the word gospel--

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.100
I hope this is true--
that the word gospel means

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.050
the spreading of good
news, that the Gospels were

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.780
the spreading of the
good news about Jesus.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.590
And what I want to do
as a critic in general,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.630
but especially with
this book, I want

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.146
to spread the good news about
the films that I really love.

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.520
I want to share
them with people.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.110
I've already seen them.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.010
I don't get a
percentage of royalties

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.850
from them if people watch them.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.025
I just want people to have the
same pleasure from these films

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:49.770
that I've had.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.160
They run the gamut in time from,
I think the earliest one is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.280
1893, is the really
earliest days of film,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.430
a French kind of serial
drama called "Fantomas,"

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.060
who was one of the first master
criminals that now have so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.460
taken over popular culture.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.910
This is kind of
where it started.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.120
And I think the last film
in the book is from 2011.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.700
It's an Israeli film
called "Footnote,"

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.634
which I really enjoyed.

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:19.550
And they've seen them.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.600
Some of these films,
I've seen quite recently.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.440
Some of these films really
stayed with me since childhood.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.360
I saw a lot of the films--
I'm from New York-- I

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760
saw a lot of the films
as a kid on this program

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.660
called "Million Dollar
Movie," that they used

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.590
to have in New York that
showed old Hollywood films.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.380
It showed them every
night over and over

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.420
again, a couple
times every night.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.210
In fact, the last
time I spoke, someone

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.970
told me that his grandmother
was a fan of "Million Dollar

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.640
Movie."

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.170
Because she could fall asleep
while it was on and then

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.870
wake up, and the film would
be showing a second time.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.800
And she could catch
up to what each scene.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.120
So this was a great
way to see films.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.950
The film from
the-- I don't know,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.970
I always, whenever I
talk about in the book,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.740
I think about this--
the first film

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.775
I saw that made it into the
book is a film called "I

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:08.940
Am a Fugitive from
a Chain Gang."

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.960
This is what I know
now is a pre-code film.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.860
This is an early
sound film from 1932.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.200
It's a period in Hollywood
right after sound came in

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.880
and before the production
code was implemented,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.830
where films were
really more daring.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.020
They were a little
crazier and stuff happened

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.770
that wouldn't happen in
traditional Hollywood films.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.040
And I'm not going to ruin it
for people who have seen it.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.020
But it's got an amazing ending.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.430
And it's got an ending
that, I can still

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.040
remember sitting in
front of the TV as a kid

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.660
and seeing this film.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.730
And I was all by myself.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.919
My parents were--
didn't care, you know.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.710
They knew they were
safe with me watching--

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.682
I was safe watching
"Million Dollar Movie."

00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:49.140
So I'm watching
this film, and it's

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.972
got this ending, this
amazingly bleak ending.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.050
And I was just-- I
didn't know what to say.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.750
I still can remember
that feeling,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.110
that I didn't know films
could end like this.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.850
I didn't know it
was legal to end

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.560
a film with such a
despairing ending.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.170
So that film-- and now
I know it's pre-code

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.050
and I know all about the factors
that went into that ending.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.800
But I still retain the kind
of excitement and energy

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.340
of seeing that film then and how
much it really galvanized me.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.720
I said, wow, this
is really amazing.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.060
So each of these films has
that kind of wow factor in it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.090
for me.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.880
And this is, again, an
interesting experience for me.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.040
Usually part of
what I do here is

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.060
I'm trying to convince
people to buy the book.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.050
And I don't have to
really do that here,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.060
because you've all
been given the book.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.670
Whoever came up with that
idea, it's a wonderful idea.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.790
But I'm still passionate
about these films

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.770
and still hoping that you
will use this book as a way

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.440
to watch and enjoy these films.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.690
Some of them will be familiar to
you, some of them will not be.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.690
I think even a
friend who's working

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.910
on a similar book,
another critic, who

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.390
said that he'd seen
50 of the 54 films.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.280
And I thought he would
have seen everything.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.430
So everyone's going to
have some things they've

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.950
seen, some things
they haven't seen.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.894
And I really hope to encourage
people to explore films

00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:11.810
that they might not
otherwise have thought of.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.512
And I just want to
read a little tiny bit

00:06:14.512 --> 00:06:17.950
from-- I have an essay
at the back called

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.590
"The 55th Film," which is
kind of deciding-- it talks

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.440
a little bit about the
process about how I came up

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440
with the films on the list.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.380
So I just want to read
a little bit from that.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.440
"I started with an initial list
of more than 100 films compiled

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.670
more or less off
the top of my head,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.320
a list I added to after
using reference books

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.600
and other compilations to prod
my sometimes stubborn memory.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.180
To be fair to those who've
read my previous collections,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.870
the only stricture I
put on myself was not

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.370
to include too many films
from my earlier books,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.920
especially "Never Coming
to A Theater Near You,"

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.680
which had some of the
smaller films I really liked.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.100
Rather than come up with
an ironclad list of 54

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.730
before I started
to write, I decided

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.850
to choose the films as I wrote
about them, one at a time.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.630
I selected these in
no particular order.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.070
When I was ready to begin an
essay, I'd look at my list,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.110
decide which title spoke to me
most strongly, what film I felt

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.330
like seeing at that moment
in time, I watch it again,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.200
and begin writing.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.820
What this system did, though I
didn't realize it when I began,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.270
was to give my
inventory of choices

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.280
a fluid, quicksilver
quality, making it in my eyes

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.750
into an ever-changing,
almost living thing.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.780
While some films were
always going to be there,

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.590
others gained or lost
status and momentum

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.260
as my mood changed and the
list grew in size and shape.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.610
The closer I got to
finishing, the more difficult,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.380
even excruciating, choosing
the final films became.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.270
Because at this late
stage, picking one film

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.390
inevitably meant another title
would be left by the wayside.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.650
By the end, I felt each of the
contending films calling out

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.640
to me, pleading with
metaphorical tears in its eyes,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.970
pick me, choose me,
take me with you.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.190
Remember how much
I've meant to you.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.980
Don't leave me behind
in the darkness.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.070
Right up to the
last minute, I was

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.930
remembering and
agonizing over new titles

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.060
that I had not found room for.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.000
When Peter O'Toole
died, I kicked myself

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.944
for leaving "Lawrence of
Arabia" out of the top 54."

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:34.610
And I really do.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.940
I still feel if I had
it to do all over again,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.659
I'd probably kick some film out
and put "Lawrence of Arabia"

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.320
in.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.299
I feel bad I left that one out.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.720
"Finally, I broke the
logjam by holding auditions

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.340
for the 54th film, watching
half a dozen contenders

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.420
before I made my choice.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.320
It was appropriately
enough for a list

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.980
compiled in Los Angeles, Roman
Polanski's and Robert Townes'

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.030
Chinatown, as good a film
about the city as has

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.050
been made that was
my final selection."

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.360
OK, so that's kind of about
how the book came about

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.159
and why it's important to me.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.700
And again, one of
the things about it

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.720
is that the process of picking
these films, especially

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.850
since I did it one
by one, it almost

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.140
was a process of me finding
out more about myself

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.610
or kind of clarifying
things about myself.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.690
I think films, what you like
and what you don't like in film,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.320
really kind of says
something about who

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.650
you are on some level.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.830
Looking at these films-- again,
I looked at them all again

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.990
before I wrote about them--
I love romantic films.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.710
If I had to pick one film
that was my favorite film,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.510
it's a French film called
"Children of Paradise"

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.090
from mid 1940s.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.630
It's just a wonderful romance.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.450
I also like films
about moral dilemmas.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.160
I think those are very dramatic.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.640
I don't find them tedious to do.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.260
Moral choices that people have
to make can be very exciting.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.732
So in some ways, I learned
I think more about myself

00:10:03.732 --> 00:10:04.690
than I thought I would.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.120
It's almost like
this book is kind

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.350
of-- it's like a spiritual
autobiography, in some ways,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.470
writing this book.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.850
So it was a lot of fun to write.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.080
It was hard carving the
time out to work on it

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.520
with all my other stuff,
my other obligations.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.950
But I always felt happy being
able to research, and write

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.220
about, and deal with
films that I really loved.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.590
So I hope you have similar
experiences with it.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.807
And I think I'm
ready for questions.

00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:32.890
They said you're supposed
to go to the microphone.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.800
So that is it.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.900
OK, let me put on
my seeing glasses,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.420
so that I can see
everyone better.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.330
OK.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.100
AUDIENCE: All right, well
just glancing quickly

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.760
through the table
of contents, it

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.110
seems like it's heavily weighted
toward earlier films rather

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.365
than later ones.

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:55.166
Is that because filmmaking
has gotten less interesting?

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:56.790
KENNETH TURAN: Well,
part of the reason

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.390
is that those earlier books I've
written, especially the "Never

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.510
Coming to A Theater
Near You," where there's

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.030
a lot of more recent
films that I really like.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.870
And again, I didn't want
the book to be the same.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.210
I mean, I do have a
weakness for older films,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.720
but I think if I had not
written that previous book, that

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.490
kind of imbalance
wouldn't be there.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.702
I was surprised you
know-- as I say,

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:20.160
I picked these
films one at a time,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.750
and I thought about
them that way.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.640
And it wasn't until I was
completely finished that I

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.390
was talking to my
editor, and he said

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.389
you have to organize
these films in some way.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:31.430
So I said, why don't I
break them down by decades

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.986
and see what happens.

00:11:32.986 --> 00:11:34.360
And I did that,
and I was shocked

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.119
to find that there are only
two films from the 1970s

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:37.660
in this book.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.420
This is supposed to be
the great era of film.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.210
And I won't even say
it isn't, but it just

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.330
worked out that way.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.442
Chinatown and The Godfather,
which are knockout films,

00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:48.150
they're the only two
films from the '70s.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.610
I like those other films,
but for whatever reason,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:56.290
they don't have the pull for
me that the other films do.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.856
Yep.

00:11:57.856 --> 00:11:59.860
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
it kind of related

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.770
to what he asking, but
in the '40s and '50s,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.580
it looks like you have a whole,
the largest chunk of films.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.060
Is there something about
that period or those films?

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.907
What is it that
resonated with you more?

00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:13.490
KENNETH TURAN: That's
a good question.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.130
You know, like I
say, I didn't really

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.400
think about that until
I looked at the list,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.660
and I said, well, look
at all these films.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660
Why are they there?

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.820
What do I like
about these films?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.340
I think that the '50s
are the biggest chunk.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.590
And again, that was a surprise,
because with the '50s,

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.920
it's boring.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.840
It's Eisenhower, country clubs.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.550
What am I doing
celebrating the '50s?

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.710
I finally decided that the '50s
had a combination of two things

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.490
that I really liked.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.035
Number one, this was still
classical filmmaking.

00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:42.410
This was still
classic Hollywood,

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.380
and I like old-fashioned films.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.940
I'm not necessarily,
though-- I mean,

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.670
I guess there's some films in
here that push the envelope.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.280
I'm not necessarily looking
for films that do that.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.140
So I like classic films.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.520
So this had still the
virtues of the classic films.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.150
But it's post-war.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.295
Everyone came back
from World War II.

00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:03.346
Things were bleaker, even though
we were the nominal victors.

00:13:03.346 --> 00:13:04.720
People weren't
necessarily happy,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.420
and it was a traumatic time.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.330
I think the combination of that
kind of unsettled bleakness,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.550
that's definitely a
post-war phenomena,

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.400
with the classic style
the prewar, that's

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.260
what I like about those films.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.960
I think that's
what did it for me.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.920
AUDIENCE: Great, and I
had one other question.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.044
Now we have so many films
that come out these days.

00:13:25.044 --> 00:13:26.460
What do you do
when you're looking

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.959
at what films you
want to watch now.

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.445
Do you have a process?

00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.280
KENNETH TURAN: That's
a good question.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.097
Yeah, I mean, we
live in the time,

00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:35.430
especially-- I think, probably
only in New York and LA--

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.310
but definitely New York and LA,
where a dozen films come out

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.770
every week, at least,
Week in, week out.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.480
That's a ton of films.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.590
And you know, some films--
Again, I spend a lot of time

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.510
reading about films,
talking about films,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.170
reading film magazines,
going to festivals,

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.630
talking to people who've
been to festivals,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.070
trying to figure out
which ones are worth it.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.712
And also I hear from publicists.

00:14:02.712 --> 00:14:04.420
A lot of these films,
even the tiny ones,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.990
have some kind of publicist.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.820
And they're always sending you
stuff to try and convince you.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.690
But it's a judgment
call on my part

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.530
what I think is worth doing.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.610
I look for especially--
I look at trailers a lot.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.130
YouTube has become
a friend of mine.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.530
I look at a lot of
trailers online.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.030
And I can tell largely,
even though I've

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.740
been fooled sometimes-- Because
trailer makers cut what they

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.536
think the most commercial
trailer will be.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.160
And sometimes, this
commercial trailer,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.350
though it's designed to
get people in the door,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.810
it may not accurately
reflect the film.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.510
So sometimes a film is more
interesting and less commercial

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.300
than it looks like
in it's trailer.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.082
But mostly, trailers
really help me not

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.040
to tell whether a film
is going to be a success

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.970
or anything like
that, but just for me

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.930
to know what I want to see.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.940
But I end up seeing
more than I write about.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.080
And it's just trial and error.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.506
I just hope I don't
miss anything good.

00:14:55.506 --> 00:14:56.730
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:03.510
AUDIENCE: If you had to pick
an Alfred Hitchcock film,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.976
which one would it be
to be on your list?

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.850
KENNETH TURAN: Well,
there is one on my list.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.180
It's--

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
looked through it.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.756
I didn't see it.

00:15:09.756 --> 00:15:11.040
KENNETH TURAN: It's "Vertigo."

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.920
AUDIENCE: "Vertigo," OK.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.419
KENNETH TURAN: And
I think "Vertigo"

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:17.529
is a fascinating film
because it's-- Yeah, I mean,

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:19.070
I just think it's
a fascinating film,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.300
because it's-- this
was Alfred Hitchcock,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.930
a very commercial director,
working with two of the biggest

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:30.140
stars of his day, working with
James Stewart and Kim Novak,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.570
big commercial Hollywood film.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.380
And it's an
astonishingly weird film.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.170
It's a very personal film.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.534
It's a film about the kind of
odd things that obsessed him.

00:15:40.534 --> 00:15:42.950
I mean, I almost think it's
as personal a film as anything

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.540
that you see at Sun
dance, which we're

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.260
looking at as personal films.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.090
Everyone says, you
probably know, "Vertigo,"

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.700
there was a-- When
"Vertigo" came out-- again,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.910
and this is an interesting thing
about the fallibility or the,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.980
I don't know, the quirkiness of
critics-- when "Vertigo" came

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.530
out, I've gone back
and read the reviews,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.010
the critics said,
this is average.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.650
Wait for the next
one, basically.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.870
This is average Hitchcock,
nothing to get excited about.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.960
And as the years went on, people
got more and more interested

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.580
in this film.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.690
And "Sight &amp; Sound," the British
film publication, every 10

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.530
years, they poll
critics worldwide

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.330
about what the
best film ever made

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.470
is, which basically
means your favorite film.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.140
And for a decade, "Citizen
Kane" won every 10 years.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.970
And this last time, about two
or three years ago, "Vertigo"

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.640
was named by this
worldwide panel of critics

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.480
as the best film ever made.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.339
And obviously, nothing is
the best film ever made.

00:16:37.339 --> 00:16:38.630
And I don't think "Vertigo" is.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.890
But it fascinates me
that what happened

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.900
is that its weird sensibility
caught up with the times.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.680
How weird it was, I think,
kind of put people off

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.750
when it first came out.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.100
And now, we kind of like that
as a culture, the strangeness,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.980
the idiosyncrasy, the kind
of obsession that we see.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.100
This resonates with
modern viewers.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:08.179
So it's a long
answer to "Vertigo."

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:09.985
AUDIENCE: This wasn't
my original question.

00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:13.560
But based on what
you just said, so

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.460
in the world of very
long Netflix queues

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.069
and whatnot, which of these
54 would you say, yes,

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.234
if you're going to see
one, that is my favorite.

00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:24.317
KENNETH TURAN: Well, it
is "Children of Paradise."

00:17:24.317 --> 00:17:25.230
It's a French film.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.112
Has anyone seen
it, show of hands?

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.987
AUDIENCE: Yeah, give me
like 4 hours, though.

00:17:28.987 --> 00:17:29.650
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's a long film.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.580
And it was made-- it's an
interesting film, because it

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.050
was made at the end
of World War II.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.424
It was made under
the occupation.

00:17:35.424 --> 00:17:37.980
It was made under
difficult circumstances.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.340
Some of the below-the-line
people were Jewish

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.960
and they worked from hiding.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.086
You'd never know any of
this as you watch the film.

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:45.793
It's just an interesting
thing to kind of

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:47.490
have in the back of your head.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.730
It's an epic romance.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.220
It's set in Paris in I
think around the 1820s.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.140
It's about one woman and I think
it's four different men, who

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.110
become madly in love with her
and how that all works out.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.600
It's just a marvelous film.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.550
And I could really watch
that again and again.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.460
And the other one is
another French film.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.750
Another French
romance, that is, I

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.480
have watched again and
again, because it's shorter.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.940
And it's obviously in the book.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.650
It's called "The Earrings of
Madame de--" D-E dot, dot, dot.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.220
It's by a French director--
actually, an Austrian director,

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.650
but it's a French
film name, Max Ophuls.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.210
And he was a master
of the moving camera.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.950
Films put on-- in those
days, they weren't hand held;

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.420
they were put on tracks.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.010
There are some shots that are
just completely intoxicating,

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.990
that I could watch forever.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.847
So I'd put those two
at the top of the list.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.680
AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.140
Look forward to it.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.780
Let me ask you a
practical question,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.460
if we're using this is
a roadmap for things

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.790
to see over the next year or so.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.660
Would you recommend
seeing the movie before--

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.230
you don't give away
the ending to--

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.095
KENNETH TURAN: I don't
give away the ending.

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.050
AUDIENCE: "I'm a Fugitive From
a Chain Gang," for instance.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.470
But do you have any
recommendation of read it

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.477
first and then watch it to give
context, or watch and then--

00:18:57.477 --> 00:18:59.060
KENNETH TURAN: That's
a good question.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.610
I mean, with my reviews,
people do it both ways,

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.020
even though I'm careful in my
reviews not to give away-- I

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.940
give away as little of
the plot as possible.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.670
But still some people want
to read them afterwards,

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.440
which is fine with me.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.350
You know, I think I
wrote them to encourage

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.510
people to see the film.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.540
So maybe reading them
will make you more--

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.430
I think in some ways, you
should read them first and see

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.660
which ones ring a bell with
you and which ones say,

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.176
boy, this one sounds like
something I want to see.

00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:26.550
But you could read
it afterwards.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.690
I mean, if you have
enough faith in me

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.244
to see it without reading
the essay, then go with god.

00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:33.160
AUDIENCE: Sounds good.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.659
Thank you.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.750
AUDIENCE: This may or may
not relate to the book,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.850
but I was wondering if
there's a film in the book

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.390
or a film in general
that you really

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.672
liked but a lot of other
critics didn't like?

00:19:48.672 --> 00:19:49.630
If you have an example.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.050
KENNETH TURAN: Yeah, I mean,
I think one that I think of

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.040
is one that a lot of
critics-- not a lot,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.090
but there are a lot of lists
of films that people love.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:05.250
There's kind of a really in
some ways a very standard studio

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.640
movie, again a romance, that is
not on a lot of people's list.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.990
It's a film called
"Random Harvest."

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.445
It was taken from
a big bestseller.

00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:18.760
It stars Greer Garson, and
it has to do with amnesia.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.620
But it's got such
a complicated plot,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.670
even if I wanted to give away
the plot, there's no time.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.820
There's so many things
that happen in it.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.330
And it kind of amazed
me when I saw it,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.269
because the plot was so crazy.

00:20:31.269 --> 00:20:32.810
Because so much
stuff happened in it,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.630
because so much good
acting and craft

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.410
went into this kind of really
astonishingly far-fetched story

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.210
and a very romantic story.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.470
So that's the one I think
that most people would say,

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.520
what's that doing there.

00:20:48.764 --> 00:20:50.170
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.589
That is easier.

00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:54.630
Do you ever feel kind of
like your hands are tied

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.840
by your chosen form,
like in the sense of,

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.500
I assume that your
criticism, your analysis,

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.530
is based on kind of
analysis of the whole film.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.960
And then you have
to do this thing

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.100
where you don't tell
anybody what informed,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.390
what you thought.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.420
Because it's like secret
literary analysis.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.670
You're not allowed to tell
people why it did this.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.890
You just have to tell
them that it did this.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.160
Or do you think that it's
kind of freeing to not

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.990
have to tell people, this
is why the filmmaker--

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.500
KENNETH TURAN: Well, what
I do is speculate on why.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.990
I do actually speculate on why.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.470
I mean, there's no way to know
why, without-- I mean, it's

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.950
possible the filmmaker,
him or herself doesn't even

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.990
know why they make
the choices they do.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.700
But again, I try and
speculate as to why the--

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.650
My job, my goal when I go
in there, I look at the film

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.920
and I really want to
say, is it effective?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.500
If it's a comedy, am I laughing?

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.370
If it's a documentary,
am I really involved?

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.260
If it's a thriller,
am I really nervous

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.470
and at the edge of my seat?

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.422
And that's my first
line of thought.

00:21:55.422 --> 00:21:56.880
And then the second
line of thought

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.130
is I do try and figure
out why is this happening?

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.880
Why am I feeling the way
the film wants me to feel?

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.870
Or why am I not feeling the
way the film wants me to feel?

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.920
So I do try and go into that.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.840
But still, I mean it is-- but I
do try, especially because I've

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.470
been doing it so long,
I feel like if there

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.490
is a film where I can
turn it into an essay

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.500
and where I can go
further with things

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.380
or look at aspects of the
film, I try and do that.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.150
I don't want to be writing
the same review day after day,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.060
week after week.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.970
So I do look for ways
to make it different.

00:22:31.173 --> 00:22:32.340
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.420
I have two questions.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:40.523
My first one I guess relates
to the context of appreciation.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:49.510
How does, say, watching
a film in movie theater

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:55.960
versus in your personal home
or in a screening studio,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.460
how does that context impact
the way in which you appreciate

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.796
or re-appreciate films
as you did in the book?

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:08.170
KENNETH TURAN:
I'm a big believer

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.800
in the theatrical experience,
you know this big screen.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.890
I mean, even my screen at
home, I have a projector screen

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.390
at home.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.095
It's like a 100-inch screen.

00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:22.070
It's quite a big
screen for a home.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.820
I want to be kind of
drawn into the image.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.720
I like being overpowered
by the image.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.560
I mean, I don't want
to watch things small.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.360
I don't enjoy watching
things on my computer.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.660
So I believe that,
in that sense,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.220
the size of the screen and being
in a room where you can really

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.215
feel the size of the
screen is very important.

00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:44.990
It turns out that it doesn't
really matter to me how big

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.330
and-- You know,
the studios often

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.650
have this feeling that
they want you surrounded

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.960
by people who they think
will like the film.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.330
They want to surround you
with advocates of a film,

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.890
so that you will like it.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.430
And it's a fine
theory, but I just

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.760
don't think it really works.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.330
I mean, I find that
it doesn't matter

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.970
if the audience
likes a film or not.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.080
I have my own
relationship to the film.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.570
I will like it or not like it.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.111
The one thing that
makes a difference

00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:14.320
is having a big screen.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.967
I mean, if I see it
on a small screen,

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:17.050
I'm not going to be happy.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.810
I'm not going to get drawn in.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.820
I want to be drawn in.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.000
That's the whole thing
I love about film,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.730
is that they draw you in.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.590
So the big screen
is essential for me.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.310
Audience, recruited audience,
ordinary people, other critics,

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.657
doesn't really matter to me.

00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:34.240
And you said you had
another question?

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:41.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my second
question relates to the I

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.630
guess your personal interest in
evaluating long form stories,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.190
I guess in the context
of, say, television,

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:58.200
where you have these sort
of multi-season productions

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.050
that carry a lot of
filmic qualities.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.660
And then you also
have these sort

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.140
of longer form films
that either fit

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.070
within the content
of a larger trilogy,

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.770
or say a director's
sort of au revoir.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.929
But yeah, what's your
comment on the long form?

00:25:15.929 --> 00:25:17.720
KENNETH TURAN: I mean,
they're fascinating.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.830
I mean again, if they're
well done, longer films,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.460
and by extension these
multi-season TV series,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460
they really draw you in.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.530
They can make
characters more complex.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.780
I think it's exciting what's
being done on television.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.710
I mean, I think the
great thing about TV

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.230
is that a lot of the
stuff that people enjoy

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.420
are a function of the fact
that television has not

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.784
abandoned the adult audience.

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:43.700
And the movies by and
large-- even though they

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.158
don't want to admit
it-- the movies

00:25:45.158 --> 00:25:47.020
have abandoned the
adult audience.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.350
It just doesn't fit with
their business model.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.300
But with cable, it does fit
with their business model.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.710
And so they're doing this
stuff and it's fascinating.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.390
I don't have time to see
it as much as I'd like to.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.490
I watch this stuff.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.640
I mean, I was binging on
things before it was a word.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.720
You know I would go on vacation
with entire seasons of programs

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.810
and just watch for
hours and hours.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.430
So I appreciate
what they're doing.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.040
And it's related to film,
but it's not exactly

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.120
the same thing.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.970
There's one film here that I
really like that's quite long.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.470
I think the longest
film in the book

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.490
is an Italian film that was
actually made for Italian TV.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.180
It's called "The Best of Youth."

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.240
And I think in total, it's about
six hours, if my memory serves.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.380
And it's just totally involving.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.630
It's about the '60s
and two brothers,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.840
and you get incredibly
involved in the story.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.710
So I think the
long formula, they

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.050
can do things that shorter
films can't do, for sure.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:44.882 --> 00:26:46.590
AUDIENCE: I also have
a couple questions.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.140
First, you talked
about how introspective

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.880
it was as a process of
picking these movies.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.020
And that made me wonder, as a
reviewer, how do you balance

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.170
or what side do you choose
between sort of when you write

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.790
your review, exposing yourself
and the reaction you had

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.290
to the movie versus
putting yourself

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.790
in the shoes of your
readers and trying

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.505
to guess how they'll react.

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:12.200
KENNETH TURAN: I
think that you really

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.950
can't do-- I think of the two
things that you've mentioned,

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.510
you can only do one thing.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.800
You can only be yourself.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.820
I think criticism is an
intensely personal job.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.980
What you like and
what you dislike,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.120
comes a lot out of the
kind of person you are,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.120
what's important to you,
just the kind of things

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.140
you personally like.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.880
If someone said to
me, put yourself

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.825
in the shoes of all the readers,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

00:27:41.825 --> 00:27:44.610
I just embrace the fact
that this is personal,

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.500
that there's not-- I write
for myself, for people

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.540
like me, for people who I think
are intelligent and interested.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.640
There's no way for
me to write kind

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.610
of for an audience
that isn't me.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.326
I don't think I could do it.

00:28:00.326 --> 00:28:02.870
AUDIENCE: My other
question was you

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.759
talked about how
one of the things

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:06.550
you sort of measure as
you watch a movie is

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.594
how well the movie is
at being what it is,

00:28:10.594 --> 00:28:12.010
like in a comedy
making you laugh,

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.390
and in a thriller
thrilling, and so on.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.130
I mean, you also talked about
how trailers can kind of be

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.744
a little bit deceiving,
because they focus

00:28:20.744 --> 00:28:22.285
on the commercial
parts or what would

00:28:22.285 --> 00:28:23.755
be commercially successful.

00:28:23.755 --> 00:28:25.130
And so I was
wondering if there's

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.370
a film that particularly
delighted to you

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.424
in a way that you
didn't expect going in,

00:28:29.424 --> 00:28:31.840
maybe something you thought
was a comedy that thrilled you

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.860
or vice versa?

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.170
KENNETH TURAN: Huh,
That's a good question.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.790
I mean, good films--
there's a film

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.980
that I saw years ago called--
not "Sunset Boulevard"

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.730
but a filmed called
"Hollywood Boulevard."

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.500
It was a Roger Corman film made
by a man named Allan Arkush.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.430
It was about a mythical
studio in Hollywood

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.130
called "Miracle Pictures."

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:57.480
And their motto was, if it's a
good picture, it's a miracle.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.860
And sometimes, I feel that way.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.950
I mean, really the films
that really work the best,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.280
they do all astonish you.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.054
I mean, it's so hard to
make a really good film.

00:29:06.054 --> 00:29:08.720
I think one that I think of that
was a real surprise to me there

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.580
was at Cannes,
there was one night

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.350
I remember just going
into a screening.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.770
I was really tired
and irritable.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.070
And the film was
about childhood.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.220
And I'm not necessarily a big
fan of films about childhood.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.940
And I thought, oh boy,
I'm sorry I'm here.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.990
And the film came on, and it
just absolutely took me away.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.826
It transported me.

00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:30.950
It's, in fact, in the book.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.570
It's a French Canadian
film called "Leolo,"

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.750
which is one of the more
obscure films in the book.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.850
So Yeah, I mean, it's
wonderful to be excited.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.470
I mean, that's why I do this,
is to have those moments to walk

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.330
in and say, oh my god,
this is so excited.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.030
And again, I write
to try and get

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.140
more people to have
that experience.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:55.773 --> 00:30:00.000
AUDIENCE: I'll try a slightly
different tack on this.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.670
Do you have any
films that you felt

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.840
kind of had a lot of
potential but just missed it,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.906
that if they had just
done things a little bit

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.780
differently, they could
have been great films

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.310
but sort of missed the mark?

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.757
KENNETH TURAN: Yeah, I feel
that all the time actually.

00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:16.840
I mean, those films obviously
are not in the book,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.506
because the one's that are there
are the ones that I feel really

00:30:19.506 --> 00:30:20.400
did live up to it.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.960
But I think one of the
things about being a critic

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.520
is that people want you-- people
come up to me all the time

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.910
and talk to me about films.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.050
Or when they've written, I hear
from them about my reviews.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.550
People want you to either
love a film or hate a film.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.520
They want it to be I guess maybe
the word is binary that way.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.810
They want you to either
say, I love this film,

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.670
you have to go see it, or this
is the world's worst film,

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.750
stay away under all costs.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.520
A lot of films
fit in the middle.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.350
They are the kind of films
that you described, that there

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.530
are good elements to
them, but they just

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.190
haven't gone quite far
enough, or some things

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.172
don't quite, quite gel.

00:30:58.172 --> 00:31:00.200
And it's hard to write
about those films.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.120
And I think in some ways,
it's frustrating to readers,

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.620
because they have to figure
out, well, do I see it.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.579
And I try and give help in that.

00:31:07.579 --> 00:31:09.370
There's a film that
came out I think a week

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.930
or so ago called "The
Drop," which I thought

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.992
was very-- had a lot of really
good elements in it, especially

00:31:15.992 --> 00:31:16.700
James Gandolfini.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.350
It was his final role.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.670
But it's a film set
in Brooklyn with a lot

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.400
of European-- really, really
good European actors putting

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.010
on Brooklyn accents.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.180
And I'm from Brooklyn, and
I was sensitive to that.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.090
So I thought it just
kind of was a near miss.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.410
There's a lot of near misses.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.368
I mean, they're better
than the terrible films.

00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.590
But I just wish they
were all better.

00:31:42.947 --> 00:31:45.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.080
First question,
when I first went

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.222
to a film festival many years
ago, I was so enthusiastic.

00:31:51.222 --> 00:31:53.430
I went through the program
and circled all the things

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.346
that I'm going to see.

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.300
I was like talk about binging.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.690
And then I realized that
after seeing two films

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.370
in a row, the third
one, I would just

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.070
sit there and go
completely over my head.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:11.760
And I'm just kind of wondering
your I mean what's the highest

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.522
frequency that you can
watch that's-- yeah,

00:32:17.522 --> 00:32:18.415
let's leave at that.

00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:19.790
KENNETH TURAN:
No, I mean, that's

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.330
a very interesting question.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.460
In fact, I mean film festivals,
for the reasons you state,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.650
are really bad
places to see films,

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.620
because you get overload.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.710
For professional reasons, when
I go to-- I think at this point,

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.200
basically, I go to Sundance
and I go to Cannes.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.240
And you know, I look in
on multiple films a day,

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.250
two, three, four films
are day, sometimes five.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.180
I don't see them all the
way through necessarily.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.340
I can't, past one or two films--
Anything I see at a festival,

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.760
I have to see again before
I write about it at length,

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.580
just for the reason
you're talking about.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.050
You get kind of overload.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.820
You can't really--
at least for me,

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.410
I can't take them in on the
level of focus and intensity

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.460
I need to, to write
about them, if it's

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.660
the third or fourth
film of the day.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.490
So one of the
frustrations of festivals

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.730
is anything I see there, if
I have to write a full scale

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.290
review later, I'm going to
have to see it all over again.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.610
It's just, I have exactly
the same experience you do.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.460
I mean, your mind
just won't take them

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.259
in the way they took in the
first one or the second one.

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:26.300
AUDIENCE: Unlike TV series,
which I did binge on.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.600
And that actually goes very
well, because it's one world.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.720
You don't have to like take
on all these different worlds.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.370
KENNETH TURAN: Yeah, you've got
to totally reboot your head,

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.837
somewhere else, totally
different kind of film.

00:33:35.837 --> 00:33:36.795
And you just get tired.

00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:37.564
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, so when you
want to see-- like let's say

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.910
a movie is coming out that
you're really excited to see--

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.050
it's either by a
director who you love

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.280
or about a subject
matter that you like--

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.670
and as interested
as you are in it,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.870
you can tell it kind
of missed the mark.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.030
How do you write a fair
review and criticism of that?

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.200
KENNETH TURAN: Well,
those are sad moments,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.104
because you want-- especially
if you're excited by the notion.

00:34:09.104 --> 00:34:12.770
I always am thinking--
even though maybe something

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.350
I said earlier will sound
different-- I'm always

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:20.570
thinking about I write
for your readers.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.870
I have to be honest.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.480
That's all I have.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.440
People trust me to be honest.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.510
They may disagree
with me, but I have

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.000
to be telling the truth
as far as I can see it.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.280
And even though it's very sad
to have to write a disappointed

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.280
review about something I
was looking forward to,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.429
I have to do it.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.840
As I said, people come
up to me all the time

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.380
and ask me what I
think about films.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.921
And sometimes, people
come up to me--

00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:50.210
My nightmare is when
someone comes up to me--

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.830
and it happens--
and they say, I went

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.800
to-- fill in the blank--
I went to this film

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.910
just because you liked
it and I hated it.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.510
And then they look
at me and they say,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.000
did you really like that film?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.261
And I want to be
able to say yes.

00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:07.510
I don't want to be thinking,
you know I cut it a break

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.340
because I like
the director, or I

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.940
cut it a break because I
like the subject matter.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.670
I want to be able to say,
no, I really liked it.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.920
So I worry about that,
but finally, I just

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.190
have to be as honest as I can.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.352
Otherwise, there's no
point in doing just.

00:35:20.352 --> 00:35:21.451
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:24.748 --> 00:35:28.510
AUDIENCE: I was
curious how important

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.060
pleasure or entertainment
is in your reception

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.430
or your appreciation of a film.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:37.770
Like how much can you
accommodate difficulty

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.590
in watching a film?

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.006
There are some
certain critics who

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:43.560
are almost connoisseurs
of difficulty, right?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.210
And you think when you watch
something like "Barry Lyndon"

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.920
or maybe like a long
form Terrence Malick

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.480
film or something where you
could actually potentially

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.560
be bored for
stretches at the film

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.604
but you really appreciate
the craft of it.

00:35:57.604 --> 00:35:58.520
How important is that?

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.190
I read some critics,
and it's all

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.810
about the pleasure and the
excitement of watching.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.884
And they don't like as much the
sort of difficult stretches.

00:36:06.884 --> 00:36:08.550
But how much do you
appreciate the level

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.664
of craft versus
personal pleasure?

00:36:10.664 --> 00:36:12.580
KENNETH TURAN: That's
an interesting question.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.550
I think they all kind of
meld together on some level.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:21.880
I mean, I have to find
something to appreciate

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.510
if I'm going to appreciate it.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.757
I can appreciate
something that doesn't

00:36:25.757 --> 00:36:27.840
sound likeable or something
that can be difficult.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.020
I mean, I saw a film a few
weeks ago called "Starred Up."

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.430
It's a British film.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.460
It's an exceptionally
violent film,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.060
which is usually
something I don't like.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.470
So I kind of winced at
the violent parts of it.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.740
But the filmmaking
was so exciting,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.340
and the storytelling
was so good,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.060
and the acting was
so good, that I said,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.010
I really like this film.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.220
So I mean, pleasure is kind
of a malleable quality.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.000
Sometimes, you find
yourself liking

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.330
things because of the skill
involved that you would not

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.890
think you would like.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.880
I mean, sometimes
films that sound boring

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.360
or that you even think
you'd be bored by, end up

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.690
being fascinating.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:08.111
But I mean, I guess it all
comes back to pleasure for me

00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:08.610
I think.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.000
But that doesn't just mean
that things are easy and happy.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.010
Sometimes very
difficult films can

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.840
be a pleasurable experience,
if the person making them

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.180
is really gifted and you
really get on that wavelength.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.371
Does that make sense?

00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:22.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no,
I think it does.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.410
I mean, on the
other hand, can you

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:27.712
think of any films that are
like just big sprawling messes?

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.920
KENNETH TURAN: There's a
lot of big sprawling messes.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.759
AUDIENCE: No, that are
at the level of craft

00:37:31.759 --> 00:37:33.300
are not like the
best films ever made

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.670
but you love them for that
incoherence or that uniqueness?

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:43.360
KENNETH TURAN: Yeah,
that's a good-- Probably,

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.930
sometimes films
just take you away.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.013
I mean, I really enjoy it.

00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:48.510
Again, it's a film I had
written the last-- About six

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:52.150
months ago, I wrote a review
of "Captain America," where

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.090
I wrote about "Marvel" fatigue.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.490
I said, you know, I've just
seen enough "Marvel" movies.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.510
They're all the same.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.160
They're all kind of
machine-made and I've had it.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.950
And the next "Marvel"
film I had a look at

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.040
was "Guardians of
the Galaxy," which

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.512
is this kind of big messy
film, and a lot of critics

00:38:08.512 --> 00:38:10.470
have written that it
doesn't really make sense.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.020
But I enjoyed it.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.670
It had a spirit and a
kind of an energy that

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.830
really captivated me.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.880
So I mean, each film
is a unique experience.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.380
Again, that goes
back to why I can't

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.980
see two or three, more than
two or three on the same day.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.570
You want to be taken where
the film wants to take you.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.280
You want to be open and
receptive to what it's doing.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.440
And if it's a mess
but an enjoyable mess,

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.500
I'm OK with that.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.360
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:31.860
Thank you.

00:38:36.902 --> 00:38:39.960
AUDIENCE: Since it worked
with our last question,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.300
I'll share another experience.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:49.680
I had the extraordinary luck of
watching "Heavenly Creatures"

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.230
without knowing anything
about it-- what it was about.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.260
So I had this like--
this will probably

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.870
make it right at
the top of my list

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.780
very easily just because there
was this moment in the film,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.854
there's this realization,
oh my god, they are serious.

00:39:04.854 --> 00:39:05.770
This is not a fantasy.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.610
They're actually going to kill
the mother, which-- I'm sorry.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.970
KENNETH TURAN: Don't
give away the end.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.070
AUDIENCE: So sorry.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.430
KENNETH TURAN: See, people
don't like it when you--

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.388
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying
if they did or didn't.

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.340
I'm just saying that
they were going to.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.910
And maybe five
years or six years

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.950
after I saw it in
a movie theater,

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.361
I saw that it was coming on TV.

00:39:26.361 --> 00:39:27.110
And I said, great.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.450
I was going to watch it.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.160
And it turns out
that, I remembered

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.590
the ending all wrong.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.700
Like I somehow managed
to change my memory

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.311
as I was kind of going over
it and thinking about it over

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:40.810
and over.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.960
I'm just wondering if you had
that experience with a movie

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.626
that you haven't
seen in a long time?

00:39:45.626 --> 00:39:47.000
KENNETH TURAN:
Well, I mean I did

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.280
have with this book-- As I said,
I didn't want to put anything

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.040
in here that I didn't
really still like,

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.750
so I looked at everything again.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.490
And not that I remember
them differently,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.990
but sometimes, there
were some films

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.390
that I had loved when they
came out that I thought

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.290
would be in the book
that didn't make it.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.248
Because I saw them again,
and I said, you know,

00:40:04.248 --> 00:40:06.500
I just don't like them as--

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.241
You know, what I used to think
was a wonderful Cuban film,

00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:11.740
I still enjoyed it a lot, but
it wasn't one of my favorites,

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.550
a film called "Lucia," a very
long, three-part Cuban film

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.860
that I really liked.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.820
But it wasn't as strong
as I remembered it.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.540
It wasn't strong enough
to make the top 54.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.790
So sometimes, you do remember.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.580
Again, this is
all very personal.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.100
You're a different person
years later sometimes.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:27.995
Everything changes.

00:40:32.753 --> 00:40:35.670
AUDIENCE: My question
is about old movies.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.620
At this point of your
career, do you still

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.950
discover old movies new to you?

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.420
Like for me, I like old
movies, but this summer I

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.380
was on a flight on
British Airways.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.640
And I just played on the
entertainment system,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.530
I saw the movie
"Summertime" from the 1950s

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.870
with Katharine Hepburn in it.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.890
And I really enjoyed it.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.880
But my way used to try
to find some old movies

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.380
is like this book that lists.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.980
But I never remember seeing
that movie on any of the lists.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:21.610
So what else can I do to kind
of find this kind of old movies?

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.310
Because there's no trailers
showing where I go to--

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.630
KENNETH TURAN: No, that's true.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.930
That's true.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.460
Yeah, I mean, I still--
there's so many.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.880
I mean, my worry is not having
the time to see all the films

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.477
that I haven't
seen, not that I'm

00:41:34.477 --> 00:41:35.810
going to run out of ones to see.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.979
There are always old films.

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:38.520
Now, I'm not talking
about new films.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.970
I'm talking about the old films.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.130
Hollywood used to put out way
more films than they do now.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.710
I think in 1939,
which is considered

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.267
to be the top year and the
golden age of Hollywood--

00:41:53.267 --> 00:41:54.850
I was just looking
at something, and I

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.310
think they said they were--
I can't remember how many,

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.240
but there may be as many as 600
films came out in that year.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.830
There were a lot of studios,
and there were these poverty row

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.217
studios that also
turned out films.

00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:06.425
So there's a ton of stuff
out there to be discovered.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.780
Like I said, this book not
only are there 54 films,

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.460
there's a second 54.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.630
And there's also each
film has a notation

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.560
at the end of what
to watch next.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.470
So if you like one
of the films in there

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.790
and you want to see
something else like it.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.590
I mean, there are lists online.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:28.560
I mean also you can look at what
companies like Criterion, which

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.840
is probably the gold standard
of re-releasing stuff,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.300
they are always finding
new exciting directors.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.150
Actually, I just got
an email from them.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.370
They're having-- And also,
there's a lot of directors

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:44.319
overseas that you can
see their old films.

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.860
They're putting out-- I can't
remember the gentleman's name--

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.050
but there's a Japanese
director from the '50s

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.050
that I'd never heard of
that they're putting out

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.970
a box set of five of his films.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.740
So that's very exciting.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.300
There's all kinds
of stuff out there.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.360
I think you just have
to do-- research online,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.610
I think is probably
the best way.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.696
But you're not going to run out.

00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:05.070
There's a ton of
stuff out there.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:06.028
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:08.902 --> 00:43:12.850
AUDIENCE: OK, I guess
I'm curious are there

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:16.140
particular movies that you've
reviewed where you've gotten

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.250
a lot of like flack or blowback?

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.710
Do you have any stories
about that in particular?

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.900
KENNETH TURAN: There's one
that comes immediately to mind.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.640
I wrote several
times, more than once,

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.250
I was not a fan of "Titanic."

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.710
And I wrote several
negative pieces about it.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.200
And James Cameron wrote
a long open letter

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.040
to "The Times," which
"The Times" published,

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.730
demanding that I be fired.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.880
This really happened.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.970
And so that was probably
the strongest blowback

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.164
I've ever had.

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:55.330
But even before that, I
mean that was still the film

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:59.030
that I've gotten the most mail
about, both pro and con, people

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.670
who love the film and people
who didn't love the film.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:08.420
And with email, I get
more stuff than ever.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.901
So it happens.

00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:12.482
AUDIENCE: For what
it's worth, I was

00:44:12.482 --> 00:44:15.400
glad you wrote the critical
review of that film.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.726
KENNETH TURAN: Well, good.

00:44:16.726 --> 00:44:17.226
Thank you.

00:44:21.162 --> 00:44:24.550
AUDIENCE: So how
do you normalize

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.770
for kind of buzz or hype?

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.810
I mean, I know for
instance like you

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.670
said you didn't write your
review of "Boyhood" initially,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.700
because there was so much love
and you weren't as blown away

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.700
by it as everybody else.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.990
And for instance,
for me, I saw both

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.030
"Gravity" and "Guardians
of the Galaxy,"

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.510
what I consider to be peak buzz.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.930
But a couple weeks
after they came out,

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:47.638
everyone is saying
how amazing they were,

00:44:47.638 --> 00:44:51.090
and I was just kind of-- I
went in expecting a miracle

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.710
and, I was like, OK, it
was a good movie, whatever.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:58.850
So how do you, as a
critic, try to neutralize

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.290
the effect of that kind of--

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.040
KENNETH TURAN: No,
that's a good question.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.160
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.310
I mean, what I try and
do is avoid that stuff

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.420
as much as possible.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.880
I don't talk to people.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.180
I don't read stuff.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.290
I leave rooms when
conversations are going on.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:20.210
I want to go into the
film as cold as possible.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:25.260
I don't want to feel that
I'm reacting to the hype.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.960
I want to react to the film.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.870
So I try and avoid knowing
about the hype as much as I can.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.040
And also sometimes, studios
are sensitive to that.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.766
And they will show
the film to me early.

00:45:37.766 --> 00:45:39.390
Even if it's at a
festival, sometimes I

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.980
can see a film here
in LA so that I

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.120
can have an honest
experience and not

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.140
be reacting to
what everyone said.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.260
But with these big
films, it is a problem.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.006
And the way I can do it
is to try-- Publicists

00:45:55.006 --> 00:45:56.880
are always wanting to
talk to you about films

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.171
and tell you about their films.

00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:00.600
And I don't want to-- I
just want to see the film.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.837
And someone wanted to tell me
about, it wasn't even her film.

00:46:03.837 --> 00:46:05.670
It was another film
that she'd really liked.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.730
And I remember like I was in a
garage trying to get to my car.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.820
And I literally, I
ran away from her.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.100
I just said, I don't
want to hear it.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.720
But I think what you're talking
about for me is a real factor.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.850
And I really try-- I
try to know as little as

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.580
possible about a film going in.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.000
And that can be difficult,
but that's really my goal.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.530
AUDIENCE: So the
only thing I really

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:33.380
know about reviews is that
they come out on Fridays

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.850
or maybe a little bit earlier.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.230
How long does it take
you to write a review?

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.255
What is the turn?

00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:40.712
Or is their deadline?

00:46:40.712 --> 00:46:41.670
KENNETH TURAN: Oh, yes.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.190
There's always a deadline.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.750
For sure, there's a deadline.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.100
Yeah, my reviews they want--
they do come out on Friday.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.880
Again, the presence
of the online world

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.440
has changed things
somewhat, because we

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.690
have a lot of readers online
and they get the review earlier.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.630
My understanding is
that the reviews go up

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.010
online sometime on Thursday.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:13.100
So they need it from me, they
want it from me on Wednesday.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.350
And you know how long
it takes is partly

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.870
a function of how much time
the movie itself gives me.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.940
In other words,
sometimes the studios

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.190
are nervous about a film and
they won't show it to you

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.920
until the last minute.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.210
Sometimes if a review
is due Wednesday,

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.200
I won't see until Tuesday night.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.250
Sometimes I'll see it Wednesday
morning; I mean, this is rare.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.070
Sometimes, they
won't show it at all.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:41.900
But if a film is good
and they show it to me

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.862
with plenty of
time-- I mean, I like

00:47:43.862 --> 00:47:45.820
to have a certain amount
of time, I don't know,

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.044
ideally at least a week to
just let it sit in my mind.

00:47:49.044 --> 00:47:50.710
This is a week when
I don't do anything.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.097
When I'm just walking
around living my life

00:47:53.097 --> 00:47:54.430
and I'm thinking about the film.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.140
At odd random moments,
it'll pop into my mind,

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.620
and I'll get an idea
about what I'm thinking.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.550
So after it does that for
about a week, then I sit down

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.660
and I usually do it
in a day, two days,

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.020
depending on the film,
what else is going on.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.650
I type up my notes.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:12.800
I take a lot of notes.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.290
Critics don't always take notes.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.790
Some of my friends,
who are critics,

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.140
write almost nothing down.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.900
And they are able to retain it.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.840
But I have to take notes.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.390
So I take a lot of notes.

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.170
I type them up, which
gives me an idea

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:26.390
where my thoughts are going.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.090
Because when I see
overall what I've

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.120
been saying, as I just take
notes moment to moment.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.664
And when I type them up, I get
a sense of what I'm thinking.

00:48:33.664 --> 00:48:35.080
And then I sit
down with the notes

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.815
and I put together the review.

00:48:37.815 --> 00:48:39.190
And like I say,
the whole process

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.414
takes one to two
days for a film.

00:48:41.414 --> 00:48:42.830
AUDIENCE: And then
one other thing

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.760
is do you have time to watch
good television or YouTube

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.805
videos?

00:48:47.805 --> 00:48:48.930
KENNETH TURAN: Not as much.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.180
Well, sometimes when I'm
trying to waste time,

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.400
I'll see what's on YouTube.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.320
Writers are always
wanting to waste time.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.590
And again, with the television,
I don't have the time.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:48:59.923
That's why I just said, I binge.

00:48:59.923 --> 00:49:02.200
I take the stuff on
vacation with me.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.190
I have too heavy a
screening schedule

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:08.240
to really be able to watch
something on a regular basis.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.300
So if say, something my
friends tell me is good,

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.500
I will get the
whole season on DVD

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.865
and take it with me on vacation.

00:49:15.865 --> 00:49:17.490
And there is great
stuff on television.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.238
I just don't have
the time to watch it.

00:49:19.238 --> 00:49:20.034
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:49:20.034 --> 00:49:20.533
Thanks.

00:49:23.062 --> 00:49:24.890
KENNETH TURAN: OK, one
more, last question.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.080
AUDIENCE: OK, this
is actually more

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.790
a little bit of a
technical question.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.980
But some of the films that
are recommended on these lists

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.140
are a little bit obscure.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:38.035
And do you have any tips on
how or where to find them?

00:49:38.035 --> 00:49:40.010
KENNETH TURAN: Most,
I think-- In my book,

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.870
I think just about
everything is available.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.114
Even though they sound
obscure, and they are obscure,

00:49:46.114 --> 00:49:47.280
they're basically all there.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.320
I think the only thing
that really isn't there

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:54.740
in any findable form, believe it
or not, is a 1920s silent short

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.370
by a man named Max Davidson,
that the copy I have

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.300
is a European DVD that
won't play on American--

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.300
I've got a multi-region
DVD player.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.230
But everything else in the
book is available, certainly

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:11.270
for DVD rental or purchase
and probably for download.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.950
There's more out
there than you think.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:13.540
They're there.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.300
AUDIENCE: Let's all
thank Kenneth Turan

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.550
for joining us today.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.810
KENNETH TURAN: Thank you.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.360
