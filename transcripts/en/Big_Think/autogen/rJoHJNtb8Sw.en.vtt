disease also in the sense that it

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:07.660
disease also in the sense that it
 

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.500
disease also in the sense that it
metastasizes too many sites in the body

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.510
metastasizes too many sites in the body
 

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.890
metastasizes too many sites in the body
but the the the animals are killed so

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:13.900
but the the the animals are killed so
 

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.780
but the the the animals are killed so
quickly that it's usually not the

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:15.790
quickly that it's usually not the
 

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.260
quickly that it's usually not the
metastasis that caused them to succumb

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.270
metastasis that caused them to succumb
 

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.070

cancer so our basic question was really

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120
cancer so our basic question was really
 

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.220
cancer so our basic question was really
to try to understand the origins of this

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.230
to try to understand the origins of this
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.360

try to understand what cell type the
 

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.950
try to understand what cell type the

tumor is derived from so that we could
 

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.230
tumor is derived from so that we could
maybe gain some insight into why this

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240
maybe gain some insight into why this
 

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.740
maybe gain some insight into why this
tumor has such an unusual etiology and

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:42.750
tumor has such an unusual etiology and
 

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.290
tumor has such an unusual etiology and
also to try to understand why it is that

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:46.300
also to try to understand why it is that
 

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.180
also to try to understand why it is that
this tumor can spread from individual to

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.190
this tumor can spread from individual to
 

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.390
this tumor can spread from individual to
individual you know is that such an

individual you know is that such an
 

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.240
individual you know is that such an
unusual property we came at it from a

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.250
unusual property we came at it from a
 

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.420
unusual property we came at it from a
number of different perspectives first

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.430
number of different perspectives first
 

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.460
number of different perspectives first
really founded upon our work in small

really founded upon our work in small
RNA so each cell type expresses a

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120
RNA so each cell type expresses a
 

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.850
RNA so each cell type expresses a
specific repertoire of small RNAs that

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:08.860
specific repertoire of small RNAs that
 

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.160
specific repertoire of small RNAs that
it uses to regulate genes but that

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.170
it uses to regulate genes but that
 

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.050
it uses to regulate genes but that
repertoire is also kind of a signature

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
repertoire is also kind of a signature
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.930
repertoire is also kind of a signature
of the cell type that the des small RNAs

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:18.940
of the cell type that the des small RNAs
 

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.240
of the cell type that the des small RNAs
are expressed in so you can use a small

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.250
are expressed in so you can use a small
 

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.120
are expressed in so you can use a small

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.130
earn a signature to tell a mammary cell
 

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.610
earn a signature to tell a mammary cell
from a germ cell you can tell a nerve

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.620
from a germ cell you can tell a nerve
 

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.940
from a germ cell you can tell a nerve
cell from a muscle cell and so we

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:29.950
cell from a muscle cell and so we
 

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.460
cell from a muscle cell and so we
started off by asking what spectrum of

happens to be a schwann cell now what
 

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.240
happens to be a schwann cell now what
schwann cells are is essentially like

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760
the insulation on a wire they wrap nerve
 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.250
the insulation on a wire they wrap nerve
cells and act it essentially as an

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.260

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.240
 
well i mean i think that the two things

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.250
well i mean i think that the two things
 

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.160
well i mean i think that the two things
that really come out of the work that

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.170
that really come out of the work that
 

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.220
that really come out of the work that
we've done looking both of the tumor and

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.230
we've done looking both of the tumor and
 

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.420
we've done looking both of the tumor and
at the host animals are that the host

genetically homogeneous and so one I

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:30.510
genetically homogeneous and so one I
 

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.940

think insight that emerged from the

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:31.950
think insight that emerged from the
 

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.310
think insight that emerged from the
study was that the notion that the

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320
study was that the notion that the
 

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.710
study was that the notion that the
tumors may be able to spread from animal

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720
tumors may be able to spread from animal
 

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.270
tumors may be able to spread from animal
to animal you know essentially like a

to animal you know essentially like a
 

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.740
to animal you know essentially like a

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:39.750
metastasis but within a population
 

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.010
metastasis but within a population
rather than within an organism in part

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.020
rather than within an organism in part
 

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.750
rather than within an organism in part
because the animals can't recognize

vaccines have kind of a bad rap in part
 

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.200
vaccines have kind of a bad rap in part
because they haven't worked particularly

Tasmanian devils so one can really

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:48.780
Tasmanian devils so one can really
 

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.900
Tasmanian devils so one can really
envision two approaches one is the

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:50.910
envision two approaches one is the
 

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.550
envision two approaches one is the
approach that's being taken which is to

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560
approach that's being taken which is to
 

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.770
approach that's being taken which is to
take it to take a set of devils and set

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:54.780
take it to take a set of devils and set
 

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.440
take it to take a set of devils and set
them aside as an insurance population

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:57.450
them aside as an insurance population
 

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.730
them aside as an insurance population
and so you essentially sequester

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:00.740
and so you essentially sequester
 

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.580
and so you essentially sequester
disease-free devils with the idea that

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:03.590
disease-free devils with the idea that
 

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.050

you know should the population actually

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.290
you know should the population actually
go extinct in the wild you have animals

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300
go extinct in the wild you have animals
 

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.690
go extinct in the wild you have animals
to reintroduce now in that case we can

to reintroduce now in that case we can
 

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.380
to reintroduce now in that case we can
use the work that we've done which in

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.780
 
well so although each cancer is unique

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:55.790
well so although each cancer is unique
 

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.470

receptor-positive breast cancer so the

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.080
receptor-positive breast cancer so the
 

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.260
receptor-positive breast cancer so the
notion and this is one of the ways in

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.270
notion and this is one of the ways in

you can think about this is that cells
are designed or evolved to be robust and

about a Jenga tower and you're pulling

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:53.520
about a Jenga tower and you're pulling
 

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.150
about a Jenga tower and you're pulling
blocks out of the Jenga tower the more

blocks out of the Jenga tower the more
 

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.340
blocks out of the Jenga tower the more
blocks that you pull out the easier it

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.350
blocks that you pull out the easier it
 

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.190
blocks that you pull out the easier it
is to make that tower fall and what

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.200
is to make that tower fall and what
 

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.130
is to make that tower fall and what
people are doing with RNAi is is trying

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140
people are doing with RNAi is is trying
 

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.260
people are doing with RNAi is is trying
to figure out precisely what additional

fall where the tower wouldn't fall if

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:10.770
fall where the tower wouldn't fall if
 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.699

to resist the biological difficulties

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:24.209
to resist the biological difficulties

therapeutic target and so the idea is to

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.110
therapeutic target and so the idea is to
 

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.690

exploit common aspects of the genetics

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:34.700
exploit common aspects of the genetics
 

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.990
exploit common aspects of the genetics
to create therapies that that overcome

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000
to create therapies that that overcome
 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.140
to create therapies that that overcome
the individuality of the disease

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.150
 
 

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.460
 
well so although each cancer is unique

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:49.470
well so although each cancer is unique
 

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.150
well so although each cancer is unique
there are certain core pathways

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160
there are certain core pathways
 

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.650
there are certain core pathways
biological modules in essence that are

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:55.660
biological modules in essence that are
 

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.060
biological modules in essence that are
altered in nearly every cancer cell and

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.070
altered in nearly every cancer cell and
 

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.280
altered in nearly every cancer cell and
the number of those modules expands as

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.290
the number of those modules expands as
 

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.820
the number of those modules expands as
one gets more specific to a particular

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:05.830
one gets more specific to a particular
 

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.730

subtype let's say estrogen

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:08.740
subtype let's say estrogen
 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.750

receptor-positive breast cancer so the

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760
receptor-positive breast cancer so the
 

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.940
receptor-positive breast cancer so the
notion and this is one of the ways in

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:14.950
notion and this is one of the ways in
 

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.620
notion and this is one of the ways in
which i think RNAi is being deployed

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.630
which i think RNAi is being deployed
 

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.590

very powerfully is to try to correlate

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600
very powerfully is to try to correlate
 

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.650
very powerfully is to try to correlate
the vulnerabilities that are created by

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:22.660
the vulnerabilities that are created by
 

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.870
the vulnerabilities that are created by
the inactivation of those individual

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880
the inactivation of those individual
 

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.030
the inactivation of those individual
biological modules and then exploit that

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.040
biological modules and then exploit that
 

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.000
biological modules and then exploit that
vulnerability for therapy the way that

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.010

you can think about this is that cells

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:33.700
you can think about this is that cells
 

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.800
you can think about this is that cells
are designed or evolved to be robust and

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.990
average is about four years and three
months and in fact I graduated a student

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000
months and in fact I graduated a student
 

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.990
months and in fact I graduated a student
yesterday in three and a half years and

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000
yesterday in three and a half years and
 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.200
yesterday in three and a half years and
so you know the notion of bringing

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.210
so you know the notion of bringing
 

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.170
so you know the notion of bringing
people into research early and then

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.180
people into research early and then
 

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.930
people into research early and then
giving them an opportunity to do

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:37.940
giving them an opportunity to do
 

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.380
giving them an opportunity to do
independent work while they're you know

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:41.390
independent work while they're you know
 

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.410
independent work while they're you know
young and full of fire is I think a

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:44.420
young and full of fire is I think a
 

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.170
young and full of fire is I think a
really critical issue that the community

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:47.180
really critical issue that the community
 

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.980
really critical issue that the community
is trying to address

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:52.990
 
 

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.100
 
well I mean we work for the public if

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.110
well I mean we work for the public if
 

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.900
well I mean we work for the public if
you want to think about where the

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:57.910
you want to think about where the
 

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.419
you want to think about where the
funding comes for our research it comes

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:00.429
funding comes for our research it comes
 

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:01.740
funding comes for our research it comes
from the National Institutes of Health

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:01.750
from the National Institutes of Health
 

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.760

which is supported by taxpayers and I

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:05.770
which is supported by taxpayers and I
 

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.590

think consequently we have a real

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600
think consequently we have a real
 

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.500
think consequently we have a real
obligation to communicate science to the

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:10.510
obligation to communicate science to the
 

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.549
obligation to communicate science to the
public outreach I think should happen at

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559
public outreach I think should happen at
 

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:17.010
public outreach I think should happen at
every level I think that working

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.020
every level I think that working
 

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.830
every level I think that working
scientists should be interfacing with

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840
scientists should be interfacing with
 

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.310
scientists should be interfacing with
high schools for example going into to

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320
high schools for example going into to
 

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.580
high schools for example going into to
high school biology class rooms

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:25.590
high school biology class rooms
 

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.720
high school biology class rooms
communicating the excitement of their

outreach program something they call the

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:35.710
outreach program something they call the
 

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.669
outreach program something they call the
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to
 

00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:41.160
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to
bring middle school students high school

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.170
bring middle school students high school
 

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.820
bring middle school students high school
students into laboratories and expose

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:44.830
students into laboratories and expose
 

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.340
students into laboratories and expose
them to laboratory science I think it's

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:47.350
them to laboratory science I think it's
 

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.630
them to laboratory science I think it's
our obligation as scientists to to reach

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640
our obligation as scientists to to reach
 

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.160
our obligation as scientists to to reach
out to the public in the form of public

lecture series we also have a strong

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.220
lecture series we also have a strong
 

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.060
lecture series we also have a strong
public lecture program at the laboratory

I participate in it I know that that

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760
I participate in it I know that that
 

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.980

many of the other investigators that the

many of the other investigators that the
 

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.530
many of the other investigators that the
lab participate in it and I think that

lab participate in it and I think that
 

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.650
lab participate in it and I think that
that the public has to understand

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:10.660
that the public has to understand
 

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.230
that the public has to understand
science not only because they pay for it

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240
science not only because they pay for it
 

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.130
science not only because they pay for it
but because science is increasingly a

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.140
but because science is increasingly a
 

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.310
but because science is increasingly a
part of their everyday life and to go

come in the not-too-distant future when
you walk into a doctor's office and they

you walk into a doctor's office and they
 

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.900
you walk into a doctor's office and they
sequence at least part of your genome
