1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.000
Do you ever feel like you do too much?

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.240
Like maybe I just need to take a little break here.
Do you ever feel like that?

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.040
I think the perception definitely perceives reality.
You know,
uh,

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.130
what it looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.641
you know,

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:22.641
within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come and act as

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.610
downtime.
You know,

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.590
me and my house is downtime even though it's still active and I got to be dad

9
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:35.280
and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around in

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.100
the back and forth.
That's still acts is downtime for me.

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.140
Like I'm shutting the work off so the phone is in the office.

12
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.850
I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation.

13
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.270
It's all TV,
it's all Taco Tuesdays.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.950
It's couch and cuddling,
uh,
you know,
baby time,
whatever.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.110
That's my downtime because,
um,

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270
I've taken a step outside of the other shit that's was,
that's,

17
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:08.010
that's what I think I do very well.
I can step outside the other shit.

18
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.150
I can separate it.
So I think when you're able to do that,
then you're,

19
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.180
you're managing your,
your mental,
you know what I mean?
Like if it's,

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.580
if it's always one thing all the time,

21
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.370
that's how you fucking drive yourself crazy because you never,

22
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.930
you never shutting it off.
Yeah.
And I think I do a good job of shutting,

23
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.800
shutting this off and focusing on this.
Like when I'm with my family,

24
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:33.450
I'm with my family.
Nothing is,
nothing interjects or comes in between.

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.800
That's fantastic.
That's so important.
It's 100%.
That's beautiful.

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.490
100% shout out.
That's gigantic.
I think I figured it out.
That's it,
man.

27
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.181
I think I figured it out.

28
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.050
You mean you've got so much success as long as you have to be with that fucking

29
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:50.730
phone all the time.
That's the phone is the big one,
right?
The phone.
The phone is,

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.690
is the gift and the curse,
you know,
I think that we,

31
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.930
we shut out the gate and saw the Gif.
Oh my God.
It's,
it's,

32
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.770
it's community is connecting us.
We're able to share.

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.630
We're able to meet new people where we're able to stay in communication with,

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
with old people,
find new people.
As an entertainer,

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.710
I can engage with my fans and this is so dope.

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.260
And then after that you get hit with the curse.
And the curse is,

37
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:19.710
there's a,

38
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.240
there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that shit.

39
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.470
You know,
there's,
there's a lot of people that are,
you know,

40
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.630
not happy or,

41
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.160
or going through things and they interject a,

42
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:39.161
a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices.

43
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.930
These devices are the easiest way to touch everybody.

44
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.230
So when you're just consumed on that shit all day,

45
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.900
you start to see yourself being a part of the negative shit.
Yeah.

46
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.450
So what I've learned to do is go and I don't,
I don't need to see that.

47
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.450
I don't need to see that shit.
I don't,
I don't pay that any mind.

48
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.850
I don't read that shit for,
it's not,
it's not helping me.

49
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.050
It's not making me better.
It's not,
it's not a pushing me to new limits.

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.370
If anything is taken up,
just creative space by me.

51
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.140
Literally spending time going in,

52
00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:16.480
in and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of bullshit.

53
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.070
So I don't let the device beat me.
And at one point I definitely did.

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.090
At one point it was everything.
It was everything.
It was,
you know,
now separated.

55
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.550
I'm not clear of it.
What you've realized,
what are they?
Is when you see,

56
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.990
when you see the bed,
you know when you see the bad side of it.

57
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.480
I thought the other day this is some real shit and it really made me think my

58
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:41.314
phone died,

59
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.630
my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the fucking maps and I was like,

60
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:49.960
Oh shit,
what the fuck?
How am I get to work?

61
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.410
I don't know where I'm going.
And I sat and I was like,
Yo,
how did we,

62
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.890
how did we get from point a to point B before the map?
Shit,
what,

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.220
what are we doing that,
I used to print out directions from Google maps.

64
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.380
I remember that.
But then before that,

65
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.220
how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to

66
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:12.340
get to?
I don't even remember.
Do you remember Thomas Guides?

67
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.420
Do you ever have a Thomas Card?

68
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.820
I did have a Thomas Guide when I first moved to La.

69
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:20.821
I get one of them did have a guy giant ask a 100% bill burr had one or two or

70
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.770
three years ago.
I probably still uses it,

71
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.800
shuts off the pool but it really fucked me up because I was like how do we don't

72
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.160
even know how,
how to do the common,

73
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500
the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I

74
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:44.071
literally had to to drive to a store racket,

75
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:49.111
buy a charger to charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where

76
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.300
the fuck I was going.
I said I had no idea how to get there.
I had no,

77
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.740
I didn't know know numbers by heart.

78
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.490
I didn't know who I was going to call like Yo,

79
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.960
this is the moment where I was like,
what level of success have I reached?

80
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.480
I just pulled over and I sat there and I was like,

81
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:06.970
how the fuck am I going get the wrong goal?
Spare phone man.

82
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.450
I don't know what it went back up phone.
It felt like the end of the world.

83
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.170
It felt,
it felt like it was over.
I was like shit.

84
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.180
And that crazy how dependent you are.

85
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.070
But that's when the light bulb started to click.
Yeah,

86
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.880
it started to click.
Like how?
How do we function with out?

87
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.690
I want to go backwards a little bit.
Yeah,
it's still there.
I still need it.

88
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.350
I still think is dope with all of the things that we can do on it,

89
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.160
but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it.

90
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.770
I want my kids to be able to step away from it.

91
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.220
That's why when I come in the house,
my phone was up cause I can't,

92
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.790
I can't bitch and complain at all about being on your phone if you see me doing

93
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.360
the same thing.
Right.
So that time,
those conversations,

94
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.080
me wanting to know about your day,
you talking to me about your day,

95
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.310
your friends who you like,
who don't you like my daughter.

96
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.630
You what boy?
Who,
what?
No,
God,

97
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.690
my son.
Yeah.
I like somebody who,
oh,
Jesus.

98
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.930
Here in comms is,

99
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.780
it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know,

100
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.370
I think it's,
it's,
it's big to make sure that you prioritize that.

101
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.520
Are you worried about what comes next?
100%.

102
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.010
I'm worried that something's going to be way more intrusive than that.

103
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.060
It's what he means.
It's already happened.
The biggest scare happened already.

104
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.010
What the,
the,
the facetime shit that happened where,
well,

105
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.540
apple,
uh,
on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your,
oh yeah.

106
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:39.800
If you didn't need to pick up.
Yeah.
They could just listen into it and you know,

107
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:41.390
that was the scariest shit ever.

108
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.740
Because if it's that easy to have a bug like that,

109
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.280
what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about?

110
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.980
Oh,
there's definitely government listened to us.
100% yeah,

111
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.960
100% everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong,

112
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.780
they go back to your side.
Mr. Hart,
we would like you to sit down for a minute.

113
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.240
Why am I you something hundred percent.

114
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.540
So the fear is the next level of the merge intrusive,

115
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.170
you know,
everything is become intrusive now.

116
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.960
Like the toughest thing for me is that there is no,

117
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.850
there is no privacy outside my home.
Right.
You know,

118
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:20.630
the,

119
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.630
the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on,

120
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.500
you know,
people to to be with me,
security to be on my home.

121
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.891
You know,

122
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:35.720
it's like there literally is no privacy and it's not a bitch and complain about

123
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.300
it because without the fans,
without the people that support me,

124
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.600
I wouldn't be where I am.
But there is no middle ground.
Right.
You know,

125
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.600
there is no handshakes anymore.
It's,
it's how you doing.
Right,
right,

126
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.440
right.
Yeah.
The handshake is so much better to get a moment like,
um,

127
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.540
we can talk if that's what you know.
Nah.

128
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.160
Yo saying now it's kind of weird cause you,
you're doing this to me,

129
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.920
it's kind of weird to have a conversation.

130
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:05.720
So you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh,

131
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.040
just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're

132
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:15.041
going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground.

133
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:19.730
Because I think right now there isn't one.
Yeah,
that's what I'm feeling now.
No,

134
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.310
I feel it too.
And especially,

135
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.000
I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your

136
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.890
privacy,
but everyone's losing their privacy then slowly but surely it's,

137
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:33.800
it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something

138
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.920
that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick their

139
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:37.754
camera in front of you.

140
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.680
But there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now,

141
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.630
which is like you have to turn your phone on,
you have to,
you know,

142
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:48.620
you have to reach out to somebody,
you have to put something up that's,

143
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.260
that step's going to be out of the way and it's just going to be people being

144
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.680
able to access your life.
Yeah.
Pretty.
You know,
you know the bed.

145
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.680
Here's what I'll say is bad.
That really fucks with me.

146
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.120
I don't like that negativity is the the want.

147
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.420
Yeah.
Like,
like the,

148
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.290
the thing that's popular is the failure.

149
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.150
The fuck up.
You know,
the,
the fight,

150
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.180
the racking catch the hate for moment that I can catch in posts like the bed is

151
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.890
being highlighted and celebrated.
That's what fucks with me.

152
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.690
What the social media shit.
Now what,
what really bothers me is,
you know,

153
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.080
when you see these things online,
like you know,

154
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.800
a fight and there was a man hitting a woman and is captured.
Right.

155
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.013
That's bad.

156
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.920
The bad thing is that you watched that the video was more important than the

157
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:54.210
actual help or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things

158
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.640
where you're catching people do these things,

159
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:01.641
the kids and this caught the moment of what you got in what you want to post and

160
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.090
get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help and that and that's,

161
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.410
that's the part that is just,
I just have a hard time processing.

162
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.440
I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people,

163
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.060
but you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to

164
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:27.090
you.
It means something to a regular person,
a regular person.

165
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.690
They can catch some worldstar video and put it up there like,
dude,

166
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.260
that's my video.
That's my video.
My video got 5 million hits,

167
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.290
my video has gone viral,
my videos everywhere.

168
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.660
For them it's like it's a point of excitement.

169
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.640
That's why when they see you they're like,
oh shit.

170
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.450
How often are they going to run into Kevin Hart at Costco or wherever the fuck

171
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:49.680
you were.
Definitely running right up to me on,
uh,
you know,
I'm in a,

172
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:54.150
I'm in the bathroom,
um,
restaurant and I go to the bathroom,

173
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.610
you know,
by the way that I went to the bathroom,

174
00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:00.870
you could definitely tell I had to shit.
I was,
I was moving fast.
I was,

175
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.750
you know,
it was one of those abrupt,
you know why you're eating.
Yeah,

176
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.380
I'm eating bad.
So I didn't eat bad and wow,

177
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.810
my stomach immediately said this is not gonna happen today.

178
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.150
So I get up and I go and literally like,

179
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.760
like three seconds.
I hear it as I'm walking over to go Kev heart.

180
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.760
And as I'm walking by,
a guy gets up,

181
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:27.630
follows me in the bathroom and he's like,
y'all gotta get a picture man.

182
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.480
And I said,
let me,
let me go to the bathroom when I'm done,

183
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:34.140
I'll take a picture with you.
I go to the bathroom.
This is a true story.

184
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:36.570
Hand her Bible hand on the Bible.

185
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.800
I assume the guy is outside the bathroom cause I,
as I'm going,

186
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:45.300
I seen him and I say what I say,
I get done.
I go to the sink,

187
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:48.960
wash my hands.
He was just sitting behind a wall and he's like,

188
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:51.120
got his phone out and I'm like,
he probably did.

189
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:52.860
He just take me while I was shitting.

190
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.850
Did he put the phone over to thing like I'm about to be on.

191
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.440
Oh my God,
it's over.
This is it.
This is my nightmare.
Here we go.

192
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.800
They're about to put something up of me.
Shitting is the bottom of my feet.

193
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.770
It's whatever.
But he's just waited.
And in that moment was so,

194
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.830
it was so important that he was in the bathroom and,

195
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.650
and as soon as I got a call and let's take an asset,

196
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.530
let's go outside the bathroom.
Yeah,
let's take a picture that's a bathroom.

197
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.010
I said,
I'm not going to,
I'm a nice guy,
man.
I'm gonna take the picture.

198
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.380
He's actually saying didn't want to lose you.
And I'm like,

199
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.120
there's not even a thought.

200
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.590
It's not even a thought about it's a bath.
Right.

201
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:35.130
So weird is that it's a bad thing,
man.
This is,
this is it.

202
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.450
This is a pretty fucking weird moment,
man.

203
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.370
This is weird when you should waited for me to finish it and I don't know what

204
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.090
you got on your phone.
You're too big for me to ask to go through your phone.

205
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.580
Whatever you get you get.

206
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.120
But I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table

207
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:57.040
just like,
what's happening?
What's Hash range at this point?

208
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.860
What is happening?
Yeah.
That didn't exist before.

209
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:01.060
I think if you were famous before,

210
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:04.660
people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand.
What pat?
We're past.

211
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.960
The autograph stage was the last time you get an autograph.
It's been awhile.

212
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.860
I don't think that,
I don't think I would know how to write it.

213
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.970
I think I would know what to put down.
It's been a minute,
man.
Yeah.
And I don't,

214
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.930
and I want to make this very clear,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

215
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.180
I understand.
Like once again,

216
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:26.020
I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it.

217
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.970
I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame,

218
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.530
but it should be that like it's normal to date.

219
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.140
The moments are better when they're real,
you know,

220
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:43.030
and after a real moment you,
you get a picture because you're like,
Yo,

221
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.140
he was actually a nice guy or I had no idea that,

222
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.360
that you would be this calm and cool.

223
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.230
You don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing

224
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:58.000
you do,
you stick the camera in the face,
you,

225
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.060
and that's when people think that you're an asshole because they,
they,
they,

226
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.700
they had the intrusive moment that then gets met with it.
Can you,
can you please,

227
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.980
I'm sorry.
You don't have to just take it to my face.
Dang.

228
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:13.210
You ain't gotta be like that.
Wait,
did look for that.
Yeah.
Turn on you.

229
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.240
Because now you get your moment.
You look for the negative moment.

230
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.900
When did shit circuit and weird for you?
How many years in?
Um,

231
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.510
I know it's been,
it's been pretty crazy.

232
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.690
It's been pretty crazy for like the last four to five,

233
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.370
the last four to five years and the last three,
you know,

234
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:32.860
if it's gotten insane because now you know,
you're,

235
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.670
you're on the international level,

236
00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:39.160
so it's global and the following theirs is bigger.

237
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.590
Um,
and it's all ages,
which is,
which is really,
really good.
But I think,
you know,

238
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:49.591
for Comedians it's a different thing because you feel like,

239
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:53.840
you know,
Comedians,
you know,
you're laughing,
we're in your homes,

240
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.940
everything is met with warmth.
So when you see a comedian,

241
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.470
especially if you're a fan of a comedian,

242
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.470
you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny

243
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:08.150
moment.
You're,
you're looking past the normal moment,

244
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.890
you know,
it's like you almost are frowned upon if you're normal,

245
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.610
if you're just chill.
Right,
right,
right.
Cause everybody wants to find the moment.

246
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.910
Right.
They thought you were going to be funny all the time.
I'm supposed to,

247
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.420
I was supposed to pop lock
right on site.
You know,

248
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.420
if it's two in the morning and you run into me and I said,
hey,
how you doing?
Man?

249
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.260
That's not enough.
