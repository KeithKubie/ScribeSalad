Man, y'all did a great job, man.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.414
We all fired up
for the show, man.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.083
- That shit was funny,
but that was stupid, though.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.184
- I mean, I'ma tell you
right now,

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.552
y'all should still hire us,
though,

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.354
'cause I think we got, like,
similar, like, you know,

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.822
sense of humor
and all that, man.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:24.258
And we can enhance your shit,
you know, man?

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.659
Like, there was
a scene last night

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.661
that we have to talk to y'all
about right now,

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.264
'cause, you know what I mean,
sometimes, like--

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.099
Okay, you know what it is,
like, slavery...

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.166
- That shit is
fucked up, though.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.434
- Is not funny.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.236
Like, it's not funny,
you know what I mean?

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.005
But if you can make it funny,

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.040
like, you got to make it
real funny.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.442
'Cause, like, when y'all was
the slaves and everything, man,

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.944
the slaves kept on getting mad

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:45.412
'cause they wasn't
getting bought, you know?

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.813
- That was messed up, man.
- And all the other slaves

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.415
would come out and get bought,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.417
and then they'd be like, "Man,
why ain't they buying my ass?"

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.919
- That shit's stupid.
- And that ain't funny, man.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.387
- Stupid.
- That ain't funny at all.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.489
I mean, why in the world
would you want to get bought?

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.490
- Stupid.
- I don't even understand that,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.891
man.
It don't make any sense, man.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.360
The whole thing
that would be funny

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.062
is, like, why?

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.130
Like, why is it funny?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.464
Like, why are they
not getting bought?

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.832
I'll tell you why they
ain't getting bought.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.234
Tell 'em.
- Nah, man.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.902
- 'Cause they got little dicks!
- Got little dicks.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.138
- They ain't get bought 'cause
they got little dicks, man.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.073
All the other slaves
got big-ass dicks.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.808
And what you have is,

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.810

that are buying the slaves

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.945

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.613

bigger dicks, man.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.917

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.289
"Give me some bigger dicks."

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.958
- Oh, then make it

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.829
- Oh, yeah, then they should

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.300
And he be up in there

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.873
