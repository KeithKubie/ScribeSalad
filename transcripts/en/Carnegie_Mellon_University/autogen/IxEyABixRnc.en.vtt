this is a strange machine and you know

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:24.710
this is a strange machine and you know
 

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.260
this is a strange machine and you know
is it just kids coming in to do

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:26.270
is it just kids coming in to do

learning and working with them we were
able to get an incredible reception in

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:39.890

fact it's really revitalized the
libraries in rural areas even more so

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360
libraries in rural areas even more so
 

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.420
libraries in rural areas even more so
than in urban areas but in both I'd say

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:46.430
than in urban areas but in both I'd say
 

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.980
than in urban areas but in both I'd say
and so that's that's been very

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:47.990
and so that's that's been very
 

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.810

have have the interactive learning be

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600
have have the interactive learning be

actually well understood now that what's
 

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.630
actually well understood now that what's
going on is that in a household you're

you have the more you have to get this
