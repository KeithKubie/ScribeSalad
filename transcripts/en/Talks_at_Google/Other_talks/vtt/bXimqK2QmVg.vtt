[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.720
JACOB SOVIERO: I'd
like to take a second

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.540
and talk to you about somebody.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.820
This gentleman served
in the active duty

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.490
in the United States Army
for three years from 2003

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.100
until 2006.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.770
He served at the 3rd
Battalion 21st Infantry

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.610
Regiment, an element of the
1st brigade, 25th Infantry

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.570
Division.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.570
October, 2004, he was
deployed to Mosul, Iraq

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.030
to support Operation
Iraqi Freedom.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.430
Currently, he serves at the
National Veteran Liaison

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.310
for Project Welcome Home Troops,
a program of International

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.801
Association over Human Values.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.050
He also travels around the
country giving intro talks,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.390
organizing, and assisting,
and teaching the power breath

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.210
method, workshops for veterans,
their families, and active duty

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.140
military.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.194
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Tom Voss.

00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:56.162
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:09.160
Thank you.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.199
And we're actually
lucky enough today.

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:13.740
Tom is actually going to lead
us in a little bit of the power

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.290
breath method that you saw
at the end of the film, which

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.289
I thought was fantastic.

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.960
So without further ado, Tom.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.660
TOM VOSS: Yeah, thanks
for everyone coming.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.680
This is really great to
see you all of you showing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.590
up and watching my life.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.790
It's pretty strange for
me, so thanks for coming.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.680
But first thing we
thought we would do

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.160
is just teach you a little
bit of some intro breathing

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.000
techniques.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.570
So what we're going
to learn is called

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.790
alternate nostril breathing.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.100
It sounds just like what it is.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.120
All we're going to be doing
is breathing alternately

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.320
through each nostril.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.660
It has a nice calming effect.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.560
This is something that you can
do if you have high anxiety

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.897
or you're feeling a
little bit nervous.

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:03.730
It's just a nice, quick
breathing technique.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.090
So what we're going
to be doing is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.810
we're going to be
taking our index finger

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.610
and our middle
finger, and we're just

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.860
going to be placing them
in between our eyebrows

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.590
right here.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.470
It's pretty simple.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.950
And then we're going to take
our thumb and ring finger,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.533
and these two are actually going
to be the ones that are going

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.855
to be closing off our nostrils.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.650
So what we're all
going to do first

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.180
is take a normal breath
in through our nose,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.630
and breathe out
through the nose.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.890
Let's do that one more time.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.156
Breathing in through the
nose and exhaling out.

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:42.530
So now, what we're going to
do is close our right nostril

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.610
with our thumb, and inhale
through the left nostril.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.130
Switching, exhaling
out through the right.

00:02:56.098 --> 00:03:03.590
In through the right,
and now through the left.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.590
And you can close your eyes, if
you're comfortable doing that.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.320
In through the left, and
out through the right.

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:19.090
Now, you can just continue
on your own at your own pace,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.943
taking nice deep breaths.

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:24.887
[DEEP BREATHS]

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.300
See if you can make the
breaths just a little deeper.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.620
And keeping the eyes closed,
you can drop your hand.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.330
Just rest it in your lap.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.313
Return to normal breathing.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.050
I want you to think
of one thing that you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.570
are grateful for in your life.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.430
And slowly and gradually,
you may open your eyes

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.180
at your own pace.

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:20.506
OK.

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:21.861
How's everyone doing?

00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:22.360
Good?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.746
How was that?

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:25.594
Cool.

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:26.980
Awesome.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.470
I think after that, we're ready
to start the discussion panel

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.805
in a nice, more grounded space.

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:36.000
I know that film can be a
little intense at times,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.110
but I'm glad you all made it.

00:05:40.732 --> 00:05:42.380
JACOB SOVIERO: So
without further ado,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.224
I'd like to bring up
the rest of the panel,

00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:45.640
and I'll bring
them up one by one.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.190
I'm going to quickly
read their bios.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.220

to investigate, to explore
their mechanisms of action

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.380
and how they relate to both
mental and psychological

the impact of
killing in veterans

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.200

And we also have Michael Collins
joining us from the team.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.800
We've already given
his bio, so I'm not

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.841
going to talk about that.

00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:00.770
Thank you for joining.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.330
So without further ado, I'd
like to kick the panel off.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.290
And I think the first best
question that we could probably

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.010
ask is this one.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.426
We see a gentleman
sitting up here

00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:11.314
that we've seen on screen, maybe
with a bit less of a beard.

00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:12.980
But I'm sure we'd all
like to know, Tom,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.355
could you tell us a little
bit about what's been going on

00:08:15.355 --> 00:08:16.950
in your life since the film?

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.283
TOM VOSS: Yeah, a lot, actually.

00:08:18.283 --> 00:08:21.260
I've been traveling around with
the film doing talks like this

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.950
and also organizing
workshops for veterans.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.760
So the power breath
meditation workshop

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.493
that you saw in the film is--

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:33.409
Project Welcome Home
Troops as an organization

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.190
that I volunteer for, and
it's something, as you saw,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.179
that had a huge
impact in my life.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.380
And before taking
that workshop, you

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.950
wouldn't have caught me dead in
a yoga and/or breathing class.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.140
But you know, I was
to a point where

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.960
I was able to try anything
to kind of feel better

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.750
and to move forward
with my life.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.140
So it has had a
tremendous impact on me,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.860
and I'm just trying to share
that with as many veterans

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.462
and civilians alike.

00:09:02.462 --> 00:09:04.170
JACOB SOVIERO: That's
awesome. thank you.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.166
TOM VOSS: Thank you.

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:07.040
JACOB SOVIERO: So I'd
like to actually start.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.039
We saw that a little bit
in the end in the film.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:12.140
We talked about PTSD and
moral injury, moral dilemma,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.852
and the difference
between the two.

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:16.310
I'm having, Dr. Maguen, could
you tell us a little bit more

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.450
about the relationship
between PTSD and moral injury?

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.700
SHIRA MAGUEN: Absolutely.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.460
Absolutely.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.120
Well, first, I want
to just say that I

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.535
think PTSD is more
of a diagnosis,

00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.610
so that's really
important to recognize,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.790
whereas moral injury is more
something that we think about

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.670
on a continuum.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.630
It's a problem that
people face, but one

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.550
that is not a diagnosis.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.980
And as we saw in the
film, it's really

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.880
about feeling like you
crossed over some line that

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.290
goes against your--

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.200
that you went against your own
moral beliefs and expectations

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.540
and that, as a
result, you're really

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.920
having some struggles or some
inner conflict in relation

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.420
to that.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.100
So when we think
about PTSD, PTSD

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.720
is really made up of
several different symptoms.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.590
And so with PTSD,
you really think

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.650
about a person having
re-experiencing symptoms,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.410
meaning they're having
nightmares or dreams about what

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.520
happened to them as an example.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.520
They also avoid in a
great respect reminders

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.840
of what happened to them while
they were deployed, reminders

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.910
of the emotional experience
that they might have felt,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.140
so if they felt fear
or guilt or shame,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.220
they try to avoid
those emotions as well.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.540
And then, the third
part of PTSD is arousal,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.260
and so you saw in the
film that difficulty

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.030
with anger or difficulty falling
asleep or feeling like you

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.790
were just on constant alert or
that you were easily startled.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.150
And so those three pieces
really make up PTSD.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.150
In addition to that,
people also sometimes

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.920
have thoughts
about what they did

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.320
or what they experience that can
cause them to really feel down

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.330
or to want to isolate.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.820
With moral injury,
again, the idea

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.110
is that you have crossed some
line and that as a result,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.640
really, you feel some deep guilt
and some deep shame, possibly,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.950
and also some isolation.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.280
And in addition to
that, there is a failure

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.290
to be able to forgive
yourself for what you did.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.160
And so I think that that was
really very nicely highlighted

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.430
in the film that the
struggle was really

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.390
with how you saw yourself
as a person and a struggle

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.590
with the failure to forgive,
and once that was tackled,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.377
it really helped the person
to cross that line and heal.

00:11:47.377 --> 00:11:49.710
And in many cases, we see
that with many of the veterans

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.302
that we work with as well.

00:11:51.302 --> 00:11:53.760
And so I think that, really,
if we think about it as a Venn

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.110
diagram, you can have PTSD,
and you can have moral injury.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.870
And those things do
have a lot of overlap,

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.870
but you can also have
PTSD without moral injury

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.480
and moral injury
without PTSD as well.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.010
And so I think that, again,
if we think about PTSD

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.730
with really having PTSD as
a result of something that

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.870
happened to you--

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.020
being exposed to a lot of
IEDs, a lot of explosions,

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.670
your body is on alert--

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.650
that's more what
PTSD looks like.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.240
And moral injury is more about
guilt and shame and a failure

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.940
to forgive oneself that
can really lead to things

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.020
that we saw in the film like
suicide, like sabotaging

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.020
your relationships.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.820
And sometimes that
inner conflict,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.500
that once you find
that inner peace,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.820
things can go very,
very differently.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.370
So hopefully, that helps
with clarifying the two

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.270
to a little bit--
to a greater extent.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.070
JACOB SOVIERO:
Thank you very much.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.956
This is one I'd like to
actually open up to the panel.

00:12:52.956 --> 00:12:54.330
During World War
II, our veterans

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.820
were welcomed home
with parades, confetti.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.680
Everybody knows the
famous V-J picture,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.430
where sailor's kissing
his lovely lady

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.270
in the middle of Times Square.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.970
But now our veterans come
home to racial tension,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.300
political unrest, and
an unknown future.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.980
What kind of effect
does this now

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.220
have on our veterans as
opposed to when we were

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.950
coming home in World War II?

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.114
I'd live to hear from anybody.

00:13:18.114 --> 00:13:19.280
TOM VOSS: That's a nice fun.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.760
Anyone want to take it?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.130
I mean, I can talk from
the veteran's perspective

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.730
a little bit.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.160
I mean, for me, me coming
home was difficult for me,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.440
because when I got back
from my deployment,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.840
I was out of active
duty within two months.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.250
So I came home
from a combat zone,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.050
and then two months later,
I was back home in Wisconsin

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.140
sitting on my mom's couch.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.960
And it was surreal for me
to see that my friends were

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.150
doing the exact same things that
they were doing when I left.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:57.520
And I had this awesomely
terrifying experience of war.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.220
And so I had no one
to connect with,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.440
and then you start seeing the--

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.280
I remember just coming home and
seeing how many advertisements

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.196
there were, and that
just, like, blew me away.

00:14:08.196 --> 00:14:10.510
I was like, wow, everyone
was running around,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.970
and everything was so much
faster when I came back.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.774
So there's this big disconnect
within myself to really--

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:21.190
I just felt like I couldn't--
there's no way I can connect

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.130
with anyone, because no one's
going to understand what

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.270
I've just been through.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.840
So I think that on
top of that, you

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:35.230
see the social unrest and
the things that are going on.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.115
At least for me, it
was like, OK, we're

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:40.480
over here fighting these
wars, and then we come back,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.070
and it's just like as turbulent,
if not worse, back home.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.950
So then that pulls
into question,

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.850
what was I participating in?

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.800
What was I doing?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.580
And I know that
Anthony's turning point

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.547
was when he was a
convoy commander,

00:14:57.547 --> 00:14:58.630
and he was driving across.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.260
He was escorting a
convoy across Iraq,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.510
and when he got to where
he was going-- like,

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.290
literally driving across
the whole country of Iraq--

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.497
he asked the driver of the semi
truck, what are you guys doing?

00:15:11.497 --> 00:15:12.580
What are you guys hauling?

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.663
They're like, oh, nothing.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.640
We're just making a
quota for our run.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.360
And that's when he started
questioning, what are we doing?

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.470
What am I doing right now?

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.540
Like I'm risking my guy's
life, so they can make

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.160
a quota for their contract.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.230
So there's a lot of
internal questioning

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.550
that goes on, at least
for me when I come home.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.670
JACOB SOVIERO: Thank you.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.380
PETER BAYLEY: Speaking from
a non-veteran perspective,

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.600
but something that
I hear from veterans

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.990
is there's a huge
amount of training that

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:46.300
goes into training to be a
soldier, something that you

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.880
touched on in the documentary--
this many months of over

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.280
and over repetitive
muscle memory

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.160
that can really ingrained.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.980
And when you're coming
back, when you're returning,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.690
there's no training
how to turn that off.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.310
You're sort of back in society.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:12.370
There's no untraining of that,
and so I hear from the veterans

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:18.670
that I work with that that's a
basic problem, that there isn't

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.840
the understanding
of how to untrain,

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.390
if that's the right word.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.430
Or people often use
the word "extinction"

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.235
in the more cognitive level--

00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:35.945
how to extinguish that, and
that's one of the dynamics.

00:16:35.945 --> 00:16:36.820
JACOB SOVIERO: Great.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.870
Thank you.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.300
So one of the things we just
heard about a little bit

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.970
was just about some
of those tension, that

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.390
feeling when you come back, and
some of those anxiety feelings

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.290
that you have.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.210
So some of the symptoms
of PTSD are often

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.840
expressed through the
body, things like increased

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.271
heart rate and hypervigilance.

00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:56.020
What are some of the
alternative treatment

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.450
methods that are studying
and training right now?

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.910
Dr. Bayley, we'd love
to hear from you.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.725
PETER BAYLEY: So some of
the alternative treatments

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:05.440
is-- well, one of
them is just what

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.400
we saw at the very end
of that documentary,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:16.630
where the power breath, or
Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, is used.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.990
That's still in an
experimental stage.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.390
We're actually running a
clinical trial right now

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.599
at the VA in Palo
Alto comparing that

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.700
to the best practice
in clinical medicine,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.720
comparing its effectiveness.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.240
Some of the other known
nonstandard treatments

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.650
are things like acupuncture.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.830
That's also fairly widely used.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:51.010
And biofeedback is another one,
biofeedback using, perhaps,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:55.600
stimuli that are eliciting
some of the anxiety

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.620
or the symptoms
of PTSD and trying

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.510
to pair it up with a more
relaxation kind of a response.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:09.320
These kind of things are
really still in their infancy.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.510
Yoga is one other type
of treatment as well.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:19.730
Again, it's not as widely used
a treatment as you might think.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.879
It sounds like a good
treatment, and there

00:18:22.879 --> 00:18:24.670
was some preliminary
evidence to say it is.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.440
But it's lacking in large
trials to really show

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.710
that that's as effective as some
of the other treatments that

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.849
are currently available.

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:33.890
JACOB SOVIERO: Thank you.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.380
No, it's amazing that we're
looking outside the box

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.410
and trying to search
for new answers.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.714
I would like to ask,
actually, Dr. Purcell, what

00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:43.130
are some of the
things in programs

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.860
that the VA has in action
to support or veterans

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.589
struggling with PTSD
and moral injury?

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:49.880
And what advice can you give
to those veterans that are

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.502
looking and seeking for help?

00:18:52.502 --> 00:18:53.960
NATALIE PURCELL:
Well, I was really

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.110
struck at the end
of the movie, Tom,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.320
when you actually spoke
to Congress about this,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.290
about advocating for
meditation to become

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.950
a part of the services
that the VA offers.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.220
And I think, increasingly,
at a national level,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.520
there's a recognition
at VA that we really

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.180
need to increase the range of
complimentary and integrative

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.000
health services that are
available to veterans.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.580
And there's a
commitment to a vision

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.040
of care called Whole Health.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.790
In a national presentation from
the Office of Patient-Centered

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.850
Care and Cultural Transformation
about the direction

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.310
that the VA is going
in for the future,

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.000
there's a quote from Plato
that really sticks with me

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.540
and, I think, really captures
where the VA is headed.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.170
And I hope I remember
the quote correctly,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.490
but it's something
to the effect of,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.090
you shouldn't attempt
to cure the eyes

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.020
without the head or the head
without the body, so nor should

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.600
you attempt to cure the
body without the soul,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.470
because the part can never be
well unless the whole is well.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.140
And so there's an increasing
recognition that we really

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.100
need to deliver a kind of care
that gets at the whole person,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.980
at the physical, at
the psychological,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.650
at the biological,
at the social,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.690
and at the spiritual level.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.200
And at the VA, we're really
working to improve access

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.300
to the range of programs
that really touch

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.540
on those different aspects
of veterans' experiences

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.070
and their lives.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.680
Right now, actually,
as we're sitting here,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.920
we have four physicians from the
San Francisco VA Medical Center

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.750
who are in Los Angeles
getting training

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.820
in battlefield acupuncture.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.630
And we've been working to
build community partnerships

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.910
with organizations like our
YMCA and even our local San

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.750
Francisco SPCA to bring programs
like our strength and wellness

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.620
program with yoga and Tai
Chi, animal-assisted therapy

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.560
programs to veterans,
so really opening up

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.170
the range of treatment
options that are available.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.290
And one thing that I
just want to mention

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.790
is as we saw in the film,
there is no such thing

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:09.860
as a one size fits all solution
for PTSD or moral injury

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.850
or the wide range of experiences
and struggles that veterans

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.930
face when they come back.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.650
And it's important to
recognize that there

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.170
is this sort of range of
options that are available

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.590
and that you have the
opportunity, if one

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.720
thing doesn't work, reach out.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.370
Try something else.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.792
Don't give up.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:32.250
JACOB SOVIERO:
Thank you very much.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.785
So one question I
had for the panel.

00:21:34.785 --> 00:21:38.450
How do gender and race play
into the likelihood of veterans

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.220
deciding to seek
help with the VA

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.860
or elsewhere for the first time?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.430
SHIRA MAGUEN: I think
there is incredible shame

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.490
and stigma associated to
seeking any kind of treatment.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.210
And so I think that's
the first thing

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.930
to remember across
race, across gender.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.980
And so I think that it was
incredibly brave of Tom

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.580
to go out there
and tell his story.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.870
And you know, it's incredible to
be able to witness that for all

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.230
of us, for him to share
all of that with us,

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.400
and that's not a
common situation.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.430
And so I think
that a piece of it

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.990
is really recognizing how
profound the stigma is

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.710
in all of veterans, who may--
there are a lot of barriers

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.642
to seeking care
and to getting help

00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:30.100
and to reaching
out and even saying

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.580
that you might need help.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.910
And so I think that
that's the first piece.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.160
And so I know that there
are a lot of people

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.550
in the audience who are
veterans, who know veterans,

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.690
who love veterans.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.770
You might be a boyfriend, a
girlfriend, a wife, a partner,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.550
a good friend.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.760
And so I think the first
piece of that is also

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.950
thinking across
gender and race lines

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.730
in terms of what we can all
do in terms of the community

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.000
to really help reach out
and support veterans, who

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.980
need care to get care.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.810
So I think that's
the first thing.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.830
I think in terms of race
and gender specifically,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.170
the VA is actually doing a
lot to recognize that there

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.969
are similarities in
people, who need care,

00:23:12.969 --> 00:23:14.260
and there are also differences.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.850
And so the things that we
can do to specifically help

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.760
women to get to the
VA are very important,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.190
because predominantly,
in the past,

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.420
it's been the VA has felt
more comfortable to some men

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.030
than to women.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.240
And so I think
just having images

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.260
on our walls of
women who have served

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.810
goes a long way in really--

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.980
and we have a women's clinic, in
particular, where women can go,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.140
where they can get
care separate from men

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.530
and also be integrated in
their care with men as well.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.090
In terms of race
and ethnicity, I

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:50.320
think being sensitive to the
ways in which race can affect

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.400
someone's military service
and the certain degrees

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.830
of discrimination that
people might face.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.900
And that can be a
part of the trauma

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.490
that they experience
as well, so just

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.250
being really aware
of that in their care

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.639
can be very, very important, so.

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:07.680
JACOB SOVIERO: Thank you.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.990
So I'd like to ask Michael
a question quickly.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.300
How have you seen the
responses to the film,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.957
obviously, leading up to
PBS coming on Veterans Day?

00:24:14.957 --> 00:24:17.040
How have you seen the
responses to the screenings,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.135
and what kind of things have
you taken away from them?

00:24:20.135 --> 00:24:22.260
MICHAEL COLLINS: Well,
we've been touring with them

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.676
for about a year
and a half, and I

00:24:23.676 --> 00:24:26.040
have to say every
audience is different.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.920
But I think what
keeps me going is

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.760
that so many of the responses
are just so emotional.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.936
You know, I think the
civilian response has been

00:24:34.936 --> 00:24:36.060
one of the most surprising.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.450
We really thought we were making
this film to give veterans

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.130
and their families
hope that there

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.421
were other paths of healing,
if they felt like they had

00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:45.570
exhausted everything
sort of clinically that

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.570
was out there, that there
were these other kind of paths

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.140
of healing.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.660
But it's a lot of the
civilians coming up and saying,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.160
I had no idea.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.890
Now, I want to go and
talk to my neighbor

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.590
and say something besides,
thank you for your service.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.230
Like it's breaking
down some barriers,

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.280
I'm noticing, in people.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.760
It's just creating a
connection in audiences,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.820
and it's different.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.560
When I play to an
audience of Vietnam vets,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.140
it's very different when
it's college students.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.710
And every single
time, it's different,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.040
but every single
time, yeah, there's

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.290
just something that I
learned that I take away

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.641
and that I'm seeing people
are saying the same thing.

00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:26.640
And then they're wanting
to, then, take the film

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.889
and bring it back home and
bring it to their community

00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:29.910
and things like that.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.720
So we've been working to try
to figure out ways to do that,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.400
to make the film
available for everyone.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.499
And we have some ways that
I can talk about after.

00:25:38.499 --> 00:25:39.540
JACOB SOVIERO: Fantastic.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.050
Thank you.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.216
And Tom, how about yourself?

00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:42.925
How have you seen
these screenings

00:25:42.925 --> 00:25:44.050
that you've been a part of?

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.560
How have they grown?

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.290
TOM VOSS: I mean, I think that
the most impact that I have

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.040
is talking to folks
like you, really

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.530
seeing how they may or
may not have shifted

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.530
your idea about what
veterans are going through,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.830
what their families
are going through.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.400
And I have veterans that
come up to me afterwards,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.220
and they're like,
now, I'm going to go

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.499
hike the Appalachian Trail.

00:26:09.499 --> 00:26:10.540
That's what I need to do.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.476
I know it now.

00:26:11.476 --> 00:26:12.600
And I'm like, that's great.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.050
You should probably ask your
wife, but that's awesome.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:19.020
So I support it, but yeah.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:25.490
So it's really cool to see
how you guys all take it in,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.140
and when you guys
have questions,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.070
that's the best part of it.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.460
And Anthony-- the
same with Anthony,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.425
really just connecting,
because with us coming home,

00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:37.300
and this is what Anthony
he talks about a lot

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.924
and he touched on in
the film is having

00:26:38.924 --> 00:26:41.250
trust in the community
when you come back.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.390
And for us to be able to get up
in front of a bunch of people

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:49.290
that we don't know and really
trust you with our story

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.720
and what we went through
was a big step for us to do.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.720
And now, it's easier and
easier, and it kind of

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.150
keeps me going to be
able to share my story

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.110
and know that I can let some
veteran out there, whether it's

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.452
one or a pair, that they're
not the only ones that

00:27:06.452 --> 00:27:07.410
are going through this.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.370
And coming home, I felt so
isolated being in Wisconsin.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.990
Only active duty guy to get
out of my platoon at that time,

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.840
so all my buddies are
getting ready to go

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.210
on their second deployment.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.280
It's really-- it's
been a long journey,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.960
and I am really thankful
that it came out

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.979
the way that it has so far.

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:28.270
JACOB SOVIERO: Thanks for that.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.362
So you actually started on
the next portion of the night,

00:27:32.362 --> 00:27:34.320
because we actually want
to take some questions

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.070
from the audience.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.153
So if you have a question,
please raise your hand.

00:27:37.153 --> 00:27:39.334
Myself or Amy's going to
come around and give you

00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:41.250
a microphone, and then
you can ask a question.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.750
Thank you.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.700
AUDIENCE: All right, Tom, so
the trek ended, obviously,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.820
a few years ago, right?

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.640
Is there anybody
that you encountered

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.240
during the trek that,
looking back now with maybe

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.840
a little more clarity
or whatnot, had a bigger

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.570
impact on you that you
didn't notice at the time,

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.330
while you were on the trek
that maybe wasn't in the movie,

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.675
and you would want to
talk about for a minute?

00:28:07.675 --> 00:28:08.300
TOM VOSS: Sure.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.299
There's a lot of people.

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:11.810
I mean, there's a
lot of stories that

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.450
happened while Michael
and Marty weren't

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.190
there, which is unfortunate.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.430
But They were like,
oh, missed it.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.440
But there are a few
examples I can give

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.350
you is that we met a pastor.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.550
His name was Pastor Marty.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:30.620
He was in the Marine Corps and
got out and became a rancher,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.820
and then became a pastor--

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.490
super interesting guy.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.930
But he came and brought us
water while we were walking,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.070
and we had water points
kind of mapped out.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.900
And he came and took
us out to dinner.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.500
And what he said to us is he's
like, where you are-- he says,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.480
life demands a response.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.862
And he's like, and you
have to figure out what

00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:52.070
your response is going to be.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.970
And then for me, I'm like, OK,
am I even responding or am I

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.827
just being dragged
through the mud?

00:28:57.827 --> 00:28:59.660
So that was a huge shift
for me and Anthony.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.400
And then what Anthony
and I would do

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.566
is we'd talk about that
stuff while we were walking,

00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:05.210
so that's when peer
support comes in,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.751
where we have this
shared experience,

00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:09.110
and we can kind of process
this stuff together.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.290
So that was a really,
really impactful one for us.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.140
And then one more
is we had a man

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.720
stop on the side of the road
to give us $20 to go get lunch.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.340
And he said his brother
died in Vietnam.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.830
So Anthony always likes to talk
about how impactful war is,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.480
that this man had no idea who we
were, had no connection to us,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.790
but he thought he was just
going to stop and help,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.840
because his brother was killed
in Vietnam 40, 45 years ago.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.080
So that just shows
how detrimental war

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.670
is to us as human beings.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.962
So it's like it's not
just an isolated event.

00:29:48.962 --> 00:29:50.920
It just doesn't affect
the veteran or families.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.044
It affects their community.

00:29:52.044 --> 00:29:53.770
It affects generations.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.000
Anthony says, I'm going
to impart the lessons

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.450
that I've learned from
Iraq on my daughter.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.070
So it's like, we have to start
looking at that framework,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.410
because then you see
how impactful it is.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.310
So it's generations upon
generations upon generations.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.760
You look at the displaced people
all over the world right now.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.050
How is that going to
impact their kids?

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.180
How is that going to
impact the communities

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.330
that they're refugees in?

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.876
So you just see the
grand scale of this

00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:24.500
and how it impacts
us on a human level,

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.250
and it's just so detrimental.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.584
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tom.

00:30:29.584 --> 00:30:30.350
TOM VOSS: Hi.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.220
AUDIENCE: Something that really
stuck out to me in the film--

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.320
and I'm still
thinking about it even

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.080
as I ask you this question--

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.250
is Katinka brought this up.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.330
She said, whether you're young
or old, and you go to war,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.570
for a lot of people,
especially young,

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:51.150
that have never
experienced love before,"

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.700
that really stuck with me,
because I think that's--

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.430
I think that's a lot of the
problem is you don't feel love,

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.540
or you've never felt it, if
you've never been in love.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.250
And maybe the connection
is to a parent,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.900
but it's totally different.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.050
Then you come home,
and you fall in love,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.600
or you get into a
relationship with someone,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.900
or you have a child.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.770
And that's the first
time you feel that,

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.237
and that flashback
that she spoke about--

00:31:19.237 --> 00:31:20.820
I don't know if that
happened for you.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.890
Maybe if it didn't,
you know other people.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.026
But maybe if you can go
into that a little more.

00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:25.650
TOM VOSS: Sure.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.390
I mean, I think what we can
really look at is through--

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.350
I was in the infantry.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.020
Specifically, I was in
Reconnaissance Battalion Scout

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.250
Sniper Platoon.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.469
So there's no room--

00:31:37.469 --> 00:31:39.010
and Anthony kind of
touches on this--

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.680
there's no room for these other
emotions in our existence.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.640
You have compassion, love,
these different things

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.320
that when you're
in a combat zone,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.800
there is just no time to sit
there and analyze things.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.060
You have to react.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.620
And I think that, as to your
point, that's really difficult.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.420
You can't just turn
it on and turn it off.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.665
It's not like a light switch.

00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:05.730
So I think that
when you come back,

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.370
and you start experiencing,
you're like, OK,

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.260
I have to get back into
these relationships,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.259
when the only relationships
I had to worry about

00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:14.790
while I was overseas
was the guy or the girl

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.140
to the right or left of
me when I was serving.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.930
And there's a much more level
of complexity that happens,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.020
and then you start to
reflect on your deployment.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.270
And I think it took
me about two years

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.050
before I even crashed and
burned the first time.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.420
And that's when
relationships started

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.860
to deteriorate in my life.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.050
I started pushing people
away, because it was easier

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.540
for me to push people
away and out of my life

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.600
than to actually have to
address the trauma that I've

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.500
been through.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:48.090
So I think when Katinka
talks about that experience--

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.480
and she had interviewed tons
of veterans in the Milwaukee

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.440
area--

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.635
she was really talking
about these experiences

00:32:55.635 --> 00:32:59.039
that veterans are having
and making these connections

00:32:59.039 --> 00:32:59.830
when you come home.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.079
And I'm like, OK, now I have--

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.580
I call it the
unraveling process.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.240
She's like, OK, what
did I just go through?

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.620
How did that impact me?

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.880
How has it impacted my family?

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.250
And that's when you
start comparing it to,

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.240
OK, well, is this who I
really am as a person?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.590
Is this how I was raised?

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.780
And then that's where
you have moral conflicts.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.950
And I think it's a
really interesting point

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.890
that she made, and it's
really impactful, too.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:31.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, this question is
for both the filmmaker and Tom.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.940
So I'm curious
about a few things,

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.900
so feel free to ignore some of
my questions and answer others.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.260
But overall, it's
about your process

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.060
as a filmmaker from beginning
until the film was edited

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:52.380
and released and your process
being documented by filmmakers

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.670
and the relationship between the
filmmakers and you and Anthony.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.830
Specifically, I noticed
that in any film,

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.030
you have an arc of
a character story.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:09.000
And so we saw your arc,
and we saw Anthony's arc.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.080
And I'm curious, how much were
you able to film, actually,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.350
of that actual journey
versus what we're seeing?

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:20.070
And where do you feel
that the filmmakers'

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.690
presence in your life
impacted you positively?

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:31.934
And also, where you
found it difficult,

00:34:31.934 --> 00:34:33.850
both just in what they
were capturing and what

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.960
they weren't capturing.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.550
And I noticed you were
quite silent on camera

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.380
for a lot of the
beginning of the film.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.421
And I was wondering if
that was an editing choice

00:34:43.421 --> 00:34:46.000
or if that was actually what
was going on in your journey.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.689
But Anthony was talking a lot.

00:34:47.689 --> 00:34:48.969
TOM VOSS: Anthony talks a lot.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.540
And then-- right.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.429
And then we see this--

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.980
he had a pivot point
on the mountain,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.470
and then you had your kind of
pivot [INAUDIBLE] revelation

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:00.280
later on.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.180
But life still continues
also after the film is over.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.160
So I'm also kind of
curious as to now

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.270
that the film is no longer--

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.090
the filmmaking is no
longer in your journey,

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:14.044
what have been your struggles
since then with the film camera

00:35:14.044 --> 00:35:15.460
not there and maybe
where you wish

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.610
the camera was still there?

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.600
I don't know.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.864
TOM VOSS: Sure you can start.

00:35:19.864 --> 00:35:21.280
MICHAEL COLLINS:
Yeah, I'll start.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.690
We weren't there the whole time.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.156
We wanted to-- the most
important thing for me,

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.530
honestly, when I
started this was

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.920
to make sure that they had the
space to have their experience.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.960
They wanted to go out
and heal themselves,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.930
and already, it was becoming
something a little bit larger.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.370
It was going to
be veterans' trek.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.540
They were raising awareness.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.940
They were having this
kind of campaign.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.172
And then on top of that,
you had a camera crew.

00:35:42.172 --> 00:35:43.630
I mean, one good
thing is we didn't

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.758
have the budget to stay
with them the whole time.

00:35:45.758 --> 00:35:49.270
But honestly, I also
wanted to give them space,

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.300
because I'm thinking, there's
a comfortability knowing,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.790
and maybe a little frustration,
when you have a minivan

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.710
kind of cruising
along next to you

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.260
all day long, because we're
shooting out of the side,

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.414
and we're doing
all these things.

00:36:01.414 --> 00:36:02.830
But when they have
to be out there

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.251
and really are dependent on the
kindness of strangers, I mean,

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:07.000
that's a big deal.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.010
That was something that didn't
make it in the beginning.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:09.885
They had their packs.

00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:14.020
They were like 85, 90 pounds,
and they were so weighed down,

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.360
because they were going to
carry everything themselves--

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.740
all the food, all
the camping gear,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.970
and then after the
first day, they just

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.012
had to unload half of it.

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:21.761
And they're like, we're
going to just have

00:36:21.761 --> 00:36:22.970
to depend on other people.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.100
And I think that
was a part of it

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.680
was giving them the space to be
out there to face the elements,

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.240
to sleep on the side of
the road if they had to,

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.156
to be in that silence.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.930
So that was part of the
filmmaking experience.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.070
We'd try to come in
at strategic points.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.740
It was tricky with
a moving target.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.780
But we did our best.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.080
And yeah, in terms of
the edit, of course,

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.880
there are choices that are made.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.670
We had 400, 500 hours worth
of footage, and I was nervous.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.020
Tom wasn't really talking.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.070
He wasn't opening up.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:57.710
And you're like, my main
character isn't talking to me.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:01.480
And then this other
one won't stop.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.176
So we're on the
plane coming home.

00:37:03.176 --> 00:37:04.300
I'm like, what's happening?

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:04.960
Oh, my god.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.690
And then when I finally just
embraced it, I said, that's OK.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.340
That's his journey.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.426
Put the silence on the
screen, him being closed off.

00:37:12.426 --> 00:37:14.050
So when Katinka says
it, when she says,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.091
I realized it when he came
home that he was still

00:37:16.091 --> 00:37:18.790
emotionally closed off, we're
all thinking, yeah, I know.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.057
We just saw that for the
past 40 minutes as well.

00:37:21.057 --> 00:37:24.137
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:25.970
But in terms of our
relationship, of course,

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.080
over time, you're in very
intimate situations with them,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.119
and you care.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:31.160
You really start to care.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.134
They're people who you're
around all the time,

00:37:33.134 --> 00:37:34.300
and you're rooting for them.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.680
And you want them to heal, just
because you become friends.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.800
And to see Tom still
struggling at the end

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.625
was honestly very
difficult. I mean,

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.750
the filmmaker in me was
like, oh, my goodness, this

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.190
is-- it's terrible.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.110
We thought it was just going
to be point A to point B.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.490
But just the human in
me was just heartbroken,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.592
because I was like, he's
not where he hoped to be.

00:37:56.592 --> 00:37:58.300
What's going to happen
when he goes home?

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.290
I don't know.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:03.370
So I was really grateful that
he continued on that journey,

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.180
that he went to Aspen, that he
did the power breath workshop.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.020
Of course, that means we
had to fundraise some more,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.603
and we had to go
back into production.

00:38:09.603 --> 00:38:11.170
But it was all--

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.740
it was great.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.480
And then in the
edit, when we watched

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.780
Anthony's arc and Tom's arc
go in separate directions,

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.310
it made the edit a
lot more difficult.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:23.110
But it was a lot more
true to the story.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.760
TOM VOSS: And I
guess, for me, it

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.970
takes a little getting used
to have a camera in your face

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:28.737
24/7.

00:38:28.737 --> 00:38:30.070
So it's easier just to not talk.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.450
It's great.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.600
But no, Anthony and I were--

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.780
how it all kind of began
is I was just like,

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.940
I need to do something
to decompress.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.502
I haven't addressed
this in 10 years.

00:38:41.502 --> 00:38:42.460
I haven't looked at it.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.420
I haven't had the time.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.820
And it was partially my
fault, so I got back,

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.950
got my own apartment, got
into school full time,

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.150
got a full time job,
just dived right back in,

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.820
and I'd crash and burn.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.410
I'd be OK for three
or four months,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.560
and then destroy relationships,
drop out of school,

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.990
and pick myself up and restart.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.990
And so that's where it
kind of came out of.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.560
It came out of that necessity
of, OK, I need to do something,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.560
or otherwise, I'm going to
end up like another statistic.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.750
And I've had two guys
from my platoon already,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.140
who've taken their own lives.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.702
So it's very
prominent in my life.

00:39:15.702 --> 00:39:18.160
I keep really close tabs on
the guys that I've served with,

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.440
and we kind of keep
communicating after those two

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.250
events had happened.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.990
But Anthony and I
really thought that we

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.720
were going to make our own
documentary with GoPro,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.650
so this was awesome
that Michael found us.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:31.450
And we're like, thank you.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.366
We don't have to make
our own documentary now,

00:39:33.366 --> 00:39:35.140
because we have no
idea what we're doing.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.300
So Anthony really got
into it, though, with,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.660
like setting up GoPros, and we
did some filming on our own,

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.210
while Michael wasn't there.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.860
And some of that made the film.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.760
But it takes a lot of
getting used to and kind

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.590
of a lot of strength.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.059
As Michael said before,
we walked 20 miles a day,

00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:55.600
and when you're in
the Mojave Desert,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.250
where there's 50
mile an hour winds,

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.920
you're walking 20
miles a day, and then

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.820
Michael pulls up in a
minivan with a camera going

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.510
two miles an hour next to
you, it's super motivational.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:11.380
So no, it's just
how it happened.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.290
So it was an
interesting process,

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:18.340
and it was good to
be a part of it.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.210
And seeing the outcome,
I couldn't be happier,

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.440
because Michael wouldn't
even show us footage

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.640
that he shot on the road.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.600
He'd be like-- we'd try to
peek, and he'd be like, nope.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.130
And he didn't show us until he
had something similar to what

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.930
you guys have seen.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.600
So that was like a year, where
he shot it, and we were like,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.100
we don't know what
this guy's doing.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.020
He was like, he's-- and
Anthony's like, wait.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:41.740
He's not here.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.992
He's with my family.

00:40:42.992 --> 00:40:44.200
He was just like, oh, my god.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.860
What is he asking my family?

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:50.790
So you have this what's going
on back home kind of a thing,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.170
so you just never know
what was going to happen.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.720
But we were both
really, really pleased

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.770
with the outcome and amazed
that Michael and Marty

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.770
could take this footage,
500 hours of footage,

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.360
and make it into
a 90-minute film.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.840
It was pretty amazing.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.340
AUDIENCE: How different do you
think your healing trajectory

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.302
would have been if you'd
gone on the journey alone?

00:41:12.302 --> 00:41:14.260
TOM VOSS: Yeah, that's
an interesting question.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:14.843
I don't know--

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.280
I don't know if I would
have made it, honestly.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.490
I don't know.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.550
I really don't
know, because what

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.310
happened was when Anthony
came along and said,

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.769
I want to jump in
on this with you.

00:41:28.769 --> 00:41:30.060
Do you mind if I come with you?

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.400
And I was like, that's fine.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.720
He had to finagle a
way to make it into,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.815
I need to make this about
work, so I can take off

00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:37.690
work for five months.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.109
So we ended up doing a
fundraiser for the nonprofit

00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.900
that he worked for.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.830
So he's like, OK.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.310
So now we have this walk, the
2,700 miles we have to walk.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.690
Now we have a fundraiser
on top of that,

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.700
and then we have Michael making
a documentary on top of that.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.690
So it really just
became this thing.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.154
And we were concerned
at different points

00:41:57.154 --> 00:41:58.570
that we're like,
OK, is this going

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.290
to take away from our healing?

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.020
Is this going to
take away from what

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.610
we're trying to accomplish?

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.870
And the amount of
support that we

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:12.450
got from the civilian population
or people that didn't know us

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.980
was just absolutely amazing.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.656
I think we only had a camp out
maybe 15, 20 times in 155 days.

00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:21.030
I mean, there were
so many people

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.740
that were supporting
us on social media that

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.990
would be like, OK, my cousin
lives in this next town

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.070
that you're going to.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.842
You guys can stay with him,
shower, do your laundry,

00:42:28.842 --> 00:42:31.050
and they're going to hook
you up with someone else 20

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.160
miles down the road.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.254
So we just like leapfrogged
that way with people

00:42:34.254 --> 00:42:35.670
just opening up
their doors to us,

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.003
which was amazing for us,
because like I said before, we

00:42:38.003 --> 00:42:38.982
had that trust issue.

00:42:38.982 --> 00:42:40.440
And that really
just blew that away

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.065
that there are amazing
people out there

00:42:42.065 --> 00:42:44.670
that want to help veterans,
that want to help them heal.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:48.090
They just need the opportunities
to do it and the direction

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:48.910
in how to do it.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.620
So if I would have
done it by myself,

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.286
I wouldn't have
experienced any of that.

00:42:52.286 --> 00:42:56.200
I probably would've just been
sleeping in ditches by myself,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.200
honestly.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.400
So yeah, it was good that it
worked out the way it did.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.420
AUDIENCE: Very emotional
movie, so hopefully I

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.580
can get through this question.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.360
I am an army mom
of three veterans,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.067
and my youngest has
dealt with PTSD.

00:43:15.067 --> 00:43:16.650
So I think this
question will probably

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.380
be directed to the doctors.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.720
I learned about moral
injury within the last year,

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:29.940
and it was very impacting to
me, as my son's mother, to--

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.270
it just really made sense to me.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:37.740
And I was very excited to be
able to go home and share what

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.520
I had learned about
moral injury with him.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.510
But I'm not seeing that
being used or taught yet

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:50.400
within the VA, and I'm
wondering if our counselors

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.380
and social workers,
psychiatrists,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.140
psychologists-- will they be
using or be trained in the more

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:02.290
moral for our veterans?

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.260
SHIRA MAGUEN: So I can
start to answer that.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.910
So I think what's incredible
is over the last year

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:13.500
or so, there's been a lot more
education on a nationwide level

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.550
about moral injury.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:20.010
And so we've done some trainings
at the San Francisco VA.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.560
Some people at the Palo Alto
have done trainings, too,

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.240
nationally.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.760
There's been a lot of
national recognition

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.750
of this issue and a
lot more awareness,

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:32.910
and so I think a lot of
the providers really--

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.940
it's now part of the
conversation and part of what

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.530
they're getting trained in.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:44.050
And there are-- even though it's
the conversations are starting,

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.170
there's also a lot
of studies right now

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.770
that are happening about new
treatments for moral injury

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.550
in particular.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.300
And so at our VA, we have
a moral injury treatment

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.180
that we use called the
impact of killing treatment.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.840
And it specifically delves
into issues of self-forgiveness

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.620
and spirituality and really
exploring all of those areas.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.130
There are other
studies, too, that

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.500
are looking at other
treatments for moral injury

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.510
to adaptive disclosure,
something called ACT as well.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.955
And so on a nationwide
level, the VA

00:45:17.955 --> 00:45:21.900
is moving pretty quickly
to study this, and then

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.160
implement some of these
treatments as well.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.060
And so I would say that
if that's something

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.480
that you know that your
sons are experiencing,

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.720
I hope that you will trust
us enough to reach out

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.520
to us so that they can
get some help with that.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.440
And I just want to add,
too, that it's really--

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.680
when people come to us, because
of the shame and stigma that

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.990
exists, it's often
parents like you

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.920
or loved ones that really
bring the people who

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.720
need the care most to us.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.866
And so thank you for doing
what you do as a parent

00:45:55.866 --> 00:45:57.240
and for all the
parents out there

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.850
who are really
helping us to help

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.960
people who need it the most.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.376
And that's what we're
really hoping to help with,

00:46:05.376 --> 00:46:06.750
and that's what
we're here to do.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.080
So I just wanted to
put that out there.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.900
NATALIE PURCELL: And
if I could just add,

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.920
concepts like moral injury
and post-traumatic stress

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.430
disorder--

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:24.240
these are terms that emerge in
specific historical contexts.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.780
And if this were the
aftermath of World War I,

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.640
we would be talking
about shell shock.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.520
So we come up with
these different terms

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.620
to try and capture these very
complicated human experiences

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.840
that are both
personal and social.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.500
So the concepts really
do evolve over time,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.260
and I think we're seeing
this evolution, where there's

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.990
a recognition that
we need to start

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:53.070
talking about moral injury, as
well as post-traumatic stress

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.060
disorder.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.330
And both of those terms are
really only as good as the work

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.260
that they do.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.740
Any term, any diagnosis is
only as good as the work

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.840
that it does in
terms of helping us

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:10.010
to identify and describe and
respond to and help people,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.350
helping us to
really build empathy

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.940
and understanding
for one another.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.570
And so I think it is
really worth asking, why

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:21.260
is it at this moment
that we're starting

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.270
to recognize moral injury?

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.360
And what is the work that
thinking about moral injury

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.120
does at this moment that
just looking at PTSD

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.770
alone doesn't do?

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.840
PTSD is a medical term.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.250
It's a diagnosis.

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.540
It's about the individual.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.290
And when we think
about moral injury,

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:44.150
it's automatically asking
us to think about our values

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:48.800
and about the potential
conflict between personal values

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.600
and collective values.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.140
It's asking us to really
look inward to ask

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.810
these questions about social
values, about politics.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.210
It raises all of that for us.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.880
And I think that it
also really makes

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:08.330
us have to think about, what are
the circumstances that lead us

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.420
to a world where
some people have

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:17.750
to face the extraordinary
stressors and horrors of war,

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:22.020
while most of the rest of us
don't have to face that at all?

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.020
And then they come
home and really

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.770
have to cope with that,
oftentimes in isolation.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:31.190
So by thinking about
moral injury, what

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.080
is it that we can
do collectively

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.440
and socially to
begin to respond?

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.300
This is not just an
individual diagnosis.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.910
This is more of a social
issue and a social problem.

00:48:47.889 --> 00:48:50.180
AUDIENCE: One of the really
emotional parts of the film

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.350
is the mother that
is grieving her son,

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:57.980
and I am just curious if
you discovered that story,

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.280
as the film so much suggests,
from the news story,

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.490
and then how you
reached out to that mom

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.540
and were able to interview
her, that she allowed that?

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.430
And then just also,
second part, curious

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.010
if you are in contact
with her and what

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.610
she thinks of the film.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.700
MICHAEL COLLINS:
Yeah, great question.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.927
It did happen the way,
basically, that you saw it.

00:49:18.927 --> 00:49:20.510
I was in a hotel
room with these guys,

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.460
and it came up on
the television.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.790
And I was going to Milwaukee
the next day, and at that point,

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.490
it was early in the shooting.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.559
It was early in
the journey, and I

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.600
knew that I wanted this
film to be about what war

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.100
looks like when it
comes home, and I

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.840
wanted it to go beyond just
the perspective of the combat

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.910
veteran and to include
family stories.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.220
And all of a sudden, I was
on my way to Milwaukee.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.007
She's from Milwaukee.

00:49:45.007 --> 00:49:46.340
Her son has the same name as me.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.960
His name is Jeremiah
Michael Collins.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.085
My name is Michael Collins.

00:49:49.085 --> 00:49:50.900
It was all these things.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.470
And she was speaking
to the media,

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:57.375
and the last thing I want to
do is call up a grieving mother

00:49:57.375 --> 00:49:59.000
and say, hey, can I
come interview you?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.710
That's just about
the last thing I

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.282
think anyone would want to do.

00:50:02.282 --> 00:50:04.490
But there was something
inside of me that was saying,

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.340
she is sharing her
story for a reason,

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.040
and maybe you should just try.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.740
So one of my
co-producers, I said, hey,

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.510
can you just do a
little outreach?

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.780
And very quickly, she found
her number through someone

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:22.520
and was able to get a
message to her, basically.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.860
And she said, yes, please
invite him to call me.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.770
I called her from the airport
the next day as I was on my way

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.230
to Milwaukee, and she
was very open to it.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.580
She said, yeah, come.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.280
We were going to have
the services next week.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.910
You should come.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.270
And so we did, and
it was difficult.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:43.160
It was the most difficult thing,
really, that I've ever shot

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.940
and how to handle
that and what is--

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.660
how much to put in, how much
to show, what's respectful.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.042
And so it was just a lot of
grappling with that stuff,

00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:57.250
while you're shooting, while
you're in the edit room.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:59.030
But she was really
happy with it.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.110
She's become a friend.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:05.117
And she used the opportunity
of the film to really share

00:51:05.117 --> 00:51:06.950
the fact that her son's
death was a suicide,

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.960
because people just
assumed that it wasn't.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.070
And she hadn't come out with
that yet publicly, so she came.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.304
She's come to
screenings in Milwaukee.

00:51:15.304 --> 00:51:16.970
We were the centerpiece
of that festival

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.360
played to her community.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.710
I think it was an 1,100
seater, something like that.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.250
And she came up
on stage with us.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.634
That was her first time
really coming up and speaking.

00:51:24.634 --> 00:51:27.050
She has now gone back to school
to become a social worker.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.390
She's very involved with
TAPS, Tragedy Assistance

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.100
Program for Survivors.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.530
So she's moving forward and is
a real big advocate for the film

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:41.450
and doing as well as can
be expected, I suppose.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.880
I wanted to-- and I know
we're probably out of time.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.970
I just wanted to respond, also,
to the question before about

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.370
just education on moral injury.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.950
You know, when we
started making the film,

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.520
we had a whole campaign in mind.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.730
And one of the pillars
of that campaign

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.806
is educating on moral injury.

00:51:57.806 --> 00:51:59.930
I think it's that time
right now, where people just

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.090
don't know about it, and
that's one of the things,

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.670
like as you asked, what's
one of the biggest responses

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:05.770
that you get from people?

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.270
They have this aha moment when
they hear about moral injury.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.770
They're like, oh,
that's what it is.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.680
We've had World War II
vets and Korean vets

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.189
and all kinds of people
just come up with tears

00:52:15.189 --> 00:52:15.980
and say, thank you.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.410
Now I get-- like
something has shifted.

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:21.590
So we've developed all kinds
of educational materials

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.287
around this, and we
just started that.

00:52:23.287 --> 00:52:25.370
We just started the whole
educational distribution

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:29.720
kind of phase of the film, where
we have it for high schools.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.340
We have it for colleges.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.880
We have it for
institutions, and we're

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.200
trying to let people know.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.210
I mean, we're
independent filmmakers,

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.910
and we're getting connected
to this whole world.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.160
But if any of you
all want to share

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.710
this film with your high
school, with your school,

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:49.620
with an NGO of your choice,
we have ways that you can,

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.890
and we'll ship all
those materials.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:53.730
We also have like
modular content.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.180
Not everyone can sit down
and watch the whole film ,

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.660
so we're creating online stuff
and things for high schools,

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.704
where they just show
a couple of clips,

00:53:01.704 --> 00:53:03.120
and they're able
to talk about it.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.474
And so we've developed a lot of
curriculum around moral injury.

00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:08.390
And there's also elements
of the campaign that

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:13.100
are about connecting
communities, about healing,

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.590
just these other
modalities of healing,

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.890
really pointing people towards
that, and changing legislation.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.500
So I invite you all to
stay connected with us

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:26.180
for social media, but also,
Marty gave me some props,

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.460
and he'd be mad at me
if I didn't hold it up.

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:31.370
We have postcards out there that
talk a little bit about this.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:34.885
If you want to get in touch with
us, you can just come up to me

00:53:34.885 --> 00:53:35.510
and talk to me.

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:37.551
I can give you my card,
or you can give me yours.

00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:39.500
But you can also fill
this out, and if you

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.090
do want to send this
film to your home,

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.780
to the library of your
hometown, or if you

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.760
want to host a screening at a
school or at an organization,

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.442
we'd love to work
with you on that.

00:53:50.442 --> 00:53:52.900
These things happen organically,
as you can see, by the way

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.820
that Jake invited us here.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:58.220
So we really depend on you
to keep this campaign going.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.574
And so we also have materials.

00:53:59.574 --> 00:54:01.240
So this is kind of
educational, and this

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.590
is about corporate screenings.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:03.790
And come up to us.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:04.376
Talk to us.

00:54:04.376 --> 00:54:06.250
You can fill this out
and hand it back to us,

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.406
however you want to do it.

00:54:08.406 --> 00:54:10.780
AUDIENCE: I want to ask about
[INAUDIBLE] outreach looked

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.290
like.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:11.789
Sorry.

00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:14.150
And I'm so happy that
you're here at Google--

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.220
that they're hosting.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:19.690
But they're kind of the pillar,
the example for corporations

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:24.130
that we hope they achieve
and try to model and mirror.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.440
So I just wanted
to ask about that.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.230
JACOB SOVIERO: Just
so everybody can hear,

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:32.080
the question was about, how do
we take care of our veterans?

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.844
And how do we better
treat our veterans,

00:54:33.844 --> 00:54:35.260
and how do we
better get involved?

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.136
So just so people could
hear you, that's all.

00:54:37.136 --> 00:54:39.135
MICHAEL COLLINS: Yeah,
in the corporate setting,

00:54:39.135 --> 00:54:41.200
specifically, and I
think that's exactly

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.910
like this is the example.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.180
We're at one of the biggest
companies in the world

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:51.790
and bringing people together to
have a conversation is one way.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:57.520
We've had other models, where
a community bank took the film,

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.280
and then they showed it
in 10 different cities.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.360
And they just made it
a gift to that city,

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.890
so they invited the local
vets organizations to come

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.360
and be on the panel after.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.850
So they announced it,
they rented the theater,

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.440
they did all that, and then
they had a conversation

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.690
with the community afterwards.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.810
And they said, hey,
here are the services.

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:16.690
These are the vets.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.060
These are the families
that are in your community.

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.562
Let's all get together and
have a conversation about it.

00:55:21.562 --> 00:55:23.020
And they also made
it a fundraiser.

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.044
If anyone wanted to donate,
it would go to that local NGO.

00:55:27.044 --> 00:55:28.960
But it was creating
awareness, and it was also

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.290
connecting with their community
outside of the business.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.460
So it was showing that
they really cared.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.160
It wasn't just about
dollars and cents,

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.970
that it was about the strength
of a community, really.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:44.080
Businesses reflect that.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.217
So we are able to work with
anyone who is interested in any

00:55:48.217 --> 00:55:49.300
of these different models.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:53.320
If they want to come in
and do something like this,

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.520
we're happy to do it.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.780
If a corporation says, hey,
we want to help younger vets,

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.960
and we want to sponsor this
film to go to the Student

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.480
Veterans of America
chapters across the country,

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.360
we have a way that
they can do that, too.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.520
And that's really
meaningful, because when

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.214
people are younger, they're
about to go into the workforce.

00:56:12.214 --> 00:56:14.380
And they're able to have
these deeper conversations.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.180
They're able to understand
what they're grappling with.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.870
They now know what
is moral injury,

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:20.600
and they can talk about
it with their peers.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.450
So we have all different ways
that we're doing it with this.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.490
Like I said, we are a
film with a campaign,

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.990
and we're doing our
best, and we are

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.050
creating all these materials, so
they can be used for training.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.370
And we have lesson plans.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.340
We have discussion guides for
communities, for corporations,

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.510
for schools, and it really
takes you all reaching out to us

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.740
and say, I work here.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.720
I went to this school.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.820
And just come to us,
and let's work together

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.314
and make it happen.

00:56:47.314 --> 00:56:48.730
JACOB SOVIERO:
Thank you, Michael.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.310
And you brought up a good point,
and I'd like to kind of close

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.351
with that one, and we'll
certainly have some time

00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:54.320
to mingle afterwards.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.780
But the strength
of the community

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.850
is really the important
one, and kind of that's

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.270
shown here tonight by all of
you coming out and supporting

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.120
this film and
supporting these topics.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.560
And that's the important part.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.330
That's how we get
into businesses.

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:08.830
That's how we make lives change.

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.590
So first and foremost,
thank you to the panel--

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.140
Michael, Peter, Tom,
Shira, and Natalie.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.640
Thank you very much.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.290
