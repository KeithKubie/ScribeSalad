Dylan, great job on the

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.638
"30 Ways to Know You're 20
Pounds Overweight" article.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.074
I heard most girls were
crying by number seven.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.342
All right, next
order of shizz,

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.444
We're still 80 tips
away from being done

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.678
with 500 hottest
sex tips.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:12.980
Start pitching.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.582
What if, while you're going down
on him you take a feather

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.253
and you gently tickle the
space behind his balls?

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.088
Hunter, it's sex tips
to drive him wild,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.723
not drive him mild.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.058
(laughing)

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.994
That's hilarious, did you
guys hear what I said?

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.997
(all laughing)

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.164
Okay, write that down.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.432
Actually, just put
it right on the blog.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.967
I don't want people
to have to wait for that.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.202
Okay, Lenore, go.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.904
So you dress like
a Boy Scout

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.205
but only from the
bottom down

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.107
and then you sit on
his knee and queef.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.076
Interesting,
I like it... more.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.144
Take a five-hour
energy

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:45.379
and pour it inside
your vagina

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.513
right before you
have sex.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:47.548
Where's your office?

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.715
I'm moving it
closer to mine.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.917
Spin me around.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.052
What if you take
a pumice stone

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.189
and you hold it over an open
flame for like an hour

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.224
and then you
gently grate it

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.792
up and down
his shaft?

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.160
Wow, love it.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:03.897
Okay, guys, we need
75 more and don't be lazy.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.766
So far, the pumice
stone's my favorite.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.334
You put his penis
in a glory hole.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.569
You begin to stroke it.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.770
You take a
mouthful of cum

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.205
from his three
best friends

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.907
and then you shoot it in his
face until he explodes?

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.175
Hmm...

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.510
What about a
sawed-off shotgun?

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.846
You could take it and
rub it up and down his neck

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.380
till he's
super hard.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.416
Okay.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.952
Okay.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.987
Okay.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.293
Bridgett.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.962
You look like
a sad emoticon.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.830
Give me something.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:41.268
Okay, okay,
how 'bout this.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.337
You fall in love
with a stockbroker,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.105
you know because it
really seems like

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.640
he wants to
get married.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.708
And then you're
together at the

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.111
Chipotle and his friends
from work show up,

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.447
and he pretends like
you're bussin' the table.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.648
So what do you do?

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.284
You pick up his basket,
you clear his table.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.919
You wipe it
and you say,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.420
"Can I get you
anything else?"

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:01.655
And you know
what he says?

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.057
He says, "Yeah, could you
freshen our drinks?"

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.559
So you freshen
everybody's drinks.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.860
And you go back
into the kitchen.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.196
You take somebody's
card, you clock out,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.898
you go home and then
what do you do?

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.432
You pour yourself
a bottle of Chardonnay

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.201
and you sit
on the toilet

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.436
and then you start playing Words
With Friends with Lenore.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.373
And then you just
go and you get into bed...

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.908
And then he explodes.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.176
What's happening
over here?

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.510
What's happening
in this section?

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:25.946
Bridgett is going
through a breakup.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.080
You don't know what
I'm going through.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.082
Okay, she's a
ticking time bomb.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.284
Somebody top
her off.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.785
I'm not hearing
sex tips.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.786
What, are we
hanging out--

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.854
are you guys
my friends?

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:34.988
No.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.356
So you wait till he
finds out his dad's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.958
been diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.561
Then, while he's crying,
you put one finger--

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.229
two fingers up
his butt...

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.897
until he explodes?

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.966
I have one.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.235
Make eye contact?

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.903
You're a cunt,
fan me.

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:51.705
How' bout, go to
Trader Joe's,

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.440
and buy an Amy's
frozen Indian dinner

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.142
Then smear it all
over his genitals

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.344
in slow circles
clockwise...

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.179
and then counter
clockwise.

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:02.049
I tried that...

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.483
and it works.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:04.685
Okay.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:05.853
You're fired.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.055
That eye contact thing
was ridic-- get out.

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.657
Guys, this article is
gonna cause a baby boom.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.226
We're doing
God's work.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.294
♪♪

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:17.698
2,000 men are suing "Glamo"
Magazine for emotional damages

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.166
claiming their sex tips

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.168
are at least partially
responsible for the fact

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.737
that they were bizarrely
raped by their girlfriends.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.972
( anchorman )
We spoke to one
of the plaintiffs.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.740
I came here today because
I don't want anyone

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.142
to ever have to go
through what I went through.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.944
I bet you guys didn't
know that you can, uh,

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:33.447
fit a Hanukkah candle
in your pee-hole.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.717
Well, guess what "Glamo"
Magazine, you can't.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.852
Now I have to
piss in a bag.
