00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.368
Number one here is moving the host array, h_in,

00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:06.743
to the GPU array, d_in.

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:08.793
So we need to go host to device.

00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:11.738
This argument is going to be cudaMemcpy host to device.

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:13.532
This transfer goes the other way,

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:16.669
from an array on the GPU, d_out,

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.407
to an array on the CPU, h_out.

00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:21.450
So we're going to go device to host.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.907
CudaMemcpy device to device simply moves a piece of memory on the GPU from one place to another.
