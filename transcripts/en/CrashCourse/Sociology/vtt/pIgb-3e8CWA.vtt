00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
Religion might not seem like something a sociologist
can study.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.500
After all, religion is about personal beliefs,
right?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.280
So, sociology won’t give you any answers
about the existence of God, or how many angels
can dance on the head of a pin.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.440
But sociology can help you think about
religion as a social institution.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.540
In the same way that we might study the family
or the government, we can ask questions about
religion’s role in society.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.180
Like, how do different religions influence
social norms in a society?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.520
What’s the function of religion in a society?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.740
Does it improve social cohesiveness or
entrench inequalities?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.400
Before we try to answer those big questions,
let’s start with a simpler one: What is religion?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:48.480
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.560
To understand how sociologists think about
religion, we need to go back to the work of our old
friend, French sociologist Emile Durkheim.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.860
Durkheim defined religion not in terms of
gods or supernatural phenomena, but in terms
of the sacred –

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.120
things that are set apart from society as
extraordinary, inspiring awe, and deserving
of reverence.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.240
He claimed that in all societies, there’s a
difference between the sacred and the profane,
or the mundane, everyday parts of life.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.480
Religion, then, is a social institution that
involves a unified system of beliefs and
practices that recognizes the sacred.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.720
But this isn’t a set-up between good and evil.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.940
Sacred doesn’t mean good and profane doesn’t
mean bad.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.829
Instead, recognizing something as sacred is
about seeing a certain place, object, or experience
as special and creating markers that separate
it from your day to day life.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.920
It’s natural, then, to think about religion
from the perspective of Symbolic-Interactionism,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.480
which thinks about society in terms of the
symbols that humans construct.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.060
And all religions rely on the use of symbols
to create the Sacred.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.480
Rituals, for example, are a form of symbolic
practice that highlight faith.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.960
Many religions use certain actions during
prayer that symbolize deference to God,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.580
such as Catholics making the sign of the cross before
prayer, or Muslims supplicating themselves and facing
Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet Mohammed.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.560
Many religions also practice ritual ablution,
or washing certain parts of the body during
a religious ceremony.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.860
For example, in the religious practice of
baptism, water is a symbol of people’s belief
that faith cleanses the soul.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.060
Objects can also take on Sacred meaning.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.060
Symbols like the Cross or the Star of David
are considered totems, objects that we have
collectively defined as Sacred.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.940
Types of dress or grooming practices, such
as men’s beards in Islam or Orthodox Judaism,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.500
also become sacred indicators of faith because
they’re visible symbols of religious belief.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.140
In this way, Totems confer in-group membership
to those who wear or use these symbols,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.680
because they provide a way for people to demonstrate
their faith and recognize that faith in others.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.880
But the role of religion in society goes beyond
influencing our symbolic practices.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.940
In addition to defining the Sacred and the profane,
Emile Durkheim also looked at religion through the
lens of structural functionalism.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.480
And he identified three major functions of
religion that contribute to the operation of society.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.720
First, religion helps establish social cohesion, by uniting
people around shared symbols, norms, and values.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.220
Durkheim argued that religious thought promotes
norms like morality, fairness, charity, and justice.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.060
Churches act as gathering places, forming
the backbone of social life for many people.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.960
In fact, membership in a church is the most
common community association for Americans.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.040
Second, Durkheim said, societies use religion
as a form of social control.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.580
People behave well, not only out of fear of their
friends and families disapproving, but also out of
a desire to remain in their god’s good graces.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.600
Christianity and Judaism, for example, have the
Ten Commandments, a set of rules for behavior
that they believe were sent directly from God.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.960
But these commandments aren’t just rules
about how to worship –

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.240
many of them match up with societal norms, like
respecting your parents or not committing adultery, or
with secular laws, which prohibit murder and theft.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.100
Third, in a functionalist perspective, religion
provides people with a sense of purpose in life.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.140
Sometimes it can feel like our lives are such
tiny blips in the grand scheme of the universe, it
can be hard to imagine why your actions matter.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.060
Religion gives people a reason to see their
lives as meaningful, by framing them within the
greater purpose of their god’s grand plan.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.460
But while Durkheim’s framing demonstrates the
many ways religions promote social unity, religion
can, of course, also be a force of division.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.320
Social Conflict Theory perspectives understand religion in terms of how it entrenches existing inequalities.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.180
Karl Marx saw religion as an agent of
social stratification,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.340
which served those in power by legitimizing
the status quo and framing existing inequality
as part of a divine plan.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.380
Rulers in many societies were believed to
be given their right to rule by divine right.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.200
Chinese emperors were believed to have a mandate
from heaven, and were given the title Son of Heaven
to indicate their divine authority to rule.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.580
In Europe, heads of state were often also the head of
the Church – in fact, to this day, the British monarchs
are the formal heads of the Church of England.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.280
And some Christian religions, such as
Calvinism, espouse predestination,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.440
or the belief that God pre-ordains everything that
comes to pass, including whether you get into heaven.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.320
So, by this logic, having wealth and power
was seen as an indication of God’s favor.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.560
So, for these reasons, Marx saw religion as
a huge barrier to revolutionary change, referring
to it as the ‘opiate of the masses.’

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.580
After all, it’s hard to convince people to rise up
against the elites if they believe that the elites have
the power of God behind them!

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.300
In addition to entrenching political
and economic inequalities,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.120
Conflict Theory perspectives also explore how
religion contributes to gender and racial inequalities.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.160
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to look at how feminist
theory and race conflict theory help us understand
religion’s effects on these kinds of inequality.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.260
If you walk around any major museum in the Western
world, you’re pretty much guaranteed to find some art
depicting religious figures from Judaism or Christianity.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.560
And in these paintings, God is pretty much
exclusively an old white man with a beard.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.880
And in fact, divine figures and their prophets
in most religions are male.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:49.820
Virtually all of the world’s major religions are patriarchal,
with religious texts often explicitly describing men in the
image of God and women in subordinate roles to men.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:58.740
For example, in Christianity, the first man, Adam, was
created in God’s image whereas the first woman, Eve,
was created from Adam’s rib to serve and obey Adam.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.240
Many religions also position women as
immoral beings in need of male constraint.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.660
In the Bible, Eve committed the original sin
by tempting Adam to eat the forbidden fruit and
got both of them booted from paradise.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.140
Many religions ban women from
positions with the clergy, including Catholicism,
Orthodox Judaism, and Islam.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.740
Religion has also been used as a way to
control women’s behaviors,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.440
requiring them to dress modestly or not
allowing women to speak in church or be
alone with men outside their family.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.480
Religion has also been used to uphold another
type of social inequality: racial inequality.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.400
Slavery in the United States, for example,
was framed as morally justifiable based on
various texts from the Bible,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.440
most prominently the story of Cain and Abel,
in which God ‘marked’ Cain for murdering his brother,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.970
which was interpreted to mean marking
him as sinful with darker skin.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.000
But that’s not to say that religion is always
on the side of oppression.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.280
Quakers, a sect of Christianity, were leaders
in the abolition movement and in the women’s
suffrage movement of the 19th century.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.440
The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was led
by many with ties to the Black religious community.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.440
Most notably the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.760
a civil rights organization headed up by a
Baptist minister that you might have heard of
named Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.900
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.500
So, we’ve talked a lot so far about religion
in theory – but how does religion work in
a practical sense?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.140
Understanding how different religions are organized
and how they integrate with the rest of society

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.260
helps us understand which of these theories
make sense in different religious contexts.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.140
We only have to look at the US to see why
understanding the practical importance of
religion might be of interest to sociologists:

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.111
In the United States, more than 70% of American
adults claim that religion is important in their lives,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.620
which is more than double the rate of adults in
other high income countries like Norway or Japan.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.660
National surveys show that about 50% of Americans
identify as Protestants, 20% identify as Catholics,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.680
6% identify with a non-Christian faith, and
23% do not identify with a religion at all.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.760
Within the Protestant faith, there are a large number
of denominations, or subgroups of religious practice,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.040
including both mainstream denominations, such
as Presbyterians and Lutherans, and Evangelical
churches, such as Methodists and Baptists.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.760
Evangelical denominations are characterized
by more active attempts to proselytize, or spread
the faith to others outside the faith.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:14.100
But who identifies as what religion depends a lot
on who you are – in terms of where you live, in terms
of class, and in terms of race and ethnicity.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.060
More well-established religious faiths that
are well-integrated into society are what
sociologists call Churches.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:27.500
Most major religions are what we would call a
Church – for example, Christianity, Islam, Judaism,
Hinduism, and Buddhism are all ‘Churches’.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.200
Religious sects, meanwhile, are faiths with
belief systems that are less formal and less
integrated into society.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.100
And they tend to attract followers who are
more disadvantaged.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.600
Some examples include Jehovah’s Witnesses,
Pentecostals, or Unitarians.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.620
Not only does class matter when it comes to
your religion – where you live might, too.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.920
Catholicism is more common in Northeastern
and Southwestern states,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.360
whereas the South has high concentrations of Evangelical Protestants, such as Baptists,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.900
and the Midwest has higher concentrations of other
Protestant faiths, such as Methodists and Lutherans.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.060
Many of these regional differences stem from
which racial ethnic groups settled in these regions.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:07.840
The Midwest, for example, had high numbers
of German and Scandinavian immigrants settle there,
and these ethnic groups are often Lutherans.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.860
Irish and Italian Americans, who were more
likely to be Catholic, settled in New England
and the Mid-Atlantic.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.900
Black Americans – who are heavily
concentrated in Southern states –

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:22.760
are somewhat more likely to be religious than
the US population as a whole, with 87% claiming
an affiliation with some faith.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.260
And the vast majority of Black Americans identify
with a Protestant faith, with evangelical churches
being the most common affiliation.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.900
There’s also a growing number of Black
Americans who identify as Muslim,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.060
with about 40% of all native-born Muslims in the
US identifying themselves as African American.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:43.950
Overall, however, the importance of religion in
the United States has been on the decline in recent
decades – a process known as secularization.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.620
Younger Americans are much more likely now
to report that they do not believe in any religion
compared to past generations.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.300
Nonetheless, the influence of religion on
society isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.280
As we learned today – no matter which school
of sociological thought you subscribe to –

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.180
religion has ties to the very rules and norms that
shape what our society and culture look like.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.740
Today, we looked at how symbolic interactionism
helps us understand religion’s dichotomy of
the Sacred vs. the Profane.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.020
Then, we compared the perspectives of Structural
Functionalists and Social Conflict Theorists

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.860
on whether religion improves social cohesiveness
or increases social stratification.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.620
And we ended with a discussion of how religious
practice in the US differs across race and class lines.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:30.420
