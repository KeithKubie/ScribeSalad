00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530
pragmatism within the Mormon population
 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.350
pragmatism within the Mormon population
that should not be lost in any

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360
that should not be lost in any
 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.190
that should not be lost in any
discussion of their political profile

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.200
discussion of their political profile
 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.330
discussion of their political profile
okay so there's some evidence Mormons or

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340
okay so there's some evidence Mormons or
 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.430
okay so there's some evidence Mormons or
conservative no shock but let me show

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
conservative no shock but let me show
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.600
conservative no shock but let me show
you some ways in which Mormons are

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610
you some ways in which Mormons are
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.650
you some ways in which Mormons are
distinctive well their distinctive in a

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660
distinctive well their distinctive in a
 

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.720
distinctive well their distinctive in a
conservative way on some issues so this

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:56.730
conservative way on some issues so this
 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.270
conservative way on some issues so this
shows you the percentage of Americans

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280
shows you the percentage of Americans
 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.240
shows you the percentage of Americans
who say it is better for a household if

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.250
who say it is better for a household if
 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.720
who say it is better for a household if
the wife stays home and the husband is

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:05.730
the wife stays home and the husband is
 

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.210
the wife stays home and the husband is
the breadwinner the other option being

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220
the breadwinner the other option being
 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.920
the breadwinner the other option being
that the husband and wife both work and

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:09.930
that the husband and wife both work and
 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.490
that the husband and wife both work and
share responsibilities at home so this

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500
share responsibilities at home so this
 

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.020
share responsibilities at home so this
is the percentage who choose the more

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.030
is the percentage who choose the more
 

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.640
is the percentage who choose the more
conservative a traditionalist option

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:16.650
conservative a traditionalist option
 

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.290
conservative a traditionalist option
that's better if women do not work and

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300
that's better if women do not work and
 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.510
that's better if women do not work and
you can see that Mormons are very

you can see that Mormons are very
distinctive on this issue the Mormons

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:22.710
distinctive on this issue the Mormons
 

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.350
distinctive on this issue the Mormons
are much more likely to say that it is

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360
are much more likely to say that it is
 

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.460
are much more likely to say that it is
better that doesn't mean that they

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:25.470
better that doesn't mean that they
 

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.140
better that doesn't mean that they
themselves necessarily have that family

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.150
themselves necessarily have that family
 

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.300

everyone involved if women don't work so
 

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.240
everyone involved if women don't work so
there's a conservative example of how

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.250
there's a conservative example of how
 

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.820

near unanimity on that question that
 

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.620
near unanimity on that question that
sort of fits in with Professor Barlow's

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:18.630
sort of fits in with Professor Barlow's
 

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.210
sort of fits in with Professor Barlow's
remarks just a few minutes ago okay so

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220
remarks just a few minutes ago okay so
 

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.640
remarks just a few minutes ago okay so
those are two examples of these are ways

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:25.650
those are two examples of these are ways
 

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.590
those are two examples of these are ways
that we see the distinctiveness of

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600
that we see the distinctiveness of
 

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.110
that we see the distinctiveness of
Mormons on the right but it turns out

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120
Mormons on the right but it turns out
 

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.150
Mormons on the right but it turns out
that on some other issues Mormons are

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160
that on some other issues Mormons are
 

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.650
that on some other issues Mormons are
distinctive in ways that do not

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660
distinctive in ways that do not
 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.000
distinctive in ways that do not
necessarily fall in line with the right

Mormons while not the most Pro immigrant

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.610
Mormons while not the most Pro immigrant
 

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.190
Mormons while not the most Pro immigrant
group in America are far more supportive

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200
group in America are far more supportive
 

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.310
group in America are far more supportive
of positive toward immigrants than our

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320

of positive toward immigrants than our
other conservative groups like the

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:54.810
other conservative groups like the
 

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.380
other conservative groups like the
evangelicals so this question again

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.390
evangelicals so this question again
 

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.720
evangelicals so this question again
comes from our survey of the entire US

00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.730
comes from our survey of the entire US
 

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.730

population we asked people to make a

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
population we asked people to make a

population we asked people to make a
trade off do you think it's better for

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.210
trade off do you think it's better for
 

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.060
trade off do you think it's better for
us to increase immigration or should we

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.070
us to increase immigration or should we
 

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.950
us to increase immigration or should we
should we decrease it this is shows you

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:06.960
should we decrease it this is shows you
 

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.870
should we decrease it this is shows you
the percentage who say that immigration

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880
the percentage who say that immigration
 

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.160
the percentage who say that immigration
should be increased it's interesting

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.170
should be increased it's interesting
 

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.810
should be increased it's interesting
that none of these numbers are terribly

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820
that none of these numbers are terribly
 

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.330
that none of these numbers are terribly
high but Mormons are far more likely

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.340
high but Mormons are far more likely
 

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.280
high but Mormons are far more likely
than evangelicals to say that yes we

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:16.290
than evangelicals to say that yes we
 

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.590
than evangelicals to say that yes we
should have more immigration and the

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600
should have more immigration and the
 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.360
should have more immigration and the
only group that they sort of come close

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.370
only group that they sort of come close
 

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.980
only group that they sort of come close
to our really Jews Jews are a little

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:21.990
to our really Jews Jews are a little
 

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.500
to our really Jews Jews are a little
more likely to support immigration and

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:24.510
more likely to support immigration and
 

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.780
more likely to support immigration and
but of course politically Jews look a

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:26.790
but of course politically Jews look a
 

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.760
but of course politically Jews look a
lot different in many other respects

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:28.770
lot different in many other respects
 

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.920
lot different in many other respects
from Mormons I'll skip over that more

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:33.930
from Mormons I'll skip over that more

immigration on our survey of Mormons

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:38.340
immigration on our survey of Mormons
 

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.290
immigration on our survey of Mormons
only we asked Mormons to place

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300
only we asked Mormons to place
 

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.180
only we asked Mormons to place
themselves on a continuum so they could

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.190
themselves on a continuum so they could
 

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.560
themselves on a continuum so they could
either say that well immigrant strength

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:45.570
either say that well immigrant strength
 

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.210
either say that well immigrant strength
in our country they could say that

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220
in our country they could say that
 

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.040
in our country they could say that
immigrants are a burden or they could

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.050
immigrants are a burden or they could
 

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.410
immigrants are a burden or they could
pick some point in between and this

pick some point in between and this
 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.420
pick some point in between and this
shows you that well it's kind of an even

shows you that well it's kind of an even
 

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.250
shows you that well it's kind of an even
mix across those four options it's not

scale of zero to 100 so you have these
 

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.120
scale of zero to 100 so you have these
two options and you had a little slider

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.130
two options and you had a little slider

double-edged sword because use the
 

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.290
double-edged sword because use the
kindling once and it's extinguished and

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:52.300
kindling once and it's extinguished and
 

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.670
kindling once and it's extinguished and
