00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.720
From producer Tim Burton

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.200
and replacement director Joel Schumacher

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.360
comes a Batman movie that replaces the 80's gothic look of the first two

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540
with the ecstasy soaked fever dream of the mid-90's.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.180
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.120
Yup, this is definitely the worst movie I've seen 30 times

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.240
Batman Forever

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.480
After Tim Bburton made Batman cool for the main stream,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.660
then put too much kinky stuff in the sequel to sell kid's toys,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.280
Warner Bros. picked Joel Schumacher as the pariah-- err... director

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320
to push the franchise in a more family-friendly direction

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.500
&lt;i&gt;-Holy rusted metal, Batman!
-Uh?&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.240
But hey! If this was the way we had to go through to get Nolan... take it away, Joel

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.400
&lt;i&gt;-Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you, sir?
-I'll get drive-through.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.900
[sigh]

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.100
Meet Val Kilmer's unique take on Batman

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220
He's not weird like Keaton,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.980
charming like Clooney,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.840
intimidating like Bale,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.640
swoll like Affleck,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.540
or emotional like a human.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.860
But he does contribute one major unique trait to the Batman legacy:

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.260
His mouth is always open!

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.060
I mean. bats do eat bugs... I guess that's one way to catch'em

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260
Watch Batman face Two-Face:

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.500
A man with the power of not being a threat half the time

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.440
But there's also the onesy-wearing Riddler:

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.500
Jim Carrey, at the height of his powers, brings the same manic energy he brings to his other roles

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.260
&lt;i&gt;Joygasm!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.580
&lt;i&gt;Ssssssmokin'!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.480
while Tommy Lee Jones makes the horrible choice to bring the same manic energy as Jim Carrey

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700
&lt;i&gt;...aand meee!!!!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.200
Watch these two actors try to one-up each other on camera

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.340
...while the real drama was apparently going down off-screen

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.980
&lt;i&gt;-He got up and hugged me, and said 'I hate you. I really don't like you'&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.240
Drill, as Batman faces his greatest danger yet,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.360
the only thing that can actually stop him for good:

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.820
A therapist!

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.040
Dr. Chase Meridian takes her place alongside Vicki Vale, as the latest Bat-girlfriend you'll never hear from again.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.580
She's got brains, brawn, and she's not using either of them

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.100
Because all she does is perv out on a stranger in a rubber suit

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.580
&lt;i&gt;You ARE interesting&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.200
&lt;i&gt;Well, I wish I could say that my interest in you is... purely professional&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.220
[many moans]

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.540
&lt;i&gt;My place. Mightnight&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.840
&lt;i&gt;I've imagined this moment since I first saw you. Your eyes. Your lips. Your body.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Experience the Bat-family grow bigger with Chris O'Donnell's Robin,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.140
whose lame origin story of the Robin name

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.560
&lt;i&gt;I flew in like a Robin&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.800
is still better than The Dark Knight Rises'

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.820
&lt;i&gt;-You should use you full name: Robin
-Thanks&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.320
Witness a mid-twenties actor, who is best to play a cool teen,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.540
complete with cool motorcycle and learher jacket,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.700
giant 90s cool guy earring,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.700
and something no-one will ever make cool:

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.160
Laundry Karate!

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.600
Holy 'dry clean only', Batman! This makes me wanna drink some bleach!

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.940
So, witness the begining of the end of the original Bat-quadrilogy

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.920
that put nipples on the Batsuit,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.100
launched Akiva Goldsman's career,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.480
and cut out the insane sub-plot with the giant bat,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.100
but survives today by hanging on to its three redeeming qualities:

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.780
The Thumbs-up .gif

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.400
The epic Seal song

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.040
And the fact that no matter what you have to say it's not as sh*tty as Batman &amp; Robin

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.080
[Ka-ching]

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.900
&lt;i&gt;Never leave the cave without it&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.540
Starring

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.640
Hello, Reddit! I am actor and artist Val Kilmer. AMA!

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360
A chewed up Starburst!

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.100
Jim Carries the movie

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.960
Dr. Girlfriend

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.660
The Adult Wonder

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.440
Didn't sign up for this

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.100
The world's craziest Laser Tag arena

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.200
The "Batman! Yeah!" guy

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.620
&lt;i&gt;Batman! Yeah!&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.000
The "Boiling acid!" guy

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.640
&lt;i&gt;Oh, no! It's boiling acid!&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840
and What's that, girl? Batman fell down a well? [bark]

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.440
Batman Begins
...to suck

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.780
Did anyone notice Two-Face's lair only works if he is facing one direction?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.020
Do they have to rearrange the furniture when he turns around?
