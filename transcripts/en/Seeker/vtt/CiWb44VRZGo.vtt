00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.150
Alec Gallimore: “What you're seeing is this
energetic blue-greenish plasma that comes

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.150
out of the thruster.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.670
It really looks like science fiction.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.210
In the end, we're supplying electricity through
a wire and an inert gas and we turn it into

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.600
this beautiful plasma that's moving at tremendous
velocities that's providing thrust that may

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.490
one day send people to Mars.”

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.949
Chemical rockets are the workhorses of the
space age, and they’ve had a pretty standard

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.260
formula for the past 60 years.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.180
Get millions of pounds of liquid or solid
fuel into a rocket, light it on fire with

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.670
an oxidizer, and then the speed of the propellant
shooting out the back gives the rocket enough

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.370
thrust, or kick, to get into space.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.820
This works great for escaping Earth’s gravity.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
But if we want to get to Mars, chemical rockets
have hit their their performance limit.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.980
We need new propulsion systems that can rapidly
shoot a spacecraft across interplanetary distances,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340
while using less propellant at the same time.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.649
That’s where the X3 comes in.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.430
As part of NASA’s NextStep program, the
X3 is an entirely new space engine that’s

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.670
all electric.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.440
Alec Gallimore: “Electro-propulsion devices
have the equivalent of 10 times the propellant

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.830
efficiency of a chemical system.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.260
To give you an example, a chemical rocket
tops out at around 40,000 mph.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.572
An electric system can go over 100,000 mph
and in fact, NASA is working on a project

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:24.180
to design one that can actually achieve a
velocity of 500,000 mph.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.930
And at that speed you cover a distance between
the Earth and the Moon in about 30 minutes.”

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.110
Here at the University of Michigan’s Plasmadynamics
and Electric Propulsion lab, engineers and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.160
students are working on the X3, a type of
electric propulsion design called a Hall thruster.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.210
Alec Gallimore: “Hall effect thrusters are
really a kind of a very ingenious propulsion

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.210
system.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.130
We take a propellant, in some cases an inert
gas like xenon.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.580
We put a huge amount of energy into it, creates
a high temperature plasma, charged particles

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.720
of electrons and ions, and then we can use
electromagnetic fields to shoot out the plasma

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
at very high speeds.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.640
So they're very simple in design, complex
though in operations and very, very efficient.”

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.030
Hall thrusters aren’t just a thing of the
future.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.030
There are actually hundreds of satellites
above you right now using electric propulsion

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.500
to stay in position.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.340
But this technology hasn’t been used for
manned missions yet, because the amount of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.570
thrust they’re capable of generating is
just too low, which means slower acceleration

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.440
and a longer trip to Mars.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040
So, we need more thrust.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.230
Ben Jorns: “Traditional Hall thrusters that
work in space operate between one and six

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.420
kilowatts.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.080
Now the X-3 comes in and trying to scale Hall
effect thruster technology, into a new power

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
operator machine.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.890
So going from six kilowatts to 100 or 200
kilowatts.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.700
And the advantage of that is if you go to
higher power, you can generate higher thrust.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.690
And therefore have higher acceleration.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.620
Instead of using one channel, which a traditional
hall thruster has three channels, so you take

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.350
all those engineering requirements and you
multiply it by a factor of three.”

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.460
For these engines to be used in space one
day, testing is critical, and these labs are

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.960
uniquely equipped for the challenge.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.540
Alec Gallimore: “Sitting behind me is what's
called ‘The Large Vacuum Test Facility’

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.540
the LVTF.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.190
It has one of the highest pumping speeds in
the world, which means it's able to have a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.921
very low pressure while it's operating a large
flow rate.

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.560
And we use it to simulate space.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.290
We have 19 cryogenic pumps, that remove all
the air and all the gasses from the chamber

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.940
so we can have a more realistic environment
to test these thrusters.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.200
Students run experimental campaigns in the
LVTF.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.040
One student might be trying to analyze the
life of a thruster.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.860
Another person might be trying to understand
how the electrons from the cathode make their

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.050
way to the channel.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.480
A successful test is often when you find something
unexpected that ultimately leads you to having

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.569
a better understanding of the device you're
testing.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:51.680
And that happens quite a bit.”

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.350
But the X3 is too powerful for even the LVTF,
and at this point, only NASA’s Glenn Research

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.900
facility can handle its testing at full capacity.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.830
Alec Gallimore: “A typical thruster may
weigh 10 pounds, this thing weighs 500 pounds.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.080
So just designing and building all the components
of this mega-scale thruster was a challenge

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.730
that we took on.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.949
Last year was a blockbuster year for the X3.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:24.100
It set records for Hall thrusters for the
highest power level at over 100 kilowatts

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.230
of power.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.180
The highest level of thrust and actually the
highest amount of current being passed through

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.290
any type of Hall current thruster.”

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.540
These engineering achievements are key, because
electric propulsion is going to be a central

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.950
part of our future in space.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.220
Alec Gallimore: “NASA is working on developing
a sort of a 20 year game plan.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.130
The idea is that we've been in the International
Space Station now for more than a decade and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.130
that has been a great.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.460
But the next step would be something like
a space station around the Moon.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.740
We would have an outpost around lunar orbit
to test new technologies that would be needed

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.970
to have humans live in space.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.520
Hall thrusters are playing a really important
role in this...it's baseline is to have a

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.440
bank of four Hall effect thrusters around
because they want to be able to move around

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.340
this space station and actually demonstrate
the ability to use electric propulsion of

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.930
this kind with a human attended spacecraft.”

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.500
The X3 is likely two incarnations away from
being flight ready, but the work happening

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.330
here is all about demonstrating new principles
for how to design electro-propulsion engines.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.550
Ultimately, future space travel will use a
combination of chemical and electric propulsion

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.550
to travel through space.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.460
And it’s projects like the X3 that make
a future mission to Mars even more possible.
