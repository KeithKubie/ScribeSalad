00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.017
The slope of our equation, because this is in slope-intercept form is just the

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:09.973
coefficient in front of the x, so that's the cost to make each nozzle. We know

00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:14.693
that each nozzle costs $2 to make, so m is just 2. This is the thing that's

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:19.814
going to determine how much the total amount of money spent or y will change as

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:24.390
the number of nozzles or x changes. Now that we know that m is equal to 2, we

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.711
can replace cost to make each nozzle with 2. Well, that looks even better. I am

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.698
so excited about where we're going with this equation.
