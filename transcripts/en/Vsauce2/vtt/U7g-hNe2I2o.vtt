Vsauce!

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.210
Kevin here.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.490
The Ulfberht was a type of viking sword made
for a short period of time and considered

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.360
one of the greatest swords ever made.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
Created from 800-1000 AD using high-quality
crucible steel from Central Asia - they were

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.939
so much stronger and more flexible than any
sword in their time they were inlayed with

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.279
the word Ulfbert to set them apart although
no one today knows the meaning behind the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.279
name.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.200
We do know this sword was so famous it was
copied in its day and out of the 171 found

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.450
only a handful are authentic Ulfberhts and
there are no other instances of this high-quality

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.809
steel technology in Europe for almost a thousand
years.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.120
What the FAK.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.980
The facts and knowledge on Legendary Swords.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.870
Excalibur was the sword of the King Arthur
and arguably the most famous sword of all

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
time.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.519
There are two different accounts of how he
became the owner of Excalibur.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.200
One popularized version is that Excalibur
is also the sword in the stone and young Arthur

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.229
was the only one able to pull the sword that
was held magically by the stone.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.380
Doing this proved he was the true king of
Britain.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.159
The other account states that he was given
the sword by the lady of the lake.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.000
After he was mortally wounded in battle he
ordered one of his knights of the round table

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.030
to return the sword to the lake, where an
arm rose and caught it.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.320
The Honjo Masamune is considered one of the
finest Japanese swords ever made and was created

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.520
by the man often recognized as Japan's greatest
swordsmith - Masamune.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.840
Legend states the blade is so perfectly balanced
and aligned that it splits light rendering

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840
its wielder invisible.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.579
Unfortunately the sword went missing in 1946
but Final Fantasy fans will recognize a Masamune

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.219
sword carried by Sephiroth in Final Fantasy
7.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.549
In 1965 the Sword Of Goujian was discovered
inside a casket with a human skeleton along

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.280
the Zhang River amongst more than fifty ancient
tombs.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.899
Even though it had been buried for over 2000
years, the sword remained sharp with very

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.340
little tarnish.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.270
Script on the sword was still legible and
read "Belonging to King Goujijan of Yue, made

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.970
for his personal use."

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
The blade was analyzed to understand why it
held up so well over the centuries and it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.450
was likely the combination of elements in
the sword and the air tight scabbard were

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.330
responsible for its incredible preservation.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.920
A claymore is a Scottish Variant of the late
medieval two handed longsword and it is the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.741
same kind of sword believed to have been carried
by William Wallace.

00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:35.630
Wallace was a Scottish Knight famous for leading
a resistance against the English during the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.810
Wars of Scottish Independence.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.020
The sword is 5 ft 6 inches (168 cm) including
the hilt and weighs 6 pounds (2.7 kg).

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.350
Legend states the original scabbard, hilt,
and belt were made from the skin of one of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.130
the English Commanders at the Battle of Sterling
Bridge.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.640
Rapiers were specifically designed for thrusting
and featured complex hilts to protect the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.320
hand of the swordsman.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.400
The hilts were designed with many variations
including the swept hilt in Italy, the Pappenheimer

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.150
in Germany or The Taza Cup Hilt style of Spain.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.780
And the Rapier was made famous in pop culture
by the Three Musketeers, The Princess Bride

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.700
and video games like the Fire Emblem series.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.190
To trap and defend against swords there were
trident daggers.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.300
Carried in the swordsman's off-hand they were
designed to defend and parry swords - opening

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.620
up the opponent for a strike.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.910
Sword breakers were designed to catch, and
then eventually break an enemy's sword.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.430
I'm gonna leave you with this legendary replica
sword made by Tony from Man At Arms.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.940
What style is it and what famous historical
figure used it?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.620
Before we go here's last video's winner.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.900
I want to thank Tony from Man At Arms - this
place is amazing.
