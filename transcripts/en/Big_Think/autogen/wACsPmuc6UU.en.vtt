00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.389
I'm passionate about getting talent back to
work really for three different reasons.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.430
One, and frankly it may appeal to some of
your viewers, I'm a taxpayer.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.480
And anything that we can do to reduce recidivism,
keep people off of the rolls as an expense,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.760
a government expense and a prison, as taxpayers,
is a positive.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.359
So there's that part of me.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.739
We have 7.3 million open jobs, and only 6
million people currently looking for jobs,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.640
which means we have a talent shortage.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.370
And if we can do anything to eliminate that
talent shortage, that's 1.3 million people,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.370
roughly.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.360
Every year some 700,000 or so people are released
from jails and prisons in America.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.640
So we can use some of that population, that
700,000-person population, to make a dent

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.010
in that 1.3 million-person deficit.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.739
So it's just practically smart.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.649
And then the third part of me, which is more
humanitarian based, is people who have made

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.579
mistakes should be deserving of a second chance.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.709
It is just I mean, because all of us have
made mistakes; some have been caught, some

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:12.709
haven't.

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.549
But these people have presumably paid their
debt to society.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.899
And if the idea is: I make a mistake at 25
years old.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.599
I go to jail for five years or prison for
five years.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.640
And then I get out.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.619
What do I have to look forward to if, forever,
I'm going to wear the scarlet letter, Convict,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.420
the C, that says I'll never get another opportunity?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.420
Life is over, then.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.649
The holy grail of this would be if we could
identify people who are six months, a year,

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.039
away from release and begin giving them transitional
skills: work skills, life skills.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.039
Think about this.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.490
I was just meeting with someone who's been
incarcerated for 25 years.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.549
The cell phone, as we know it, didn't exist
then.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.100
So when they come out, they're going to have
to get adjusted to all of that.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.369
The world has literally transformed in 25
years.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.179
So in an ideal state, we would begin helping
them transition back into a world that they

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.650
pushed the pause button on two and a half
decades ago.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.430
And we've got to catch them up pretty quickly
so that they acclimate and don't recidivate.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.949
That's number one.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:24.099
But once we do get them out, the most important
thing we can do is get them back to work housing

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.400
and work.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.599
And they're sort of inextricably intertwined.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.019
But housing is critical.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.849
And we've got to find places for people to
have a permanent place.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.459
Mind you, they've had housing for some significant
period of time.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.230
And on the outside, absent that, there's an
instability that makes them more vulnerable.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.709
And then you've got to pay for that housing,
which is where the job comes in.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.500
We employers have to reach out to this population
and let all of our biases go away.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.180
And we really do have to overcome our own
biases.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.720
We talk about implicit bias, unconscious bias.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.980
People think, oh, that's just in the context
of race and gender.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.459
Well, the fact of the matter is we have a
lot of biases, one of which is a bias that

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.170
we have against the formerly incarcerated.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.390
And maybe it's because of television and everything
that we see in movies and the characterizations

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.909
of people who are in jail, but all of that
comes through, whether we're conscious of

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.739
it or not, when we are talking to someone
who we know has been incarcerated.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.549
We have some interesting research that says
roughly 80% of HR managers say, 'I'm interested

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.159
and would be willing to hire the formerly
incarcerated.'

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.310
SHRM's research says there is no bias at that
level.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.139
Where we get into the bias and have had it
and seen it historically was customers and

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.510
other employees.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.510
Those are the biggies.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.209
You know, there's this NIMBY concept, which
says, 'Yeah, I like the idea of hiring the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.480
formerly incarcerated, but not to sit next
to my daughter at work.'

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.129
So Not In My Backyard that's the NIMBY concept.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.980
And so we've had to work on that.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.760
Fortunately, we have some new research that
says employees themselves, as a result of

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.500
this narrative changing, and we're repositioning
the formerly incarcerated, have said, 'I'm

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.500
OK.'

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.829
Three-quarters of employees have said, 'I'm
OK with you bringing people into the workplace

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.870
for non-violent crimes.'

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.400
Similarly, about three-quarters of customers
have said, 'For non-violent crimes, I'm willing

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.360
to buy from a company that openly hires the
formerly incarcerated, a product or service.'

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360
They're willing to do that.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.370
Those were two major hurdles in the past.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.220
And what we're seeing is as a result of us
changing the narrative these are not bad people.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.090
They are people who made mistakes.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.120
And that every one of us has made them and
is entitled to a second chance we're changing

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.770
the narrative around hiring the formerly incarcerated,
which is why SHRM is so committed to it.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.979
Again, partially, employers just need to fill
this deficit.

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.270
America's birth rate has been on the decline
since about the year 2000.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.770
So we don't have the luxury of refusing to
give opportunities to any large population

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.800
of people.
