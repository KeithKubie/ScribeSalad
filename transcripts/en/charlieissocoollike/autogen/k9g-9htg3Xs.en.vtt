00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.680
spectrum like ultraviolet light and
x-rays but the problem of all of this is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
x-rays but the problem of all of this is
 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.350
x-rays but the problem of all of this is
that only about 4% of the universe is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
that only about 4% of the universe is
 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.300
that only about 4% of the universe is
stuff we can actually see using light

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
stuff we can actually see using light
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.390
stuff we can actually see using light
the other 96% is known as the dark

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
the other 96% is known as the dark
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.730
the other 96% is known as the dark
universe and it's completely invisible

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740
universe and it's completely invisible
 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.890
universe and it's completely invisible
to us however now that we know what

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
to us however now that we know what
 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.810
to us however now that we know what
gravitational waves look like the plan

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820
gravitational waves look like the plan
 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.790
gravitational waves look like the plan
is to figure out more about them and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800
is to figure out more about them and
 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.650
is to figure out more about them and
then hopefully use that information to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
then hopefully use that information to
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.590
then hopefully use that information to
try and build a new kind of telescope

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
try and build a new kind of telescope
 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600
try and build a new kind of telescope
that will allow us to see the universe

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610
that will allow us to see the universe
 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.570
that will allow us to see the universe
using gravity instead of light and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580
using gravity instead of light and
 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.130
using gravity instead of light and
there's a chance as well this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
there's a chance as well this
 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.420
there's a chance as well this
information might allow us to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
information might allow us to
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.340
information might allow us to
extrapolate back to probably the biggest

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350
extrapolate back to probably the biggest
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.320
extrapolate back to probably the biggest
gravitational event of all of them the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
gravitational event of all of them the
 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.390
gravitational event of all of them the
Big Bang and learn more about where we

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400
Big Bang and learn more about where we
 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800
Big Bang and learn more about where we
all came from it's kind of like we've

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
all came from it's kind of like we've
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.360
all came from it's kind of like we've
been watching the universe like it's a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
been watching the universe like it's a
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.000
been watching the universe like it's a
TV on mute this whole time and we've

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
TV on mute this whole time and we've
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.950
TV on mute this whole time and we've
just finally figured out where the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960
just finally figured out where the
 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.320
just finally figured out where the
remote is so I am incredibly excited to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330
remote is so I am incredibly excited to
 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.420
remote is so I am incredibly excited to
see what new discoveries will be made as

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430
see what new discoveries will be made as
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.880
see what new discoveries will be made as
a result of this and I hope you know are

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890
a result of this and I hope you know are
 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.740
a result of this and I hope you know are

science video I made about Saturn

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830
science video I made about Saturn
 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.960
science video I made about Saturn
because that one's quite fun also

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970
because that one's quite fun also
 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.590

I'm gonna be one of those annoying

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600
I'm gonna be one of those annoying
 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.150
I'm gonna be one of those annoying

what my book is about so be prepared for

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900
what my book is about so be prepared for
 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.530
what my book is about so be prepared for
that for now I'll just say that if you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
that for now I'll just say that if you
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.530
that for now I'll just say that if you
enjoyed this video you'll probably enjoy

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540
enjoyed this video you'll probably enjoy
 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.140
enjoyed this video you'll probably enjoy
the book as well I hope that's vague

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
the book as well I hope that's vague
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.170
the book as well I hope that's vague
enough good bye
