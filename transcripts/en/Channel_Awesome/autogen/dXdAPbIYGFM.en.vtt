00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
after that that's really the most I
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.149 align:start position:0%
after that that's really the most I
should<00:01:16.979><c> say</c><00:01:17.450><c> in</c><00:01:18.450><c> terms</c><00:01:19.140><c> of</c><00:01:19.939><c> the</c><00:01:20.939><c> film</c><00:01:21.420><c> itself</c>

in terms of like that the mood and the
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 align:start position:0%
in terms of like that the mood and the
tone<00:01:24.810><c> I</c><00:01:25.200><c> think</c><00:01:25.439><c> one</c><00:01:25.950><c> of</c><00:01:25.979><c> the</c><00:01:26.070><c> reasons</c><00:01:26.430><c> it</c><00:01:26.580><c> works</c>

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 align:start position:0%
tone I think one of the reasons it works
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 align:start position:0%
tone I think one of the reasons it works
so<00:01:27.030><c> well</c><00:01:27.060><c> is</c><00:01:27.570><c> that</c><00:01:27.869><c> the</c><00:01:28.350><c> first</c><00:01:28.590><c> half</c><00:01:28.920><c> of</c><00:01:29.130><c> this</c>

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:0%

now that's high praise so clearly it's
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.729 align:start position:0%
now that's high praise so clearly it's

not as good as either of those but it
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
not as good as either of those but it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
reason the scares in the second half
 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
reason the scares in the second half
work<00:03:18.750><c> as</c><00:03:18.959><c> well</c><00:03:19.140><c> as</c><00:03:19.260><c> they</c><00:03:19.440><c> do</c><00:03:19.730><c> because</c><00:03:20.730><c> the</c>

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 align:start position:0%
work as well as they do because the
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.490 align:start position:0%
work as well as they do because the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
horror until roughly the second half but
the<00:03:26.459><c> reason</c><00:03:26.760><c> it</c><00:03:26.850><c> works</c><00:03:27.000><c> so</c><00:03:27.269><c> well</c><00:03:27.450><c> is</c><00:03:27.540><c> because</c>

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
the reason it works so well is because
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 align:start position:0%
the reason it works so well is because
it<00:03:28.019><c> creates</c><00:03:28.530><c> this</c><00:03:28.829><c> environment</c><00:03:29.070><c> where</c><00:03:30.000><c> you</c>

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 align:start position:0%
it creates this environment where you
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.780 align:start position:0%
it creates this environment where you
are<00:03:30.239><c> just</c><00:03:30.450><c> so</c><00:03:30.900><c> uneasy</c><00:03:31.590><c> and</c><00:03:31.980><c> it</c><00:03:32.700><c> feels</c><00:03:33.150><c> real</c><00:03:33.630><c> and</c>

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 align:start position:0%
are just so uneasy and it feels real and
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.100 align:start position:0%
are just so uneasy and it feels real and
because<00:03:35.790><c> of</c><00:03:35.820><c> that</c><00:03:36.030><c> you</c><00:03:36.299><c> feel</c><00:03:36.600><c> like</c><00:03:36.900><c> you're</c>

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 align:start position:0%
because of that you feel like you're
 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
because of that you feel like you're
