00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay. Welcome back. Let's go and implement this thing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Since we're addressing a global variable,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we need to declare it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All we do is we take the command that's being input in here and append it to our list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
To see whether everything has been recorded properly,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we print out saved commands at the end of the execution.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's see how this works.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here again we do have our three commands as they're being processed.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is the recorded commands, namely: open, save, and quit.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you're running this outside of the web page--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that is, on a command line--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
then you can actually uncomment this line and interact with the program itself.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
