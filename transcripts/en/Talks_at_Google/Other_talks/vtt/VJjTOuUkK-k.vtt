MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.300
I guess we'll get started.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.550
Yeah, very excited to be here.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.341
We have Jon Taffer here
today who many of you know.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.140
Quick background on Jon.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.200
This is from his TV show.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.024
I love the opening.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:12.940
[ECHOES] Running a bar
is not just a business.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.130
It's a science.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.900
And no one know more about
science than Jon Taffer.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.030
Over the last 36 years,
Jon has transformed

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.150
hundreds of failing
bars worldwide.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.940
Using his proven methods
and no nonsense approach,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.979
Jon turns money pits
into money makers.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.270
JON TAFFER: That's pretty good.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.770
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.270
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.770
JON TAFFER: I'm not
sure I can top that.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.210
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, your
sound guy's awesome.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.780
All right.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.300
But anyway, so Jon is
a very popular host

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.690
of the TV show "Bar
Rescue" on Spike TV.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.210
He travels around the
country, finding failing bars

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.510
and optimizing them.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.950
He's got a whole science and
strategies and philosophy

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.179
on how to optimize a bar.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.970
And at the end, you
know, he leaves the bar

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.560
in five days totally changed
and generally successful.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.570
We'll talk about some of
the ones that revert back.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.830
In 2010, he was
appointed president

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.534
of the Nightclub
and Bar Media Group.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:03.075
And then he's recently served
as chairman of Taffer Dynamics,

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:05.790
where he acts as a consultant
to restaurants, nightclubs,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.372
hotels, bars, everything.

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:10.080
And then he just
released his first book,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
which is why we're here.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.540
It's called "Raise the Bar.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.020
An Action-based Method for
Maximum Customer Reactions."

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.480
And it was published
just a few months ago.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.262
And Jon, like I
said, I'm a huge fan.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.970
So I'm very excited
about this interview.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.200
And a round of applause.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.970
Thank you for being here.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.445
JON TAFFER: Thank you.

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:25.395
Good to be here.

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:28.200
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.400
So before we jump into
the book, let's first talk

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.880
about kind of your journey.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.290
You started out working in
the restaurant/bar industry.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.010
He even ran Barney's Beanery,
which most people here

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.780
know about.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.194
And then you went into
the consulting business.

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:43.110
Can you kind of talk
about that transformation

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.372
from working and owning bars to
moving into being a consultant?

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.080
JON TAFFER: Sure.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.570
I didn't learn this in college.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.530
I was a political science major.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.930
Very glad I didn't go into
that business, by the way.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.950
But I started tending
bar in college.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.250
And one thing led to another.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.040
And as Jon Lennon
once said "life

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.450
is what happens when
you make other plans."

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.360
And I wound up being
in the bar business

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.970
and started as a bartender.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.300
Became a head bartender,
assistant manager,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.030
general manager.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.660
Moved into the hotel arena.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.140
Became a general manager
of a large resort,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.960
and vice president
of a hotel company.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.460
And in the mid-'80s,
tax codes changed.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.780
And hotels couldn't
write off the deductions

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.840
that they used to.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.280
So suddenly, restaurants and
hotels had to make money.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.140
They couldn't be
write-offs anymore.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.860
And the hotel
industry had operated

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.230
what I call guest
amenities, not businesses.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.100
So I came in.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.040
And I'm that guy
who signed contracts

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.731
with all the big
hotel companies.

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.480
I'm the guy who closed
all the restaurants

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.880
in the top of hotels
all across the country.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.850
Shut them all down.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.650
I'm the first guy who ever put
a leased restaurant in a Holiday

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.790
Inn hotel, which was a
very good idea for them,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.780
and really worked very deeply
bringing brands into hotels

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.410
and working in hotel food
and beverage when I started.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.950
I wound up doing about 300
hotels all over the world.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.160
Properties like the Park Hyatt
in Sydney, Grand Hyatt Tokyo,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.370
Taipei, Taiwan,
Jerusalem, London,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.410
and started working all over the
world for the hotel industry.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.080
And my whole purpose
was to teach hoteliers

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.710
how to do restaurants
and bars that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.820
could compete against
free standing.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.970
Because in those days,
hotels had no credibility

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.160
in that arena.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680
And that's how I started.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.380
And I started my
consulting company in 1986.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.560
And my first client was the
company that I worked for.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.510
So I left, brought them in.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.810
And then my life changed
when Sheraton came up to me

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.540
and offered me a major contract.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.320
And I did 40 Sheraton hotels.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.000
And out of the 40 that I
did, if I remember correctly,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.930
18 of them had the highest sales
per foot in food and beverage

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.120
in the entire hotel industry.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.720
And then it all took off for me.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780
Then, my phone started
ringing off the hook.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.970
In 1991, I opened my first--
actually, that's not correct.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.660
In 1989, I opened the first
operation that I ever owned.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.430
Any Green Bay fans here?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.880
Green Bay Packer fans?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.730
First bar I ever owned was
called Lynn Dickey's Sports

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.750
Cafe, who was a quarterback
for Green Bay back then.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.040
And I wound up having
three of those.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.540
And what really
changed my life was

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.170
Mall of America in
Minneapolis, which

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.430
has more visitations than
the city of Las Vegas.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.980
I opened three restaurants
in Mall of America.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.240
The landlord gave me all the
money-- I opened them for free

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.770
and two years later,
was a multimillionaire.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.840
And that really changed my life.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.320
And I'm inspired not by
the bricks and mortar.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.890
I'm not inspired
by the food, even

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.160
though it's very important.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.720
I'm inspired by the
look on your face.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.420
That's always been
my inspiration.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.930
I don't believe
that we serve food.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.310
I believe we serve reactions.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.120
We achieve it through food.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480
I don't believe we play music.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.420
We play reactions.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.620
We achieve it through food.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.030
And I don't believe
you guys sell ads.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.330
The fact of the matter is if the
viewer doesn't react to the ad,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.300
the ad is meaningless.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.070
We don't sell ads.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.210
We sell reactions.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.150
We achieve it through
ads, whether they're

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.470
client reactions, whether
they're advertiser reactions

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.300
or prospect reactions.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.410
And that's what I
learned at a young age.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.940
And that philosophy
changed my life.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.580
And by understanding
the principle

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.610
of reaction management--
I own that term.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.570
I actually own the term
"reaction management"--

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.540
everything changed for me.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.590
And suddenly I
realized that wow,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.080
I can cause you to do things
you wouldn't normally do.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.837
I can manipulate the hell
out of you if I want to.

00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:30.670
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.169
JON TAFFER: Make
you buy what I want

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.000
you to, go where I want you
to, sit where I want you to.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.340
So I became a nut case
on human behavior.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.400
And things really puzzle me.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.205
For example, 70% of all
people that walk into a mall

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.275
make a right hand turn.

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:46.980
Why?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.820
Why?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.983
That -- excuse me--
that shit haunts me.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:51.950
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.940
JON TAFFER: It does!

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.740
And it makes me say, what can
I do to make you make a left?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.240
And I will lay awake at
night figuring out ways

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.830
to make you make that left turn.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.500
And that's very
rewarding to me when

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.389
I can change human behavior.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.680
MALE SPEAKER: Do you think
that's because 90% of people

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.809
are right-handed?

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:08.850
JON TAFFER: I'm not sure.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.340
I'm a lefty.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.548
So I couldn't relate to that.

00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.230
But no, I'm not sure that is.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.660
There's an inherent
movement towards the right.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.139
Maybe it's because we
bear right on roads.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.430
Maybe we even bear right when
we walk through airports.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.730
So maybe that's the principle.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.700
But it's interesting,
when you go to Asia,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.350
and they walk into a mall, they
make a right hand turn too.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.560
So I'm not sure that
argument holds water.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.400
But there are certain
things about human behavior

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.970
that are shocking to me.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.170
And there's gold, when
you can change behavior.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.696
Walt Disney was
the master of it.

00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:42.320
You go to Walt Disney
World in Orlando.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.506
It's 120 degrees.

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:44.630
You're sweating like crazy.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.569
You spent $90 to walk
through the door.

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.110
Within three minutes,
you're standing

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.810
on line for an hour and a half.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.310
Right?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.010
You get off the line, you
go through an attraction

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.676
for two minutes.

00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:55.460
You get on another line
for an hour and a half.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.190
After three lines in five
hours, you've done three things.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.560
Now you want a Coke.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.830
So you stand online for
45 minutes for that.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.719
Now you get a cup with
Mickey Mouse on it.

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.260
Now you got to carry this thing
around with you all day long.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.650
$14.95.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.020
And you realize when you go
home with the bags of stuff

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.280
you'll never use, the
T-shirt you'll never wear,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.980
you realize wow!

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.100
I sweated, I stood in
line, and I loved it.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.260
And there's a manipulative
quality to business.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.960
And you're no different.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.650
When we cause people
to act in ways

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.910
that enhance our objectives,
not theirs, we all make money.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.550
So the trick is how
do I get you to do

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.230
what isn't natural to you,
but have you love me for it

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.190
in the end?

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.510
That's the trick.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.590
Because I want you to
come back and do it again.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.090
Right?

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.060
There's no such thing as single
transactions in the world.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.132
Everything is
multiple transactions.

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:49.090
I'm all about getting to
that next transaction.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.340
That's what's important to me.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.820
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.020
So we heard a lot
about your consulting.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.200
How did the TV show come
about with Spike TV?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.110
Did you initiate it?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.220
Did they initiate it?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.140
JON TAFFER: I did.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.500
I'm very proud of this.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.004
I've been a public speaker in
my industry for about 30 years.

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.170
And I give keynote speeches.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.760
And I get a lot of
money for speeches.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.270
I've spoken in about 30
countries around the world.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.740
And I'll speak in major
industry conventions.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.730
I'm speaking at Friday's next
week for their corporate event.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.720
And I was giving a
speech in Las Vegas,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.540
and somebody came up to me
and said, you should be on TV.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.752
And I thought about it.

00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:25.460
So I went home, and
I wrote something up,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.930
which was originally
called "On the Rocks."

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.902
And I came out here and
went to Hermosa Beach

00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:31.110
to a friend that owned a bar.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.590
I got a camera, a microphone,
and I got his employees

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.260
to work with me.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.559
And I did a three
minutes sizzle reel.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.510
And really it was me
just screaming at people.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.549
I just walked into
his bar, screamed

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.730
and yelled at the employees.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.420
"Not negotiable!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.520
You're fired!" and
there's this whole thing.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.830
And I didn't know
anybody in Hollywood.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.630
I was a bar guy.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.910
And so I had this three
minutes sizzle reel.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.490
I sent it cold to five
companies and got three offers--

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.630
and it was unbelievable--
within a week.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.890
And I had offers from three
different production companies.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.210
So I had a look at each
company, do background checks,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.570
and the company I picked
was the best one, but not

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.040
necessarily the
best financial deal.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.430
So I thought more long
term than short term.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.000
I signed with 3 Ball Productions
in Manhattan Beach, who

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.390
also does "Biggest Loser" and
one of the largest reality

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.770
show producers.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.600
They picked me up,
signed me to a contract,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.100
and Spike picked up the
show four days later.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.720
So in the time I got the
idea, to the premiere

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.760
of the show on
TV-- not the pilot,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.590
the first season--
was less than a year.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.470
And I'm told that's
almost a record.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.240
And normally, it takes
two to three years

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.550
to get to that level.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.164
So I was blessed, I think.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.080
Some of that's timing.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.290
I get that I'm pretty
good at what I do.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.200
But some of it is timing.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.740
I just happened to be in the
right place at the right time,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.580
I think.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.080
So the show premiered
almost three years ago.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.665
We just aired our 49th
episode to the highest ratings

00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:54.790
in the history of the show.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.260
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.176
JON TAFFER: Thank you.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.040
Honestly, it's been an
incredibly humbling experience

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.420
for me.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.336
And I'm shocked when celebrities
get these egos that suddenly

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:09.460
you're unimportant to them.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.840
They're above you.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.040
It has made me appreciate
humanity, the people around me

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.540
that support me, believe in me.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.365
This has actually made
me a better person.

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:21.240
And I wouldn't have
thought about it that way

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.540
before the fact.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.537
But it has humbled me.

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.370
I feel like I'm hugged
by America every day.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.085
It's an incredible feeling.

00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:30.210
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.850
And so 49 episodes-- how do you
decide which bars to rescue?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.430
I'm sure you've got
a ton of requests

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.722
from bars all over the country.

00:10:36.722 --> 00:10:38.263
And you've done all
over the country.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.470
And some are really awful.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.280
And some are just
horrific, like,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.590
how do you decide which to--

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.943
JON TAFFER: That's my choice.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.300
Awful or horrific.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.779
It's pretty accurate too.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.070
Actually, when I did the
show, my deal with the network

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.470
was I wanted you to find
me the worst in the world.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.970
I don't want this
to be a cake walk.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.070
I want to fail.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.530
I want to fail.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:01.350
So now that we're
known, about 1,000 bars

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.220
submit applications
a year for me

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.250
to scream at them,
which is amazing to me.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.070
And these are people
that are in trouble.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.790
So we go through a
screening process.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.410
First of all, we picked the
cities that make sense to us.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.930
We like small towns, big
towns, Midwest, East Coast.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.780
We like to move it
around and mix it up,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.560
so we have the
different subcultures

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.440
of America, if you
will, in a show.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.420
The next thing we do is
we see if they're real.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.770
Are they hustling
me for a remodel?

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.895
Or are they really in debt?

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.480
Are there really
houses on the line?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.900
Is this a real story?

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.520
So we verify those elements.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.360
We verify the debt,
all that kind of stuff.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.080
Make sure that there
are stakes, if you will.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.900
Then, once we've narrowed
it down to about 40 or 50,

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.810
then I'll send a
producer to each

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.990
of those locations with
just a little camera.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.660
And they'll talk to each staff
member for about 20 seconds.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.160
That's all.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.720
What's your name?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.120
What do you here?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.520
What do you think of this place?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.950
What's your name?

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.575
What do you do?

00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:55.060
So we can see the
behavior of the employees.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.230
And I'm looking for
a compelling story,

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.180
I want you rooting for the
owner or hating the owner.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.900
But I want you connected to it.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.170
And the secret of "Bar Rescue"
is finding those personalities

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.720
that are exciting to be with.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.130
And if you think it's
frustrating to watch,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.290
you should live it, Because
it's quite an experience.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:13.790
Very

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.290
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.956
And what would you
say is the number one

00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:18.160
reason most bars fail.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.260
JON TAFFER: Excuses.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.980
But that's the reason why
all of you would fail too.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.080
And here it is.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.760
You wake up in the morning.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.936
You're failing.

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:27.060
So you blame the President.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.880
You blame Congress.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.080
You blame Greece.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.410
Blame the Euro.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.230
I mean, construction
industry-- it's the Mayor!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.210
Oh, it's the this.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.700
And you wake up in the morning,
and you look in the mirror.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.158
And you're not failing, because
it's the other guy's fault.

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.930
Or it's the economy's fault.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.700
But if you looked in
the mirror and said

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.740
I'm failing because I'm
me, you wouldn't like it.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.380
And you'd change that.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.300
And I believe the
common denominator

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.420
of failure in any
business is excuses.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.010
As long as you wake up
and blame poor sales

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.380
on the economy or
an environment, then

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.920
you have no motivation
to make it better,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.600
because it's not your fault.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.230
But in the worst
economic environment,

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.810
four, five years in this
country, ago, in this country

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.470
that we've seen,
in our lifetimes,

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.847
there were people making a
lot of money, weren't there?

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:12.430
In the height of
that recession, there

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.750
were people selling advertising,
people opening restaurants,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.020
people building businesses.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.510
Somebody's making money.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.360
So the excuse is bull.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.550
It's bull.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.200
So wake up in the morning
and own your failure.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.480
Look in the mirror and say
I'm failing because of me!

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.210
And you won't like it.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.700
And then you'll change it.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.910
But as long as you
don't put it on you,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.000
you have no motivation
to change it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.750
So in short, if you
own your failure,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.340
you'll own your success.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.200
If you don't own your
failure, you'll never dig out.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.190
And I find that in any business.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.450
Always the common
denominator of failure,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.605
personally, is excuses.

00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:48.230
You don't want to be
a failure, do you?

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.070
AUDIENCE: Not at all.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.490
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:50.550
JON TAFFER: You don't
want to look in the mirror

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.070
and experience that.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.150
If you can't blame
anybody but yourself,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.392
you're going to change.

00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:56.600
You're going to fight it out.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.550
That's the deal.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.840
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.012
So a lot of guys in this
room want to open bars,

00:14:01.012 --> 00:14:02.970
like this one sitting up
here in the front row.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.862
What do you say to
these people that

00:14:04.862 --> 00:14:06.320
want to open their
own bar one day.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.110
JON TAFFER: Well, first
of all, know your reason.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.250
Anybody see the Murphy's
episode of "Bar Rescue"?

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.050
The two frat brothers
opened a bar?

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.460
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.810
JON TAFFER: The last
thing you want to do

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.340
is open a bar because
you like to drink.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.173
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:18.120
JON TAFFER: That's like
somebody into drugs

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.247
who becomes a pharmacist.

00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:20.080
I mean that's just--

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.580
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.240
JON TAFFER: It makes
no sense at all.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.820
You got do it for
the right reasons.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.000
You've got to do it because
you love the business.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.727
If you love the
social aspect of it,

00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:30.060
you'll never do your financials.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.240
You'll just hang with
people all day long.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.450
If you love the drinking,
that's even worse.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.730
You got to love the business.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.100
It's a tough business.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.719
And we were talking before we
started, in the clothing store

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:40.760
business, you buy shirts.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.950
You mark them up 60%, 70%.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.432
If you got 10
shirts on the shelf,

00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:46.640
you go home that night, you
come back in the morning,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.010
you still got 10
shirts on a shelf.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:48.884
Not the bar business.

00:14:48.884 --> 00:14:52.360
Bar business, you've got
to manage every minute.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.490
Product is exposed.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.575
Liabilities are exposed.

00:14:54.575 --> 00:14:56.690
It's a tough business.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.422
Honestly, if I had
to do it over again,

00:14:58.422 --> 00:15:00.130
I'm not sure I would
be in this business.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.640
To be honest with you,
when I look at all the work

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.690
that I did over
the years, I could

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.130
have applied those efforts
to bigger things rather than

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.570
smaller bars.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.830
And I was involved in
Rainforest Cafe, for example.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.700
That went public, and
it was big dollars.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.491
Don't get me wrong.

00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:16.560
I don't regret being
in the bar business.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.350
But when I look at my life,
all the nights that I worked,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.920
all those evenings,
days, 20-hour days,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.580
I look back and say gee, wonder
if I would have been a lawyer.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.637
Nah, maybe not a lawyer.

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:27.470
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.530
AUDIENCE: No!

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.390
JON TAFFER: There are lifestyles
that are easier is my point.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.020
So you've got to
love the business

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.590
and be passionate
about it to make it

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.877
through those late nights
and those mornings.

00:15:36.877 --> 00:15:37.710
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.480
And what's been the
hardest "Bar Rescue"

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.630
you've ever done and why?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.660
JON TAFFER: I'm going to guess
the hardest "Bar Rescue" I've

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.860
ever done was the one
that aired-- actually,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.590
the last one with
the two twins, which

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.402
aired just about
three weeks ago,

00:15:54.402 --> 00:15:56.110
where I had a family--
I mean, these guys

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.060
hadn't had Christmas dinner
together in nine years.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.018
They lived across from
each other, these twins,

00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:01.900
and they hated each other.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.675
And what I learned
about "Bar Rescue"

00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:06.030
is it's so about the people.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.340
And at the end of the day,
I got those twins together.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.874
It was a pretty intense episode.

00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:11.290
And I don't know
if any of you saw

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.110
that episode-- the
son Tyler, the nephew,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.930
sent me a note that they had
their best Christmas dinner

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.120
in all these years
for the family.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.465
So when you have
personalities that don't work,

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:24.340
that's the challenge.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.250
I can paint the bar.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.570
I know how to set it up.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.840
I know how to put
the technology in it.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.923
I know how to decorate it.

00:16:28.923 --> 00:16:30.590
I know how to program.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.619
The people--
remember these people

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:34.160
aren't failing
because of their bars.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.410
They're failing because of them.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.569
And that's my challenge.

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:39.110
And that was a
particularly good one.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.193
And I'm going to answer
the next question for you.

00:16:41.193 --> 00:16:43.500
The best one we've
ever done is probably

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.020
"Spirits on Bourbon," which was
the first episode this season.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.180
They're up $125,000 a month.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.135
AUDIENCE: Holy shit!

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.510
JON TAFFER: The
barber shop chair

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.440
is the most photographed
attraction on Bourbon Street.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.140
Last month, it did over
$80,000-- just that chair.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.704
And the guys, they
sent me a note.

00:17:01.704 --> 00:17:02.870
They've become good friends.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.200
They just bought a
warehouse, so they

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.720
can buy cups for their
Resurrection cocktails, 20,000

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.280
at a time to keep
their prices down.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.135
And it's to me-- I'm not
always right in life.

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:15.760
None of us are.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.457
But I'm pretty close.

00:17:17.457 --> 00:17:18.290
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.206
JON TAFFER: When it comes
to the bar business.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.770
People, when they stay with the
plan, tend to do really well.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.850
"Moon Runners"--

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:25.599
MALE SPEAKER: Yup.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.599
JON TAFFER: Which is from
your neck of the wood.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.930
I mean, their
numbers are up 600%.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.300
And there's an independent
website-- forgive me,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.080
I forget the name.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.210
Bar Rescue something--
that somebody does,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.300
and they track them all.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.700
And I believe on their site--
and I haven't been there

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.240
in a few weeks-- on their
site, we had aired 47 of 48.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.001
They claim that seven closed.

00:17:46.001 --> 00:17:46.750
And I don't count.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.470
So I'm going to take
them at face value.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.249
But what they did is they
did Before and After Yelp.

00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:53.290
And then they tell you if
it's opened and closed.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.350
So 48 or 49 episodes are there.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.040
If seven have
closed, that puts us

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.726
in about an 80% track record.

00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:02.350
And when you consider the depth
of failure these people are in,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.510
I'm pretty proud of that.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.009
I'm not sure we could do much
better, to tell you the truth.

00:18:06.009 --> 00:18:08.147
But the pirates episode
has to be mentioned.

00:18:08.147 --> 00:18:08.980
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.460
JON TAFFER: Only because it
was the most bizarre experience

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.420
of my life.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.840
These people were pirates.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.760
They couldn't speak un-pirate.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.760
They couldn't talk like we do.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.097
They spoke like 1845 pirates.

00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:23.930
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.710
JON TAFFER: They didn't
have regular clothes.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.090
These people woke up every
morning to be pirates.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.490
And when I said to them how
how do you make a living?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.860
Oh, Renaissance Faire.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.180
That's two weeks a year.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.910
Oh, no, there's a
big pirate community.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:38.740
I go on Facebook.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.080
200 people.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.480
And these people
wanted to be pirates.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.820
And if you remember, when I
put them in regular clothes,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.370
they couldn't speak non-pirate.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.190
So I guess let them play in
their sandbox, so to speak.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.340
But that was a very
frustrating one for me,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.287
because a Discovery TV
was right next door.

00:18:57.287 --> 00:18:59.370
There were huge office
buildings in Silver Spring.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.800
The concept that we created
was for lunch and happy hour,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.140
for them to close
early, because at night,

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.280
that was a dangerous,
not a very good area.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.790
They never even
opened for lunch.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.100
They tore the sign down
six hours after I left.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.150
It's on YouTube.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.550
A vigil around a fire, where
they were chanting, of course,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.280
pirate songs.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.186
And it was one of the most
bizarre experiences of my life.

00:19:23.186 --> 00:19:24.100
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.820
JON TAFFER: I will
never forget it.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.640
And they're still
open, by the way,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.902
which is unbelievable to me.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:32.360
MALE SPEAKER: So you actually
kind of just referenced this.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.380
I know a couple
people in the crowd

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.713
had asked me this ahead of time.

00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:36.220
But a lot of people
watch your show,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.320
and then they get on Yelp
immediately following,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.960
and see whether it's
been successful or not.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.780
And several times, we've seen
them change the name back.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.670
They reverted back
to their bad ways.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.430
Other people have
kept what you've

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.680
done or remained successful.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.300
Can you kind of
talk about why is it

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.790
that some have
reverted and failed,

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.800
while others keep what
you've given them, et cetera.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.202
JON TAFFER: Yeah, good question.

00:19:55.202 --> 00:19:57.035
These people make
thousands of bad decisions

00:19:57.035 --> 00:19:58.466
that got me there.

00:19:58.466 --> 00:19:59.360
Right?

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.490
Think of all the
choices that they

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.580
made from hiring to
products to management

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.550
to cause them to be in
the depth of failure

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.900
that they're in when I show up.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.589
And my challenge is
to reverse that level

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.005
of failure, that
depth of failure.

00:20:16.005 --> 00:20:17.055
I forgot your question.

00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:18.430
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
it was just why

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.440
do some revert back to their
old name and [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.565
JON TAFFER: So what happens
is-- and I'll pick one.

00:20:22.565 --> 00:20:24.450
The Brixton in Austin, Texas.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.200
Remember that one?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.350
With the cocky husband--
they changed the name back

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.330
a week later.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.740
But they kept everything else.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.160
They kept the
infusion cocktails.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.840
But they were hung
up on The Brixton.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.230
They're doing pretty well.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.030
But guys, you know this.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.990
If the Google name had
a terrible association

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.640
with it and a reputation
for not delivering

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.890
on the promises made, how much
advertising would you sell?

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.430
So if I didn't
change the company,

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.530
but put a new sign
on the building,

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.850
at least I have a
chance at a new future.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.540
So, Swanky Bubbles--
remember that one?

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.790
Who puts Swanky Bubbles
back on a building.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.090
You think you would thank
you for taking it down.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.210
But they changed the
name back the next day.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.760
And his logic was
it's confusing.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.250
My old customers won't
come to the new bar.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.310
You were losing money
with the old customers.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.624
And here's what they
don't understand.

00:21:14.624 --> 00:21:16.290
When they changed the
name back, they're

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.700
thinking of the
customers they have.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.480
I'm trying to get them to
customers they don't have

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.780
and the thousands of people that
they alienated and chased away.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.660
So with a new brand
comes a honeymoon.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.080
With a new brand comes
a whole new future.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.689
I have probably kept as
many brands as I've changed.

00:21:34.689 --> 00:21:36.730
So I don't just go in
there and change the brand.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.021
We do a lot of market research.

00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:39.410
I use Esri.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.000
And I do all my online research.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.551
By the way, "Bar Rescue"
is absolutely in real time.

00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:45.050
I should speak to
this for a moment.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.150
You know, the first day
I show up at about 4:35

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.270
in the afternoon.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.291
I go in and do my
recon that night.

00:21:51.291 --> 00:21:53.540
When I leave the bar that
night, that day ends for me.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.456
I go back to my hotel.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:55.520
The next day is Day 2.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.190
We train, we have stress test.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.270
The next day is Day 3 training.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.370
At the end of Day 3,
at about 9 o'clock,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.350
I get the staff out
of there at night.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.060
And then we go to
work building the bar.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.710
We do it for a true 36 hours.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.710
So the evening of Day
3, the day of Day 4,

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.510
and the morning of Day
5, we remodel the bar.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.150
And then I reveal
it to them on Day 5.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.245
It is absolutely in real
time, and not one word of it

00:22:21.245 --> 00:22:22.220
is scripted ever.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.560
Candidly, if it
was, I'd walk off.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.350
And I just won't do that.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.580
So it is incredibly real.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.990
And that's why the
casting, the selection

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.450
of the bars and the
characters are so important,

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.100
because I'm not
going to script it.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.780
And in "Bar

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.010
Rescue," we use the phrase
"we work with what we have.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.680
We don't create
what we don't have."

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.450
And it's working the moment.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.310
And we've gotten pretty good at
it, I think, after 59 of them

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.120
or so.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.870
MALE SPEAKER: Man.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.054
So why did you decide
to write a book.

00:22:52.054 --> 00:22:54.220
JON TAFFER: I've been a
public speaker for 30 years.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.650
I love helping people.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.870
I can't tell you-- you know, I
tell people this story often.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.320
One of the greatest moments
in my life was an operator.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.450
When I opened Mall of
America, it had a dishwasher.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.280
His name was Theo.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.930
And this guy was a
dishwasher, almost

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.580
a gang banger kind of
kid in Minneapolis.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.270
And my prep cook quit, and
I made him a prep cook.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.242
I liked this kid
for some reason.

00:23:15.242 --> 00:23:17.450
Then I'm opening another
restaurant six months later.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.930
And I pick a training
team from that restaurant

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.580
and I fly them to another city.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.540
And I took Theo as
my prep cook trainee.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.500
And now we're in a hotel
meeting room, sort of like this.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.400
And all my training
team goes up in front

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.630
of the staff to
introduce themselves.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.480
And Theo walks out there
in a shark skin suit,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.030
missing his teeth and
gold in the front,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.950
and says six months
ago, I was a dishwasher.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.850
And look at me today.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.160
And I cried.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.410
And I realized that was the
most important thing to me

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.062
I could ever do.

00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:49.520
And I've been
fortunate in my life.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.800
I've made money.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.490
Now I want to make people.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.280
And I'm really inspired by that.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.750
And we talked
about this earlier,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.420
when people come up to me and
say they've gotten promoted,

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.010
I've inspired them, they've
raised the bar, whatever

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.500
it is it's an incredibly
motivating thing to me.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.880
So the book was an
effort to do that,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.080
to try to take what I do and
share it with more people,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.511
because I really believe in it.

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:11.510
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.090
And so your philosophy
of reaction management

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.251
which you coined is kind of the
main theme throughout the book.

00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:19.500
Can you give everyone a quick
summary of what that is?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.110
JON TAFFER: Sure.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.942
First, let me explain
how it came about,

00:24:22.942 --> 00:24:24.900
because I don't cover it
very much in the book.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.108
When I was young, my mother
was incredibly difficult,

00:24:27.108 --> 00:24:28.490
a little violent.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.750
So when I was seven,
eight, nine, ten years old,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.545
I understood that if I
couldn't control her mood,

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:36.990
I was going to
get my ass kicked.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.600
So at a very young age,
I learned the sensitivity

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.670
to watch her face,
read her moods.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:49.510
And I developed this skill
to sense and feel people.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.120
Like your crossed arm, right?

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.900
I would stare at you
and shake my head

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.024
until those arms uncrossed.

00:24:55.024 --> 00:24:57.020
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.620
JON TAFFER: Same with you.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.309
I mean, I look at
everybody's body language.

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:02.350
And I do it subliminally.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.070
I don't think about
it consciously.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.640
Your eye contact, your body
language, your energy level,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.580
your posture.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.650
And I read these things.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.700
And I figured out how
to manipulate you.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.440
And here's a philosophy.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.610
If you go into a
restaurant and you sit down

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:16.810
and you order food.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.540
And the food comes to the table,
and it's put down on a table.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.998
When the plate hits the table--
and this could be anything.

00:25:21.998 --> 00:25:25.360
It could be a Google ad--
one of two things happens.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.590
Either the guest sits up, reacts
to it, or nothing happens.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.250
If nothing happens, we're
stuck in mediocrity the rest

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.630
of our lives.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.420
Whether that's a Google Ad,
whether it's a plate of food,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.510
whether it's a song, whether
it's the color of a wall,

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:46.580
nothing we do is anything other
than creating human reactions.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.260
When reactions go in the
direction we want them to,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.254
people write us
checks, don't they?

00:25:52.254 --> 00:25:53.920
They move to other
sides of the country.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.040
They take jobs.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.580
Everything changes,
when we can cause

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.250
people to react in the
ways that we need to.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.448
So at a young age, I
developed this skill.

00:26:03.448 --> 00:26:05.156
And that's why I think
"Bar Rescue" works

00:26:05.156 --> 00:26:07.322
for me because I'm only
with these people five days.

00:26:07.322 --> 00:26:08.530
I got to read them quick.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.920
And we were talking earlier--
I mean, I'm people's faces,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.760
for sure-- but
there's a reason why.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.780
This might surprise you.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.690
I am never angry
on "Bar Rescue."

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.660
It is completely calculated.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.310
It is completely deliberate.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.690
And we were talking, if
I wanted to pick on him,

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.600
OK, this is a guy
with some pride.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.850
First, I'm going to try pride.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.230
Do you want to be a success?

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.770
Do you want to be a failure?

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.353
What are your parents going to
say when they see you faiiling?

00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:31.530
I'll try, that didn't work.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.512
Now, I'll try fear.

00:26:32.512 --> 00:26:33.845
You're going to lose everything!

00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:35.386
You're going to be
out in the street.

00:26:35.386 --> 00:26:37.000
What are you gon--
that didn't work.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.540
Picture your kids.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.900
Can you come true for your kids?

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.710
That didn't work.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.779
Well, now I have
only one option.

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:44.070
I'm going to rip you to shreds.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.390
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.270
JON TAFFER: Because
I have no choice.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.490
I have no choice.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.980
And here is "Bar Rescue" in
its most essence, if you will,

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.590
right at the core.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.740
You're going to
dig your heels in.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.790
And you're not
going to let me in.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.060
You're going to get defensive.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.780
So I'm going to be in your face.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.310
I am going to be
relentless, until I

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.740
can make you doubt
yourself for one second.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.570
And if I can make
you doubt yourself

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.930
just a little for one
second, your brain opens

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.010
and I walk right the hell in.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.060
And that's the way it is.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.490
I got to break you down and
make you doubt yourself.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.080
Because you're the
one who's wrong.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.056
You're the one losing money.

00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:25.680
I've got the bank
accounts to prove it.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.620
So I stand there with
this cocky, confidence.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.550
And I will beat and
beat and beat on you

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.690
until that crap comes open.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.270
And then I walk in, and we
were talking before I started,

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.630
the biggest fights
I have are always

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.730
the biggest hugs at
the end, aren't they?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.830
So when you turn them,
you really turn them.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.410
It's an incredible
thing to watch.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.580
And they walk different
four days later.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.229
Once I crack through,
their posture's different.

00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:52.770
Their facial expression
is different.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.436
When you look in your
eye, you can truly

00:27:54.436 --> 00:27:56.830
see this human transformation.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.150
It's remarkable.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.340
And you see it on TV, but
it's even more evident

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.322
when you're there.

00:28:01.322 --> 00:28:02.246
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:02.246 --> 00:28:03.170
Very cool.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.630
So a lot of people in this
room work in advertising.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.290
You talk about
advertising in the book.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.710
Can you talk about what
sort of advertising bars

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.490
can do from digital to-- you
talk a lot about word of mouth

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.540
too, whether that can
be something generated.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.270
JON TAFFER: Sure.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.811
Let me start by saying I come
from an advertising background.

00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:21.410
My grandfather
invented Direct Mail.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.310
And gets credit for inventing
Direct Mail in Brooklyn, New

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.810
York.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.720
When he was 16 years old,
he bought a printing press,

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.455
and started putting
fliers in newspaper

00:28:29.455 --> 00:28:31.774
at the newspaper
stand on the corner.

00:28:31.774 --> 00:28:33.190
And then he walked
down the street

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.340
and wrote down the
names in the mailboxes

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.160
and started leaving
flyers in the apartment

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.720
buildings in Brooklyn.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.070
And then, he started
getting and mailing them

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.150
from this little
storefront that he had.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.240
And one of the largest
ad companies in the world

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.900
knew we were advertising,
bought my grandfather's

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.780
little storefront
operation, brought him in.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.780
The term Direct
Marketing was invented.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.450
And my grandfather then
created the entire direct

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.980
marketing/direct mail.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.560
And my family has done
the direct marketing

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.960
for Volvo, Mercedes Benz,
and a bunch of companies

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.740
now for three generations.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.470
So I come from a
marketing background.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.710
It's in my blood.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.601
And to me, marketing is
just human reactions.

00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:13.100
Period.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.780
End the discussion.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.390
We don't do ads.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.330
We do human reactions.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.310
We achieve them through ads.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.560
I don't even make phone calls.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.601
I create human reactions.

00:29:19.601 --> 00:29:20.900
I do it on the phone.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.530
The fact of the
matter is everything

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.030
I do-- no different
than this moment

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.570
right now-- if I don't
create reactions, I fail.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.000
Period, and so do you.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.410
So it's a way of life.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.440
You study every facial
expression, every inflection

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.210
in voices, everything
to manipulate you

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.252
for me to get your check.

00:29:39.252 --> 00:29:41.710
I have no guilt doing that,
because I know when you give me

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.960
a check, I'm going to come
through for you in the end.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.880
That's the trick.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.532
When you know you're doing
right you can fight harder.

00:29:47.532 --> 00:29:48.990
You got to know
you're doing right.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.285
You guys do right here.

00:29:50.285 --> 00:29:51.560
You're a great company.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.510
I advertise on Google myself.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.270
But I've learned that if an
ad doesn't create a reaction,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.380
it's worthless.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.760
And where we blow
it, in that business,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.600
is when we take advertising
dollars from a client

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.210
and place an ad that we know
is not going to get a reaction,

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.470
that we know is going to fail.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.380
We don't serve them.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.338
We don't get a renewal.

00:30:10.338 --> 00:30:13.040
We don't serve our
ourselves and our company.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.970
So the end result is you
guys have to create reactions

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.790
from the advertising
that you do.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.310
Or you're never going
to grow that business.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.082
So you're as much in the
reaction business as I am.

00:30:24.082 --> 00:30:25.930
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.460
Very cool.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.422
And so a lot of us,
we love the parts

00:30:29.422 --> 00:30:31.630
of the show when you really
dig deep into the science

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.879
behind the bar, the science
of everything that you do.

00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:36.490
And it's all to increase
workplace efficiency

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.690
and whatnot.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.940
Google prides itself on
trying to do the same things.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.230
So what are some
of the sciences you

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.105
learned to optimize for
workplace efficiency.

00:30:44.105 --> 00:30:46.271
JON TAFFER: You know, there's
a lot of things to it.

00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:47.780
And I want to
reiterate the question

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.540
that you asked me before.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.040
You asked me about
social marketing,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.090
and I didn't mention it.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.400
You know, social marketing
is a big word today.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.590
And everybody does it.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.580
But who does it well?

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.930
Not too many.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.350
It's a new science.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.200
We're still figuring
it out ourselves.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.210
I mean, just because I have
100,000 Twitter followers,

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.919
how do I monetize that?

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.210
How do I motivate these people?

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.215
What is it?

00:31:08.215 --> 00:31:08.840
Is it an event?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.730
Is it a discount?

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.360
I mean, what is it
that causes people

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.860
to-- and I'm going
to use my word--

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.220
react to my social marketing?

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.490
No reaction, no dollars.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.960
No reaction, no win.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.110
So where people
blow it is they go

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.290
through the mechanics
of social marketing.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.500
They go through the
mechanics of advertising,

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.494
but they never really focus
on "where are the reactions?"

00:31:30.494 --> 00:31:31.660
And here's the way I say it.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.140
And I'm trying to be short.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.960
You know, in the real world,
when a big company goes

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.510
to an ad agency,
and the ad agency

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.860
provides all the creative.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.180
If you like the creative,
you buy the advertising.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.250
If you don't like the creative,
you don't buy the advertising.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.340
Bar business?

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.200
Opposite.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.050
We buy the advertising
with no creative,

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.050
and then at the last
minute we get a phone call.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.090
I need your copy.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.140
Oh, oh!

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.210
And so the fact of
the matter is we

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.020
go at it in a mechanical way.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.590
And that's what you can't do.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.690
You've got to make certain that
those reactions are created.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.250
The words, the phrasing,
the fonts, the color,

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.790
the positioning--
these are subliminals

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.490
that will either somebody
to click through or not.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.400
And you are a point
of difference.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.920
You guys stand alone.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.880
You're the shining
star in the business.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.860
Nobody lights a candle to you.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.740
Bing?

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.510
Come on.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.230
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.280
JON TAFFER: The fact
that the matter is now

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.947
because you are perceived as
so good at what you do, so big,

00:32:30.947 --> 00:32:32.030
the bar is high, isn't it?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.600
Now I expect more
from you, which

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.250
means as we get bigger and
better and our reputation

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.270
grows, we've got to
deliver stronger.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.890
So the problem with
social marketing

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.690
is an absence of
creative generally.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.220
It's become more
mechanical, more logistical,

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.440
very uncreative.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.487
And some of it is because
it's in real time.

00:32:49.487 --> 00:32:51.570
In a newspaper ad, you
plan a month ahead of time,

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.460
two months ahead of time.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.710
You work on your copy work.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.459
Social marketing, I
come up with it today.

00:32:55.459 --> 00:32:56.760
I put it online in 10 minutes.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.770
There is no planning.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.440
And the real time nature of
it sometimes works against us.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.070
And then here's the
ultimate kicker.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.580
When I hit you with
social marketing

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.450
three or four times
in a row and blow it,

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.850
you're going to delete me
every time for then on.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.820
I'll never get you back.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.320
So we only have one shot.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.700
I believe in social marketing.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.140
Either we engage the audience.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.640
Either we connect
with the audience.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.450
Or we alienate the
audience and we will never

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.710
connect with them after that.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.609
And that's what my
experiences are.

00:33:24.609 --> 00:33:25.400
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.310
And some of the
big shock moments

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.790
of the show and
when fire people.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.280
And sometimes you get in their
face and you throw them out.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.780
Other times, you're sympathetic.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.680
You're like, sorry,
I have to let you go.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.550
So how do you choose
like you're going to fire

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.316
and how you do it?

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.815
And you're welcome
to practice on me

00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:42.420
if you want to fire me
[INAUDIBLE] interview.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.400
JON TAFFER: Well,
you know, when you

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.240
were talking earlier about
general marketing sciences.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.820
The bar business is very visual.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.260
I need to move your eye
where I needed to go.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.650
First, I sell with the eye, then
I get my hand into your pocket.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.000
So I say, with the
exterior building.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.762
If I don't pull your eye, I'm
not going to pull your body.

00:34:01.762 --> 00:34:02.970
The front door of a business.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.410
If I don't pull your eye, I'm
not going to pull your body.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.560
In a Google ad, if I
don't pull your eye,

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.409
the copy doesn't mean anything.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.949
So the fact of
the matter is I've

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.480
got to connect and pull you in.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.929
And there's all
sorts of sciences.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.120
When you walk in the
front door of a business,

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.889
your eyes are going to go to the
most colorful or brightest spot

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:20.630
in a room.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.449
Every time.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:22.770
End of discussion.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.110
So some designer puts a
beautiful piece of artwork

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.610
on the wall.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:26.790
I'm not making money off that.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.290
No!

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.790
Put the artwork over there.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.886
I'm putting what I make money
on, where the eye falls.

00:34:32.886 --> 00:34:34.260
So one of the
things that do is I

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.469
work very hard on
changing eye movement when

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:37.800
you walk through the door.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.310
I also know that bars
are about meeting people.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.790
Eye contact.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.560
So at zero level, in a
bar when it's unelevated,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.070
everybody's at high seating.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.380
So everybody's eyes are within
10 inches of each other,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.300
whether you're standing
or sitting in a bar stool.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.138
When people connect, the
magic of a bar happens.

00:34:55.138 --> 00:34:56.929
But you've got to look
at each other's eyes

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.600
or it never starts.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.620
So in elevated areas
in bars, there's

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.950
a lot of science to this.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.610
If I have one staircase on
an elevation in a bar, what

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.360
happens is you see a
pretty girl up there.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.760
So you go up the steps, you
walk, you hit a dead end.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.040
You feel like an idiot.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.620
You got to turn around
and go back the other way.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.286
And she knows exactly
what you're doing.

00:35:15.286 --> 00:35:16.910
So you never go up there again.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.230
But with two staircases, I
walk through with a purpose

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.770
and go out the other side.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:26.214
So it's totally manipulative
in every conceivable way.

00:35:26.214 --> 00:35:27.880
I want to manipulate
where your eyes go,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.500
which way you go, where
you sit, where you stand.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.690
And here's the trick
to the bar business.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.377
You can make drinks
at home, can't you?

00:35:34.377 --> 00:35:35.710
You don't need me for cocktails.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.080
You can make exactly
what you want.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.660
In today's world,
the technology--

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.050
we can get exactly the
programming that I want,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.080
musically, video,
satellite, online.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.300
I have every entertainment
option and everything

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.460
I could ever want at home.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.710
I don't need you for drinks.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.440
I don't need you
for entertainment.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.170
There's one thing that you
can't get at home that I have.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.830
And that's social interaction.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.740
That's my calling card.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.090
And if I create socially
interactive environments,

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.300
people come back.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.765
And that's where these sciences
play in of height and eye

00:36:05.765 --> 00:36:07.140
movement and all
of these things.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.027
It's all about
creating interaction.

00:36:09.027 --> 00:36:09.860
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.220
So we'll do one last question.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.303
And then we'll open up to
the floor for questions.

00:36:13.303 --> 00:36:16.229
So you just finished
Season 3 of "Bar Rescue."

00:36:16.229 --> 00:36:17.270
You just wrote your book.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.130
What is next for Jon Taffer?

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.370
I have a new show I'm
starting in February

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.330
called "The Hungry Investor."

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.540
And I describe it as a
cross between "Bar Rescue,"

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.910
"Hell's Kitchen,"
and "Shark Tank."

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.380
Myself and two
partners are traveling

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.950
around the country looking
for businesses to invest in.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.890
So let's say, we decide
we want to invest

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.700
in steak houses or
any business-- sushi,

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.800
whatever it might be.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.590
So we might come to LA,
pick two steak houses

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.280
that we might want to invest in.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.235
And I created this formula
called an Invest Test. where

00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:54.470
we determine the elasticity
and potential of the business

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.760
and individuals in it.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.020
So we run them through this
rigorous and best test process

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.462
to determine there in
your business's potential.

00:37:02.462 --> 00:37:03.920
And then at the
end of the show, we

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.730
determine which one we're
going to invest in it,

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.710
and we give him the money.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:07.690
And we make the investment.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.270
And then we let you
know how it did.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.230
So it's much more business
return on investment, equity,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.270
a little deeper for me.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.978
It's sort of fun.

00:37:15.978 --> 00:37:18.440
It allows me to show my
business knowledge, not just

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.525
my bar knowledge.

00:37:19.525 --> 00:37:20.400
I'm excited about it.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.540
Then "Bar Rescue,"
I told you we just

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.130
got picked up just yesterday.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.910
20 more episodes
for us is Season 5.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.500
So I'm very excited about that.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.750
MALE SPEAKER: Congratulations.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.314
JON TAFFER: I just finished
my 59th episode yesterday.

00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:34.160
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.530
All right, let's
open it to questions.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.613
And there's actually a
microphone right over there

00:37:37.613 --> 00:37:39.110
that we can--

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.367
AUDIENCE: So if you had
a room full of people,

00:37:41.367 --> 00:37:43.450
what would you tell them
in a brief period of time

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.450
to keep them from ever
showing up on your show?

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.910
JON TAFFER: No excuses.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.110
If I had to leave
you with one message,

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.500
it's understanding that
all I'm going to do

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.330
is identify where
you're failing.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.956
You can do that too if you want.

00:37:57.956 --> 00:37:59.330
But you got to
look at the mirror

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.890
and say I'm failing because of
me-- what am I doing wrong--

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.890
And pick it apart.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.473
The other thing about
the bar business

00:38:04.473 --> 00:38:09.167
is I've seen a lot of bars not
fail, but run out of money.

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:10.500
They would've turned the corner.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.291
The first restaurant
I ever owned by myself

00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:13.860
was called Alamo Grill.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.820
Actually, second one.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.330
And Lynn Dickey was the first.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.810
And I opened it, and
about 90 days into it,

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.250
I ran out of money.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.566
I was losing money
in Mall of America.

00:38:23.566 --> 00:38:25.190
And it's because it
was a new business,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.190
and we were so busy that I
couldn't make it profitable.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.620
So I was in trouble.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.060
So I went and sold
50% of this business

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.840
that I put a million
dollars in for $150,000

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.600
to get the money I needed.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.420
That year, that business
profited $800,000,

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.845
and somebody else owned
half of it for $150,000.

00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:47.220
It's almost like
a football game.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.220
Vince Lombardi once said,
I never lose the game.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.660
I just run out of time.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.310
That's very much
the bar business.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.860
If you just had the money
for another month or two,

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.030
you could've figured
it out and made it.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.942
And the problem with the bar
business is it's all rookies.

00:38:59.942 --> 00:39:02.400
There's no place where you'd
go and learn the bar business.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.566
There's hospitality schools.

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:05.710
There's no bar school.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:09.880
So the bar sciences that
I teach-- Google it!

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.844
There's nobody else who
teaches these things.

00:39:11.844 --> 00:39:13.510
There's no other books
with these things

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.180
that teach these sciences.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.010
So the fact of the matter is I'm
a little unique in what I do,

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.400
but every bar can be
successful, if they just

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.650
changed what they do.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.280
And I'll leave you with
a quote from, I believe,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.445
Benjamin Franklin.

00:39:27.445 --> 00:39:29.460
It says "if you do tomorrow,
what you did today,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.680
you'll get tomorrow
which you got today."

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.150
I got to make them do
something different tomorrow.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.180
So do they.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.870
And the strange thing is they
could do that without me.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.750
But the problem is they
blame the president,

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.370
they blame Congress, they blame
everything else but themselves.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.440
And then they go home,
mad at somebody else.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.962
I suggest you should go
home mad at yourself.

00:39:48.962 --> 00:39:50.379
MALE SPEAKER: Great
Next question.

00:39:50.379 --> 00:39:52.878
AUDIENCE: Where did you get a
lot of the data and statistics

00:39:52.878 --> 00:39:54.580
you use, such as
if you serve food,

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.320
someone stays 45 minutes longer.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.690
If you have neon lights, they
leave 30 minutes earlier.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.070
Where do you get that data?

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.250
JON TAFFER: Some of
that is industrial.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.416
For example, the fluorescent
lighting is industrial.

00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:06.492
It was actually a study done
by General Motors years ago,

00:40:06.492 --> 00:40:08.075
where they changed
florescent lighting

00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.270
to incandescent lighting.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.350
And illnesses went down.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.200
And employee
productivity went up.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.520
And I own a company
called GuestProbe.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.590
And it's not a company
that I promote publicly,

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.590
but I have over my 30 years,
I have these databases

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.580
with 60,000 restaurants
and bars worth of data,

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.770
where I've done these
surveys and focus groups.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.330
So most of this data is owned by
me, really, and created by me.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.730
It's a little unique.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.000
And it's not out
there any place else.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.710
So for me, I know
it's 52 minutes,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.580
because I've tracked
it for 30 years.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.969
Nobody else has.

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:43.510
I wish I had a better
answer for you.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.030
But that's the reality of it to.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.440
They're my own sciences
that I test and work.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.030
And they work every
time for me, as you see.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.610
When I push the
buttons, it happens.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.750
Science is science, but I'm the
nutcase who does this stuff.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.480
And I am.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.160
I'm a nutcase on this stuff.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.030
I will spend a fortune
to build a video camera

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.300
in the corner behind
a piece of mirror,

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.160
just so that I can
monitor posture.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.770
When I open a new
bar or restaurant,

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.757
I put a girl in the ladies'
room in a stall with a notepad.

00:41:11.757 --> 00:41:13.590
And she sits in there
for an hour and a half

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.335
because what you guys say
to each other at the mirror

00:41:15.335 --> 00:41:16.150
is gospel.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.900
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.101
JON TAFFER: I want to know.

00:41:19.101 --> 00:41:21.100
I want to know what you're
saying to each other.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.040
When do you think of my food?

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.170
What do you think
of my environment?

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.461
Do you think the place is safe?

00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:26.200
Do you like the other customers?

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.720
I need to know.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.230
I have this insatiable
addictive need

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.860
to know what's going
on in your brain.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.830
So I use every trick in the
book to get to that information.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.730
So it's 30-year, $60,000
restaurants worth of data.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.610
It's actually a
really neat database,

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.750
even down to the color of
plates, flow patterns, hours,

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.640
price, points, for example,
psychological pricing.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.190
And there's no difference
in guest perception

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.010
from $8.25 or $8.95.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.660
Absolutely zero.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.890
So if you charge $8.25 instead
of $8.95, you're leaving what?

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.710
60 cents on a table every
time you create a transaction.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.170
So I can go into a bar, just
change the pricing from $8.50

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:11.560
to $8.95 on all the menu
items, move some stuff around,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.360
not change one recipe and
increase revenues by about 20%.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.710
So that's the science.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:19.090
I can box something in
the center of a menu

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:23.730
and sales of that item will
go up 20% every single time.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.890
If I bold it, put
Chef's Special on it,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.590
sales would go up 14% to
17% every single time.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.340
People have a 6.5%
propensity to order

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.160
the top bottom and bottom two
items on the list on a menu.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.300
So what am I going to do?

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.140
I'm going to take my
most profitable item,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.230
box it, shadow it, move it
all around, move it at $8.95,

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.300
and manipulate you to buy
what I'm making money on.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.170
If there's a menu item
that my customers love,

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.760
that I don't make
money on, I hide it,

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.207
so no new customer find it.

00:42:53.207 --> 00:42:54.540
The old customers know I got it.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.540
I'm not going to take
it away from you.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.850
But I don't want anybody else
getting hooked with this thing.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.058
I want them [CLICKING SOUND].

00:42:59.058 --> 00:43:02.650
So I hide that in the menu, and
move my most profitable items.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.660
It's incredibly manipulative.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.471
And I had the confidence to do
this because of that database.

00:43:08.471 --> 00:43:10.220
Or I probably wouldn't
have the confidence

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.410
to make the bold moves
that I do sometimes.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.700
MALE SPEAKER: And what is the
name of that invention where

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.360
you have the two rails
with just a limited space?

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.642
JON TAFFER: Butt funnel.

00:43:17.642 --> 00:43:20.340
Made a lot of money, a lot of
mileage, off the butt fun--

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.480
the concept of the
butt funnel, and it's

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.270
for a youthful, high
energy nightclub.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:27.280
It's a narrow entryway
to a dance floor.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.790
So stand up for a second.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.623
So if we're going to
go in this dance floor,

00:43:30.623 --> 00:43:32.710
we got to sort of go like this.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.250
Now, with a guy and
a girl, it tends

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.200
to work better most
of the time, but--

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.625
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:37.790
JON TAFFER: The
fact is I'm forcing

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.020
their faces to be together.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.470
I'm forcing eye contact.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.500
I'm forcing human interaction.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.070
And butt funneling, I
invented about 25 years ago.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.555
Got a lot of mileage
out of the butt funnel.

00:43:48.555 --> 00:43:49.680
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.646
All right, next question.

00:43:51.646 --> 00:43:54.270
AUDIENCE: OK, well, first I have
to say, sorry, that I actually

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.840
never watch your show,
which I have to start.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.160
But it sounds like,
from your story,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.720
that the first thing that
the owner does is like, oh,

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.830
I don't want to change.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.580
So I'm curious what your take
on this human psychology.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.980
On the one hand, they
obviously apply for the show,

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.890
and they know they're going
to be asked for a change.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.060
But then they don't
want to change.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.920
JON TAFFER: You know,
it's interesting,

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.770
when I look at those five
minute little casting reels

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:18.640
that we do, they say stuff
like oh, when Taffer gets here,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.140
he's going to love me.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.110
I mean he's going to think that
I'm as good at this as he is.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.300
Boy, do they get a
surprise when I show up.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.560
Then the other guy says, oh,
boy, if he screams at me,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.250
I'm going to go at him.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.570
I just look at him loudly,
and he starts crying.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.900
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.150
JON TAFFER: So they
take this posture.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.730
It's strange.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.760
And after shooting
59 of them, you'd

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.010
think they know what's coming.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.260
But the fact of the
matter is each one of them

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.649
thinks that they're going
to be the one that I'm not

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:46.440
going to scream at.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.550
And if you saw Gypsy, the Las
Vegas gay bar that we did,

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.030
remember what he says?

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.980
Oh, I got to tell you.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.940
Jon is going to be my buddy.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.420
And then after this
is all done, he's

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.544
going to go out for a drink,
and he's going to say,

00:44:57.544 --> 00:45:00.192
Paul, you were right,
and I was wrong.

00:45:00.192 --> 00:45:02.620
Yeah, that didn't quite work
out for him as he thought.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.520
But it's fascinating, that
human dynamic that you're

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.530
setting yourself up
to be embarrassed

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.840
on national television.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.809
And here's the
unique part of it.

00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:16.100
At the end of the show,
they're not really embarrassed,

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.510
are they?

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.920
Nine out of ten episodes,
they turn, don't they?

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.810
And nine out of ten
episodes, at the end

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:25.434
you like them, even if they were
a total jerk in the beginning.

00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:28.520
Remember, Ami, the guy in Denver
that I got in a fight with?

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.800
He called Chef Duffy "fat boy"?

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.750
So I swung at that guy.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.700
I mean, he infuriated me.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.770
We fought for three days.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.480
And he was an
Israeli military guy,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.840
about four feet
four inches tall,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.940
who thought he was
about nine foot tall.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.330
And this guy was an ass.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.120
And what you didn't
see on cameras

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.020
before he said fat
boy to Chef Duffy,

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.450
he called his
employees assholes.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.860
So my employees are stupid
assholes and your fat boy chef.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.560
I just won't accept robbing
people of their dignity.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.940
I don't do that.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.170
And I'll attack what
you do, but I rarely

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.440
attack people personally,
unless it's a unique situation.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:16.050
Make a long story short,
at the end, he said,

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:17.550
I prayed to God for an angel.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.810
And the angel sent
me Jon Taffer.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.390
So at the end, he
redeemed himself.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.340
And I think that's
why they do it,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.840
is they know at
the end of the show

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.625
if they're reasonable at all--
they were jerks along the way,

00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:30.000
but at the end,
there's something

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.510
endearing about each of them.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.760
I think that's the motivation.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.152
Also, when you're losing
a half a million dollars,

00:46:34.152 --> 00:46:35.610
and you've got a
family to support,

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.430
that could be pretty
motivating too.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.525
And we do change fortunes.

00:46:40.525 --> 00:46:42.150
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions for you.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.440
One is you're very animated.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.800
Your body language is unique.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.180
Have you've studied people
for your own body language?

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.910
Is that what you came up with?

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.170
Because even on the show, every
move you make seems calculated.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.920
JON TAFFER: It is.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.730
AUDIENCE: And it's very
empowering and brilliant.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.980
JON TAFFER: Thank you.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.130
AUDIENCE: I just recognize it,
and it's very empowering, just

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.754
absolutely shocking
how much you move.

00:47:06.754 --> 00:47:07.670
JON TAFFER: Thank you.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.780
And it is.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.140
It is very contrived.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.530
I have to have more energy
than anybody in the room.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.740
I've got to drive the
energy of the TV show,

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.270
as well as the five days
for those employees.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.640
So my energy is critical to
moving the process along.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.019
So if I have a flu, if
I have a fever, nope.

00:47:25.019 --> 00:47:26.060
I got to be on every day.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.080
I got to lift that energy.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.514
The other thing is
I've got to be loud.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.180
And the fact of the
matter is the things

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.850
that you-- back
to your question--

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.570
the things that I
say to them have

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.890
been said to them
before in many cases.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.470
But when I say it, they are
going to frickin' hear it.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.970
And I'm not going to
allow them not to hear it.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.990
And these animations,
I'm even doing it now,

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.370
are really critical
to positioning myself

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.520
above them in their perception.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.290
And I don't mean above
as a human being.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.350
They need to look up to me, or
they're not going to follow me.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.990
And the animations, the
energy, the body language,

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:03.380
the communication, the
eye contact, all of this

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.700
matters to me getting them to
slip into that submissive role,

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.885
if you will, and follow my lead.

00:48:09.885 --> 00:48:12.262
AUDIENCE: Your book on
tape should be a video.

00:48:12.262 --> 00:48:13.720
JON TAFFER: I have
some videos out.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.928
As a matter of fact, I'm
launching in February Taffer

00:48:15.928 --> 00:48:18.200
TV, which we're
launching, I just

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.240
built a whole production
studio in Las Vegas

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.770
with a 30-foot bar in it.

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.570
So it's a whole
educational program

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.392
that we're creating to do that.

00:48:26.392 --> 00:48:27.225
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:27.225 --> 00:48:28.350
JON TAFFER: You're welcome.

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.510
AUDIENCE: The second question
was when you rescue a bar,

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.030
and these people already
in financial trouble,

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.810
does the show pick
up the renovation?

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:36.210
JON TAFFER: Yes.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.680
AUDIENCE: Does the
show pick up your fees?

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.990
Is there ever a deal
that goes on between--

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.350
JON TAFFER: The show
pays for everything.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.530
The owner pays for nothing.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.720
AUDIENCE: And they're completely
separate once you leave?

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.810
JON TAFFER: Yes, I
have no involvement

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.018
in the business when I leave.

00:48:46.018 --> 00:48:48.420
As a matter of fact,
probably 80% of them,

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.400
I've never spoken
with when I left.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.190
I will share my email with them.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.360
If they have questions,
they can shoot me an email.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.470
I give them my books.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.890
I give them lists of promotions.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.820
They get a binder
about this thick.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.330
And nine out of
ten of them never

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.140
communicate with me ever again.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.030
And I don't look back,
to be honest with you.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:06.965
I'm always looking
forward at the next one.

00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:09.340
AUDIENCE: One of the best
things you ever did on the show

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.740
was when you brought a previous
"Bar Rescue" owner in to spy

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.936
for another one.

00:49:13.936 --> 00:49:15.060
That made a big impression.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.735
JON TAFFER: We're doing a
bunch of that this season.

00:49:16.735 --> 00:49:17.290
AUDIENCE: I hope so.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.170
JON TAFFER: It's fun
for me, because A, it

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.207
gives you an update
on that bar when

00:49:21.207 --> 00:49:22.540
they tell you how they're doing.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.720
It shows the relationship
I created with them

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.220
that it's real.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.030
And they went through
the experience,

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.760
so they're great
candidates to do that.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.100
You're going to see a
lot of that this season.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.766
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:49:31.766 --> 00:49:32.490
Thank you.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.080
JON TAFFER: My pleasure.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.470
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.636
So it's actually the last
question we have time for.

00:49:35.636 --> 00:49:39.440
Jon, do you have any other
final words or final advice

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.400
for some of us?

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.960
JON TAFFER: The
only final advice

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.280
I would give you is I've lived
a very unconventional life.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.130
And it's because I live
my dream every day.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.170
Dreams are inspiring.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.040
Work is not.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.524
Find a dream.

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.940
Whether it's that
client you can't

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.460
get that you've been
fighting for six months.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.330
You got to have dreams.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:02.880
Dreams make this world go on.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.590
It built our whole country.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.700
And when we get in a
rut as human beings

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.180
is when we lose touch
with our dreams.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.550
We lose the ability to
fight for those dreams.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.420
So don't be an
employee of Google.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.910
Live your dreams at Google.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:22.830
Find a way to match your dreams
with the goals of your company

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:24.640
in your own work,
because there's

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.320
nothing worse than mechanical
employees that lost touch

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.950
with their dream.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.525
The other thing I would
say is leadership.

00:50:34.525 --> 00:50:36.150
I'm one of the few
people who say this.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.000
Leadership is not created.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.040
You can read every
leadership book in the world.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.665
I can't make somebody
a leader, if they

00:50:41.665 --> 00:50:43.470
weren't by 12 years old.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.930
Leadership is a trait that we
have, that we're born with.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.430
The Pied Piper,
no, you never read

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.069
what a good musician
he was, do you?

00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:52.360
Couldn't play the flute at
all, but people followed him

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.693
off the cliff because of who is.

00:50:53.693 --> 00:50:55.830
How many entrepreneurs
do people follow

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:58.850
to bankruptcy that don't
know what they're doing?

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:01.600
Leadership is a
trait that is born.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.710
When you find a great leader,
attach yourself to him.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.490
Ride it to the end,
because great leadership

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.190
and your dreams together will
take you to the Promised Land.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.410
And the worst thing
in the world is

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.045
when you see somebody who
lost touch with their dreams.

00:51:17.045 --> 00:51:18.170
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.120
All right, a round of
applause for Jon Taffer.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.020
Thank you very much.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:26.743
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
