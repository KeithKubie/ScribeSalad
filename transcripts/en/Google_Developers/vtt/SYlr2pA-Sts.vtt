00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:09.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I'm really
excited about our next speaker,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.160
because I worked closely
with her until recently.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.210
And before I say who she is,
let's watch a video about her.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.710
PAVNI DIWANJI: To
me, when I program,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.280
it feels like I'm
creating something,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.230
and once these creative
juices are flowing,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.320
then I can bring
them everywhere I go.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.660
I grew up in a city in western
India called Ahmedabad.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.780
My mom worked as a bank manager.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.470
At the time, you don't think
about these things, right?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.590
It's only afterwards,
you're grown up,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.290
and you're looking around
and you're like, boy,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.900
that was unusual to have
actually a working mother.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.080
My dad worked for IBM.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.350
Think I was in
seventh grade, and he

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.320
was trying to get me
excited about programming

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.530
for the first time in
the language BASIC.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.374
My dad's like, well,
you should learn

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:05.790
so you can enter
this competition.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.850
I'm like, oh, that sounds good.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730
Really I have never looked back.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.676
Once I got my hands dirty,
I was like, this is amazing.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.570
I remember this
day very clearly.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.440
I showed up to the university,
and I'm looking around.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.370
In my whole class,
I'm the only woman.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.600
And I'm like, I guess I'm going
to have to get used to this,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.240
because it's also
a four-year degree.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.080
If girls are showing
inclination towards sciences,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.550
we have to support them and
we have to encourage them.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.960
We have two daughters,
and I think my older one

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.010
is, right now, into
computer games.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.505
So I'm taking that as a win.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.440
My dad mortgaged
his office, $10,000.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400
I knew that could
last me one quarter.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.490
So my mission, when
I came to Standford,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450
was to find a way to
fund my education.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.820
I made a big list of
all of the professors.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.050
I went to them, and I
said, here's what I can do.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.270
Can you take a chance on me?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.990
Some of them shouted at me.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.200
One of them really kicked
me out of the office,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.350
and I cried for a bit, and
then the next morning, I

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.510
went to the next
person on the list.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.070
So I think my, don't give
up gene, really helped me.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.540
I graduated in '92.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.330
The company I wanted to work
for was Sun Microsystems,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.360
because it was where a
lot of hot engineers were.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.580
At the time, C++ was
the language of choice,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.080
but it was fairly complex,
and a lot of programmers

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.650
didn't really like it.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.730
This little team of
eight people deep in Sun

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.195
were designing a new
programming language called OAK.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.920
And OAK became JAVA,
and then just launched,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.480
and it became a huge
overnight success.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.770
It was tremendously exciting.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.320
We would come to work every day,
and there was a huge fan base.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.070
And we had no idea
when we put it out,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.650
we had no idea how
much of a success

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.200
this was going to become.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.570
And then, James
Gosling had this idea

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.935
that this programming
language can be really, really

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.220
useful even on the server side.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.040
And no one was looking
at that area at all,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.430
and so I said, I'll step
up and I'll look at it.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.190
And then servlets were born.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.290
I think you can hardly go
to a website today that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.251
doesn't deploy the technology.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.470
I think spam is awful.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.050
It clutters up everyone's life.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.850
What makes it very
hard is also what

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.245
intrigues me about the problem.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.370
It's almost like you're
playing chess with someone.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.036
There's a human being
on the other side,

00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:01.250
and there's us on
this side trying

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.730
to figure out how
to take them out.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.520
I'm thinking about
the problem every day.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.750
There's got to be
a better answer.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.220
There's got to be
a better answer.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.879
And that's what led to the
creation of my second company

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.420
MailFrontier.

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:23.230
The idea is, can we
take Gmail and bring it

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.530
to schools, and
universities, and companies?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.910
And I found this
incredibly exciting.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.290
I picked it up as
my 20% project.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.370
20% projects at Google
are like, for 20%

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.900
of your time you're allowed
to do whatever you want.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.640
Gmail was created this way.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.050
Google Maps was
created this way.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.590
Fast forward four years,
and what we achieved

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.870
was Google Apps for Business.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.170
Most major universities in
the world today use that.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.807
My kids' school uses that.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.550
I would say it's the most
fast-paced project at Google.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.170
I am driving the profiles
and pages effort,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.240
and we've just gotten started.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.720
We have so many good things
coming down the pipeline.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.810
Success, to me, for Google+
pages, means every business,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.260
every band, every
artist, will have a page,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.230
a Google+ page where they
will all be using Google+.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.000
I would declare victory if
I have changed the world,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
if I have created something
that a lot of people

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.550
use that have made a
difference in their lives.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.470
And Google makes it
really easy to do that.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
let's welcome [APPLAUSE]

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.940
our VP of engineering
at Google Pavni Diwanji.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.200
When this video was made, she
was the director it appears.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.330
Today she runs our spam
fighting efforts and Google Kids

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.620
efforts.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.700
She, as you saw in the video,
founded and led Google Apps

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.910
for Business, and other
enterprise products,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.510
and also helped start and
lead profiles and pages effort

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.090
for Google+.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.840
Prior to joining Google, Pavni
was a serial entrepreneur

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.300
who started and sold multiple
successful companies.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.580
She managed the communication
and client software division

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.340
encompassing email,
instant messaging,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.700
and toolbar products
and Excite@Home.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.380
She started her career,
as you saw in the video,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.480
at Sun Microsystems as
a software engineer.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.780
And she is the one who
helped make servlet happen.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.510
She's won numerous
entrepreneurship awards

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.070
and holds several
patents in the areas

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.840
of distributed systems
and networking.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.100
I also have the pleasure of
working closely with Pavni,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.300
and it amazes me, her energy,
her unstoppable attitude,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.580
and she never take
no for an answer.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.420
So let's welcome Pavni on board.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.880
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah, it
was a rough introduction,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.850
wouldn't you agree?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.170
It's hard to talk after that.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.900
So I thought maybe I
can spend 10 minutes

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.480
and talk a little
bit about my journey.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.580
And then I can open
it up for questions,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.210
and we can just take it where--
it's a small enough audience.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.260
We should be able to, I
think, have a conversation.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.150
But before I start, one question
I have is, how many of you

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.210
are students?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.910
Just for my
[INAUDIBLE], awesome.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.650
And how many of you are
already in the workforce?

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.650
Wow, OK, cool.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.570
It's pretty divided.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.560
So I think the things
I want to talk about

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.540
is things that,
the qualities that

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.860
have helped make a difference
for myself, and hopefully

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.260
through that process,
motivate to you guys

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.750
to go conquer your own
moon-shots or your own dreams.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.280
So, I was very fortunate.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.350
I started as a kid
in India, and my dad,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.720
as you saw in the
video, worked for IBM.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.390
And one of the things
he did early on

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.477
is, he used to take me
to work all the time.

00:08:10.477 --> 00:08:12.060
At that time, there
were no computers,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.300
there were only punch cards
and punch card machines.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.820
I'm kind of old, I guess.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.570
But it was very good, because
getting that exposure--

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.100
and he would take me, he used
be a hardware engineering

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.360
and would do calls, and he
would take me on the calls.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.984
And he would teach
me as we'd go along.

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:32.190
And it kind of sparked
that early interest in me.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.340
Now, every Sundays,
he would also

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.820
give us, me and my brother
both, a screwdriver

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.760
and a soldering
iron, and we would

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.830
have to go around the house
fixing things that didn't work.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.730
That part was not
too exciting for me,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:49.970
but the computers stuck on,
and they have served me well,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.600
and I've never really
looked back on my interest.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.490
So I was one of those people
who was fortunate enough

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.620
to know what I was
passionate about early on.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.290
Now, it doesn't always happened,
but in my case, it was.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.300
Now, the other thing, I was
very good at math at school,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.520
and my parents
always encouraged me.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.730
Whatever I was good at, they
would encourage me to do that.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.750
For example, I was
an avid reader,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.800
and there was no reading
limit in my house.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.510
I also remember, I
had a working mother,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.260
but early on she didn't
work because there

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.530
were no day cares.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.840
And I remember in fourth
grade, she came to me,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.590
and she sat our
family down, and she

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.430
said well, I want
to make a change.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.500
I want to go back to work, and
it's important for my own good.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.410
And we listened, and
she explained to us

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.150
why it would mean changes
to us, and we listened.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.690
And I realize now,
looking back on it,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.510
how unusual that experience was.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.760
Most kids in my school
didn't have working moms,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.120
and didn't have to
make any adjustments.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.450
And here I had
both my parents who

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.230
were great role models to me.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.800
And this is what, I have
two daughters, as you saw,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.880
and I really try hard to
encourage their passions.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.390
Now, my older one, has
a passion for writing,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.040
and also, unusually, science
fiction and Minecraft.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.390
And, like I said, I try to
encourage her passions, too.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.050
And my younger on is
more, it looks to me,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.020
right now, that she's much more
into science and engineering.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.950
So, now when I choose computer
science for my undergrad,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.650
and as I showed, I arrived
at the engineering school,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.270
the shock was quite immense.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.280
It's hard to capture.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.400
You show up, and you're
the only girl in the class.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.710
And you look around,
and it's, to me, it's

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.170
a big test for your own self.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.080
Can I still do it?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.230
I asked myself, and I said,
yup, you know, it's OK.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.550
I'll just learn how to
be in this environment.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.480
And I think the big learning
lesson is, do what it takes.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.840
Follow your interest,
and if you're having fun,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.820
than the rest of it is
going to fall in place.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.450
Now, when I decided to
follow further education

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.770
and come to US,
Stanford accepted me.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.540
And I also remember the day
when some of my relatives

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.150
came to my mother to
have a special talk.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.310
And they said that
it better not send me

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.710
to US and to Stanford
for further education.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.460
And she said, why?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.730
It's such a great opportunity.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.620
And they said, well, if she
gets such highly educated,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.150
then she won't find a match.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.670
And I remember my mom
towering, she stood up,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.310
and she said, let
me worry about that.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.170
So I thought that was the
best thing that she could do,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.642
and she turned around, and she
looked at me, and she said,

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:43.600
you're going to do what
you need to do, and let

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.340
me worry about these people.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.980
So, financially, it was also
not easy, as we talked, right?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.430
And thinking ahead,
the fact that my dad

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.290
made such a big
sacrifice to send me here

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.660
to further my studies, that gave
me a lesson of responsibility.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.260
There were a lot of sacrifices
done to get me to where I was,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.980
and so I did not want to
fritter away my opportunity.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.370
I wanted to work hard,
and it was deep within me

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.420
to prove myself, because
a lot was riding on it.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.170
And that work
ethic comes from, I

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.450
think, that lesson
of responsibility

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.950
that my parents gave.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.380
Now, coming to
Stanford I told you

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.580
guys story about the early
lesson on don't give up.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.080
But I also want to
talk a little bit

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.220
about my first class I took
was computer networking.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.054
Now, it was easy for
me to top in India.

00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:38.720
I was always in the
first, second, rank.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.830
You come to Stanford,
and you're surrounded

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.040
by super smart people, people
who are much smarter than you.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.522
And it is intimidating.

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:47.980
I go to my first lesson, it
was computer networking lesson.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.210
The professor, David Cheritan,
he stood up and said,

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.330
OK, first homework assignment.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.860
And we're all getting
our notebooks out.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.690
And he said, I want you
guys to go and read TCP/IP.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.800
Now, for geeks in
the audience, this

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.280
is the protocol that
powers everything.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.390
And he's standing up,
and he's saying to us,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.990
all students, fresh, saying,
yeah, we can do it better.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.410
So I think I was like,
that's impossible.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.280
We can't do that in
two weeks, right?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.190
He's crazy.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.320
And I think that what I
learned in that two weeks,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.230
is it was not impossible.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.360
In fact, a lot of students
wrote better things, right?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.720
So what it taught
me is that you have

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.020
to think from first principles,
nothing is impossible,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.100
and working with smarter
people, encouraging

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.240
diverse environments,
and taking on challenges

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.700
does change the world.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.250
So, this was my first
lesson at Stanford.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.550
When I got a job doing
backups for Stanford

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.130
to pay for my tuition.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.020
And I also remember the first
time-- they gave me an office,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.200
and I went into the
office, and there

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.190
was a next computer and a
Macintosh-- two Macintoshes,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.840
actually.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.940
And I'm looking,
and in my mind, I'm

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.260
thinking there must
be 10 people office,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.880
we must be time sharing.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.310
So I looked at them, and I
said, so what's my time slot

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.416
to come into this office?

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.790
And they're looking
at me saying,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.250
no, no, this is your office.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.510
I'm like, really?

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.040
I get to have three computers?

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.700
Wow!

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.560
So that's the other
thing, resources

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.030
were [INAUDIBLE], for
me, it was like a kid

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.120
being in a candy store.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.190
And then it was only left up to
me to make a difference, right?

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.810
So that was huge.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.960
So fast forward
two, three years,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.380
I'm looking for my new job, I
knew I wanted to work for Sun.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.140
I had an offer from
Silicon Graphics,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.010
but I went to interview
at Sun, and I really

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.080
liked the people there.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.930
And the engineers
there excited me,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.400
and they were trying to
build this thing called,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.650
remote procedure
calls, RPCs, and I

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.260
thought I could really
help them do it better.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.080
But they decided not to hire me.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.321
So I got a call saying,
no, you're really bright,

00:14:56.321 --> 00:14:58.570
and we really like you, but
we don't have any openings

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.910
right now, so no.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.394
And I was really depressed,
and then one of my friends

00:15:02.394 --> 00:15:04.060
looked at me and said,
since when do you

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.050
take no for an answer?

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.820
Pick up the phone
and call the manager.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.630
So I had to pump
myself up to do that.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.200
And I spent 15
minutes-- I didn't

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.700
listen to anything
she had to say--

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.740
and all I talked about
is how I could change

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.040
what they were doing for better,
and how they're making mistakes

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.060
that I could help fix, right?

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.040
And after 15 minutes she just
said, OK, let me call you back.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.190
Give me a day or so
to think about it.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.330
Then, five minutes,
I'm not kidding you,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.120
five minutes later, she called
me and said, you're hired.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.686
So the lesson was, don't
take no for an answer,

00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:44.060
there are too many
people in life

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.030
who spend time
saying no to people.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.710
Don't listen to them, right?

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.990
Before I went to
JAVA team, there

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.046
was another team I was with,
and I was very frustrated.

00:15:55.046 --> 00:15:56.670
I was doing really
well as an engineer,

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.378
but I would go in to
these large meetings

00:15:58.378 --> 00:16:00.190
and no one would listen to me.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.180
And I had good ideas, and
no one would listen to me.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.900
So, one thing I do very
well is I ask for help.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.620
And so there was a distinguished
engineer in my team,

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.544
and so I pulled him aside and
said, do you not like my ideas?

00:16:11.544 --> 00:16:12.960
And he says, no,
they're fabulous.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.850
So I said, then why
is no one listening

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.180
to me in the meetings?

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.095
And he paused for a
second, and then he

00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:21.590
said, well, you just
hike up the volume.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.140
Try a few things,
learn to shout.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.020
He even told me,
get on the table.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.860
Do whatever it takes, so I
took his advice to heart,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.570
and in the next meeting,
I'm like, right.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.420
I cleared up my throat,
and I was going in,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.630
and then right in the beginning
of the meeting, I shouted.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.670
I started shouting at
the top of my voice.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.240
And there was a hush.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.823
And then everyone looked at me
and said, why are you shouting?

00:16:43.823 --> 00:16:46.972
And it's like, it's because
you weren't listening to me.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:52.700
But anyway, do whatever it takes
to make your dream real, right?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.350
And then a few years down, after
JAVA happened and everything,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.720
it was super exciting for me.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.360
My career had gotten off
to a fabulous start at Sun.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.569
And then one of my coworkers
came to me and said,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.430
let's do a startup.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.750
This was 1998, it
was an unusual time.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.890
A lot of people were
breaking off to do companies,

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.240
and I'm like, no.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.829
I'm doing so well at Sun, I
don't want to give it all up.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.280
So it took me a few
months to figure this out,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.859
but then I said, you know?

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.740
Maybe challenging myself
would be a good thing.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.510
And so I broke off and we
started my first company,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.220
which was a search company
called [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.380
And it was an
amazingly fun ride,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.510
and what I learned
through that experience

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.890
was taking big risks matter,
challenging yourself.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.370
If you challenge yourself,
you might surprise yourself.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:46.510
I found things I didn't know
I had in terms of talent.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.550
I was a CEO, I'd never
done sales before.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.580
I hadn't taken an MBA
class before, right?

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.650
But I just kind of worked my way
through it, and in the process,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.130
I found that was actually
a really good negotiator.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.890
It's something I
would have never found

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.530
if I'd just stayed at Sun and
continued to be an engineer.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.380
So, I think my learning
there was-- and it also

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.840
really grew my confidence
and taught me new skills.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.790
So sometimes, throwing
yourself into a new problem

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.200
really grows you and grows
your perception of you

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.550
and what you can
do with your life.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.950
So, fast forward again,
and I've been at Google,

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.330
I think, since 2005, so eight
and a half years, long time.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.110
When I came over,
I didn't think I

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.150
was going to last for
very long because I

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.510
had to startup bug in me.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.730
But I went through
the interview,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.750
and I was so challenged
in that interview.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.800
It was over three days,
and so many people,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.500
and they were asking me
really hard questions, right?

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.170
And I interviewing
for a managing job,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.010
like a director
job, and they were

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.200
asking me to code on
the whiteboard, right?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.979
And afterwards, I remember
talking to the recruiter,

00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:59.520
and I said, I think there's been
some mistake because they're

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.353
asking me to code, which
I don't mind doing,

00:19:01.353 --> 00:19:03.430
but you know I'm interviewing
for a managing job.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.180
And he's like, no, we
do this to everyone.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.180
I'm like, OK.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.110
But what I learned was that
through that interview,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.030
I took it as an
experience, because I

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.930
learned that there are so
many smart people here.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.950
And I really want
to learn from them.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.470
In the interview,
I think someone

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.890
who interviewed me had
invented Google Ads.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.420
And I'm like, wow.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.244
So it in my gut, I
came home, and I'm

00:19:25.244 --> 00:19:27.160
like, if they're going
to offer me a job, then

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.020
I'm going to take it because
this feels right to me.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.760
And my first four years, I
remember coming in to Google,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.910
and I had a bunch of big jobs.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.640
I was managing Google
Calendar, and Blogger,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.370
and a bunch of projects.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.880
And then there was this
three engineer team,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:51.290
and they had this idea that
what if we take Gmail and use it

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.870
for universities, and
schools, and businesses.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.632
And I just come
from startup land,

00:19:56.632 --> 00:19:58.340
I had gone through
the hell of setting up

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.670
an exchange server
for my startup.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.664
And I also knew
that in schools, we

00:20:03.664 --> 00:20:05.080
were using really
backwards tools.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.016
And I saw the opportunity
to have the impact.

00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:09.640
And even though it
was a small project,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.400
I adopted it as a 20% project.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.979
And this is one
of the-- there are

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:14.520
lots of fabulous
things about Google,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.270
but one of the things
I love the most

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.660
is that they really
give you the freedom

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.650
to figure out what you're
passionate about and go for it.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.660
And the other
fabulous thing is, I

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.490
remember, I have this
really concrete memory,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.720
the first building I stepped
in was right next door, here.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.450
And one day I was just
doing my business,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.687
and sitting on my desk,
and this guy friend

00:20:37.687 --> 00:20:38.770
came by and introduced me.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.650
And he was just
sitting two desks down,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.770
and he was the founder of Gmail.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.320
And I'm like, oh
my God, oh my God.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.360
I have arrived, that's
what I said to myself.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.040
So anyways, it's really
humbling, but at the same time

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.770
I find it very empowering.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.020
So, last 10, 15
minutes what I've

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.740
talked about is, follow
your gut and passion,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.440
don't let anyone
else say otherwise.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.910
Don't take no for an answer.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.950
Do whatever it takes
to follow your dreams.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.300
And take risks.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.020
Challenging yourself
and keeping growing

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.000
is the only way to grow.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.170
And then the last thing
is, find an environment

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.580
that supports you.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.930
Surround yourself with
people who support you,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.910
and the rest will follow.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.765
So I hope my story inspires
you to find your own,

00:21:33.765 --> 00:21:36.589
and pursue your own moon-shots
and dreams, thank you.

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:41.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:46.500
So, I'm happy to answer
questions if we have time.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, so
based on your story,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.050
I have something very similar.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.350
I completed my
bachelor's and I wanted

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.890
to get my master's over here,
and my mom was OK with that.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:04.050
And my aunt came to her and
said, why are you doing that?

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.359
She should get married now.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.900
PAVNI DIWANJI: It's
a common problem.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.845
AUDIENCE: And so same thing
happened after a completed

00:22:10.845 --> 00:22:11.710
a master's.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.400
People asked me, when
are you getting married?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.140
And after some
time, I got married.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.050
And people asked me, so
when are we having babies?

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.650
And the worst thing about
this is nobody asked me

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.390
what I'm doing with my career.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.300
It's just sad.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.490
So my question to you is,
what would you suggest?

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.740
How do we change the
society around us?

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.780
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think I'm a
big believer in what Margaret

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.939
Mead's code I think
everyone knows it,

00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:41.480
everything starts
with an individual,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.590
don't underestimate
the power you have.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.730
My dad also always
says that when

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.520
you come across a
challenge, 100% of the time,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.830
the answer is within
you, not around you.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.620
So look within, and
what I would say

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.770
to you is why are you
waiting for them to ask?

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.040
Tell them.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.380
Tell them what you
want to do, right?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.750
So that would be answer.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.150
I don't think this is
easy, any big changes

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.730
in numbers in society, they
all have to start small.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.360
Every big change
has to start small.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.940
And the soldiers and individuals
who are in the revolution

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.402
are what is going to make
a difference in the end.

00:23:16.402 --> 00:23:18.360
So this is where all of
you are very important.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.500
And this is why we are
here on a Saturday, night?

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.070
Because we all think
we can make a change.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.420
As Yoki also said the
same thing earlier.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.560
AUDIENCE: So you have an
amazing drive, an amazing self

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.670
confidence, and I that was
really inspiring to hear.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.810
And I think a lot of people
the room probably have similar,

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.520
if we made it here, we have
the same kind of drive.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.807
And I think-- I lead
the women in tech group,

00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:50.390
and I think sometimes
it's really easy

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.270
to say, follow your passion,
do whatever it takes.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.830
And that can be really
hard, and really alienating,

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.700
and really lonely.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.160
And so I think my question is,
how do we lower the bar so you

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.910
don't need that amazing drive,
that iron drive to make it?

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.120
How do we make it
easier for those

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.040
who don't have that
to join us here

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.389
in this really
amazing profession?

00:24:12.389 --> 00:24:14.430
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think
it's a very good question,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.622
and there are a couple of
facets of answers I would give.

00:24:18.622 --> 00:24:20.080
One of the things
I tell people is,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.970
if things are not working
where you are, then change it.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.320
You have the power to change it.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.860
You try once or twice.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.620
This is why I,
personally, love Google,

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.040
and this is why I've been here
for eight and a half years,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.000
is I think it's incredibly
humble and supporting

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.320
environment, right?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.350
To get your voice
heard it's no problem.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.190
We're solely
data-focused, right?

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.470
We debate openly
about ideas, we are

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.800
fairly collaborative
as a company,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.580
and I think these are really
good embodiments for women

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.790
engineers, too.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.140
We like that, right?

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.957
So find an
environment like that.

00:24:53.957 --> 00:24:56.040
The other point I would
make is, surround yourself

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.860
with people who are
going to lift you, right?

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.230
It's incredibly important.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.500
Early on I realize-- and it
doesn't have to be women--

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.840
early on I realized that, I need
help, comes really easy for me

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.340
to say.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.800
And I realize it's not so
easy for a lot of people,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.470
but one of the
things I realized is

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.330
as soon as I say that, I always
have a hand raised, someone

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.410
raising their hand
saying, I'll help you.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.760
So I've had good fortune to
have good social backing,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.930
like having great friends,
and also having great mentors

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.060
who can tell me
what I need to do.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.080
So, I think that is
going to make it easy.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.580
AUDIENCE: So I'm
part of-- thank you,

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.010
I'll stand over here-- so
I'm part of a tech boot camp,

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.532
and I'm the first
woman in my program.

00:25:54.532 --> 00:25:56.240
There have been about
50 students so far,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.640
and I'm the only
woman that has ever

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.210
been enrolled in the program.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.760
And one thing that I
find that's interesting

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.900
is that a lot of
the men program,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.960
they're not really aware
of their own biases that

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.400
can create an environment that
make it difficult for women

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.580
to get into.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.430
So for example, for the
first week in the program,

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.080
the guys got together and they
made a page called Bro Hacks.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:25.270
And it was all about hacks for
guys to make really cool code.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.840
And I've been made an honorary
bro since then, which is great.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.420
But I think that there
are little things that

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.900
can create a very difficult
environment for women

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.130
to get into or it
seems intimidating.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.210
And I wanted to see
if you or anybody else

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.370
here have any thoughts on
how we can make men more

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.585
aware of the biases
that they have.

00:26:44.585 --> 00:26:45.960
Because it is very
difficult when

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.910
you walk into a room
and it's only men.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.130
Or you walk into a recruiting
event or a networking event

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.859
and people assume that you're a
recruiter and not a developer.

00:26:55.859 --> 00:26:57.400
So I just wanted to
get your thoughts

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.070
on that, how we can bring in
men to the conversation, too?

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.710
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think
someone, go ahead.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.300
There's one minute left, OK.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.820
So a quick-- I would say
there's no magic answers.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.370
Unfortunately it is
what it is, but I

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.130
think we have the
power to change it.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.400
So what I do in these
situations is I just stand up

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.480
and I say, here's
who I am, and here's

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.490
where I'm going to add value,
and here's my role, right?

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.530
So you do have to
be the spokespeople.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.950
We have to be our
own spokespeople

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.720
is what I'm saying, probably
that's the best way.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.250
There's no magic answers that's
going to transform society.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.650
The power is in this room.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.470
The power is here.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.740
I think we have to be
the revolutionists.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.835
We have to be the leaders.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.194
AUDIENCE: So, I have
one more question.

00:27:47.194 --> 00:27:48.610
So like someone
had mentioned, you

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.577
have this amazing
self-confidence.

00:27:50.577 --> 00:27:52.910
And I think a lot of women,
when they arrive at college,

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.939
I was one of them, but that
was the first time I had ever

00:27:56.939 --> 00:27:58.230
learned about computer science.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.980
And there are these
boys in the class that

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.712
have been doing it since
they were like, 11.

00:28:02.712 --> 00:28:04.170
And there's been
a couple articles,

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.420
there's been more and more
talk-- not just about men--

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.532
but there's something
called tech privilege,

00:28:08.532 --> 00:28:10.740
where there's people that
have been doing it forever,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.835
and someone coming in later,
it's often very intimidating.

00:28:13.835 --> 00:28:15.460
And then you mentioned
during your talk

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.110
that at Sun Microsystems
you knew you were right.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.940
And you had ideas and
they were brilliant.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.440
So how did you
believe in yourself?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.447
How did you believe that
you had great ideas,

00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:28.530
and that they were right,
and people should listen

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.550
to you instead of assuming that
other people, because they've

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.280
been in industry
longer, just knew better

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.737
because they have
more experience?

00:28:34.737 --> 00:28:35.820
PAVNI DIWANJI: You didn't.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.640
I didn't know I was right.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.780
That was part of my story,
but maybe I can tell it again.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.104
I think initially, I
also got down, right?

00:28:44.104 --> 00:28:46.270
I didn't talk about all the
low points in my career.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.070
There's more lows than
highs in career and in life,

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.470
but I think that don't give
up rides me out, normally.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.230
And I have this little back room
in my house where I go to cry,

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.730
as well.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.400
So, I think it's OK.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.500
I think that's what I said,
I think on the Sun one,

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.210
I think I didn't
know I was right.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.880
I knew something was off, that
I was having all these ideas,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.060
and there was this little
voice inside of me that said,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.910
this doesn't look right.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.080
So I went and I consulted
someone offline.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.650
That was the key thing.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.295
This person, other
engineer, one on one,

00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:23.920
I sat down and said,
what do you think?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.780
And he said, no, you're right,
and you should speak up.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.830
And that was what gave me
the power to do what I did.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.410
So everyone has lows and highs.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.720
Men do too, right?

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.570
So I think the question
is, do we have techniques?

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.000
Do we cultivate
techniques to surmount it?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.340
And I I'm a big
proponent of mentoring.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.740
Not for the sake of it, but
find someone who you look up to.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.920
Cultivate that relationship so
that you can go and ask them

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.370
for help when you need it.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.020
We're done, I think.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.070
Thank you everyone.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.690
Thank you.
