The editor is quite powerful. 
Without using any code,

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.380
one can create relatively 
sophisticated layouts.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.020
Make sure to use 
the built-in styled text widgets

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.550
for large and medium text. 
All of the text is just placeholder text,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.180
so you easily enter it 
using the visual editor.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.256
If you're proud of your creation,
take a screenshot and post it

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.962
along with the XML into the forums.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:26.700
Now that you have some background 
on the basic tools in Android studio,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.650
and a few of the basic android 
user interface views,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.850
Katherine will show you 
how to start making some sunshine.
