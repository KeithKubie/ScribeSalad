00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
BEN SPARKS: Let's say, you're in Britain
on a dual carriageway.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm gonna try and draw this.
Two lanes, and we'll both go in this direction

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.840
and there's a blue car on the left,
and it's going at 70 miles per hour

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.100
which is the legal limit on motorways
and dual carriageways in this country.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.380
BRADY HARAN: They're doing the right thing.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.980
BEN: Yeah, and so they should be.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.920
Trouble is, you could be doing the right thing,
and other people on the roads might not.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.579
There's a guy overtaking the blue car.
It's gonna be the red car.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.760
BRADY: It's always the red car!

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.560
BEN: It's always the red car, and he's going faster.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.660
In fact, I'm gonna draw him in
at the moment he overtakes

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.040
and he's going -- as I'm sure it's happened to me,
in the blue car I hasten to add

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.280
I've been in the blue car, and someone comes
barreling past me going at 100 miles an hour.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520
Certainly it could happen,
whether it's on a motorway or dual carriageway.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.840
Now, they're not going the same speed,
but there is a moment when they're neck-and-neck

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.760
and that's the moment I want to freeze time
and ask you about what happens next.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.800
Because at this moment when they're neck-and-neck,
they see in front of them a tree

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.540
or some barrier which is unexpected,
and so they both need to break

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.480
and we're going to assume lots of things,
like is always the case with a mathematical question.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.620
We have to model it to keep it simple enough to answer.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.480
So the models here might be that,
let's assume have same cars.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.180
Let's assume reaction times are not part of this.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.580
We could add those things in later
if we want to complicate the model.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.040
Let's assume they both slam on the brakes
at the same time, and they break at the same rate

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.940
and by the time he gets there,
the blue car has sort of just stopped in time.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.800
So that's the blue car, who's got smaller apparently...

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.080
He has stopped with millimeters to spare,
which is good.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.960
BRADY: So the blue car just,
just stops as it gets to the tree.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.140
BEN: No crash for the blue guy.
He slammed on the brakes just in time.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.640
What I'm gonna claim, it's obvious
that the red guy is in trouble.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.540
The red guy is moving quicker.
He brakes at the same time, at the same rate.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.800
I think he's definitely gonna crash. No one seems
to argue about whether the red guy's gonna crash.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.220
What's really crucial, and here's the puzzle for you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.300
is that, it matters what speed you crash at.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.060
Right, if you crash at one mile an hour,
no one's gonna really worry.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.560
If you crash at a thousand miles an hour,
you're in trouble.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.700
Now, he's not gonna crash at thousand miles an hour.
He's gonna crash slower because he started braking.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.540
But, at what speed does he hit the tree?
And that's the puzzle.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.020
There's some intuition to get involved here,
there's also some maths to check it out

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.240
and the answer is-- well, it surprised me.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.980
BRADY: # Do do do do-do do do #

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.240
# The girl from Ipan-- #
(BEN laughs)

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.580
BRADY: Alright.
BEN: We're back! So the red guy has crashed.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.500
I just feel like I missed my chance to draw a crash.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.640
So this is the red guy.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.820
He's in pieces all over the place.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.380
Because your intuition doesn't work well
with speed questions

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.390
and this is why I got a bit surprised about this.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.000
The first thing to notice is that,
a lot of people think the answer is 30 miles an hour.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.320
It's really 'sensible' to think about the difference in
speed, which is 30 miles an hour at the start

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.860
and to think, if everything else is the same,
surely that's the speed it's got left over.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.760
There are lots of reasons why it's not correct,
and one of the reasons you'll probably think is

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.260
I wouldn't be asking this question if it was 30, fine!

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.520
Another intuition thing to ask though, is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.700
do you think it's slower than 30,
or do you think it's quicker than 30?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.540
Because if it's not 30, it's one of the two.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.680
And I'm gonna tell you the answer,
and I'm gonna justify it,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.220
because when someone told me the answer,
I just bawled. It was...

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.600
I was surprised. I was also a bit shocked
and dare I say it, sobered

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.140
and maybe I changed
my driving habits a little bit, because

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.820
the red guy hits the tree

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.280
assuming all that stuff we assumed, at approximately

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.220
71 miles per hour.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.840
BRADY: Seventy-one!
BEN: Seventy-one.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.860
He has not even reached the speed
that the blue guy started braking at

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.460
and he's hit the tree at that speed.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.960
There's the difference between
not crashing at all, well done blue guy

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.580
and hitting a brick wall, or a tree in this case,
at 71 miles an hour.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.920
And that was from a difference of 30 miles an hour
to start with, and everything else is the same.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.100
It's pretty easy to justify this, but

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.880
the answer is sobering enough.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.020
So I think we should justify it before I leave you

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.260
to go and change your driving habits,
and myself on my way home.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.980
There are many ways to solve this

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.520
and maybe if you've solved it a certain way,
try solve it another way.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.360
You can use things called the SUVAT equations.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.720
I've heard people make up nice rhymes to remember these things.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.280
They're to do with constant acceleration
equations to do with speed, distance, and time.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.980
But there's another way
which gets you the answer more quickly.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.600
So maybe you should go and try this SUVAT thing

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.820
but if you think about kinetic energy

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.280
this actually is quite easy.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.780
So I'm gonna imagine that they

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.940
I'm gonna do lots of slightly dodgy things here

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.360
but you have to imagine that
I'm just getting a ballpark for this model.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.280
The kinetic energy for the blue guy
is gonna be to do with several things.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.780
There's a formula for kinetic energy,
which looks like this.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.660
There's a half in there
for reasons I'm not going to go into

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.780
there's the mass of the car
which we're going to assume is the same for both cars

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.500
and there is its velocity.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.940
Now, if we're gonna actually work out the kinetic energy

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.240
we'd work this out in meters per second,
because that's the units that kinetic energy works in.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.980
I'm just gonna dodge that.
So I'm actually gonna say that it's kind of

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.240
kinetic energy is proportional to this,
because I'm just gonna work with 70's.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.800
But I hope you forgive me for this dodge

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.820
because I'm gonna do the same with the red car
so we can compare them.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.980
So the blue guy has got ½m, whatever the m is,
and we've got 70 squared.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.840
That's its velocity in miles per hour, and
we won't worry about it being in meter per second.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.020
Red guy, easy enough calculation

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.820
has a kinetic energy at the start of a ½m.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.360
We're going to see that's the same mass
because it's the same car

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.040
but this time we've got a 100 squared,
because that's his velocity to start with.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.080
And I'm gonna claim that in braking,
you're getting rid of kinetic energy.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.000
I don't think that's controversial

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.180
and the blue guy's got rid of all of it,
so there's none left.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.900
So what we need to work out
is how much energy that is

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.860
and if actually I calculate -- the only number
in here is 70 squared, and if the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.220
so I'm gonna say, this is proportional
to 70 squared, which is

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.000
4900 amount of energy.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.200
It's not in joules because
I'd need to have the units changed.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.640
But the red guy is proportional to 100 squared

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.500
which is 10,000.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.280
So even if the red guy gets rid of all the energy
the blue guy's got rid off

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
which he would if everything else is the same

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.509
I just need to do 10,000 take away 4900

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.260
which is 5100 of whatever units we're using left

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.140
which is more than the blue guy started with

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.060
and if you square root this, you get 71 point something

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.220
and that's it. The red guy's doomed

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.260
and it gets worse, because we haven't
even considered what'd happen if they

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.480
maybe take a tiny bit of time to react to the tree.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.540
If they take the same time to do it,
the blue guy has traveled less far than the red guy

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.280
so it's looking even worse.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.920
One other thing to bear in mind is maybe

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.160
you brake quicker when you're moving quicker
because there's more friction

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.880
but that doesn't counteract the fact
that the red guy is now doomed.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.940
The first time I heard this story,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.330
I had to go on

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.380
a course

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.900
about speed, being aware of speed on the roads.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.660
BRADY: Why were you doing that course?
BEN: I had, well I... it was a good idea.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.500
I think it was a good idea for me to do that
and avoid a massive fine.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.720
But they were telling me all this stuff about
driving slowly is important

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.420
and I'd just heard this,
and this completely sobered me up

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.160
and they were telling me a lot of other facts,
which had no effect, so

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.340
I tried to tell them this, they didn't appreciate that.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.420
But it is powerful. It made me slow down

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.400
and the crucial thing to take away is that,
it's the square of your speed that affects all your energy

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200
and that's the bit our intuition is really bad at.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.760
I'm gonna patent this one day. No stealing, Brady.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.900
If speedometers in a car,
instead of going 10, 20, 30, 40, 50...

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.200
if they went up with gaps that were
proportional to the square of those numbers

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.340
then you'd get this lovely intuition that
going from 70 to 100 is like doubling your energy

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.100
instead of just going up to 30 miles an hour.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.180
Car manufacturers haven't taken this one on board yet

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.460
but, one day.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.220
BRADY: I hope one of the things this video shows is that

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.300
in mathematics, sometimes
rather than just plugging numbers into equations

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.920
it's good to really understand
what's going on under the hood.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.500
See what I did there? "Under the hood."

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.240
Wrote that myself.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.620

Alright, let's really speed things up here!

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.920
I know I'm not supposed to be encouraging speeding

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.440
but it's okay a racetrack, isn't it?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.400
This is a controlled environment.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.640
Oh! Crashed...
