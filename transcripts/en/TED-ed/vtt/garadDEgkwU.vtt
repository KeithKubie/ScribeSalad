00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.209
It's that time again.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.635
You need another internship

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.882
to bolster your college applications.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.456
Last year you worked at a local art museum,

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.051
helping organize their collection

00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.096
and giving tours to visitors.

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:28.347
This year, it's going to be much more difficult.

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:30.269
You want to work on an organic farm

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.754
across the country in California.

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:34.603
That's your real passion.

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.563
Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:38.453
doesn't include organic farmers.

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:40.741
The same for your parents' group of friends.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.118
They want to help you,

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.504
but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.205
The school counselor, she just laughed.

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:50.244
To make your farming dreams come true,

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:53.255
you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties,

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.430
people like your family and closest friends,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.914
and try tapping into your weaker ties.

00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:00.102
Weak ties are a broader network,

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.881
your friends of friends of friends.

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.216
They're important because they have access to resources

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:07.346
that your strong ties don't have.

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:09.636
This works in both directions, by the way -

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.852
you have access to resources that they don't have.

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:14.229
Let's say most people speak

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.729
to three close friends on a regular basis.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.738
Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts,

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:22.293
you have access to three more people,

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:25.362
like a tree that branches out three times per node,

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:27.740
so you can look beyond your closest circles.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.533
During the last family get-together,

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.328
didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:35.205
with a nature photographer on the West Coast?

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.938
In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image

00:01:37.938 --> 00:01:42.171
by said photographer on the front cover of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.547
So, you email him

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:46.297
and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.802
publishes a sustainability magazine,

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.435
which employs a staff writer

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:52.582
who pitches on a local baseball team

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:54.316
with an umpire who,

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.355
wait for it,

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:57.053
is an organic farmer.

00:01:57.053 --> 00:01:58.437
Bingo!

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:01.237
Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds,

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.775
all because you reached out to your weak ties.

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:05.826
That's your key, remember?

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.197
Every conversation is an opportunity.

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:11.367
Moreover, don't wait for opportunity,

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:12.437
make it happen.

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:14.293
Take Kathryn Minshew for example.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.517
She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:20.570
to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.941
Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking.

00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.712
1 - Always say yes to invitations,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.261
even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting.

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:31.599
Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.853
resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:39.730
2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.776
That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.104
as soon as you meet them,

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:45.448
but talk about what you're trying to do.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:46.491
Be excited,

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.233
ask for feedback,

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.527
and try to get them excited too.

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:52.177
3 - Show up and often.

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:55.785
Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.578
You don't want to be that person

00:02:56.578 --> 00:02:59.201
who only shows up when he needs something.

00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.707
Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:04.217
when a new opportunity presents itself.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.796
So while networking may not be the most intuitive,

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:08.465
or even for some of you introverts,

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.272
the most comfortable skill,

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:13.038
it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job,

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:14.094
going to school,

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:17.436
or most importantly, learning from others.

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.765
Good luck!
