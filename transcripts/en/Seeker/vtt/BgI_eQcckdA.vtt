00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
Oh hello!

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.300
I’m just popping by with some of the most
recent exciting cosmological news: LIGO, already

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.389
a scientific superstar for being the first
facility to successfully detect gravitational

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.670
waves...is getting a quantum upgrade!

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.029
That’s right--the facility that is already
considered one of the most advanced pieces

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
of equipment on the planet is getting a roughly
$35 million upgrade.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.089
Projected to go into use around 2024, the
enhancements to LIGO could double its already

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.519
impressive detection power.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.930
We went into more detail about how LIGO works
in another video of mine that we’ll link

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.320
at the end of this video, but basically: there
are two LIGO facilities in two different states

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.430
in the US.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.090
Each facility has two 4-kilometer-long arms,
down which scientists bounce a laser, towards

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.080
a mirror at the other end.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.460
Then when the light bounces back and the beams
cross one another, the light waves should

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.190
cancel each other out.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.690
But, if there’s an extremely subtle shift
in the universe—and we’re talking EXTREMELY

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.339
subtle--like a gravitational wave—the two
waves won’t cancel each other out.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.340
The mirrors will have shifted enough that
the light waves are out of sync in a way that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
we can measure.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.140
Based on the results that are recorded by
the detector, scientists can then interpret

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.409
the data to see if the facility has detected
a gravitational wave: a ripple in space time

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.939
caused by a huge astrophysical event like
the collision of cosmological objects like

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.110
neutron stars and black holes.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.380
Obviously a problem here is making sure the
readings you’re detecting are really gravitational

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.869
waves, not just something like the natural
vibration of the earth.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.959
And while LIGO already has lots of successful
measures in place to prevent the measurements

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.490
from being interfered with by things that
are NOT gravitational waves, it could always

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.520
get better.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.310
Additionally, some of the LIGO improvements
are an effort to address the Heisenberg uncertainty

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.700
principle, or the idea that it’s impossible
to exactly measure more than one aspect of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.409
a phenomenon.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.729
For example, any attempt to precisely measure
the velocity of an electron will, according

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.479
to Heisenberg, disrupt its trajectory.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.560
You couldn’t also measure the electron’s
position and have it be unaffected by your

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.720
measurement of the velocity.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.540
Basically, you can’t measure two things
at once and have them both be accurate.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.250
The principle, in principle, applies to everything,
from your car to your molecules, but it’s

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.220
only really significant for things on microscopic
or more often, subatomic scales.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.130
This is relevant because the light beams that
LIGO’s calculations rely on have two different

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.130
important aspects that both need to be measured
in order to get a good reading.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.530
Its phase, which is the light’s position
at a given point in time, and its amplitude,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.220
which can be defined as its intensity.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.500
And because we’re trying to measure more
than one aspect of these light beams, the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.290
Heisenberg uncertainty principle can cause
some additional murkiness around detections—making

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.400
it even more difficult to pick out gravitational
waves from other, non-gravitational wave noise.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.480
To solve this problem?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.560
In the upgraded facility, LIGO will start
using quantum ‘squeezed’ light.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.150
This ‘frequency-dependent squeezing’ technique
will hopefully minimize fluctuations in the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.290
light’s phase, making the measurements of
the light’s amplitude more accurate—minimizing

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.650
the effect of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.150
The upgrade also includes new mirrors with
advanced coatings, specially designed to even

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.540
further reduce any extra noise caused by heat.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.960
These improvements are what will take this
history-making facility from LIGO to ALIGO+—the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.810
Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory Plus.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.300
The changes not only mean that scientists
could catch a gravitational wave every day,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.210
but could also be able to detect smaller events,
events happening farther away in space, and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.820
know way more about what the events were like!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.260
Were the black holes spinning when they crashed
into each other?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.840
Burning questions we may soon actually get
to know the answer to.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.230
Ultimately, this means more concrete evidence
in our search to uncover the mysteries of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.450
extreme physics in space, which gives us more
insight into the universe both as it is now,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.000
and as it came to be.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.750
Like we mentioned before, check out this video
here on some drama on LIGO’s measuring techniques,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.710
and make sure you come back to Seeker for
all your gravitational wave updates--like

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.270
the LIGO facility in India that’s planned
for 2025!

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.030
As always, thanks for watching and we’ll
see you for the next one.
