Bernie Sanders' young supporters
have been incredibly passionate

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.405
during his campaign,
and now that it's all over

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.574
they're understandably
emotional.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.543
â™ª

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.519
(laughter)

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.221
Comedians, in the spirit
of party unity, what's something

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.458
you might say to cheer up
these forlorn delegates? Sarah.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.594
Don't worry, you can reuse that
hat at the Renaissance Faire.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.296
-(laughter)
-Yes. Points.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.298
-Yeah, you could.
-(applause)

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.934
Uh... I want to point out
there's nothing wrong

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.703
with going
to the Renaissance Faire.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.639
-Chris.
-Uh...

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.741
Dude, it's okay.
You're still white.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.710
-All right, points. Points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.147
Tony.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.416
Don't worry, guys, your parents
will give you more money

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.984
to spend on other things.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:51.084
All right, points. Points.
