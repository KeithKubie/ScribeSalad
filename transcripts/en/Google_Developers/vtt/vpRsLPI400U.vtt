PETE LEPAGE: Hi.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.730
I'm Pete, a developer
advocate at Google.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.500
Images play an integral part
of almost every web page

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.552
and often account for the most
number of downloaded bytes.

00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:14.510
I'm going to show you a
few techniques that you

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.290
can use today to serve the
right image to the right device

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.440
on your pages without
too much extra work.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.240
First, let's take a look
at background images

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.150
served via CSS.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.060
One technique that you
can easily use today

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.970
is to combine the
background property

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.270
with media queries for
conditional image loading,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.600
based on screen resolution,
viewport size, and more.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440
On the previous example,
when the browser width

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.090
was less than 500
pixels, it only

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.300
used the image of the phone.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.760
But when the window was
more than 500 pixels,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.060
the media query kicked in,
adding an image of New York

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.720
City to the background.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.910
And instead of showing
the image of a phone,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.770
it showed the image of a tablet.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.290
Media queries can
also apply styles

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920
based on device
pixel ratio, making

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.110
it possible to display different
images for 1x and 2x displays.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.500
Chrome, Firefox and Opera
all support the standard min

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.660
resolution 2dppx syntax.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.280
Say that 10 times fast.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.350
While Safari and Android browser
both require the older vendor

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.430
prefix syntax without
the dppx unit.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.960
Remember, these
styles are only loaded

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.770
when the device matches
the media query.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.270
So you always need to
provide a fallback.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.480
This ensures that an
image is always loaded.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.650
Recently Chrome and Safari both
landed the new CSS image-set

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.200
function, making it easy to
provide multiple image files.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.800
This allows the browser to
choose the best image depending

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.980
on device characteristics,
for example,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.950
a 2x image for a 2x display or
a 1x image for a 1x display.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.380
The syntax is fairly
straightforward--

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.740
a comma-separated list
of image declarations

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.420
which consists of a
URL string followed

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.690
by an image resolution.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.950
Support for the
image-set function

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.750
is still new, and
for the time being,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250
requires the WebKit
vendor prefix.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.610
In addition to loading
the correct image,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.090
the browser will
scale it accordingly.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.260
The browser assumes
that 2x images are twice

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.560
as large as 1x images, and will
scale the 2x image so that it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.120
appears the right
size on screen.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.100
Now, for images and markup,
there aren't as many options

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.820
yet.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.980
The picture element is
coming, but hasn't landed.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.950
In Safari and Chrome, you can
use the new srcset attribute.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.780
The srcset attribute
enhances the behavior

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.600
of the image element, making it
easy to provide multiple image

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.880
files for different
device characteristics.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.680
The syntax resource
set is almost identical

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.160
to the CSS image-set function,
taking a comma separated list

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.670
of image declarations,
which consists

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.240
of a URL string followed
by the image resolution.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.300
Because srcset simply adds a new
attribute to the image element,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.400
if a browser doesn't know
how to support srcset,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
it simply ignores it and
uses the source attribute.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.530
That also makes it easy
to build a polyfill,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.930
and there are plenty available.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.550
In some cases, images
can be replaced

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.800
with CSS or other
browser capabilities.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.550
Rounded corners, gradients,
text shadows, box shadows,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.630
even reflections can
all be done with CSS

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.930
without the need to
download an image.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.990
And when someone finally
does ship a 16, or 20, or 30,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.080
or whatever new
display, you won't

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.870
need to create another
new image file.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.910
Adding responsive images
to your site is easy.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.910
For background
images, I've shown you

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.700
how you can use media
queries or the recently

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.490
landed image-set function.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.570
For images and markup,
picture is coming soon.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.519
But today you can use
the srcset attribute.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.550
And there are more
capabilities coming soon.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.820
To learn more about
responsive images,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.350
check out the images section
on the Web Fundamentals site

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.590
or just click on
that link on screen.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.090
Yeah.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.420
That one right there.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.990
Perfect.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.270
Thanks for watching.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.560
Go build something awesome.
