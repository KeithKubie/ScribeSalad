00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:09.108
- Then I feel something
tickle my anus.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.943
It felt like a feather.

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.579
I turn around.
There's no one there.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.016
So now I think something
paranormal is happening.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.952
Like it's Liberace's ghost
going, "Hi."

he's got his own podcast

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.002
called TigerBelly.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.671
Please give it up
for the hilarious comic

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.073

Let him hear it.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.846
So this story happened 15 years
ago.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.749
It involves sexualities,
and it's unholy,

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.452
and 15 years ago, I just want
to let you guys know

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.855
that I just couldn't get laid.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.858
I'm shaped
like a human dumpling.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.492
I look like Pikachu
with diabetes.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.361
I don't look good.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.429
I don't even know
how to fuck.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.999
This is what I do,
like a Hula-Hoop.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.035
This is how I fuck.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.503
So 15 years ago,

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.437
I got a gig in Las Vegas,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.706
my first headlining gig
at the Riviera,

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.642
and they were gonna pay me $150.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.544
Thank you.
One show.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.378
And--I'm making it.

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:55.882
And they wouldn't fly me out,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:59.719
so I had these two comics
drive me to Las Vegas,

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.287
Bryan [bleep].

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.888
He's a real guy.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.223
And Aaron [bleep],

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.793
and we drive to Las Vegas,

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.462
and we're on
Las Vegas Boulevard.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.665
We're at a stoplight,
and we're in Bryan's Bronco.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.969
And a truck pulls up next to us,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.804
a blue truck, with two
of the ugliest white girls

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.241
I've ever seen
in my fuckin' life.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.241
They were twins.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.077
They had mullets.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.579
They had Confederate flag
T-shirts on.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.748
They had acid-washed jeans.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.750
I'm getting hard right now.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.318
[laughter]

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:36.155
And they yell into the car,
"We think you're cute."

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.157
They weren't talking about me.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.859
They weren't talking
about Bryan, 'cause Bryan

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.594
is the ugliest white dude
I've ever seen.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.529
If you know Bryan [bleep],

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.399
he has no jawline
or fuckin' chin.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.769
His neck just blends
into his face.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.437
He looks like a tiki statue

00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:55.541
or Beaker from "The Muppets."

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.276
He looks awful.
He has a Gollum body.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:00.179
You know how white guys
have skinny arms and a belly?

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.614
God damn, he's unfuckable.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.716
Anyway, guys, the reason why
I just said that--

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.685
I called them out,
because I asked them

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.887
to do this story with me,
and he says, "No, I have kids."

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.555
Fuck you, Bryan.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:14.393
That's what you get.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:15.695
They were talking about Aaron,

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.062
and Aaron jumped out
of the Bronco.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.631
He goes
into the truck, and they just

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.265
drive into the distance,
you know what I mean?

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:23.102
We're like,
"Hope you don't die," you know?

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:27.139
So we go to the Riviera,
and it's, like, 9:00 p.m.,

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.076
and I tell Bryan, I go, "Bryan,
I need to write a set list,

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.645
"so you just do your own thing.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.380
I'll see you at the show.
It's at midnight."

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.748
So I go do my set list.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.817
At midnight, I show up
at the Riviera,

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:40.152
and Aaron and Bryan rolls up

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:42.222
with these two girls,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:46.492
and Aaron pulls me aside,
and he says, "Hey, dude,

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:51.497
if you're funny,
they'll fuck you."

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:56.335
And I got, "Nah."

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.138
Then Aaron goes, "Hey, 'cause
they're white supremacists."

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.606
I swear to fucking God.

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.242
So then, "Yes, I'll do it then."

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:06.412
Because if you're ethnic and you
fuck two white supremacists,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.114
that's a win for my people.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.848
[laughter]

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:14.019
They're gonna build a statue of
me in Seoul.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.787
So I go up,
and I do the show,

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:17.423
and I'm pretty good,
you know what I mean?

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.491
I'm likeable.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.527
Focus groups like me.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.197
I test well.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.198
And after the show,

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.366
we go up to the room,

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.668
and it's debauchery.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:32.271
I mean, the air is thick.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:35.040
It's like a Cambodian jungle.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.476
You can slice the air
with a machete,

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.710
you know what I mean?

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.980
And we were all wearing condoms.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.986
[laughs]

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:50.222
So it's two hours
of just sexualities, and...

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.324
I get the skinny one.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.525
We switch off.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:56.696
So...
[giggling]

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.965
eventually, I have the fat one
on the bed, right?

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.201
One of 'em was fat, by the way.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.736
I'm doing doggie style,

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.006
and Aaron has the other one
in the other bed,

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.642
and I look around.
"Where the fuck's Bryan?"

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.911
Nobody knows where Bryan is.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.079
He disappeared.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.713
The bathroom light is off,
right?

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.081
So he's not in there.

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.751
So I go, "Fuck him."
I keep going, right?

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.522
Then I feel something...

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:25.324
tickle my anus.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.226
It felt like a feather.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.862
I turn around.
There's no one there.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:33.266
So now I think something
paranormal is happening.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.234
Like it's Liberace's ghost
going,

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.770
"Hi," or whatever.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.605
So I keep going, right?

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.441
Then I definitely
feel something

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:44.777
rubbing against my anus, right?

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:49.782
Bryan had crawled
underneath my body,

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:52.117
underneath her body,
and started eating her out

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.519
while I was fucking her,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.688
which makes him a warrior.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:59.025
He's a fucking soldier, guys.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.595
I gave him a Purple Heart
afterwards, seriously.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.862
And I go, "Get the fuck out
of there."

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:06.532
He goes, "She likes it.
She likes it."

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.735
So all right.
I keep going.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.137
I start power fucking her.
You know how you do it?

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.739
You power fuck?

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.041
You speak English?

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.744
He said, "I don't know power
fuck."

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:24.250
I go rapid, ka-ka-ka,
you know what I mean?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.584
And my penis slips out,

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.953
and it goes right into
Bryan's eye.

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:31.991
[laughter]

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:35.728
I've never heard a scream
that loud before.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:36.762
[screams]

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:39.931
You know, it is fucking crazy.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:42.668
And then we stopped immediately.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.171
Putting a penis in an eye

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.673
is a party-stopper.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.475
I don't care where you are,
right?

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.944
It just ruins the mood.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.179
You can get a gold medal at the
Olympics

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:55.848
as they're putting the fucking
ribbon around your neck,

00:06:55.848 --> 00:07:00.019
and a P goes in your eye,
it's done, okay?

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:05.024
So anyway, we get up,
and I take him to breakfast.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.025
[laughing]

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.927
I do,

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.930
'cause I'm a good person,
you know what I mean?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.364
So we're at breakfast,

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:14.833
and we're eating bacon or
whatever.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.870
and I look across,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.373
and Bryan's eye
is completely closed

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:23.442
with a yellow film around it.

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.543
crowd: Ooh.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.378
- I know.

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:28.047
And I go, "Dude, your eye."

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.216
He goes, "I think we should go
to the hospital.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.517
It burns."

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.286
I go, "Nah.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.855
Put some Clorox on it
or whatever."

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.292
I wanted him to lose the eye

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.827
just for the story.

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:44.697
I blinded a man
with my penis once.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.502
So we get in the car.
It's 6:00 in the morning.

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:52.304
I'm fuckin' tired.

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:55.240
You speak English?
You all right? All right...

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.676
we drive to the hospital,
and I don't know what to say.

00:07:57.676 --> 00:07:59.244
I've never told a doctor

00:07:59.244 --> 00:08:02.081
that I poked somebody in the eye
with my penis before.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.750
Do you lie?
What the fuck do you do?

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.385
So Bryan goes, "I got it."

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.187
So we're sitting there
in the emergency room.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.189
Doctor walks in.
He says, "What happened?"

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.725
Bryan points at me.
He says, "He skull-fucked me."

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:16.595
[laughter]

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:18.097
That was the story.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.331
Thank you.
