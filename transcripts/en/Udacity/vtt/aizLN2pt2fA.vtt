Since the inverse of a function will have its x and y coordinates switched from

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.170
how they were in the original function. The x's and y's must be switched in

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.462
this equation, too. How about we do that next then? Please switch the position

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:18.715
of x and y in our equation y equals 3x minus 1. Write the new equation in this

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:19.309
box.
