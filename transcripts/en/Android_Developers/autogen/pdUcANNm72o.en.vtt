system is going to broadcast the action

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
system is going to broadcast the action
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.750
system is going to broadcast the action
to get restrictions intent to your

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
to get restrictions intent to your
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760
to get restrictions intent to your
application and it's going to expect

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
application and it's going to expect
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.430
application and it's going to expect
that you returned with an ArrayList of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
that you returned with an ArrayList of
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.520
that you returned with an ArrayList of
restriction entries in the bundle so in

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
restriction entries in the bundle so in
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.960
restriction entries in the bundle so in
the broadcast receiver when you get the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
the broadcast receiver when you get the
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.090
the broadcast receiver when you get the
broadcast the first thing you want to do

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
broadcast the first thing you want to do
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.210
broadcast the first thing you want to do
is called go async on the broadcast

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
is called go async on the broadcast
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.340
is called go async on the broadcast
receiver this is going to keep it active

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
receiver this is going to keep it active
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990
receiver this is going to keep it active
and also give you a pending results

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
and also give you a pending results
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.730
and also give you a pending results
object to return your restrictions in

object to return your restrictions in
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.800
object to return your restrictions in
then you create an ArrayList of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
then you create an ArrayList of
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900
then you create an ArrayList of
restriction entries and put it in the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
restriction entries and put it in the
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.660
restriction entries and put it in the
bundle and return it we've got three

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670
bundle and return it we've got three
 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850
bundle and return it we've got three
different types of restriction entry we

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
different types of restriction entry we
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.230
different types of restriction entry we
have the boolean type just on and off

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240
have the boolean type just on and off
 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.020
have the boolean type just on and off
we've got the check box single select

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
we've got the check box single select
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.330
we've got the check box single select
from a list and we have multiple

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
from a list and we have multiple
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.930

selection from a list three different

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
selection from a list three different
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.660
selection from a list three different
types and looking at those in code we

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
types and looking at those in code we
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.740
types and looking at those in code we
have three different constructors for

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
have three different constructors for
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.630
have three different constructors for
those different types of restriction

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
those different types of restriction
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.130
those different types of restriction
entry and all of those constructors take

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
entry and all of those constructors take
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.070
entry and all of those constructors take
a key so that later on you can retrieve

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
a key so that later on you can retrieve
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.750
a key so that later on you can retrieve
the setting from the system

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
the setting from the system
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.070
the setting from the system
and also a default or current value here

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
and also a default or current value here
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260
and also a default or current value here
we've got the brilliant ID and then the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270
we've got the brilliant ID and then the
 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.450
we've got the brilliant ID and then the
single choice type maybe in the single

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.920
choice type you want to use it for the
content rating of the content available

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930
content rating of the content available
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.600
content rating of the content available
to restricted user so you can have a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
to restricted user so you can have a
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.060
to restricted user so you can have a
single choice of under 12 15 plus

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070
single choice of under 12 15 plus
 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.830
single choice of under 12 15 plus
whatever and then you just choose one of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
whatever and then you just choose one of
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.970
whatever and then you just choose one of
those and make the content in your

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980
those and make the content in your
 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370
those and make the content in your
application relevant for the user and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
application relevant for the user and
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.660
application relevant for the user and
then the multiple choice type is going

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670
then the multiple choice type is going
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.070
then the multiple choice type is going
to take an ArrayList of strings for the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
to take an ArrayList of strings for the
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.980
to take an ArrayList of strings for the
default so now the system's asked you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990
default so now the system's asked you
 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.330
default so now the system's asked you
for your restrictions you've returned

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
for your restrictions you've returned
 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.949
for your restrictions you've returned
them in this bundle and ArrayList of

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
them in this bundle and ArrayList of
 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.960
them in this bundle and ArrayList of
restriction interest and then the device

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
restriction interest and then the device
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.370
restriction interest and then the device
owner has been and set the exact

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
owner has been and set the exact
 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.320
owner has been and set the exact
restrictions for their child so the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330
restrictions for their child so the
 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.970
restrictions for their child so the
final step of course is going to be to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980
final step of course is going to be to
 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.280
final step of course is going to be to
retrieve those restrictions from the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
retrieve those restrictions from the
 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.590
retrieve those restrictions from the
system so on resuming your application

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
system so on resuming your application
 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.350
system so on resuming your application
you can recall the restriction set by

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360
you can recall the restriction set by
 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.570
you can recall the restriction set by
getting hold of the system service for

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580
getting hold of the system service for
 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.250
getting hold of the system service for
user service and then get the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
user service and then get the
 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.840
user service and then get the
application restrictions for your

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850
application restrictions for your
 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.970
application restrictions for your
package of course this may come back

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
package of course this may come back
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.410
package of course this may come back
without any restrictions in it in that

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420
without any restrictions in it in that
 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.580
without any restrictions in it in that
case you'll be running in the device

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590

you're in a restricted profile you'll
see all the restrictions you can collect

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990
see all the restrictions you can collect

restricted and if it's not you almost

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630
restricted and if it's not you almost
 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.450
restricted and if it's not you almost
certainly in a restricted profile so

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460
certainly in a restricted profile so
 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.800
certainly in a restricted profile so
that's how restricted profile works but

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810
that's how restricted profile works but
 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.330
that's how restricted profile works but
there is of course just one more thing

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340
there is of course just one more thing

about restricted profiles they're
 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.710
about restricted profiles they're
especially useful for content-based

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720
especially useful for content-based
 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.420
especially useful for content-based
applications and I'm looking forward to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
applications and I'm looking forward to
 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.219
applications and I'm looking forward to
seeing what use cases you come up with

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229
seeing what use cases you come up with
 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.520
seeing what use cases you come up with
thank you very much
