00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.390
Are you watching a web-enabled TV while browsing
on your smartphone with your laptop nearby?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.800
Think about unplugging!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:15.090
Because you’re wasting energy, money AND
heating up the planet.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.940
Hello everyone, tech addict Amy with you today
on DNews.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.930
Odds are you’re watching this on a computer
or phone that you plug in but rarely, if ever,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.930
powerdown.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.699
Well, listen up, because perpetual “stand-by”
mode is really not a good thing!

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.480
As we become more connected and more dependent
on all the latest gadgets and appliances,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.970
we’re inadvertently using electricity when
we don’t need to.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.750
This includes computers that have a “sleep”
mode, DVRs that sit idle waiting to record

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.070
the next “Game of Thrones,” that silly
clock on your microwave and your plugged-in,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.840
fully-charged laptop.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.870
For most of these appliances, they draw power
from the mains simply because they’re plugged-in

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.070
and not because they’re doing anything useful.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.170
In a study of Northern Californian households
carried out by the Natural Resources Defense

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.650
Council, researchers found that 23 percent
of residential energy consumption was coming

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.230
from idle devices.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.009
On average in these homes, there were 65 such
devices.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.459
Roughly a quarter of all energy use comes
from appliances and devices that aren’t

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.069
currently doing a thing.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.299
This may not sound like a lot, but the study
crunched some numbers.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.259
Assuming that the whole of the United States
has a similar addiction to useless machines

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.539
plugged into the wall, we, as a nation, consume
an extra 64 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.520
per year -- that’s the equivalent power
consumption of Alabama and Arizona for 12

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520
months!

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.249
If there were powerplants dedicated to keeping
idle devices on standby mode, we’d need

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.990
50 large (500-megawatt) stations to make that
happen.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.130
Obviously, there’s a cost.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.509
This excess energy use translates to approximately
19 billion dollars per year, which averages

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.609
out to about
165 dollars per US household per year.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.929
But the cost isn’t just financial, it’s
environmental.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.590
Idle electronics account for 44 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.340
-- that’s nearly 5 percent of carbon dioxide
generated by the US residential sector per

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.340
year.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.859
Carbon dioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas,
so it stands to reason that if households

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.519
would just unplug their electronics while
they’re not being used, another source of

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.550
the greenhouse gas can be limited.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.650
So unplug your devices!

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.310
Turn off your power bars!

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.079
And be be aware of how much you actually need
your computers.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.439
Odds are, you shut a lot of things down, save
yourself some money, and help the planet.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.930
And if you’re super keen, why not get in
on the ground floor and help develop the tech

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.000
that will help save our environment!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.280
Tech innovations are constantly changing our
lives.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.989
Full Sail’s Simulation &amp; Visualization degree
program was designed to create future engineers

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.950
who will develop systems for the twenty-first
century.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.010
All of Full Sail’s Web &amp; Tech programs are
designed specifically to flex as new methods

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.819
and applications unfold, allowing students
to remain relevant and informed throughout

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.620
their entire academy journey.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.459

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.319
So electronics are a culprit, but what else
in our houses are damaging the environment?

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:15.609
Trace has the rundown in this video right
here.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.420
So with some new knowledge, will you be changing
your device habits?
