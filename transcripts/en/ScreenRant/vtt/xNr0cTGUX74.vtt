00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.460
Movie production is often viewed as a well
oiled machine on tight, strict schedules for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.690
everyone included.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
It often leads moviegoers to assume everything
happens precisely as planned, but that isn’t

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.090
always the case.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.580
Improvised scenes usually happen when an actor
truly transforms into their character and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.470
reacts to the any given situation as said
character.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.340
Unscripted scenes give movies a more honest
feel and leave the viewers remembering the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.340
film.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
And, more often than not, can spark an emotion
from laughter to sadness—and everything

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.390
in between.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.100
Check out these 10 hilarious movie moments
you didn't know were improvised.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.309
Robin Williams &amp; Matt Damon In Good Will Hunting
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck’s critically

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.899
acclaimed film, Good Will Hunting, had its
very own hilarious improv scene.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.329
The sequence features whiz kid Will Hunting
(Matt Damon) at one of his many therapy sessions

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.030
with therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.800
In order to get Hunting to open up emotionally,
Maguire recalls a memory about his late wife

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.829
and her gassy habits causing Hunting to laugh
hysterically.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.590
But what you may not have known is the entire
story was made up by Williams mid-scene.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.070
And Damon’s laugh is 100 percent genuine.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.510
Although Williams earned his first and only
Academy Award for his role, he still managed

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.770
to dial in his well-known improvised acting
skills at a critical moment.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.250
Jim Carrey &amp; Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber
It’s hard to forget Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.310
as the idiotic best buddies Lloyd Christmas
and Harry Dunne in the comedy-cult-classic—Dumb

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.310
and Dumber.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.509
And, with a duo like that, is it so hard to
believe that the actors didn’t stick to

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.509
the assigned dialogue?

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.990
There’s a scene where the two knuckleheads
pick up a hitchhiker and unleash a ton of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.159
crazy antics on the unsuspecting man.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.479
In the original script by the Farrelly Brother’s,
the scene called for Carrey and Daniels to

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.280
test the man’s nerves over an argument about
jelly beans.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.369
But instead, the two actors horse around endlessly.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.780
This is the notable scene where Carrey asks,
“Hey, wanna hear the most annoying sound

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.520
in the world?” and proceeds to yell in the
man’s ear.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.009
Nick Frost &amp; Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead
The 2004 Brit-horror-comedy, Shaun of the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.460
Dead, featured its share of British comedians,
comic actors and sitcom stars leaving the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.870
script open for interpretation from the cast.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.960
That being said, there are several different
versions of the scene where Nick Frost’s

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.860
character Ed attempts to cheer up Shaun (Simon
Pegg) by telling stories about the pub regulars.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
In the scenes, Ed describes the woman as an
ex-pornstar and this was supposedly all made

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.670
up on the spot.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.790
And as a result, we even get some genuine
laughter from Pegg.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.000
Seth Rogan &amp; Paul Rudd in Knocked Up
Judd Apatow’s 2007 rom-com, Knocked Up,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.550
starred Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl as
two young adults facing the repercussions

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.350
of a drunken-one-night stand and an unintended
pregnancy.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.940
The film also featured an improvised scene
idea from Apatow’s 2005 hit The 40-Year-Old

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
Virgin.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.240
The scene involves Rogan’s character Ben
Stone taking a ride with Pete (Paul Rudd)

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.480
where the two perform some hilarious back
and forth banter.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.080
While the scene didn’t make the movie, it
was part of the DVD extra as a deleted bonus

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.350
scene and the improvised dialogue runs over
three minutes.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.900
Paul Rudd &amp; Michael Pena in Ant-Man
Marvel’s Ant-Man is arguably one of MCU’s

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.300
funniest superhero films and it is largely
due to the hilarious cast.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.130
The film stars Paul Rudd, Michael Pena, Judy
Greer, Evangeline Lily and many more.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.410
And believe it or not, a majority of the stars
scenes were improvised.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.050
Rudd revealed many of his scenes with Greer
(who plays his ex) were improv.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.100
While Pena told Variety that about 50 percent
of his scenes were improvised as well.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.620
Specifically Pena and Rudd’s scenes would
need a re-write as the two would make the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.510
scene their own with the magic of improv.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.950
Bill Murray in Caddyshack
One of Caddyshack’s most quoted scenes from

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.310
the film is by Bill Murray’s character,
groundskeeper Carl Spackler.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.010
In the film, Murray mutters a story to himself
about an unknown golfer winning the Masters

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.360
and he titles it “The Cinderella Story.”

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.950
Unknown to many is that the entire scene was
developed by the actor on the spot.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.011
In his 1999 book Cinderella Story: My Life
in Golf Murray said, "The Cinderella Story

00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:56.430
was a spur-of-the-moment idea.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.440
'Get me some flowers,' I said.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.370
'Four rows of mums.”

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.480
Harrison Ford in The Empire Strikes Back
Throughout the Star Wars films, Harrison Ford

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.470
has played the cocky rogue Han Solo.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.880
In many of the films we see his character
as brash, arrogant, conceited and overconfident

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.229
but there is one scene where we see some compassion.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.150
In the original scene in The Empire Strikes
Back before Han is placed in suspended animation

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.129
Leia confesses her love Han and is supposed
to reply with “I love you too.”

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.110
However, George Lucas told Ford that it doesn’t
work and thought he should say what he thought

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.159
would be best.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.960
And with that, we get the simple reply of
“I know.”

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.159
Richard Castellano in The Godfather
The Godfather is a dark and gritty crime drama

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.740
that follows a fictional New York mafia family.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.379
But one of the actors took it upon himself
to add a bit of comedy to the script.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.479
In the scene when Peter Clemenza (Richard
Castellano) heads out to have Paulie Gatto

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.110
(John Martino) killed, his wife also tells
him to remember to pick up cannoli’s.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.949
As a result, the murder takes place during
the cannoli run.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.629
After Clemenza’s henchman takes care of
Gatto, the mafia man instructs his lackey

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.280
to “Leave the gun.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.449
Take the cannoli.”

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.879
And just like that, the slight tweak and improvised
line of humor created a very memorable moment

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.400
in the movie.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.229
Jeremy Renner in Avengers: Age of Ultron
The Marvel’s Cinematic Universe really made

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.919
an incredible movie with Avengers: Age of
Ultron.

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.910
Fans were introduced to new characters and
it laid the foundation for the Civil War storyline.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.469
Aside from all the action and drama it had
some hilarious scenes, in particular with

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.030
Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.009
He and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson)
had a somewhat love-hate relationship and

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.449
often had back-to-back banter.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.470
At one scene, Quicksilver speeds away and
taunts Hawkeye, leaving the archer to draw

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.680
his bow and take aim at the speedster, quietly
saying, “Nobody would know… ‘last I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.749
saw him, Ultron was sitting on him!’”

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:47.040
The line was one of the funniest in the film
and one that Renner came up with all on his

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040
own.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.300
Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy
In 2014 when James Gunn’s Guardians of the

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.289
Galaxy released, many fans of the Marvel movies
were introduced to a plethora of new heroes.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.499
And while these characters are well known
to the comic book world, movie goers left

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:01.120
the theaters a bit confused.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.819
Gunn and Chris Pratt decided to have some
fun with the character’s obscurity.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.470
The scene in question is when Peter Quill
is first captured and he is disappointed that

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.360
no one recognizes the name of Star-Lord.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.229
The scene, surprisingly, was improvised and
was a nice way for the audience to empathize

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.830
with the character about his unimportance.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.780
Those are our picks for 10 hilarious movie
scenes that were totally made up on the spot.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.720
