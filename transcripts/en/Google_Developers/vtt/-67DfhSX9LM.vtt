[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.550
HOI LAM: So on my
side we have Ninu,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.350
who's a part manager on
the Google Beacon platform

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.260
and also Ani who's a part
manager on the physical web.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.240
So you have basically all of
the Google Beacon platform

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.600
represented on this stage.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.760
So we can kind of jump
through sort of questions.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.900
Actually I left my list of
internet requests on here.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.970
So what we do is I'll kick
off with two questions,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.740
and then afterwards, if
anyone in the audience

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.690
want to ask a question, please
feel free to put your hand up

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.130
and we'll go from there.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.510
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sounds good.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.009
Yeah.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.346
HOI LAM: OK so the first
question is why is Google

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:48.470
creating a Beacon platform?

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.660
I mean there are
platforms already.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.250
So--

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.650
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.940
HOI LAM: What do you think?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.710
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So
first off, hi guys.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.556
My name is Nirdhar Khazanie.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.152
I'm Ninu.

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:58.610
I'm product manager
here at Google.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.210
Really happy to be here
with Ani, and with you, Hoi.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.940
So kind of like why we
designed the Google Beacon

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.590
platform and Eddystone.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.110
So think about it like this,
so the Google Beacon platform

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.630
spans everything
that you might want

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.680
to do with the very high
quality context precise signal

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.970
that you might get
directly from a Beacon.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.070
Let's try to break this down
into three main components.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.860
The first one is Eddystone.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.290
So Eddystone is our
open Beacon format.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.960
Then the second part is the
actual scanning libraries

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.540
that we have, which
are platform agnostic.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.430
And the third part is the actual
Google Beacon registry itself.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.790
So let's talk about Eddystone.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.610
So Eddystone is our open
frame specification format.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.700
So we released this last
year in July of 2015.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.450
So it's open, meaning that
it's available on GitHub.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.510
Today you can download
it and actually works

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.180
on both Android
as well as an iOS.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.960
It's extensible, so we have
three mainframe formats today.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.830
So there's Eddystone UID.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.530
There's Eddystone URL, which
works with the physical web,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.160
which is what Ani works on.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.430
As well as there's the Eddystone
TLM, which is telemetry data.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.060
And something that
really, I think,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.419
that differentiates us from some
of the other different Beacon

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.924
formats which might be out there
is that, with telemetry, we

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.090
have the ability to work
directly with the Proximity

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.440
Beacon API where
you can actually

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.760
get health stats and battery
stats, et cetera, directly

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.470
on your Beacon
deployments that you might

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680
have out there in the world.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.700
So the second part
is with scanning.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.100
So our nearby
API's, actually it's

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.650
a platform scanning API that
works, again, cross-platform,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.970
both on Android
as well as on iOS.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.830
And with the nearby,
some of the benefits

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.680
that you get
underneath the hood are

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.230
that you get over the
air updates that actually

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.040
help with performance as well
as with battery improvements.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.680
Further, you also can ask for
a limited set of permissions,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.000
which actually works really
well across both platforms.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.160
And then, also this
helps to include

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.250
things like pending intents,
as well as background

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.796
subscriptions that we have.

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:02.890
Though this
basically leads into,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.710
with the nearby API connecting,
directly through the Proximity

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.080
Beacon API, and then onwards
to our Google Beacon platform,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.420
which is like our
back end services.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.339
And so with that, you can
actually add any attachments

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:15.880
that you might have
from your Beacons

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.760
that you will have
registered with Google.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580
And then from there
you can add content

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.220
that you want to be able to
deploy out within your apps.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.170
And so this kind of
like end to end story

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.770
is what we're really
looking forward to.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.270
And that's kind of
what we're really

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.430
looking at the developers
in the audience

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.440
to be able to also work
with us afterwards.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.194
So if you have any
questions about this,

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:36.360
we'd love to be able to
hear them and see how we can

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.970
get your apps working better.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.560
HOI LAM: Cool.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.870
Another question is there
are other geolocation

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.050
techniques like GPS and wi-fi.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.749
Why should people
think about Beacons?

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.290
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Yeah,
we think Beacons

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.710
are valuable for
two main reasons,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.430
separate from other
localization technologies.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.980
The first is that it works
really well, particularly

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.310
in indoor environments.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.740
We spend most of
our time indoors,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.470
but the existing localization
technologies that are out there

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.470
don't do a great job of
being able to figure out

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.140
exactly where a user is inside.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.100
Beacons provide pretty
scoped and pretty short

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.440
range cues as to
where a user might

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.270
be in an indoor environment,
so it works well there.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.160
The second is that Beacons
work very well for establishing

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.709
context as to where a user is
relative to their location,

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.430
not necessarily precisely the
coordinates that they're at.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.140
So for example,
Beacons do a good job

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.806
of figuring out whether or not a
particular individual is inside

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.940
of a room or outside
of a room, which

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.280
is valuable context that certain
applications can take advantage

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.780
of.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.310
So these are two
ways that Beacons

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.268
are a little different
from other localizations

00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:39.300
technologies.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.170
HOI LAM: Cool, are there
any live questions?

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.910
If not, I will ask
some of the questions

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.660
that I've actually
got from the internet.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.820
So you can actually see these
on my G+ and twitter account.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.170
So the first question
is, how many of my users

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.560
will be able to use Beacons?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.820
What android, iOS,
and chrome versions

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.870
do we need for the
users to use it?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.290
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Sure, so I know

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.475
that we've been
actually supporting

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:07.860
Bluetooth low energy.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.070
So just to give you guys
a little bit of context,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.120
so Beacons actually work
on Bluetooth low energy.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.700
Right, so I'm going to
refer to that as BLE.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.670
So we've actually had support
for a BLE in android since 4.3,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.140
which is Jelly Bean MR2.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.350
And so that population, if you
look at it from then till now,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.830
so we have 1.4 billion Android
devices which are there

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.100
in the public
today, and about 73%

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.770
of all those different
devices are actually

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.990
capable of working
directly with BLE.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.900
And so, from the iOS side,
so let's see, so in iOS ,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.070
if you have an
iPhone 4s or above,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.930
and then also an iPad third
generation or earlier,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.307
or later, it can actually
work directly with Beacons.

00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:58.710
HOI LAM: Cool, physical web?

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.600
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Yeah,
so specifically

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.800
for the physical web,
and Google chrome support

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.860
of the physical web,
we are supported

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.984
on an iOS as of Chrome 45,
which launched in mid July.

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:10.400
So if you're on the latest
version of Chrome on an iPhone,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.660
you'd be able to use it.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.300
On Android, we're coming soon.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.260
But hopefully by the
end of the quarter,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.320
be able to start using it there.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.345
HOI LAM: That's a great
cross platform stories.

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:21.767
I launch on iOS first.

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:22.267
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:24.683
We've got a live question.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:26.910
AUDIENCE: What about desktop?

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.077
HOI LAM: What about desktop?

00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:30.118
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Specifically
for the physical web?

00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:30.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.490
ANIRUDH MOHAN: We're very
focused on the mobile use case,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.150
in particular.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.810
We think that's where
Beacons make a lot of sense.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.910
As users sort of interact
with the physical world,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.000
and can discover URLs
in various locations,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.290
so we're prioritizing
mobile for now.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.211
In the future, it
might make sense for us

00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:47.210
to evolve in the desktop,
but it's currently not

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.770
in our plans.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.100
HOI LAM: All right, another
question from the internet

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.310
is, this particular
developer is considering

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.525
using Beacons for
positioning, so just

00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.150
kind of deploy a
whole bunch of Beacons

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.850
and do very precise
positioning within a room.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.539
What do you think about that?

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.080
ANIRUDH MOHAN: So
as I mentioned when

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.690
describing sort of where Beacons
are particularly valuable,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.231
one of the points
I was talking about

00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:12.190
was how it provides
very good context

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.370
as to where a user might be.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.450
And this is sort of
the use case that we

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.600
like to encourage with
a Beacon deployment.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.530
Because of the way that you
can track where a user is

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.260
from a Beacon using
RSSI values that

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.170
are very variable in different
indoor locations based

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.960
on the material of
the environment,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.570
based on how many individuals
are inside the room,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.170
we don't think Beacons are
a very great technology

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.520
for figuring out precisely
the coordinates of a user

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.819
in a location, but
where it is useful

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.360
is figuring out
whether or not a user

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.010
is within a certain region.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.120
So we tend to encourage
context based applications

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.990
rather than localization
based applications.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.740
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Some
of the other things

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.920
I think that we can also
do is using like the places

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.020
API, which is there.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.550
So that allows you to
have a level of context

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.400
of like what is the
lat what is the long,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.320
and then also are
you indoors, or are

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.650
you in a particular region.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.172
So that helps to also provide
a little bit better precision.

00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:04.420
HOI LAM: Cool.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.150
And other questions
that we get is,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.794
because we do have multiple
frame types within Eddystone,

00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:11.710
what's the best practice
in terms of combining

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.514
those different types?

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:15.430
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure,
so I'll take that one.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.590
So we currently have three
different frame formats, right?

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.830
So there's UID, URL, and TLM.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.657
So with TLM, specifically
with telemetry, this kind of

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:27.740
gives us a little bit more
of that differentiator.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.220
And so we actually
recommend and we actually

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.539
encourage you to be able to
have the Eddystone UID as well

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.350
as TLM frame, and then being
able to actually transmit those

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.630
together in parallel.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.169
For something else, also
like with telemetry,

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.880
the benefit is, if you are in,
let's say, a very local region,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.870
one that may be a
little bit more remote,

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.030
you might want to actually
broadcast your TLM

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.200
packet a little bit
more frequently as well,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.224
so it's able to be
picked up easier.

00:08:56.224 --> 00:08:57.640
ANIRUDH MOHAN: We
call the process

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.090
of concurrent broadcasting
sort of interleaving.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.630
And one of the nice things
is, if configured properly,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.779
interleaving actually does
not hurt the performance

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:05.820
of the Beacon deployment.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.160
It's very minimal in terms
of its power consumption.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.055
So it's a great way of
sort of broadcasting

00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:13.180
all the different frame
types that a deployer might

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.506
want to without
sacrificing performance.

00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:17.966
HOI LAM: Live question.

00:09:17.966 --> 00:09:20.406
AUDIENCE: So
yesterday, some of us

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:23.975
saw the Project Tango demo,
which was really amazing.

00:09:23.975 --> 00:09:27.871
And I was kind of could
we pair that with Beacon

00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:33.237
somehow to really help people
who have vision impairment be

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:36.394
able to navigate room,
be able to figure out

00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:38.512
where something is in a room.

00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:39.470
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.200
Yeah, go ahead.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.950
HOI LAM: Let me just
repeat that question.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.485
So yesterday we saw the
demo from Project Tango.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.260
What are different ways and we
can combine that with Beacon

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.620
to enable people that might
have visual impairment,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.285
in this case, to help
them navigate around?

00:10:00.377 --> 00:10:01.960
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
You want to jump in?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.125
ANIRUDH MOHAN: I was going to
let you talk about wayfinder.

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:04.583
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Sure, no problem.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:06.890
Yeah, so let me talk about
wayfinder for like a minute.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.860
So wayfinder is an
open standard that

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.410
google.org, which is like our
philanthropic arm at Google,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.250
they actually gave
them $1 million.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.540
So this happened in December.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.250
And so the concept
is, in London,

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.369
if you're going through the
Tube, if you're going between,

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:24.910
let's say, the Piccadilly line
to, let's say, somewhere else.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.790
For people like us who have
the ability to be able to see,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.540
it's really easy, right?

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.100
It's much easier
than for someone

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.760
who's visually impaired.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.140
But what we're actually
looking at and actually doing

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.950
is seeing how can
you get from point A

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.170
to point B if you're
visually impaired,

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.140
and can Beacons actually help
guide that experience and make

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.440
that possible, right?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.420
So will it actually say, OK go
down this particular tunnel,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.629
take a right, go up the
stairs, and so on and so forth.

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.920
And so those are the kind of
things that we're actually

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.790
looking into, and seeing how we
can actually help accessibility

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.665
based features, and try
to move those forward

00:10:59.665 --> 00:11:01.006
as well in the stack.

00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:03.130
I think it's a really
interesting idea with Project

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.700
Tango.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.210
And it's not something that
we've actually looked at today,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.690
but it gives us some
ideas on where we actually

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.510
could move forward.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.052
So thank you for
that recommendation.

00:11:11.052 --> 00:11:12.468
ANIRUDH MOHAN:
We're also chatting

00:11:12.468 --> 00:11:14.140
with folks at the
Beacon office hours

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.900
earlier today about
other potential sort

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.567
of Tango-Beacon integrations.

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:19.650
And someone brought up the
really interesting idea

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.620
of using a Tango mapped spatial
location to sort of queue

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.190
what ideal deployments
could look like in a room.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.702
For example, if you were able
to map a room with Tango,

00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:30.160
could you then use
that information

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.440
to figure out where
you could optimally

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.824
place Beacons to cover the
entire environment, sort

00:11:35.824 --> 00:11:37.490
of what sort of signal
strength that you

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.000
need to put those Beacons at
in order to blanket the room.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.090
So there's other sort of
applications with Tango

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.590
too that we haven't
looked into yet,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.708
but certainly I think
the door is open.

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:50.010
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Think
we have a question.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.125
HOI LAM: Over there.

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:53.291
AUDIENCE: Does the rest of
the platform [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.708
HOI LAM: So the question there
is, does the proximity Beacon

00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:05.640
API or nearby work with
other types of Beacons

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.912
that are not Eddystone?

00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:09.620
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Yeah, so we're actually

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.620
focused right now on Eddystone.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.550
Primarily because
that is what we're

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.150
doubling down our efforts on.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.560
So I think a lot of
our time and effort

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.150
is going to be focused on
Eddystone in the next upcoming

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.250
months and year.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.790
And we think that, by
keeping it open and kind

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.840
of like that concept on GitHub
where anyone can actually

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.890
commit to it and we can
make the platform better,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.510
that's our vision
for how we're going

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.615
to be able to scale our
efforts moving forward.

00:12:34.615 --> 00:12:36.390
HOI LAM: Yeah and
just add to that, I

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.610
think with the proximity
Beacon API you can

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.130
register a lot of Beacon types.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.320
But as we said earlier,
with Eddystone, you

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.290
get the telemetry frame and
you get the URL frame we're

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.560
hoping that developers will look
at that and say, wow you know,

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.040
all that extra functionality
is really useful to me.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.230
And as a result, they would
choose Eddystone maybe even

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.272
on it's own merits
on that front.

00:13:02.272 --> 00:13:03.980
ANIRUDH MOHAN: The
only thing I would add

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.480
is that, for a given
Beacon deployment,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.370
Eddystone isn't mutually
exclusive with a different type

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.770
of sort of Beacon format.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.940
So developers can,
on the same Beacon,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.212
deploy multiple different
types of formats.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.295
AUDIENCE: I guess my
question is more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.180
HOI LAM: Yeah, so
the sort of context

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.560
there was, for existing
deployed to Beacon already,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.820
can they utilize some
of the cloud service.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.430
So the answer is yes, you
can register those Beacons

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.090
with the proximity Beacon API.

00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:44.777
OK, anything else?

00:13:44.777 --> 00:13:46.010
Well, I'll go down the list.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.820
So there is also
another question about,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.370
because we have 18
partners already,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.000
many producing multiple
models of Beacon,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.010
is there an easy way to
kind of look at the specs

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.680
and what differences
would there be

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.217
from choosing kind of one
manufacturer over another one?

00:14:06.217 --> 00:14:08.800
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah I think,
so the concept is this, right?

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.520
So because Eddystone is so
open, we have 18 partners today.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.510
So if you go to g.co/Beacons,
you can actually take a look

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.030
at all the different
partners which are there.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.930
And I think the benefit,
and kind of like the reason

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.440
why we even have
this open platform,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.700
is so we have multiple different
OEM's that can actually

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.620
work with us as Google.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.300
And then each and every
single different partner

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.670
has their own strengths, right?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.250
And so they have
different services

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.370
that you all can
choose from, and that's

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.170
kind of like the benefits
of actually using

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.800
Eddystone in general.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.570
We are working very strongly
with all the different OEM's

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.600
to make provisioning easier, as
well as registration directly

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.200
through our
Proximity Beacon API,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.820
and then also directly with our
back end, with our services.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.450
So the Google Beacon platform
is very much so focused

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.540
on seeing how we can get a
lot easier for developers

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.470
to start using it
from the ground up.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.882
And so look for that in
the next upcoming quarters.

00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:07.590
ANIRUDH MOHAN: And
it's important to note

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.230
that, when we say partners,
we don't necessarily

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.630
mean that these
are the vendors who

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.170
we encourage developers to use.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.780
These are just
ones that have met

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.390
the proper sort of Eddystone
certification process, that

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.800
are faithfully reproducing the
spec that we have on GitHub.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.400
Beyond that, as Ninu
mentioned, they all

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.516
have different points
of differentiation,

00:15:28.516 --> 00:15:30.140
and it's up to the
individual developer

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.350
to decide which one
they'd like to use.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.965
HOI LAM: And just to
add to that answer,

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:39.202
another thing is, the
strength of those 18

00:15:39.202 --> 00:15:42.230
partners and the
ecosystem that we have is,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.090
depending on your
use case, you might

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.830
want to choose different
types of Beacon.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.880
So you know, if you have
a mains power readily

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.110
available within the room
that you want to deploy,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.210
you might just want to plug
a Beacon into that socket.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.550
And as a result, you don't
need to worry about replacing

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.680
or the battery power at all.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.180
Or alternatively,
if you're thinking

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.390
about really possible use
case, and you want the smallest

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.685
possible Beacon, we
also have some partners

00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:09.160
that produce kind of coin
sized Beacons as well.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.804
So you can choose
kind of whatever that

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:15.730
suits your particular use case.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.500
Anything?

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.880
Nope, cool.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.830
So, going down.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.820
So for the physical web, what
would the experience be like?

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.150
I guess it's for the
people that was not

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.400
in Scott's presentation.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.870
And I've got a slide
that might help.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.490
Ani--

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:30.770
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Sure.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.650
HOI LAM: You run through that.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.320
ANIRUDH MOHAN: So
some of you folks who

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.270
were in the room for a
Scott Jenson's presentation

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.950
might have already seen
this, but this is just

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.491
sort of an overview of what the
physical web experience looks

00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:42.170
like today on iOS and Android.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.830
So on iOS, for anyone
who has an iPhone,

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.130
you know, feel free to
start playing with this now.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.440
But the main sort of
surface for interaction

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.820
for the physical web is
through the Today view,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.620
which is a concept that
iOS introduced, I believe,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.420
a couple releases ago
that's effectively Apple's

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.890
interpretation of widgets.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.480
And so Chrome has a Today view
widget that users can add.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.180
And whenever you're
around a Beacon,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.656
you can opt into the
physical web contextually.

00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:10.280
And then in the
future, whenever you're

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.210
around Beacons that
are broadcasting URLs,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.280
you'll be able to see
those lists of URLs

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.619
when you go to this
dedicated Today view.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.880
On Android, the story is
a little bit different,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.740
because we can have a little
bit more flexibility in the way

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.619
that we do notification
management.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.030
And so the main sort of mode
of interaction on Android

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.569
is a low priority
notification, which

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:32.860
is a notification that's
delivered to the user's device

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.470
without buzzing or
vibrating the phone.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.645
So it still appears sort of in
the standard notification tray.

00:17:38.645 --> 00:17:40.020
When the user
swipes down, they'd

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.820
be able to see the low priority
notification on the bottom,

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.600
but without it interrupting
the users workflow.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.750
So this is our way
of allowing users

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.040
to always go to a persistent UI
surface that has physical web

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.380
URL's available there if
they're around a Beacon

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.480
without interrupting their work.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.240
So whenever you're
around a Beacon,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.960
be able to swipe down, see
this notification, tap on it,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.779
and see the list
of nearby websites.

00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:05.320
And when you're not
around to Beacon,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.256
the notification just
clears itself away.

00:18:07.256 --> 00:18:09.630
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: And I think
the awesome part about this

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.760
is, you don't even have
to have an app installed.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:11.990
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Right.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.190
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Like
it's directly there

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.148
with the experience and
you can deploy content.

00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:16.400
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Yeah, right.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.632
You just need Chrome, as a user.

00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:20.650
HOI LAM: Cool.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.620
Next can you talk a little
bit about the telemetry frame,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.240
and you know how that helps
the developers on maintenance.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.630
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure, yeah,
so I had actually mentioned

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.220
this a little bit earlier.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.590
But with telemetry,
what we actually

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.350
do as Ani had also pointed
out about interleaving,

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.210
we actually say that you should
have a Eddystone UID as well

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.600
as TLM frame together.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.900
And so interleaving those two
is kind of the recommendation

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.500
that we have.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.525
Further, some of the
things that we can do today

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:52.150
within the platform in terms of
surfacing through the Proximity

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.160
Beacon API is if you
have a set of Beacons,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.800
and then you want to know
what the actual health is

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.420
of that Beacon,
is it about to die

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.680
or what not, we can actually
provide an alert for that

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.330
and actually tell you yes
your Beacon is about to die,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.460
you may want to go out and
actually change battery.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.650
And then, in general, it's
kind of like we're really

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.260
focused on making sure
that those Beacons which

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.450
are positioned and when
you actually deployed,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.140
them are exactly
where you get them.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.100
So let's say that you have
deployed a set of Beacons,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.350
and that someone came and
then just ripped it off

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.520
or something happened
where it's actually moved.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.490
We can actually provide
an alert also saying

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.985
that a Beacon is moved as well.

00:19:31.985 --> 00:19:33.610
So those are some of
the things that we

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.220
can do with telemetry today.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.720
AUDIENCE: So is there reported
to just random people walking

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.220
by, or?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.636
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah so think
about it like this, right.

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.990
So if you have an app,
and so in your app,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.020
if you have the nearby
API, then the nearby API

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.110
would then be able to
take TLM based packets

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.987
and then send that directly
to the Google Beacon platform.

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:54.570
And so through there,
we can basically

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.930
be able to determine and
then provide those alerts

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.780
accordingly to your apps.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.530
HOI LAM: Question.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what are the
conditions for using the Google

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.530
Beacon platform?

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.356
Is there like a
[INAUDIBLE] if you

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:09.440
go above a certain number of
Beacons, it's paid for, or?

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.182
HOI LAM: So the question there
is, what are the conditions,

00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:14.640
and are there any charges using
the Google Beacon platform?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.460
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So the Google
Beacon platform today is there.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.710
So we have our developer
terms of service.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.880
So when you actually sign up
for a Google Developer Console

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.740
account, you have to
basically go accordingly

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.990
to RTOS from there.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.920
And then everything
is free for the public

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.750
to be able to go out and
use as long as you've

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.880
accepted the agreement.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.380
And then you move
forward from there

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.707
with your actual deployments
and attachment data.

00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:42.040
ANIRUDH MOHAN: And the same
is true for the physical web

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.900
as well.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.800
There's no cost.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.460
All you have to do is
point to Beacon to a URL.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.190
HOI LAM: Cool.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.400
Are there areas of
developer experience

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.641
that you guys want to improve?

00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:56.890
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah, I
would say the first thing is

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.830
provisioning an app.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.370
And then being--
sorry, excuse me.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.870
Provisioning a
Beacon directly so

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.980
that it works uniformly and
seamlessly within your app.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.646
We're working really strongly
with all the different OEM's

00:21:07.646 --> 00:21:08.480
on that.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.030
And registration
is also something

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.070
that we're looking at,
trying to improve also

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.550
to make that a much more
seamless behind the scenes.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.050
ANIRUDH MOHAN: For
larger developers

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.716
who might be deploying
a lot of Beacons,

00:21:17.716 --> 00:21:19.590
we want to do a better
job of helping them

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.970
be able to do fleet management.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.820
So remotely update
those Beacons,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.830
manage the Beacons sort
of status and health.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.389
Ninu mentioned the
telemetry frame.

00:21:27.389 --> 00:21:28.930
We ran a lot of
experiments last year

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.910
with larger deployments that
leverage the telemetry frame.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.860
So we hope to use some
of those learnings

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.440
this year in helping some of
our larger deployments out.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.540
And finally, I'd say we want to
improve the scanning experience

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.739
on the nearby API's.

00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:43.280
That's something
that we always think

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.280
we can do a better job of but
from a performance standpoint,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.670
in terms of not using sort of
the user's device irresponsibly

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.390
to do scans and also from
a reliability standpoint,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.379
making sure that we show nearby
Beacons as often as possible.

00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:58.170
And that's something
that we're continually

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.131
investing in that we want
to improve this year.

00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:02.630
HOI LAM: Actually question for
the audience, how many of you

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.260
have actually developed on
the Google Beacon platform?

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.650
Couple of you.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.550
OK, are there any
things that you find

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:16.775
could be useful for
your own development?

00:22:16.775 --> 00:22:18.691
Anything?

00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:19.222
Nope.

00:22:19.222 --> 00:22:20.930
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Oh
wow, you guys have--

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.096
ANIRUDH MOHAN: It's perfect.

00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:23.054
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:23.054 --> 00:22:24.720
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: No
changes whatsoever.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.050
Everything works great.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:25.493
HOI LAM: You guys are fired.

00:22:25.493 --> 00:22:26.240
ANIRUDH MOHAN: We're done.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:26.540
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.345
HOI LAM: You guys are done.

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.249
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: We've
officially launched

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:30.290
successful products then.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.100
ANIRUDH MOHAN:
Let's just go home.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.660
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Yeah, we're done.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.284
No more road maps

00:22:34.284 --> 00:22:35.075
HOI LAM: Excellent.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.460
So, how much time do we have?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.779
Five minutes, cool, are
there any live questions?

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:43.820
Ah one there, over there.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.736
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.270
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah, I'm
can share with you-- yeah sure.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.728
You want to ask
the question again?

00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:58.060
HOI LAM: The sort of question
there is whether we have a road

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.049
map of what is coming up next.

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:02.340
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure, what
I can share with you today

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.840
is we're very much still
focused on first party base

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.630
integrations.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.210
So the products for
example like Google Now,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.930
et cetera, we can't really
talk too much in that,

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.700
but I will tell you that
focusing all of our efforts

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.570
directly within our
first party products

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.210
is very important to us.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.260
Where we're strategically
positioning the entire

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.590
Eddystone spec to make
sure that it works very

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.532
seamlessly behind the scenes.

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:29.740
And so being able to have
those integrations in place

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.700
are kind of what the entire
team are focusing on today.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.830
So look for that in
the upcoming quarters,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.274
and that's kind of what
I have to share today.

00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:40.940
ANIRUDH MOHAN: On the
physical web side,

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.810
we're focused on two main things
over the next couple quarters.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.590
One is strengthening our
cross-platform story,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.030
so really investing in
our Android release.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.920
That'll be coming
up this quarter.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.860
And the second is continuing
to improve our ranking service.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.500
Today in today's
world, there aren't

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.420
too many Beacons out there so
ranking isn't a huge problem

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.930
beyond making sure that we serve
high quality spam free results.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.080
Over time, as we invest
in larger deployments,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.750
we're expecting users to
discover lots of Beacons

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.680
out in the wild.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.560
In which case, ranking
becomes increasingly

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.150
important to make sure that
we surface the most relevant,

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.420
the most useful results
first to the user.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.356
So we want to continue
to invest there.

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.230
We talked about all this
stuff on our GitHub,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.670
and we invite you guys to sort
of join the conversation if you

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.110
feel like there's
things you think

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.610
we should be improving
to, and we'll

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.362
do our best to respond quickly.

00:24:28.362 --> 00:24:30.070
HOI LAM: There's one
question over there.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.028
AUDIENCE: You guys sort
of answered my question

00:24:32.028 --> 00:24:36.350
about the bandwidth
issue, but I was wondering

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.770
have you developed any
techniques on the installation

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.190
that you can recommend
or learn from

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.030
to avoid, say, interference
when you install it [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.997
Anything useful
like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:49.997 --> 00:24:52.330
ANIRUDH MOHAN: I missed the
first part of your question,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.110
but I'm--

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.440
HOI LAM: So is the
question of best practice

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.570
in terms of physical
deployments of Beacons?

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.850
AUDIENCE: Installing
them to avoid vandalism

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.280
but not affecting the signal.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.520
HOI LAM: Yeah, so
the question there

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.530
is what are the best
practices in terms

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.550
of sticking the Beacons
up and preventing them

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.595
from being vandalized.

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:11.470
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Yeah we
find it hard typically

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.810
to provide generic
advice, because it's

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.510
so dependent on the room
and the physical location

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.500
that you're in, the
materials in the room,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.230
the number of people that
tend to be in the room.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.230
Because all these things
affect the interference

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.330
of the waves emitted
by the Beacons.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.060
But general sort of trends that
we've observed, placing them

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.790
higher rather than
lower prevents vandalism

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.410
while also providing sort of
a more direct line of sight

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.440
to the user's device to decrease
the likelihood of path loss.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.864
That tends to be something
that works better.

00:25:41.864 --> 00:25:43.280
Other attributes
that are generic,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.512
I'm trying to think of
off the top of my head.

00:25:45.512 --> 00:25:46.220
HOI LAM: So you--

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.200
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Try not to make sure

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.750
that there are any
obstructions which

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.250
are basically in the path
of the Beacon to the user.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.450
That's probably the biggest one.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.150
HOI LAM: Yeah, and also,
this is a tip from Scott,

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.670
he said, basically,
buy the strongest glue

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.020
that you can buy on the market.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.930
You would not believe
how many Beacons just

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.060
fall off on their own.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.998
And so that's one
top tip, there.

00:26:08.998 --> 00:26:10.956
AUDIENCE: So duct tape
wouldn't be recommended.

00:26:10.956 --> 00:26:13.564
No.

00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:14.980
HOI LAM: Directly
from the source.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.060
Scott say no.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.680
ANIRUDH MOHAN: And
also when in doubt,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.247
tend towards decreasing the
signal strength of the Beacon

00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:23.580
rather than increasing, because
these things have a much

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.871
bigger range than you'd expect.

00:26:24.871 --> 00:26:28.880
And in certain applications, you
wouldn't want a certain Beacon

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.470
to be discoverable from a
far away or adjacent room.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.072
And so smaller signal
strength tends to help that.

00:26:35.072 --> 00:26:36.346
AUDIENCE: What about glass?

00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:39.130
Does glass affect
the signal much?

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.620
HOI LAM: So the
question there is

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.240
how does glass impact a signal?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.000
What we find in the London
office is they pass straight

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.220
through, so increases
the range significantly.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:55.605
Question?

00:26:55.605 --> 00:26:58.230
AUDIENCE: At this point in time,
how many people are connected,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.144
or interacting with a
particular [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:01.144 --> 00:27:04.209
How do you get that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:06.250
HOI LAM: So the question
here is, how many people

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.390
are interacting with Beacons
through the Google Beacon

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.890
platform?

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.348
AUDIENCE: For
example, in this room

00:27:11.348 --> 00:27:18.033
you've got [INAUDIBLE]
that's there for a number

00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:21.585
to see how many people
are there, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:25.384 --> 00:27:27.300
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Do you
want to restate that?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.133
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Sure.

00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:29.837
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Sure, go ahead.

00:27:29.837 --> 00:27:31.670
HOI LAM: So there's two
sides to that story.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.570
I know that us
developers, we want

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.550
as much numbers and analytics
as we want or as we could

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.510
in terms of how many people
are seeing those Beacons.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.740
So that the two sides
to that answer is, one

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.340
we want to protect
the users' privacy.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.330
So in Scott's
presentation he said

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.870
that the developers
themselves would not

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.930
be able to see which
user can see their link

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.140
but not click on the
link in a physical web

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.226
to purely just protect privacy.

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:08.260
And it's a similar story
with application as well.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.600
So when the application is
interacting with your app,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.920
that you can write your
own analytics code and say,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:19.290
oh this person opt in to use
the nearby functionality,

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.200
and they see these
three Beacons.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.500
So you can collect those
kind of information, but only

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.840
with the user's permission.

00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:31.770
AUDIENCE: So it's
more [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.207 --> 00:28:37.760
HOI LAM: So the
follow up question

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.880
there is it's within
the app design

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.640
rather than within
the framework.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.950
Yes, so it is within
your app that you

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.150
can collect the information
if the user give you

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.529
the permission.

00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:51.070
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: I think the
one thing I would really stress

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.020
is that, in Eddystone, we're
very focused on user privacy as

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.810
well as security.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.010
So please keep that in mind
when you're building your apps.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.869
Try to use the best practices
that we've set forth.

00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:03.160
And I think that's something
that keep in mind as well,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.170
to be able to establish that
user trust, keep it intact,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.112
and not infringe upon
that on the user.

00:29:09.112 --> 00:29:11.070
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
more from [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.210
HOI LAM: So the question
there, the follow up

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.680
question there is whether
there could be a background

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.040
service that could be
run in order to say which

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.320
part of store, which
part of the location

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:43.289
is most frequent by customers,
let's say, in that use case.

00:29:43.289 --> 00:29:44.830
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Yeah I think that's

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.980
a lot of those kind of
special kind of like needs

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.650
that you would want to have for
your app would be done directly

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.060
direct within your
app framework itself,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.876
and whatever it is that you'd
be building a proprietary.

00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:57.500
ANIRUDH MOHAN: So a
developer can still

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.989
ultimately log the
end user interaction

00:29:59.989 --> 00:30:01.280
that's facilitated by a Beacon.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.155
If they tap on a link,
if they take an action

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:05.290
that the Beacon sort of
supports, but not the

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.224
scan itself.

00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:08.890
HOI LAM: Basically
you need to, I guess,

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.280
give some value back
to the user and explain

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.240
why you would need that.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.610
Because the user it we need
to click on that permission

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:21.110
dialogue and say, yeah, I will
allow this app to track me.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.630
So yeah, think about the perhaps
the user value side of things

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.190
as well.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.450
ANIRUDH MOHAN: It's important to
keep in mind that the days are

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.500
still sort of early for
the Beacon ecosystem

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.160
and when we talk to
users about Beacon,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.910
one of the foremost
concerns on their mind

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.150
is sort of privacy
and being logged.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.660
And so we want to be especially
cognizant of making sure

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.660
that we're being
responsible about collecting

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.240
the minimum amount
of data possible,

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.120
if anything, in these
deployments while also

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.980
providing value.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.170
HOI LAM: Maybe time for one
more question if there is one.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.637
No, OK, you guys have done well.

00:30:54.637 --> 00:30:55.470
Thank you very much.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.000
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Thank you.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.333
ANIRUDH MOHAN: Great, thank you.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.918
