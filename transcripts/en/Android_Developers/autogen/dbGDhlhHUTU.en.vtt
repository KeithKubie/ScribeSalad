good afternoon everyone and welcome to
 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.440
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
this week's episode of the app clinic

this week's episode of the app clinic
 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.240
this week's episode of the app clinic
this week we are looking at sleep

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
this week we are looking at sleep
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.779
this week we are looking at sleep
monitoring and recording at my regular

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
monitoring and recording at my regular
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.929

colleague in Neil Lewis has been hard at

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
colleague in Neil Lewis has been hard at
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.660
colleague in Neil Lewis has been hard at
work testing these out and unfortunately

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
work testing these out and unfortunately
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939
work testing these out and unfortunately
that means he is currently sleeping so

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
that means he is currently sleeping so
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890
that means he is currently sleeping so
we're gonna hopefully get some of his

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
we're gonna hopefully get some of his
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.509
we're gonna hopefully get some of his
input on some of these apps a little

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
input on some of these apps a little
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.120
input on some of these apps a little
later in the program if he's able to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
later in the program if he's able to
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.180
later in the program if he's able to
arouse himself from sleep and and get

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
arouse himself from sleep and and get
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770
arouse himself from sleep and and get
them give us some of his insight now

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
them give us some of his insight now
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290
them give us some of his insight now
that's just how important we take our

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
that's just how important we take our
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.060
that's just how important we take our
jobs here at the app clinic we're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
jobs here at the app clinic we're
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.650
jobs here at the app clinic we're
willing to sleep during the day on a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
willing to sleep during the day on a
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.830
willing to sleep during the day on a
Friday just so that we can give these

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
Friday just so that we can give these
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170
Friday just so that we can give these
apps the appropriate attention that they

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
apps the appropriate attention that they
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540
apps the appropriate attention that they
deserve so we're going to look at three

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
deserve so we're going to look at three
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.889
deserve so we're going to look at three
apps today they are asleep as androids

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
apps today they are asleep as androids
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.979
apps today they are asleep as androids
circle alarm and sleep recorder and they

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
circle alarm and sleep recorder and they
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930
circle alarm and sleep recorder and they
all basically are designed to do the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
all basically are designed to do the
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490
all basically are designed to do the
same thing so they're designed to help

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
same thing so they're designed to help
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049
same thing so they're designed to help
you get a good night's sleep

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
you get a good night's sleep
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329
you get a good night's sleep
now certainly the first and last of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
now certainly the first and last of
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.440
now certainly the first and last of
these two which we're going to look at

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
these two which we're going to look at
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240
these two which we're going to look at
it designed specifically as sort of your

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
it designed specifically as sort of your
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270
it designed specifically as sort of your
own private sleep study you you get the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
own private sleep study you you get the
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.830
own private sleep study you you get the
device you put it on your bed and it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
device you put it on your bed and it
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140
device you put it on your bed and it
measures vibrations using the sensors to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
measures vibrations using the sensors to
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700
measures vibrations using the sensors to
see how good a night's sleep you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
see how good a night's sleep you're
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.870
see how good a night's sleep you're
getting whether you're twisting and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
getting whether you're twisting and
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670
getting whether you're twisting and
turning moving around or whether you're

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
turning moving around or whether you're
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.210
turning moving around or whether you're
just lying there in a comatose bliss the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
just lying there in a comatose bliss the
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070
just lying there in a comatose bliss the
middle app a circle alarm is a little

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
middle app a circle alarm is a little
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899
middle app a circle alarm is a little
bit different it's actually a an alarm

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
bit different it's actually a an alarm
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090
bit different it's actually a an alarm
clock essentially which we looked at

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
clock essentially which we looked at
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.800
clock essentially which we looked at
these little while back I was still the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
these little while back I was still the
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.370
these little while back I was still the
third highest rated app in the category

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
third highest rated app in the category
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630
third highest rated app in the category
this week so we are going to take a look

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
this week so we are going to take a look
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.039
this week so we are going to take a look
but it is a little bit different from

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
but it is a little bit different from
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.240
but it is a little bit different from
the other two we're going to spend a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
the other two we're going to spend a
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.420
the other two we're going to spend a
little bit more time on those apps

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
 
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.650
 
so getting started what do we really

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660
so getting started what do we really
 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.540
so getting started what do we really
want from these sorts of apps so what it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550
want from these sorts of apps so what it
 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.880
want from these sorts of apps so what it
really comes down to is we're looking

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
really comes down to is we're looking
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.220
really comes down to is we're looking
for something which is really easy to

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230
for something which is really easy to
 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.730
for something which is really easy to
use sorry about that my poll that's all

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
use sorry about that my poll that's all
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380
use sorry about that my poll that's all
right it's always fun to have moving

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
right it's always fun to have moving
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870
right it's always fun to have moving
things uh-huh now it says profile a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
things uh-huh now it says profile a
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270
things uh-huh now it says profile a
device profile wish list at the top it's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
device profile wish list at the top it's
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400
device profile wish list at the top it's
not it's actually the sleep monitoring

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
not it's actually the sleep monitoring
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.999
not it's actually the sleep monitoring
wish list

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
wish list
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400
wish list
that's my lack of preparation getting in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
that's my lack of preparation getting in
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.230
that's my lack of preparation getting in
the way there but really what I want is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
the way there but really what I want is
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610
the way there but really what I want is
something which I can startup and it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
something which I can startup and it
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620
something which I can startup and it
doesn't take a lot of effort I think you

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
doesn't take a lot of effort I think you
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510
doesn't take a lot of effort I think you
can get a lot of the requirements for an

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
can get a lot of the requirements for an
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.730
can get a lot of the requirements for an
app like this which is basically it's a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740
app like this which is basically it's a
 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170
app like this which is basically it's a
tracking app in this instance it's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
tracking app in this instance it's
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.130
tracking app in this instance it's
tracking your sleep

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
tracking your sleep
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.250
tracking your sleep
but a lot of the same learnings and sort

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
but a lot of the same learnings and sort
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380
but a lot of the same learnings and sort
of optimizations are going to be very

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
of optimizations are going to be very
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.610
of optimizations are going to be very
similar to what we've looked at a few

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
similar to what we've looked at a few
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.780
similar to what we've looked at a few
weeks ago when we were looking at

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
weeks ago when we were looking at
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.540
weeks ago when we were looking at
Fitness tracking apps so like those apps

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550
Fitness tracking apps so like those apps
 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.060
Fitness tracking apps so like those apps
like endomondo RunKeeper runtastic you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
like endomondo RunKeeper runtastic you
 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.740
like endomondo RunKeeper runtastic you
want something that's relatively easy to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
want something that's relatively easy to
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.210
want something that's relatively easy to
get going which doesn't take a lot of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
get going which doesn't take a lot of
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.150
get going which doesn't take a lot of
attention but then has rich analytics

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
attention but then has rich analytics
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.380
attention but then has rich analytics
once you've used it so that you're able

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
once you've used it so that you're able
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.750
once you've used it so that you're able
to sort of get started record things

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
to sort of get started record things
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.820
to sort of get started record things
really easily and then spend your time

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
really easily and then spend your time
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.360
really easily and then spend your time
analyzing the results at your leisure so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
analyzing the results at your leisure so
 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.100
analyzing the results at your leisure so
the first app that we're going to take a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
the first app that we're going to take a
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.229
the first app that we're going to take a
look at today is sleep as Andrew and you

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
look at today is sleep as Andrew and you
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.509
look at today is sleep as Andrew and you
can see here they've got a feature

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
can see here they've got a feature
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.530
can see here they've got a feature
graphic whoops just skipped ahead of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
graphic whoops just skipped ahead of
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080
graphic whoops just skipped ahead of
myself they have a feature graphic here

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
myself they have a feature graphic here
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.620
myself they have a feature graphic here
which is along the right lines it's a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
which is along the right lines it's a
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.570
which is along the right lines it's a
little noisy and what they've done here

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580
little noisy and what they've done here
 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.490
little noisy and what they've done here
is they've done sort of a classic

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
is they've done sort of a classic
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.229
is they've done sort of a classic
mistake and they've used the feature

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
mistake and they've used the feature
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.900
mistake and they've used the feature
graphic as a place to put all of their

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910
graphic as a place to put all of their
 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.180
graphic as a place to put all of their
screenshots now there is a place for

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
screenshots now there is a place for
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.070
screenshots now there is a place for
screenshots on the landing page so you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080
screenshots on the landing page so you
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.570
screenshots on the landing page so you
don't need to put them into your feature

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580
don't need to put them into your feature
 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.940
don't need to put them into your feature
graphic now the big reason for not doing

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
graphic now the big reason for not doing
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.220
graphic now the big reason for not doing
that is that when this gets shrunk down

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
that is that when this gets shrunk down
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.350
that is that when this gets shrunk down
into a tiny size on a phone for one of

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
into a tiny size on a phone for one of
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.110
into a tiny size on a phone for one of
our smaller feature slots it's going to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120
our smaller feature slots it's going to
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.789

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.370
quite hollow it's not quite an action
bar and that's one of the things which I

bar and that's one of the things which I
 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.600

along the bottom the alignment isn't
 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.940
along the bottom the alignment isn't
quite right so they've got the overflow

you've got sort of the the pseudo action

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
you've got sort of the the pseudo action

which makes sense but it's also kind of

which makes sense but it's also kind of
redundant because I have the time on the

redundant because I have the time on the
 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.820
redundant because I have the time on the
top of my phone up here as well so it's

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830
top of my phone up here as well so it's
 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.090
top of my phone up here as well so it's
kind of like I'd rather see the overflow

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100
kind of like I'd rather see the overflow
 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.060

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630
where it should be where it kind of
 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.450
where it should be where it kind of
belongs on Android otherwise it just

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460
belongs on Android otherwise it just
 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.879
belongs on Android otherwise it just
makes it a bit confusing otherwise what

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889
makes it a bit confusing otherwise what
 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.260
makes it a bit confusing otherwise what
we've got here along the bottom is

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270
we've got here along the bottom is
 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.510
we've got here along the bottom is
effectively your tab so each of these

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520
effectively your tab so each of these
 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.790
effectively your tab so each of these
and again this is a little bit confusing

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
and again this is a little bit confusing
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.409
and again this is a little bit confusing
because we've combined the concepts of

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419
because we've combined the concepts of
 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.060
because we've combined the concepts of
an action with the concepts of

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070
an action with the concepts of
 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.330
an action with the concepts of
navigation so things like hitting the

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340
navigation so things like hitting the
 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.120
navigation so things like hitting the
moon button effectively puts you to

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130
moon button effectively puts you to
 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.400
moon button effectively puts you to
sleep so that's an action fair enough

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410
sleep so that's an action fair enough
 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.730
sleep so that's an action fair enough
hitting the the bar brings up the

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740
hitting the the bar brings up the
 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.070
hitting the the bar brings up the
activity for being able to monitor your

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080
activity for being able to monitor your
 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.320
activity for being able to monitor your
previous sleeps and so it gets a little

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330
previous sleeps and so it gets a little
 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.060
previous sleeps and so it gets a little
bit confusing because what's an action

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070
bit confusing because what's an action
 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.920
bit confusing because what's an action
what's a navigation it should be a

what's a navigation it should be a
 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.990
what's a navigation it should be a

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830
don't you want to make sure users know
 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.650
don't you want to make sure users know
what to expect whenever they're pressing

what to expect whenever they're pressing
 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.930

something that looks like an action bar

feedback we often have is that you're

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479
feedback we often have is that you're
 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.360
feedback we often have is that you're
not supposed to have tabs along the

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370
not supposed to have tabs along the
 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.790
not supposed to have tabs along the
bottom and I'm sure the the explanation

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
bottom and I'm sure the the explanation
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.320
bottom and I'm sure the the explanation
here is all they're not tabs right it's

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330
here is all they're not tabs right it's
 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.550
here is all they're not tabs right it's
an action bar you're allowed to have an

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560
an action bar you're allowed to have an
 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.260
an action bar you're allowed to have an
action bar along the bottom and it's

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270
action bar along the bottom and it's
 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.650
action bar along the bottom and it's
true you are but only as sort of the

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:55.660
true you are but only as sort of the
 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.510
true you are but only as sort of the
second half of a split action bar and we

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520
second half of a split action bar and we
 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.100
second half of a split action bar and we
don't have anything along the top here

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.110
don't have anything along the top here
 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.350
don't have anything along the top here
so I'd much rather like to see this

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360
so I'd much rather like to see this
 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.909
so I'd much rather like to see this
flipped around so that the action bar

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919
flipped around so that the action bar
 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.279
flipped around so that the action bar
sits on the top you've got navigation on

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:05.289
sits on the top you've got navigation on
 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:06.779
sits on the top you've got navigation on
the left you've got actions on the right

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:06.789
the left you've got actions on the right
 

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:08.580
the left you've got actions on the right
and it's a lot clearer as to exactly how

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:08.590
and it's a lot clearer as to exactly how
 

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.779
and it's a lot clearer as to exactly how
it all is supposed to work so here like

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:12.789
it all is supposed to work so here like
 

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:15.180
it all is supposed to work so here like
again we go through your hip you hit

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.190
again we go through your hip you hit
 

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.760
again we go through your hip you hit
plus it lets you set an alarm as to when

plus it lets you set an alarm as to when
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.950
plus it lets you set an alarm as to when
you want to wake up or you can just have

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960
you want to wake up or you can just have
 

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.610
you want to wake up or you can just have
a nap

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.620
a nap
 

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.300
a nap
which is nice and then so if we can I'm

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.310
which is nice and then so if we can I'm
 

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.320
which is nice and then so if we can I'm
not going to go into too much do

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.330
not going to go into too much do

not going to go into too much do
telling the UI in the interest of time

telling the UI in the interest of time
 

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:29.309
telling the UI in the interest of time
but kind of the key is here when you

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319
but kind of the key is here when you
 

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:33.300
but kind of the key is here when you
press the the Go button and it's going

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.310
press the the Go button and it's going
 

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.819
press the the Go button and it's going
to start recording my sleep and it's

00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:35.829
to start recording my sleep and it's
 

00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:37.290
to start recording my sleep and it's
going to use a variety of sensors in

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.300
going to use a variety of sensors in
 

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.550
going to use a variety of sensors in
order to do that and give me an

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560
order to do that and give me an
 

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.800
order to do that and give me an
indication of how good a night's sleep I

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:40.810
indication of how good a night's sleep I
 

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.130
indication of how good a night's sleep I
have which is nice you know that's

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.140
have which is nice you know that's
 

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.480
have which is nice you know that's
that's basically the whole purpose but

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.490
that's basically the whole purpose but
 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.819
that's basically the whole purpose but
what I think is kind of again confusing

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:47.829
what I think is kind of again confusing
 

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:50.069
what I think is kind of again confusing
here is that we have an overflow icon

00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:50.079
here is that we have an overflow icon
 

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:52.130
here is that we have an overflow icon
which I'm covering slightly where am I

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140
which I'm covering slightly where am I
 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.269
which I'm covering slightly where am I
so you've got this overflow icon and

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279
so you've got this overflow icon and
 

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:58.620
so you've got this overflow icon and
sort of unpredictable behavior so if I

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:58.630
sort of unpredictable behavior so if I
 

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.710
sort of unpredictable behavior so if I
click this it's going to bring up sort

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
click this it's going to bring up sort
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.009
click this it's going to bring up sort
of this contextual menu bar which is not

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:05.019
of this contextual menu bar which is not
 

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:06.329
of this contextual menu bar which is not
really what I'm expecting it's kind of a

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:06.339
really what I'm expecting it's kind of a
 

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:08.400
really what I'm expecting it's kind of a
dialog where I'm expecting a pop up

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.410
dialog where I'm expecting a pop up
 

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.569
dialog where I'm expecting a pop up
overflow menu this the things which

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:12.579
overflow menu this the things which
 

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:14.220
overflow menu this the things which
we've got here to set are all fair

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.230
we've got here to set are all fair
 

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.230
we've got here to set are all fair
enough it's just again though the way

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240
enough it's just again though the way
 

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.430
enough it's just again though the way
that it behaves and if we leave this

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440
that it behaves and if we leave this
 

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.780
that it behaves and if we leave this
screen long enough it'll all turn off

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:18.790
screen long enough it'll all turn off
 

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.360
screen long enough it'll all turn off
and go dark which again is nice you can

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.370
and go dark which again is nice you can
 

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.819
and go dark which again is nice you can
see here dimming screen touch or back to

00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:23.829
see here dimming screen touch or back to
 

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.610
see here dimming screen touch or back to
return and so this is good because it

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:26.620
return and so this is good because it
 

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.930
return and so this is good because it
means that the phone can stay on and if

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:27.940
means that the phone can stay on and if
 

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.460
means that the phone can stay on and if
it wants to use sensors it's going to

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:29.470
it wants to use sensors it's going to
 

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.370
it wants to use sensors it's going to
have to stay active while I'm asleep so

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.380
have to stay active while I'm asleep so
 

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.139
have to stay active while I'm asleep so
it's really important here that that it

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:34.149
it's really important here that that it
 

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:37.170
it's really important here that that it
does this which is which is nice we kept

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:37.180
does this which is which is nice we kept
 

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.939
does this which is which is nice we kept
back it automatically records everything

00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:38.949
back it automatically records everything
 

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:43.650
back it automatically records everything
which is good so otherwise it works well

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:43.660
which is good so otherwise it works well
 

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.660
which is good so otherwise it works well
it does does what it's intended to do

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:45.670
it does does what it's intended to do
 

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.730
it does does what it's intended to do
but I think really the key for this app

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:47.740
but I think really the key for this app
 

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.130
but I think really the key for this app
is all about tweaking the UI making the

is all about tweaking the UI making the

is all about tweaking the UI making the
navigation and the actions a little bit

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640
navigation and the actions a little bit
 

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.150
navigation and the actions a little bit
easier a little bit more obvious

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160
easier a little bit more obvious
 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.650
easier a little bit more obvious
otherwise great information around

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:55.660
otherwise great information around
 

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.610
otherwise great information around

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.620
statistics
 

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.350
statistics
well displayed as well I really like the

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360
well displayed as well I really like the
 

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.720
well displayed as well I really like the
use of graphs and tables to try and make

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:00.730
use of graphs and tables to try and make
 

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.509
use of graphs and tables to try and make
this information as easily consumed as

this information as easily consumed as
 

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.189

which looked at one of the redesigns you
 

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.710
which looked at one of the redesigns you
know really resonated this idea of

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720
know really resonated this idea of
 

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.120
know really resonated this idea of
trying to make it simpler trying to make

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.130
trying to make it simpler trying to make
 

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.040
trying to make it simpler trying to make
it easier and I think that's what a lot

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.050
it easier and I think that's what a lot
 

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.050
it easier and I think that's what a lot
of people want is these apps that they

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.060
of people want is these apps that they
 

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.790
of people want is these apps that they
love to use these services which they

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800
love to use these services which they
 

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.340
love to use these services which they
find hugely useful but they want to have

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:32.350
find hugely useful but they want to have
 

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.890
find hugely useful but they want to have
it be easy to use to be sort of more of

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:34.900
it be easy to use to be sort of more of
 

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.360
it be easy to use to be sort of more of
a magical experience where you're not

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.370
a magical experience where you're not
 

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.160
a magical experience where you're not
learning a piece of software just taking

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.170
learning a piece of software just taking
 

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.870
learning a piece of software just taking
advantage of a service so I'm rushing

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880
advantage of a service so I'm rushing
 

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.790
advantage of a service so I'm rushing
through today's shows because I want to

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800
through today's shows because I want to
 

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.320
through today's shows because I want to
I want to try and keep it a little more

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.330
I want to try and keep it a little more
 

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.060
I want to try and keep it a little more
succinct than than perhaps we sometimes

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.070
succinct than than perhaps we sometimes
 

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.750
succinct than than perhaps we sometimes
do so let's have a look at let's look at

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760
do so let's have a look at let's look at
 

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.520
do so let's have a look at let's look at
the next app so this is sleep recorder

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:55.530
 
 

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.320
 
and you can see here no feature graphic

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.330
and you can see here no feature graphic
 

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.390
and you can see here no feature graphic
which is a real shame without a feature

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.400
which is a real shame without a feature
 

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400
which is a real shame without a feature
graphic you can't be featured you don't

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:02.410
graphic you can't be featured you don't
 

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.450
graphic you can't be featured you don't
have a chance of being in the pure

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:03.460
have a chance of being in the pure
 

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.760
have a chance of being in the pure
Android collection either and really the

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:05.770
Android collection either and really the
 

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.950
Android collection either and really the
biggest thing here is that you're going

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:07.960
biggest thing here is that you're going
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.230
biggest thing here is that you're going
to be limiting your downloads so the

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240
to be limiting your downloads so the
 

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.970
to be limiting your downloads so the
lack of a feature graphic on a landing

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:11.980
lack of a feature graphic on a landing
 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.830
lack of a feature graphic on a landing
page actually has a significant impact

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:13.840
page actually has a significant impact
 

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.270
page actually has a significant impact
on the number of people who are likely

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:15.280
on the number of people who are likely
 

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.270
on the number of people who are likely
to download it so and it's not only that

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:18.280
to download it so and it's not only that
 

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.530
to download it so and it's not only that
but the quality of the feature graphic

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:19.540
but the quality of the feature graphic
 

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.310
but the quality of the feature graphic
so if you're if you're if getting lots

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320
so if you're if you're if getting lots
 

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.450
so if you're if you're if getting lots
of downloads is something that's

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:24.460
of downloads is something that's
 

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.100
of downloads is something that's
important to you it's important to have

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.110
important to you it's important to have
 

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.660
important to you it's important to have
that feature graphic and for it to be

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:27.670
that feature graphic and for it to be
 

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.000
that feature graphic and for it to be
good now this is an app which spends a

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.010
good now this is an app which spends a
 

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.640
good now this is an app which spends a
lot of time on design they've used a

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:32.650
lot of time on design they've used a
 

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.870
lot of time on design they've used a
skeuomorphic design which you'll see in

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880
skeuomorphic design which you'll see in
 

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.480
skeuomorphic design which you'll see in
a moment so clearly look and feel is

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:36.490
a moment so clearly look and feel is
 

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.160
a moment so clearly look and feel is
something that's important so it's it's

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.170
something that's important so it's it's
 

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.830
something that's important so it's it's
really an opportunity here to take that

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:40.840
really an opportunity here to take that
 

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.900
really an opportunity here to take that
same attention to detail which you have

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:42.910
same attention to detail which you have
 

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.670
same attention to detail which you have
within your app and put it here front

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680
within your app and put it here front
 

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.080
within your app and put it here front

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:50.290
point of impression you know we always
 

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.710
point of impression you know we always
say that first impressions are really

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720
say that first impressions are really
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.270
say that first impressions are really
important and that's exactly what you're

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.280
important and that's exactly what you're
 

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.710
important and that's exactly what you're

which is going to make people want to

00:14:59.970 --> 00:14:59.980
which is going to make people want to
 

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.390
which is going to make people want to
use your app in terms of the icon

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:03.400
use your app in terms of the icon
 

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.030
use your app in terms of the icon
you can see it's it's okay it's kind of

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040
you can see it's it's okay it's kind of
 

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.150
you can see it's it's okay it's kind of
the rounded square image which we're

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160
the rounded square image which we're
 

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.250
the rounded square image which we're
trying to move away from so again this

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:11.260
trying to move away from so again this
 

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.720
trying to move away from so again this
may be an opportunity to think about how

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:12.730
may be an opportunity to think about how
 

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.280
may be an opportunity to think about how
to make this into something which is a

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:14.290
to make this into something which is a
 

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.170
to make this into something which is a
little more distinctive more a

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:16.180
little more distinctive more a
 

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.360
little more distinctive more a
silhouette rather than sort of an image

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:18.370
silhouette rather than sort of an image
 

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.680
silhouette rather than sort of an image
painted on a rounded square canvas if we

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:22.690
painted on a rounded square canvas if we
 

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.860
painted on a rounded square canvas if we
look at the app itself you can see that

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:25.870
look at the app itself you can see that
 

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.480
look at the app itself you can see that
they've gone for a very skeuomorphic

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.490
they've gone for a very skeuomorphic
 

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.150
they've gone for a very skeuomorphic
design it looks a lot like a tape

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160
design it looks a lot like a tape
 

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.280
design it looks a lot like a tape
recorder basically with sort of a record

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.290
recorder basically with sort of a record
 

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.920
recorder basically with sort of a record

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:34.930
playback and fast-forward affordances in
 

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.020
playback and fast-forward affordances in
the middle you've got you know this this

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.030
the middle you've got you know this this
 

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.370
the middle you've got you know this this
analog indication of your sleep patterns

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:41.380
analog indication of your sleep patterns
 

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.020
analog indication of your sleep patterns
effectively so it looks kind of like an

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.030
effectively so it looks kind of like an
 

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.090
effectively so it looks kind of like an
EKG mixed with a tape recorder sort of a

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.100
EKG mixed with a tape recorder sort of a
 

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.610
EKG mixed with a tape recorder sort of a
lie detector vibe almost since I guess

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:47.620
lie detector vibe almost since I guess
 

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.750
lie detector vibe almost since I guess
that's what it puts me in the mind of

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:48.760
that's what it puts me in the mind of
 

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.880
that's what it puts me in the mind of
when I look at it is just kind of looks

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:50.890
when I look at it is just kind of looks
 

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.180
when I look at it is just kind of looks
like a lie detector for my sleep so you

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:54.190
like a lie detector for my sleep so you
 

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.370
like a lie detector for my sleep so you
definitely feel judged which is

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:56.380
definitely feel judged which is
 

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.470
definitely feel judged which is
necessarily a bad thing so it is a

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480
necessarily a bad thing so it is a
 

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.630
necessarily a bad thing so it is a
recorder it looks like a recorder so

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:00.640
recorder it looks like a recorder so
 

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.070
recorder it looks like a recorder so
it's definitely on there on the right

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.080
it's definitely on there on the right
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.850
it's definitely on there on the right
track there

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:02.860
track there
 

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.590
track there
they have taken a skeuomorphic design

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600
they have taken a skeuomorphic design
 

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.870
they have taken a skeuomorphic design
approach which is quite in contrast to

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880
approach which is quite in contrast to
 

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.220
approach which is quite in contrast to
the first app that we looked at which

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.230
the first app that we looked at which
 

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.230
the first app that we looked at which
was much more of a sort of a clean

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240
was much more of a sort of a clean
 

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.440
was much more of a sort of a clean
hollow based theme and you know really

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:13.450
hollow based theme and you know really
 

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.000
hollow based theme and you know really
I'm not making a judgment call on this I

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.010
I'm not making a judgment call on this I
 

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.170
I'm not making a judgment call on this I
think that both are valid options really

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:19.180
think that both are valid options really
 

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.520
think that both are valid options really
what I'm trying to judge here is whether

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:20.530
what I'm trying to judge here is whether
 

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.680
what I'm trying to judge here is whether
or not their design choices are making

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.690
or not their design choices are making
 

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.140
or not their design choices are making
it easier for me as a user to get

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.150
it easier for me as a user to get
 

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.510
it easier for me as a user to get
started and use that up and to be honest

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:27.520
started and use that up and to be honest
 

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.580
started and use that up and to be honest
with this app I struggled a little bit

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:29.590
with this app I struggled a little bit
 

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:35.100
with this app I struggled a little bit
so if I switch to the giant phone here

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.110
so if I switch to the giant phone here
 

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.800
so if I switch to the giant phone here
we go well sleep recorder has stopped so

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:37.810
we go well sleep recorder has stopped so
 

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.690
we go well sleep recorder has stopped so
that's not a good sign I'm not gonna

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:39.700
that's not a good sign I'm not gonna
 

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.520
that's not a good sign I'm not gonna
report it right now but I will hopefully

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:41.530
report it right now but I will hopefully
 

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.010
report it right now but I will hopefully
be able to go back in and record that

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.020
be able to go back in and record that
 

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.930
be able to go back in and record that
for you

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940
for you
 

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.230
for you
so again rate us like sleep recorder

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240
so again rate us like sleep recorder
 

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.490
so again rate us like sleep recorder

not great kind of obnoxious I understand

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:54.340
not great kind of obnoxious I understand

not great kind of obnoxious I understand
that you want people to rate and review

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:55.690
that you want people to rate and review
 

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.150
that you want people to rate and review
your app and there are certainly ways to

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160
your app and there are certainly ways to
 

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.010
your app and there are certainly ways to
do that but this is the second or third

00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.020
do that but this is the second or third
 

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.260
do that but this is the second or third
time that I've launched the app it feels

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.270
time that I've launched the app it feels
 

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.760
time that I've launched the app it feels
like this is maybe not the right time

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:02.770
like this is maybe not the right time
 

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.560
like this is maybe not the right time
particularly because when I'm gonna be

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.570
particularly because when I'm gonna be
 

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.090
particularly because when I'm gonna be
launching this the first few times is

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.100
launching this the first few times is
 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.890
launching this the first few times is
likely to be when I'm getting ready for

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:07.900
likely to be when I'm getting ready for

want to be interrupted with any anything
which isn't sort of key to that and so

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:14.470
which isn't sort of key to that and so
 

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.600
which isn't sort of key to that and so
this is perhaps something which you

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.610
this is perhaps something which you
 

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.910
this is perhaps something which you
would display later

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:16.920

time where you really don't have any
 

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.570
time where you really don't have any
time to spare so I'm going to say no

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:23.580
time to spare so I'm going to say no
 

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.330
time to spare so I'm going to say no
thanks and you can see everything's

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:26.340
thanks and you can see everything's
 

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.860
thanks and you can see everything's
moving around so we've got this you know

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:27.870
moving around so we've got this you know
 

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.080

beautiful skeuomorphic design we've got

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.090
beautiful skeuomorphic design we've got
 

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.600
beautiful skeuomorphic design we've got
needles bouncing around we've got we've

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:32.610
needles bouncing around we've got we've
 

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.680
needles bouncing around we've got we've
got rotary dials which I can turn and

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:35.690
got rotary dials which I can turn and
 

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.000
got rotary dials which I can turn and
what I like about it is that it's it's

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.010
what I like about it is that it's it's
 

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.770
what I like about it is that it's it's
simple there's there's no overflow

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780
simple there's there's no overflow
 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.600
simple there's there's no overflow
button there's a very limited number of

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:41.610
button there's a very limited number of
 

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.860
button there's a very limited number of
things you can do and everything that I

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:42.870
things you can do and everything that I
 

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.280
things you can do and everything that I
press has an immediate reaction now

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.290
press has an immediate reaction now
 

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.860
press has an immediate reaction now
where I'm a little bit less thrilled is

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:48.870
where I'm a little bit less thrilled is
 

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.840
where I'm a little bit less thrilled is
that it's not obvious what any of the

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:50.850
that it's not obvious what any of the
 

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.060
that it's not obvious what any of the
things that I'm touching do so I can

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.070
things that I'm touching do so I can
 

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.530
things that I'm touching do so I can
turn this and it's going to change my

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:54.540
turn this and it's going to change my
 

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.040
turn this and it's going to change my
delay from 1 to 30 but I don't know what

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.050
delay from 1 to 30 but I don't know what
 

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.470
delay from 1 to 30 but I don't know what
that delay is for or what the units are

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480
that delay is for or what the units are
 

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.780
that delay is for or what the units are
so I'm a little bit at a loss like I can

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:02.790
so I'm a little bit at a loss like I can
 

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.390
so I'm a little bit at a loss like I can
change it but I don't know what it does

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400
change it but I don't know what it does
 

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.820
change it but I don't know what it does
and again I can dial this around and it

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:07.830
and again I can dial this around and it
 

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.240
and again I can dial this around and it
changes the color on on the on the dial

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.250
changes the color on on the on the dial
 

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.460
changes the color on on the on the dial
but I really don't know what I'm doing

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:13.470
but I really don't know what I'm doing
 

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.280
but I really don't know what I'm doing
so it's it's kind of it's kind of a cool

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.290
so it's it's kind of it's kind of a cool
 

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.590
so it's it's kind of it's kind of a cool
effect but in terms of feedback it's

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600
effect but in terms of feedback it's
 

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.210
effect but in terms of feedback it's
underplayed it's a little too simplistic

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220
underplayed it's a little too simplistic
 

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.700
underplayed it's a little too simplistic
it's perhaps relying on me understanding

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.710
it's perhaps relying on me understanding
 

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.440
it's perhaps relying on me understanding
what the analog equivalents of this

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.450
what the analog equivalents of this
 

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.110
what the analog equivalents of this
design are in order to to be able to

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120
design are in order to to be able to
 

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.060
design are in order to to be able to
understand it so I'm gonna here I would

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.070
understand it so I'm gonna here I would
 

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.350
understand it so I'm gonna here I would
try and make it a little bit more

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360
try and make it a little bit more
 

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.760
try and make it a little bit more
obvious to users who are going to open

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:31.770
obvious to users who are going to open
 

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.400
obvious to users who are going to open
it for the first time to understand what

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.410
it for the first time to understand what
 

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.990
it for the first time to understand what
are these things doing how am I supposed

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000
are these things doing how am I supposed
 

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.210
are these things doing how am I supposed
to use them so the one thing which I am

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220
to use them so the one thing which I am
 

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.140
to use them so the one thing which I am
familiar with is the the record button

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:41.150
familiar with is the the record button
 

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.000
familiar with is the the record button
so I hit record because that's what you

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.010
so I hit record because that's what you
 

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.950
so I hit record because that's what you
do in fact you know you are going to

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960
do in fact you know you are going to
 

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.600
do in fact you know you are going to
take my tape recorder analogy to its

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:47.610
take my tape recorder analogy to its
 

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.460
take my tape recorder analogy to its
maximum I hit record and play at the

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:49.470
maximum I hit record and play at the
 

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.340
maximum I hit record and play at the
same time but in any case I hit record

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:52.350
same time but in any case I hit record
 

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.980
same time but in any case I hit record
and it pops up with a with a modal

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:54.990
and it pops up with a with a modal
 

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.960
and it pops up with a with a modal
dialog of all things telling me that I'm

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:56.970
dialog of all things telling me that I'm
 

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.450
dialog of all things telling me that I'm
holding it wrong but I want to start I

00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460
holding it wrong but I want to start I
 

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.070
holding it wrong but I want to start I
don't press record I press the button in

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080
don't press record I press the button in
 

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.630
don't press record I press the button in
the middle which is a little bit

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640
the middle which is a little bit
 

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.060
the middle which is a little bit
confusing because well clearly this is a

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.070
confusing because well clearly this is a
 

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.000
confusing because well clearly this is a
tip why not why not make it so that the

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.010
tip why not why not make it so that the
 

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.410
tip why not why not make it so that the
record button is the way that you

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:09.420
record button is the way that you
 

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.690
record button is the way that you
started I'm sure that there is a reason

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700
started I'm sure that there is a reason
 

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.610
started I'm sure that there is a reason
for it and in fact what I have

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
for it and in fact what I have
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.250
for it and in fact what I have
determined is that I think basically

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260
determined is that I think basically
 

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.670
determined is that I think basically
these buttons along the bottom

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:18.680
these buttons along the bottom
 

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.860
these buttons along the bottom
navigation tabs so hitting record is how

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:21.870
navigation tabs so hitting record is how
 

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.930
navigation tabs so hitting record is how
I go into recording mode and hitting

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940
I go into recording mode and hitting
 

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.210
I go into recording mode and hitting
play is how I go into the playback tab

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220
play is how I go into the playback tab
 

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.970
play is how I go into the playback tab
so it's basically tabs as indicated by

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980
so it's basically tabs as indicated by
 

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.770
so it's basically tabs as indicated by
the depression of the buttons

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780
the depression of the buttons
 

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.870
the depression of the buttons
they go from playback to record and then

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880
they go from playback to record and then
 

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.640
they go from playback to record and then
clearly I'm already in records of a hit

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:34.650
clearly I'm already in records of a hit
 

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.560
clearly I'm already in records of a hit
recording again that's why I get the

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:36.570
recording again that's why I get the
 

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.570
recording again that's why I get the
dialogue so the fact that there is a

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580
dialogue so the fact that there is a
 

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.550
dialogue so the fact that there is a
dialog tells me that enough users are

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:40.560
dialog tells me that enough users are
 

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.770
dialog tells me that enough users are
doing this that perhaps this particular

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780
doing this that perhaps this particular
 

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.340
doing this that perhaps this particular
paradigm isn't working for you and

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:46.350
paradigm isn't working for you and
 

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.810
paradigm isn't working for you and
that's I think one of the risks when

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820
that's I think one of the risks when
 

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.670
that's I think one of the risks when
you're using something skeuomorphic is

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:49.680
you're using something skeuomorphic is
 

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.810
you're using something skeuomorphic is
that you really want to be careful

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820
that you really want to be careful
 

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.620
that you really want to be careful
because the record button means start

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:54.630
because the record button means start
 

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.660
because the record button means start
recording that's how it works on the

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:56.670
recording that's how it works on the
 

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.460
recording that's how it works on the
analog device which you are creating a

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:58.470
analog device which you are creating a
 

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.680
analog device which you are creating a
design around so as soon as you create a

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:00.690
design around so as soon as you create a
 

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.630
design around so as soon as you create a
design that looks the same as a real

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640
design that looks the same as a real
 

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.000
design that looks the same as a real
world object but actually the behavior

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.010
world object but actually the behavior
 

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.950
world object but actually the behavior
is different then it gets really

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960
is different then it gets really
 

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.380
is different then it gets really
confusing so that's something you want

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.390
confusing so that's something you want
 

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.200
confusing so that's something you want
to avoid and in this instance I think

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.210
to avoid and in this instance I think
 

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.920
to avoid and in this instance I think
fundamentally I think hitting a record

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:12.930
fundamentally I think hitting a record
 

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.600
fundamentally I think hitting a record
should start the recording so maybe

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:14.610
should start the recording so maybe
 

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.360
should start the recording so maybe
rework the way that those tabs have been

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.370
rework the way that those tabs have been
 

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.100
rework the way that those tabs have been

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.130
implemented to make it a little bit more
obvious particularly because the analogy

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140
obvious particularly because the analogy
 

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.050
obvious particularly because the analogy
between fast-forward and favorites

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.060

I like the alliteration that's cool but

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.150
I like the alliteration that's cool but
 

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.180
I like the alliteration that's cool but
it's not necessarily obvious so it's a

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.190
it's not necessarily obvious so it's a
 

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.790
it's not necessarily obvious so it's a
design which really means that you have

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:31.800
design which really means that you have
 

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.770
design which really means that you have

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780
to click everything on the screen before
 

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.480
to click everything on the screen before
you know what anything on the screen

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.490
you know what anything on the screen
 

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.970
you know what anything on the screen
does and so that's just increasing that

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980
does and so that's just increasing that
 

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.500
does and so that's just increasing that
learning curve it means that before I

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:39.510
learning curve it means that before I
 

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.900
learning curve it means that before I
can decide whether or not I want to use

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:41.910

information in a modal dialogue so I hit

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:22.660
information in a modal dialogue so I hit
 

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.270
information in a modal dialogue so I hit
OK eventually and okay so now I can see

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280
OK eventually and okay so now I can see
 

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.400
OK eventually and okay so now I can see
that the delay was a countdown timer in

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:29.410
that the delay was a countdown timer in
 

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.670
that the delay was a countdown timer in
seconds before it started recording so I

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:32.680
seconds before it started recording so I
 

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.410
seconds before it started recording so I
guess the idea there is you hit record

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:34.420
guess the idea there is you hit record
 

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.630
guess the idea there is you hit record
and then you can you know put it next to

and then you can you know put it next to
 

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.650
and then you can you know put it next to
your bed or expect that you're going to

and you really don't want to record
anything until after that so that's what

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:45.580
anything until after that so that's what
 

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.300
anything until after that so that's what

not it's actually started recording now
from my experiments earlier on it wasn't

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:55.540
from my experiments earlier on it wasn't
 

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.880
from my experiments earlier on it wasn't
I thought that at this point the

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:56.890
I thought that at this point the
 

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.290
I thought that at this point the
countdown had finished it was recording

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.300
countdown had finished it was recording
 

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.310
countdown had finished it was recording
but then there was nothing in my history

me think that what this is actually

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960
me think that what this is actually
 

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.420
me think that what this is actually

take so I guess we've got two apps which

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.090
take so I guess we've got two apps which

sleeping the other which is using audio
 

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.500

well perhaps they're both using audio I

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:02.510
well perhaps they're both using audio I
 

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.240
well perhaps they're both using audio I
should probably have checked that more

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:04.250

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.840
closely uh-huh
and really it doesn't matter either way

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:07.850
and really it doesn't matter either way
 

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.040
and really it doesn't matter either way
whether you're recording sort of

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.050
whether you're recording sort of
 

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.150
whether you're recording sort of
movement or whether you're recording

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:10.160
movement or whether you're recording

to all of the apps it's just which

sensor Hardware you happen to be using

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:17.540
sensor Hardware you happen to be using
 

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.020
sensor Hardware you happen to be using
in order to record things and I think a

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.030
in order to record things and I think a
 

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.030
in order to record things and I think a
great app would actually use all of the

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.040
great app would actually use all of the
 

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.230
great app would actually use all of the

changing while you are sleeping so I

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:28.820
changing while you are sleeping so I
 

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.270
changing while you are sleeping so I
think so I can stop the recording I can

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:31.280
think so I can stop the recording I can
 

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.180
think so I can stop the recording I can
go back here and again so this is again

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.190
go back here and again so this is again
 

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.680
go back here and again so this is again
kind of confusing because there is no

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:35.690
kind of confusing because there is no
 

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.550
kind of confusing because there is no
recording even though I thought that I

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:39.560
recording even though I thought that I
 

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.620
recording even though I thought that I
had been recording and and again there's

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:41.630
had been recording and and again there's
 

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.420
had been recording and and again there's
a couple of UI tweaks here we've kind of

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:43.430
a couple of UI tweaks here we've kind of
 

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.460
a couple of UI tweaks here we've kind of
got this iPhone e style buttons

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:47.470

particularly here it's a little
 

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.850
particularly here it's a little
disconcerting because you've got this

confusing thing for users so I think you
 

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.680

know as useful as the app is the the
 

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.790
know as useful as the app is the the
biggest thing the best thing that they

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:06.800
biggest thing the best thing that they
 

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.790
biggest thing the best thing that they
can do here is is kind of think about

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:09.800
can do here is is kind of think about
 

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.910
can do here is is kind of think about

how that onboarding that that on ramping
 

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.410
how that onboarding that that on ramping
is for users you know how are you going

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:14.420
is for users you know how are you going
 

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.760
is for users you know how are you going
to get them to really understand how to

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:15.770
to get them to really understand how to
 

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.620
to get them to really understand how to
use the app and see how beautiful and

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:17.630
use the app and see how beautiful and
 

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.660
use the app and see how beautiful and
simple it is without having to spend a

simple it is without having to spend a
lot of time learning the things which

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:21.950
lot of time learning the things which
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.770
lot of time learning the things which
are hidden so one of the things that

are hidden so one of the things that
 

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.820
are hidden so one of the things that
you're going to need to learn if you

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:27.830
you're going to need to learn if you
 

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.680
you're going to need to learn if you
want to build an app like this certainly

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:29.690
want to build an app like this certainly

step that we looked at to be able to
 

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.070
step that we looked at to be able to
take in that input and then do the

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080
take in that input and then do the
 

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.900
take in that input and then do the
analysis on that so all of that

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:46.910
analysis on that so all of that
 

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.010
