00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.420
- [Instructor] We're told,

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.900
the table gives the amounts
of materials Aya recycled.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.550
So we have the different materials here,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.260
and then it gives the various amounts.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.890
How many kilograms of paper
and aluminum did Aya recycle?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.410
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.950
Okay, so we're thinking
about paper and aluminum,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.000
so paper is right over here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.950
She recycled 277 kilograms of paper.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.750
And aluminum is right over here.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.640
She recycled 134 kilograms of aluminum.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.260
And so we want the
combination, or the sum,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.540
of paper and aluminum, so it's going to be

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
277 kilograms plus 134 kilograms.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.680
So we really need to figure
out what 277 plus 134 is,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.330
and in multiple videos, we have talked

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.470
about how there's many different
ways of approaching this.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.930
We could say, well let's
just break up the 134.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.680
We could start at, actually let
me do this on a number line.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.750
That sometimes is a fun thing to do.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.420
So if we were to just say,
this is our number line,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.603
and we're going to start
at 277 right over there.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.780
So first, we could add
100, because we have 100

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.490
right over there, so let's do that.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.240
If we add 100, so plus
100, where does it get us?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.720
Well if we add 100 here, we get to 377.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.290
So 300, I'll just write, 77.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.410
And then we could add three 10s, or 30.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.610
So then we're going to add 30.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.610
So let's add 30, so plus 30.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.790
What does that get us?

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.500
So this is interesting.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500
If you add 30 to 370,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.510
you would get to 400,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.240
and then we have another seven there,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.790
so that gets us to 407.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.250
So then we get to 407.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.960
And once again, this is just one way

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960
to try to think about it.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.670
And then, last but not
least, we could add the four.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.820
So then you say, we're there right now,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.630
and then we add plus four,
and seven plus four is 11,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.590
so 407 plus four is 411.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.730
So how many kilograms of paper
and aluminum did Aya recycle?

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.940
Would be 411 kilograms.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.203
Kilo, kilograms, and we're done.
