00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:02.502
Welcome, smiths.

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.837
You know why I'm here.

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.255
We're going to do the
strength test now.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.215
Now, I'm going to take
each of your hatchets,

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.466
and I'm going to
strike this railroad

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.595
tie repeatedly and violently.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.055
We're going to see not
what your hatchets do

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:15.557
to the railroad tie,
but what the railroad

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.308
tie does to your hatchets.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.184
Matt, you're up first.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:18.935
You ready?

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.186
No.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.396
Well, we're going
to do it, anyway.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.106
This is it.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.775
Jay's got a look in his eye like
he's going to beat the crap out

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.318
of that timber, so I'm just--

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm really worried it's
going to come apart.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.329
[grunting]

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.340
[laughter]

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.259
Nicely done, Matt.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.761
Your edge is fine.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.345
No damage.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:56.431
You are slightly out of
alignment with your edge here,

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.809
but it's slight, so I was
able to correct easily.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.643
Everything's tight.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.145
Nothing moved.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.938
The handle's just a little
big, but I like having

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.148
that flare on the bottom.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.566
You did a great job.
Congratulations.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.109
Thank you.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.486
John, we're gonna do you next.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.237
Jay said he's
going to violently

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.655
strike this railroad tie.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.325
He has his violent,
I have my violent.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.786
I like to give hugs and
kisses for my violent.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.204
We will just have
to see what he does.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.543
[grunting]

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.850
Nice job, John.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.686
Everything's still tight, so
the leather band-aid worked very

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.896
well to hold things together.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.815
You did do a rough
index down here,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.733
but it feels almost triangular.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.819
So it's a little odd,
but it worked well.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.445
Good job.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.279
Aaron, you're up next.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.405
You ready?

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.115
Fire away, sir.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.786
All I have is just sheer hope
that this is going to last.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.539
Hopefully it's not going
to tear off, or break

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.832
welds, or anything like that.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.124
So fingers crossed, for sure.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:15.760
There's a problem here.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.366
Gentlemen, there is a
minimum and maximum length

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.827
parameter for the
handles of your hatchets.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:45.248
Your hatchet handle is
over by 3/4 of an inch.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.833
You now have the
dubious distinction

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.835
of being the only
bladesmith that's

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.837
ever participated
on this show to blow

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.547
the parameters on both rounds.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.090
That's a little
bit disappointing

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.010
from somebody who has so
much talent, so at this time

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.345
I have to ask you to please
leave the forge, Aaron.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.388
Yes, sir.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.514
I'm sorry, man.
That sucks.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.473
It's all right.

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.100
I'm a little bummed out.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.518
I should have been a little
bit more patient with it,

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.312
and a little bit more
diligent about noticing

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.355
the parameters of what I had.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.984
What I've learned from this
experience is measure twice,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:13.985
cut once.
