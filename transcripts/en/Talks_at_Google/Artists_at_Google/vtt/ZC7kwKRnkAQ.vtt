00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:10.330
KEVIN VLK: Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.820
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.280
I'm Kevin Vlk with
the Google team.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.570
And here we are in sunny
LA at YouTube Space.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.228
How awesome is this
space, eh, guys?

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.684
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:22.100
So this full
production facility--

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.550
we're really, really
excited here because we're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.920
doing something brand
new that we haven't

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.211
done in Talks at Google before.

00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.020
We're doing a YouTube
360 degree live stream.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.970
So we're live right now across
the world and these two cameras

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.420
that you see here
are 360 degrees.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.184
For you guys
watching online, what

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:38.600
we're going to be
doing here today

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.685
is interviewing the
cast of "Finding Dory."

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.810
We're going to bring them
up here in just a second.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.310
For you guys watching
online-- if you're

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.830
watching on your mobile device,
just take your phone, just

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.272
look around in
complete 360 degrees.

00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:51.230
Then we've got some fun
stuff here in the back.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.063
You can look around the
production facility.

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:56.130
And then if you're on
desktop, just take your mouse,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.130
click the video, move it
around, and that's it.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.848
All right, are we
ready to meet the cast?

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:02.556
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:04.548
All right, let's bring them out.

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:07.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
the voice cast

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.120
and creative team behind
Disney Pixar's "Finding Dory."

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.066
[MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.307
Alrighty, welcome guys.

00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:40.804
ELLEN DEGENERES: Hello.

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:41.800
ANDREW STANTON: Hello.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.549
KEVIN VLK: Thanks so
much for coming here.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.600
So, "Finding Dory,"
out June 17th,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.850
thank you guys all
for being here.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.140
Ellen, welcome.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.060
ELLEN DEGENERES: Hi.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.670
KEVIN VLK: So this
is a movie completely

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.482
about your character, Dory.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.190
And you've been--

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.398
ELLEN DEGENERES: There are
other characters, as well.

00:01:58.398 --> 00:01:59.920
KEVIN VLK: Right.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.100
Thank you.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.923
But-- so your-- go ahead.

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:07.340
ALBERT BROOKS: I don't
know, I just found that out.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.866
ELLEN DEGENERES: I'm Dory.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:12.310
KEVIN VLK: And so-- but
you were a huge cheerleader

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.454
for this film for
years on your show.

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:17.120
ELLEN DEGENERES: Thank
god I had a show.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840
We would not be sitting here
had I not had a talk show.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.210
True statement.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.070
It's true.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.870
KEVIN VLK: Talk
about intimidation.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.786
ELLEN DEGENERES: Yeah.

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:27.180
He finally called
and said uncle.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.640
He's like, all
right, we'll do it.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.330
We'll do it.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.290
ANDREW STANTON: She
said, I was just kidding.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.165
That's what she said.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:35.040
ELLEN DEGENERES: I was like,
no, I'm not interested.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.910
No, it was started as-- I
seriously wanted a sequel.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.300
I was like, they
make sequels for

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.650
every other successful film.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.990
We won an Academy Award,
for crying out loud,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.720
so where's the sequel?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.650
And then, it just
got to be a joke.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.700
And then I just gave up.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.540
And I was just--
well, I'm just going

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.010
to keep going
because it's funny.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.332
But then it worked out.

00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:53.790
KEVIN VLK: And then
13 years later.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.850
So Andrew, you brought
this back 13 years later.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.630
So when did that idea-- besides
Ellen pushing it-- come to you?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.838
ANDREW STANTON: You know,
when you make these movies,

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:02.170
you see them so many times.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.010
So I'd seen "Finding
Nemo" about 100 times

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.980
before 2003 even finished.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.710
So you just stop watching.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.580
And about eight years
later, it was 2011,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.914
they wanted to put it out in 3D.

00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:13.621
They put me in a
theater and I watched it

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.260
like an audience member for
the first time in a long time.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.069
And I walked out so
worried about Dory.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.360
I was just like, she's going
to forget Marlin and Nemo,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.054
she won't know how to get back.

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:24.470
And I don't know
where she's from.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.330
And I think she's got
abandonment issues

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.130
that I know about as a writer.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.132
So suddenly, it just all
started to bubble up after that.

00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:33.340
KEVIN VLK: It's unbelievable.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.510
And it's a wonderful
film, I've seen it.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.510
It's absolutely--

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.840
ALBERT BROOKS: By the way,
as long as you're here.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.730
Make the third
one before we die.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.737
ANDREW STANTON: Oh, OK.

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:44.249
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.540
KEVIN VLK: Well, Ellen, I
want to get to you, actually,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.956
about your character,
too, Marlin.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:48.840
Marlin's back.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.010
And we have the new voice of
Nemo right back there, Hayden.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.150
Say hello to everyone.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.149
ELLEN DEGENERES: Hayden.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.890
ANDREW STANTON:
Hayden's actually 30.

00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:01.860
She plays a really
good 9-year-old.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.824
HAYDEN ROLENCE: Wait,
you guys didn't know yet?

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910
KEVIN VLK: Albert,
your character, Marlin,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.990
is back, obviously.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.800
And it's interesting because
it was really, really great

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.300
to see you now have a
completely different dynamic

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.500
with your son, Nemo.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.579
And now Marlin is
much more protective

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.720
over Dory, who wants
to go find her family.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.560
So can you talk a
little bit about where

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.730
Marlin is at the stage?

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.590
ALBERT BROOKS: Well, I
know he doesn't agree,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.860
but I thought that Marlin
was in love with Dory.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.810
I mean it.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.449
I just figured
that, you know, he--

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.740
ANDREW STANTON: Whatever
makes the scenes work for you.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.140
ALBERT BROOKS:
Marlin's lonely and he

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.600
hadn't found anyone else.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.855
And she's lovely and,
you know, why not?

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.730
EUGENE LEVY: I think we
have the next sequel.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.870
TY BURRELL: Yeah, I
was just going to say,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.661
there's your third.

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:51.681
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:53.430
ALBERT BROOKS: But you
know, it was great.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.760
Hayden's terrific.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.080
Alexander Gould, who played
the first one, he's 42.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.050
So I actually was
in "Weeds" with him.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.270
After he was Nemo, I played
his grandfather in "Weeds."

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.530
So that was sort of interesting
talking about pot with Nemo,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.440
you know.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.230
But Hayden's wonderful.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.410
And you know, like a
modern divorced family,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.096
here's a new kid.

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:21.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.810
KEVIN VLK: There we go.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.710
It's going great.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.640
So Ty and Kaitlin, you guys
play new characters in the film.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.470
So we have Bailey, which
is your character, Ty,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.423
and then Destiny.

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:31.797
So tell us about
your characters.

00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:36.790
KAITLIN OLSON: We're buddies.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.480
TY BURRELL: Yeah.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.560
Basically, Bailey
and Destiny are

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.990
two people that Dory enlists
to help her find her folks.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.360
People.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.830
They're two people dressed in
whale and whale shark costumes.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.190
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah, it's
like an abstract kind

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.310
of a thing we were doing.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.790
ELLEN DEGENERES: Did you
dress in whale costumes

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.790
when you recorded this?

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.180
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.720
ELLEN DEGENERES: You
didn't need to do that.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.120
TY BURRELL: We're the only
live action part of this movie.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.769
It was exhausting.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:07.560
ELLEN DEGENERES: You
must have been so hot.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.420
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah,
it was really hot.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.930
Yeah, you're-- Bailey's a big
beluga whale and Destiny is

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.290
a giant whale shark.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.480
And they're kind of a
brother-sister relationship,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.813
they get on each other's nerves.

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:23.343
But they're very sweet and they
end up trying to help Dory out.

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:24.051
KEVIN VLK: Great.

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.140
And We have an
exclusive clip we're

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.400
going to play here in just
a few minutes with your two

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.059
characters, so we'll bring
that up here in a little bit.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:31.600
But Ellen, you know,
you're returning

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.019
to the character of Dory.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:34.560
It's a really, really
emotional story

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.101
about her trying to
find her parents.

00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:37.939
So you know, when you
first read the script,

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.480
was there anything that you were
able to bring to the script,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.688
or tell Andrew, I'm looking
for this in the character

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:45.350
or I want to go this direction?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.460
ELLEN DEGENERES: No.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.190
I mean, this guy's a genius.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.920
I'm not going to tell him
how to write a script.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.950
I mean, when I was in the
room, I changed a lot.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.449
But I--

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.457
ANDREW STANTON: Yeah.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.290
ELLEN DEGENERES: No.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.680
But you know, that's
what's great about it.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.350
The script is
fantastic-- the script is

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.050
what it is-- but it's
open and free enough

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.450
that you do 50 takes and you
just do whatever you want to do

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.610
and he chooses-- they
choose-- whatever

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.810
turns out to be the best one.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.310
So--

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.384
ALBERT BROOKS: It's
always the first.

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:16.800
ANDREW STANTON:
But you know, it's

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.390
four years writing this thing.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.720
I mean, we're doing-- there was
over 10 drafts of this story

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.740
done over that time.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.781
And they know that while
we're working with them.

00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:27.230
And you also adapt to the
actors once they're cast.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.460
So I'm learning just
as much from them

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.090
and we're rewriting to
play to their strengths

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.190
so that it's like, hopefully,
comfortable shoes, almost.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.040
And it becomes a little
symbiotic at a point.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.925
KEVIN VLK: And Eugene,
you play Charlie--

00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:42.300
EUGENE LEVY: Yes,
that's correct.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.970
KEVIN VLK: --the father of Dory.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.840
EUGENE LEVY: Yeah.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.730
KEVIN VLK: So what can
you tell us about Charlie?

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.990
EUGENE LEVY: Well, it
was exciting to play

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.920
a dad who has a child not
doing strange things with pies.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.435
That was a big plus for me.

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.584
TY BURRELL: That was,
like, your first question.

00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:10.300
EUGENE LEVY: Yeah, right.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.010
Yes.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.670
Does Dory eat baked goods?

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:18.470
No, I-- no, it was kind of a--
it was a very charming-- well,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.020
I was just honored to be
included in this thing.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.710
No question about that.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.170
And playing a dad,
you know, of a child

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.370
who is kind of memory
impaired, so to speak.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.010
You know, it's kind of a
very funny, very amusing.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.900
And there's something very
heartfelt about playing

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.920
a dad whose child
is off somewhere,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.080
you don't know what
happened, and you know,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.020
will they ever be able to--
how will they function?

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.200
Because she has no
memory-- short-term memory.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.530
So you know, it was interesting
and complicated and fun and

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.644
exciting.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.810
KEVIN VLK: I mean, that's
a real powerful part, too.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.010
And Hayden, I'll get
right back to you.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.468
But Andrew and
Lindsey, when you're

00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:12.770
creating this story
about-- you use very much

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.410
a comedic effect
in "Finding Nemo,"

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.910
where you have Dory's character
with short-term memory loss.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.160
That's a real
disability in life.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.950
And you really, really
hit it home in this film.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.879
So was that-- I mean,
because she's really

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.670
struggling with it.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.640
You see it in the
beginning of the film,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.556
you see it throughout.

00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:30.070
So was that a point that you
really wanted to drive home?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.230
ANDREW STANTON: Well,
she's the main character.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.090
Once you have a main
character, there

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.340
has to be more depth to them.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.590
And you, sadly,
are sort of forced

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.036
into a bit of a
straight man role

00:09:37.036 --> 00:09:38.660
when you're in the
main character role.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.610
The thing that was
always great about Dory

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.830
was that I always knew
that tragic side of her.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.190
That was always-- I
always knew her optimism

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.880
and her caregiving
and her can-do spirit

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.250
was somewhat her armor
to protect herself

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.760
from this sense of loss she had.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.922
So it was just sort of
flipping that on this film.

00:09:54.922 --> 00:09:56.380
ELLEN DEGENERES:
It was great, too,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.840
because I remember the day
that there was the scene where

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.130
I had to explain what
short-term memory loss was,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.160
and how to explain it.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.780
And that was one of the
times that I could just go--

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.655
ANDREW STANTON: Yeah.

00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:09.660
ELLEN DEGENERES: --and
talk about what it-- how

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.079
to explain it to someone.

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:13.120
LINDSEY COLLINS: It was
funny and heartbreaking--

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.790
ANDREW STANTON:
--at the same time.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.630
LINDSEY COLLINS:
--at the same time.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.630
And I think that's kind
of what the movie really

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.750
leans into on this one.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.730
That it's charming,
and that is Dory.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.860
And we were always
trying to walk

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.000
that line between the charm
that was Dory and that

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.810
is Ellen and then also the
kind of tragedy, really, of it.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.297
And making sure that
we never leaned too far

00:10:33.297 --> 00:10:35.130
one way or the other
so that we felt like it

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.060
was being really true
to this character.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.980
KEVIN VLK: It was
a delicate balance.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.000
I mean, that's what it was.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.710
Like, in the beginning
of the movie,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.250
you first-- your initial
reaction is the laugh.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.500
It's like, oh, that's Dory.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.916
And then it starts getting
deeper and you're like, oh god.

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:46.840
And like it's really,
really intense.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.794
So Hayden, the
new voice of Nemo.

00:10:49.794 --> 00:10:51.710
Pretty exciting-- from
my hometown of Chicago.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.190
So welcome here to California.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.102
So what was it like to be Nemo?

00:10:58.102 --> 00:10:59.560
HAYDEN ROLENCE:
It's very fun being

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.742
able to pretend that I'm
just a cute, little fish

00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:05.753
and I'm not just me.

00:11:05.753 --> 00:11:07.478
I actually get to
pretend that I'm

00:11:07.478 --> 00:11:13.674
something that's a very good
idea and very fun to do.

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.090
KEVIN VLK: You're
wonderful in it.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.724
It's crazy.

00:11:15.724 --> 00:11:17.140
When I was watching
it, I actually

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.640
didn't realize at first--
from the trailers--

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.410
that they got a new voice.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.300
And I was like, well,
of course they did.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.240
It's 13 years later.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.710
And you pull-- you
sound exactly like him.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.450
It's great.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.040
You did a wonderful job.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.248
ELLEN DEGENERES: He's like
the Darrin of "Bewitched."

00:11:27.248 --> 00:11:30.140
You know, like, he had to be
as good as the original Darrin

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.961
and it's really tough.

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:34.460
KEVIN VLK: A lot
of this takes place

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.680
in a marine, which is a great
thing because in "Finding

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.280
Nemo," you see the characters
going through open water

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.270
and oceans and
everything, and you

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.436
have different environments.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.020
But now you're in
a marine institute.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.517
And for you, Lindsey and
Andrew, when you guys are there,

00:11:47.517 --> 00:11:49.850
there's a lot of creative
ways of how the characters get

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.670
around the park.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.040
But what was one of the
most complicated scenes--

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.200
as a producer, Lindsey,
you're just like, really?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.020
LINDSEY COLLINS: I
think, honestly, it

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.240
was when Andrew came
and was like, so we've

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.220
come up with this new
character and he's an octopus.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.830
And I said, I'm sorry, what?

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.150
And he said, he's an octopus.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.040
Well, he's a septopus, so
you get one less tentacle.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.170
He is-- Hank, the
octopus, no doubt,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.520
is the hardest character,
I think, anybody at Pixar

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.320
has ever done.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.847
And took two years.

00:12:19.847 --> 00:12:21.930
I mean, normally, our
characters take nine months,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.120
start to finish.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.540
And this took two-- he took two
and a half years just to build

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.870
and rig.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.130
And so that was one
where I was like, really?

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.380
Does it have to be an octopus?

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.920
Could you maybe not?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.590
Maybe turtle?

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.050
ANDREW STANTON: No.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.883
LINDSEY COLLINS: No.

00:12:35.883 --> 00:12:37.380
ANDREW STANTON:
Already have that.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.140
LINDSEY COLLINS:
Something plastic?

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.960
ANDREW STANTON: The first shot
took six months to animate.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.459
And we were, we're never going
to get finished at this rate.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:45.660
But fortunately, everybody
got smarter and faster.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.410
KEVIN VLK: And what
environments were some

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.490
of the most complicated ones?

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.430
Because you see them in
pipes and different tanks.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.260
LINDSEY COLLINS: It's
definitely the glass.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.500
If you watch "Finding
Nemo," you'll

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.540
notice that there was,
like, only three shots,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.440
I think, where we
allowed Andrew to put

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.910
the camera in the corner of
the tank of the dentist office.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.219
And it's because of the
reflection and refraction.

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:05.010
I'm talking to people
at Google and YouTube

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.720
so I feel like I'm in my
people, you understand me.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.840
And it's really hard.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.030
I mean, we intentionally didn't
do that because the computer

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.260
couldn't do it and we had
to direct it and fake it--

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.820
all the lighting.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.486
And so the new renderer
actually allowed

00:13:17.486 --> 00:13:19.235
us to do much, much more.

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:20.610
And we took full
advantage of it.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.620
ANDREW STANTON: So
we do it everywhere.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.152
We basically-- he
did it everywhere.

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:24.360
ELLEN DEGENERES: Coffee pots.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.235
LINDSEY COLLINS: Yes.

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:28.605
Every possible container has
glass and reflection in it.

00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:29.810
KEVIN VLK: I gotcha.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.470
An so are there
any-- Andrew, what

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.620
I loved was-- I remember
watching-- I'm a huge Pixar

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.420
fan, animation fan-- and I loved
watching, in the first one,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.540
some of the making of it.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.834
And you kind of tacked
onto this flashback thing

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.250
in the first
"Finding Nemo," where

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.850
you want to do flashbacks and
tell the story through that.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.808
And it's a great plot
device that you used here

00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:53.044
throughout the movie, as
well, to tell Dory's story.

00:13:53.044 --> 00:13:54.460
Was that something
you immediately

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.440
knew that you wanted to do
or did that come organically?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.710
ANDREW STANTON: Oh, that
is an 11th hour idea that

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.030
saved our butts on this movie.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.614
We came up with it last fall.

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:03.030
But a lot of people don't know
"Nemo" didn't come together

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.300
till the last six
or eight months.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.730
All the pieces
were there, we just

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.938
didn't have them lined right.

00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:10.640
And so I feel like this movie's
in good hands in a weird way

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.220
because it did the same pattern.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.734
But yeah, the first
movie-- all that tragedy

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.150
you see at the beginning of
"Finding Nemo," all that loss,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.480
was actually flashbacks
that were doled out.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.430
And it just didn't work, you
didn't sympathize with Marlin.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.170
But once we saw his
tragedy at the front--

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.586
we moved it all to the front--
and suddenly, all the lines

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:28.690
we'd always had played fine.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.960
Everybody empathized with him.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.320
And then this was the reverse.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.040
We had too much
information at the front.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.623
And then when we
doled it out and made

00:14:35.623 --> 00:14:38.940
it memories that Dory has
and is triggered as she goes,

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.170
it became like the inverse
of the first movie.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.444
And it just felt right.

00:14:42.444 --> 00:14:44.110
It was Jason Bourne
style, it was great.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.790
ALBERT BROOKS: You can take
that into your own life.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.189
Start every conversation
with your saddest story.

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.230
ANDREW STANTON: It works.

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:54.910
KEVIN VLK: And so
now, we're going

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.530
to cue an exclusive clip
here from "Finding Dory,"

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.411
so let's cue it up.

00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.020
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.360
-Can you please keep
it down over there?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.510
My head hurts.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.340
-Who's that?

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.650
-That's my neighbor, Bailey.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.030
He was brought in
with a head injury.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.210
-I know you're talking
about me, Destiny.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.960
-He thinks he can't
use his echolocation,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.400
but I've overheard
the doctor's talking.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.870
-I'm right here.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.880
-There's not a thing
wrong with him.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.690
-I hear every word
you're saying about me.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.580
-What's echolocation?

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.150
-Well, Bailey's head is
supposed to put out a call

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.200
and the echo helps him
find objects far away.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.900
Oh, but apparently,
he's still healing.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.400
-Now I know you're
talking about me.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.785
I really can't echolocate.

00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:31.410
-I cannot have this
conversation again.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:31.951
I just can't.

00:15:31.951 --> 00:15:34.114
-I hit my head very
hard out there.

00:15:34.114 --> 00:15:35.030
See how swollen it is?

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.870
-Your head is
supposed to be big.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.900
You're a beluga.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.874
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:38.874 --> 00:15:43.257
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:47.310
KEVIN VLK: So Ty
and Kaitlin, those

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.802
are your guys' characters--
Bailey and Destiny.

00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:51.260
Did you guys record
it all together

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.819
to get some of the
dynamic and improv?

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:54.610
TY BURRELL: We did.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.280
That was--

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.446
KAITLIN OLSON: That was fun.

00:15:56.446 --> 00:15:58.079
We got to do two
or three together.

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.620
You know, mostly
you're just in there

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.990
by yourself with these guys.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.740
TY BURRELL: Right.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.657
ANDREW STANTON: Again.

00:16:03.657 --> 00:16:05.698
KAITLIN OLSON: But we got
to do a couple together

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.710
and it was really fun.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.293
Because we're actors, we're used
to working with-- these guys,

00:16:09.293 --> 00:16:10.293
by the way, are amazing.

00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:12.167
TY BURRELL: They're too
smart for us, though.

00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:13.650
It's much-- I'm always look--

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.260
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah, it's
better to work with dumb people.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:14.810
TY BURRELL: Yeah.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.410
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.880
TY BURRELL: She was looking
for an idiot and she found one.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.300
KAITLIN OLSON: That's right.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.508
It makes me more comfortable.

00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:21.230
It makes me feel smarter.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.004
TY BURRELL: Yeah, that was
actually-- that was new for me.

00:16:25.004 --> 00:16:26.420
I haven't done a
ton of animation,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.610
but the chance to go in and
be in the room with, well,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.880
Kaitlin, in particular,
who's so funny.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.569
The whole process
is so collaborative.

00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:40.110
Obviously, we're
not really tinkering

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.170
with any of the major writing.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.550
But these guys
are just so smart.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.351
And so much changes
as you're doing it

00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:49.469
that when we were able to do
it together, it really felt--

00:16:49.469 --> 00:16:51.010
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah,
just the freedom

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.343
to play around a little bit
and see what else was there.

00:16:53.343 --> 00:16:54.064
TY BURRELL: Yeah.

00:16:54.064 --> 00:16:54.980
KEVIN VLK: It's great.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.920
We're going to bring up one
of our YouTube top creators,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.190
sWooZie, to ask some
questions that he got

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.460
from our social media handle.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.971
So let's bring him up.

00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:07.338
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:07.338 --> 00:17:08.219
SWOOZIE: Hi.

00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:08.760
Check, check.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.626
How's it going, guys?

00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:10.032
KAITLIN OLSON: Hi.

00:17:10.032 --> 00:17:10.740
TY BURRELL: Good.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.579
SWOOZIE: So we asked a lot
of our YouTube subscribers

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.099
and the YouTube peoples
out there some questions.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.690
And a lot of them are
coming toward you, Andrew.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.630
They want to know how you
go about selecting voices

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.589
for your movies.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.780
ANDREW STANTON: Oh, well,
everybody knows the term

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.200
that the camera loves them.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.477
They're very photogenic.

00:17:30.477 --> 00:17:32.060
But I like to say
there's a term where

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.430
the microphone loves them.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.763
There are people that just
have voices that you can just

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.430
hang a character on.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.540
And sitting in front of you are
five amazing examples-- or six,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.040
I'm sorry.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.900
I can't count today.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.930
Six examples--

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:44.970
TY BURRELL: Was I the one
you weren't thinking of?

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.260
ANDREW STANTON: Yeah, I
wasn't thinking of you.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.845
LINDSEY COLLINS: The microphone
does not love you, Ty.

00:17:47.845 --> 00:17:48.270
I'm sorry.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.240
TY BURRELL: There are five
people in front of you.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:50.980
ANDREW STANTON: No, four.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.710
No, wait a minute.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.890
Three.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.890
LINDSEY COLLINS: I'm not
going to say which is--

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.850
TY BURRELL: One guy who
just tries super hard.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.960
He's just a hard working guy.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.210
ANDREW STANTON: But it's true.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.780
Like, when you want to-- I
started out as an animator,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.285
so I really recognize when
you hear a voice that you just

00:18:08.285 --> 00:18:09.920
can't help but project
a character on.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.240
You can't help want
to see acting from out

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.170
of a different character.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.850
And so you end up with
these lists sometimes.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.930
Ellen, herself, was
somebody I wasn't thinking

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.780
of at the time when I was really
in the early days of writing

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.571
on "Finding Nemo," and
then I heard her off

00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:31.910
of a television set and
boom, it suddenly matched.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.780
I'd been a fan of
Albert's ever since I

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.632
can remember, going
to all of his movies

00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:38.090
and listening to
his comedy albums.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.381
And so I was waiting for the
right role to fall for that.

00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:42.880
And then, Kaitlin--
same thing-- I'd

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.370
sort of been a fan
of her voice, and Ty.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.890
And Hayden, I discovered.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.330
And Eugene-- all
these are people

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.474
that I've just been fans
of hearing and I just go,

00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:51.390
they would be perfect.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.079
But you're just waiting
for the right character

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:56.620
that you're coming up with and
hope that somebody else hasn't

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.782
grabbed them before you do.

00:18:57.782 --> 00:18:59.240
SWOOZIE: That's
another thing, too.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.690
On YouTube, a lot of us are
one-man production teams

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.076
and a lot of us do animation.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.450
So there's a lot of people
wondering how do we start off?

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.830
Anybody that wants
to be involved

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.445
with animation, the process.

00:19:09.445 --> 00:19:10.820
Just out the gate,
what would you

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.240
recommend, as far as programs,
for anybody starting out?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.656
ANDREW STANTON:
God, I don't know.

00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:15.770
I mean, I'm too old now.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.350
I don't know.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.002
I started out with
pencil and paper.

00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:19.210
I still use pencil and paper.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.930
I don't know if anybody
knows what that is, but.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.750
SWOOZIE: Old school,
like Stone Age stuff.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.666
ANDREW STANTON: All I
can say is it's so easy.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:27.770
I mean, now you can make
a movie in your house.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.840
I had to steal stuff when
I did it to get movies

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.400
made in my backyard and stuff.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.887
So I'd just say, do it.

00:19:35.887 --> 00:19:37.220
Grab whatever you can and do it.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.066
There's nothing stopping
you, so just do it.

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:42.690
SWOOZIE: This one
was popping up a lot.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.580
We can go on to-- all right.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.140
What about other
animated Disney films--

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.520
if you could be in any of those
other animated Disney films,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.000
what movie would
you want to be in?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.916
KAITLIN OLSON: I'm a
huge fan of all the Pixar

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:56.580
movies and particularly
all of Andrew's movies.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.600
I was a huge fan of "WALL-E"
and all the "Toy Stories."

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.940
Those were just-- I watched
those before I had kids

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.912
and then my little
boys love those movies.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.620
So those are the ones
that are always on.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.722
And so when I got
the call about this,

00:20:08.722 --> 00:20:10.180
I was like, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.340
I don't care what
I'm playing, but yes.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.841
Whatever.

00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:14.798
ALBERT BROOKS: I'd like
to give the candlestick

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.350
a go in "Beauty and the Beast."

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.150
ANDREW STANTON: Nice.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.610
Even the Broadway version?

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.800
ALBERT BROOKS: No.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.167
Not matinees.

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:25.500
SWOOZIE: What about you, Hayden?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.490
Any other movie--
"Aladdin," "Lion King,"

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.382
any of those that
you'd want to be in?

00:20:29.382 --> 00:20:30.840
HAYDEN ROLENCE: I
don't really know

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.090
if I'd want to be in any
other movie besides this one.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.002
SWOOZIE: Good answer.

00:20:34.002 --> 00:20:35.210
LINDSEY COLLINS: Good answer.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.260
That's the answer.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.310
SWOOZIE: Your check
is in the mail.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.351
LINDSEY COLLINS: You win.

00:20:38.351 --> 00:20:39.420
SWOOZIE: Bonus.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.292
Ellen, what about you?

00:20:41.292 --> 00:20:42.500
ELLEN DEGENERES: Same answer.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.859
I would never--

00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:44.900
SWOOZIE: This is the one.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.400
ELLEN DEGENERES: I thought Dory
was great in "Finding Nemo."

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.500
Joy in "Inside Out"
would have been fun.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.390
I liked Joy.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.250
I mean, I'm very
happy being Dory.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.356
Eugene, anybody?

00:21:00.356 --> 00:21:03.380
EUGENE LEVY: No,
I-- the thing of it

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.970
is, really, these pictures--
all the Pixar animations--

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.560
are so incredibly great.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.600
And the process is
so much fun to do.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.230
I mean, I don't know
if anybody really

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.320
understands exactly what you
do when you're in a studio,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.960
but it's really quite amazing.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:29.500
And when you get to work
with incredibly talented,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.580
genius people here,
where you kind of just

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:39.060
give a line and they-- as you're
giving the line in the scene--

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.850
they kind of know--
they're making changes

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.636
as they're going.

00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:43.010
Try it this way,
try it this way.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.770
And it's all happening
in milliseconds.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.460
And it's an incredibly
exciting way to work because--

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.710
ANDREW STANTON: You also got
to act with Diane Keaton,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.444
so that's probably
why he's on a high.

00:21:53.444 --> 00:21:55.360
EUGENE LEVY: I know, my
wife isn't here today.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.790
That was kind of fun, too.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.120
But yeah, I would say
it's a really fun way

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.380
to work, doing animated films.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.910
And when the scripts
and the stories

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.210
are as exciting
as "Finding Dory,"

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.972
then you consider
yourself very lucky.

00:22:15.972 --> 00:22:16.796
SWOOZIE: OK.

00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:17.310
Awesome.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.980
That's all the time
I have for you guys.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.830
We have some crowd
questions later,

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.292
but I'm going to
toss it back here.

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:23.750
Thanks so much for
your time, guys.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.552
ALL: Thank you.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:25.802
LINDSEY COLLINS: Nice t-shirt.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.300
KEVIN VLK: Thank you, sWooZie.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.550
We're going to take
some audience questions.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.466
I think they're going
to start lining up here.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.760
Here we go.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.752
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:22:40.752 --> 00:22:41.744
Wait, can you hear me?

00:22:41.744 --> 00:22:42.240
You can hear me.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.790
I kind of want to ask
a question of everyone,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.924
but I'm going to focus on Dory.

00:22:44.924 --> 00:22:45.890
So don't be offended.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.550
It's all good, you're all cool.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.770
My question to you
is in "Finding Dory,"

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.270
one of the mantras for me
was "just keep swimming,"

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.770
which is-- I'm a plus-sized
health and fitness motivator,

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.270
so I help women like me start
and re-engage in fitness.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.436
So to me, it's about
the journey-- embracing

00:23:00.436 --> 00:23:01.770
the journey-- just keep moving.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.270
No matter what
happens, just keep

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.270
going while loving you are
and the body you're in.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.270
So what I'd be
curious to know is

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.550
what is your life lesson
coming out of "Finding Dory"?

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.040
Did you have that moment-- that
"just keep swimming" moment--

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.120
that really stood out to you?

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.858
ELLEN DEGENERES: Well, my life
is-- that's my motto, as well.

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:20.762
AUDIENCE: No, it's my motto.

00:23:20.762 --> 00:23:21.670
ELLEN DEGENERES: OK, it's yours.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.324
I'm now--

00:23:22.324 --> 00:23:23.240
AUDIENCE: We'll share.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.900
ELLEN DEGENERES: --so sorry
to now steal it from you.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.430
Second lawsuit.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.510
AUDIENCE: I'm aggressive.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.730
ELLEN DEGENERES: Well, it
was kind of like my motto.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.517
It wasn't completely my motto.

00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:40.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.570
Because I think if
anyone knows my story,

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.780
it is-- I had to
just keep swimming.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.100
My life has been a
lot of challenges

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.790
and a lot of different
curves and roadblocks.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.110
And so I think that's
a great-- you know,

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.110
I didn't come up with
"just keep swimming,"

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.580
but it has turned out to be
something that a lot of people

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.400
can hold onto and
use in their life.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.490
And so I would say
just everything.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.490
I think I am so blessed
and lucky that that's

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.610
part of my character, that I get
to say, "just keep swimming,"

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.860
for whoever you are and
whatever you're going through.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.276
AUDIENCE: Well,
thank you for that

00:24:15.276 --> 00:24:16.750
because it's a big life changer.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.874
ELLEN DEGENERES: Thank you.

00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:18.865
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:19.990
ELLEN DEGENERES: Thank you.

00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:26.178
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:24:26.178 --> 00:24:29.510
I just wanted to know what
your favorite aspect of working

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.180
on this film has
been, whether it's

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.350
recording, fleshing out the
story, promoting it, et cetera?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.850
Of anyone.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.308
LINDSEY COLLINS: You've had
the big-- you've had, probably,

00:24:39.308 --> 00:24:40.910
the most to choose from, yeah.

00:24:42.935 --> 00:24:44.310
ANDREW STANTON:
Honestly, working

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.230
with the actors is
probably my favorite,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.890
simply because they're
sitting in front of me.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.870
No, it's actually
because it's the one

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.897
part of this process over four
years that's spontaneous--

00:24:55.897 --> 00:24:57.980
where you're actually doing
a lot of give and take

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.610
in the moment and you're in the
now and you're just reacting.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.780
And I find that so exciting.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.200
I get very little of it
working in animated pictures,

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.610
so I'm pretty hungry for it
when we do these sessions.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.193
I know they're
grueling, they're long.

00:25:11.193 --> 00:25:12.960
These guys stand
around for four hours

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.418
and they're just
on the whole time.

00:25:14.418 --> 00:25:16.720
So they're basically
doing a one-person show.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.440
And a lot of them--
I know I've said

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.130
that it's the most tiring thing
they do simply because there's

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.060
no breaks built into it.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:30.259
But it's pretty invigorating,
it's pretty exciting to me.

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:32.050
CHRISTINA CALPH: Hello,
I'm Christina Calph

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.730
from the channel
Bad Girl's Ball.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.657
This question is for everyone.

00:25:36.657 --> 00:25:38.740
A lot of people in the
audience, including myself,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.120
are content creators
here at YouTube.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.880
And I just would like to
ask you all what advice

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.590
you'd like to give us
with building our careers.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.670
TY BURRELL: Get super lucky.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.420
Get weirdly lucky.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.500
CHRISTINA CALPH:
That's horrible advice.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.770
Horrible advice.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.454
TY BURRELL: I apologize.

00:25:59.454 --> 00:26:00.870
ALBERT BROOKS:
Well, someone asked

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:06.320
a question earlier to
Andrew about how do you

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.940
animate something?

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.800
And you know, I would say
the answer's the same,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.310
and that's a story.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.800
You start with
that-- you start--

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800
you're a content creator.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.390
So you don't start
with the actors,

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.510
you don't start with the set,
you start with the story.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.620
You start with the content.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.620
And if you have
a great story, it

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.560
can fit 100 different
ways to tell it.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.550
Animation, it can
fit live action.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.700
So you know, think
of great stories.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.840
Just stories that
you haven't heard.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.520
I would say that's a
basis to start with.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.740
ELLEN DEGENERES: I
would say authenticity.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.150
I think whatever-- I think if
something's happened to you,

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.150
and the same thing that Albert's
saying-- if you have a story,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.730
you're probably
not the only person

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.220
with that story, whatever it is.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.490
And sometimes the
best stuff comes out

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.490
of the hardest stuff
and the worst stuff

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.700
that you've gone through.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.330
So if you've actually
experienced something,

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.740
I don't think anybody should
hide any kind of truth.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.760
So whatever you have witnessed
or experienced or gone through,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.170
find a way to express that
and find a way to stay.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.070
And I think people read
truth and authenticity.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.980
And I think that's the
most important thing

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.770
for establishing anything.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.020
ALBERT BROOKS: And even if
you don't have something,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.491
you must have a horrible uncle.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:32.550
CHRISTINA CALPH:
Thank you very much.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.150
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.760
I know a lot of you have
experience with improv

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.900
and just being
quick on your feet,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.780
and I was wondering
how much room there

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.970
was for improvisation.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.800
It seems like a lot, from
what you've been saying,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.680
but how that
improvisation affects

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.510
the process and
the final product

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.310
and how it might be different
from other animated films,

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.975
as it was with "Finding Dory."

00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:04.350
ALBERT BROOKS:
Well, I don't know

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.440
compared to-- other animated
films are different.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.110
Some of "The Simpsons"
that I've done,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.980
the whole thing was improv'ed.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.280
There's always a
solid script here.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:22.140
And the thing about Andrew is
that once he gets those words,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.120
if you're willing
to keep going, he'll

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.930
take every word in the
English language out of you.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:35.310
So by the end of the day,
you've given a lot of choices.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.550
Hopefully, there are some
choices he didn't think of.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.260
And then they have
to-- the thing

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.200
I'm most grateful for is I
don't have to listen back

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.211
to these recording sessions.

00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:48.210
ANDREW STANTON: Exactly.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.760
ALBERT BROOKS: Because after
9,000 takes, I just say,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.730
you choose.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.320
ANDREW STANTON: Every person
here-- there's at least one

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.990
or two lines, if
not more, that are

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.260
in the finished movie of
things that they came up

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.880
with on the set that I
would have never written.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.255
ALBERT BROOKS:
But you know, it's

00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:04.030
generally-- in
animated films-- I

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.220
think it's generally welcome
because it's at the stage where

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.610
it's still-- you're not
coming into a finished movie

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.340
where you have to fit the
exact words in a mouth.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.370
So they, generally, if you
can do it, they welcome it.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.420
AUDIENCE: This is a
question for Ellen and Dory.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.667
How did you learn to
(IMITATING DORY) speak whale?

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:31.000
ELLEN DEGENERES: Well, that's
a very good, first of all.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.540
I was in Hawaii and
there was a woman

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.090
who was staying in the house
next to the house that I

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.280
was renting.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:49.140
And she was doing yoga--
like, crazy yoga on rocks--

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.614
and listening to whale sounds.

00:29:53.614 --> 00:29:55.280
I didn't know you
could buy that record,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.900
but there's a record that
just is whale sounds.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:04.310
And I was listening to it and
it just was like the most--

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.279
the weirdest thing I'd
ever seen in my life.

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.570
And I just thought, a wave
is going to take her out any

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.239
minute and it didn't.

00:30:10.239 --> 00:30:12.280
I kind of wanted it to
happen because it was just

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.470
so weird that she's
on her head on a rock.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.360
And so anyway, I just knew
what a whale sounded like

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.761
and I didn't think I'd ever need
to use it in life, but I did.

00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:23.760
ANDREW STANTON: I was so
scared to ask her this.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.260
I thought, this is
going to be the thing.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.460
This is going to be--
this is on "Nemo"--

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.000
this is going to be the
thing that makes her go, OK,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.590
I'm done.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.840
I'm not in this movie anymore.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.590
I'm out.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.870
And I'm like, would you
be willing to speak whale?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.840
And she told me this
whole story right away.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.200
And just went right into it.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.420
ELLEN DEGENERES: Oh, I can
speak whale, all right.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.448
I've been waiting.

00:30:38.448 --> 00:30:40.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.100
So that's it.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.590
And it's not easy.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.410
I mean, you did it very well.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.120
But if you have to
do it a lot, it's

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.974
very tough on your vocal chords.

00:30:47.974 --> 00:30:49.140
You have to kind of warm up.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.630
ANDREW STANTON: Kaitlin
had to do it a lot.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.046
Because her
character's the reason

00:30:52.046 --> 00:30:53.820
Dory knows how to speak whale.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.320
KAITLIN OLSON: Yeah,
I did it a lot.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.920
They'd look at me and
go, um, one last thing.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.150
I'm like, oh, OK,
let's just do it.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.757
Get me some tea.

00:31:03.757 --> 00:31:04.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.680
ELLEN DEGENERES: Thanks.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.145
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.062
AUDIENCE: Hello, my
question is for Ellen.

00:31:15.062 --> 00:31:16.950
What was the
craziest moment that

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:21.399
happened on set when recording
the movie "Finding Dory"?

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:22.940
ELLEN DEGENERES:
The craziest moment?

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.292
I don't know if there
was a crazy moment, but--

00:31:25.292 --> 00:31:26.750
ANDREW STANTON:
Your back went out.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.740
Your back went out.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.660
LINDSEY COLLINS: You
couldn't even stand.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.380
Your back went out.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.070
ELLEN DEGENERES: Oh, I
don't even remember that.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.220
We did this for three
years, so what happened?

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:32.580
ANDREW STANTON: You
came in like this.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.800
LINDSEY COLLINS: When you came
in, you couldn't stand up.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.640
It was like right before
you came into the session

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.756
and you still had to do a
four-hour session with us.

00:31:37.756 --> 00:31:40.256
And we were like, we're really
sorry, could you do one more?

00:31:40.256 --> 00:31:41.507
ELLEN DEGENERES: That's right.

00:31:41.507 --> 00:31:43.339
That's-- well, I don't
know if it was crazy.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:43.990
It was sad.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.410
LINDSEY COLLINS: Sad.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:44.780
Sad.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.700
ELLEN DEGENERES: It's
one of the saddest.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.250
Do you want a sad
moment or a crazy?

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.040
Yeah.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.580
I forgot.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.572
And then I literally--
I had to still do it.

00:31:50.572 --> 00:31:52.030
ALBERT BROOKS:
Another crazy moment

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.510
where you got in that
horrible accident.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.340
ELLEN DEGENERES: Yeah,
remember that time when I was--

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:55.920
ANDREW STANTON: So crazy.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.570
LINDSEY COLLINS:
It was so crazy.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.620
Crazy Ellen.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.510
ELLEN DEGENERES: Yeah.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.340
I was going to
say-- this is just

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.190
an excuse to complain about it.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.870
They-- because Dory is
always either left behind

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.070
or catching up to people.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.240
So there's a lot of
hyperventilating,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.770
like breathing really just--
(HYPERVENTILATING) guys,

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.930
it's that or it's
like, scream-- ah!

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:18.674
A lot of those.

00:32:18.674 --> 00:32:20.090
And you'd think
that once-- I just

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.880
did that-- you could use that
throughout the whole film,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.870
right?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.670
But I had to do it all the time.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.220
I had to-- and I was
just like, don't you

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.766
really have the
(PANTING) already?

00:32:29.766 --> 00:32:30.890
So there was a lot of that.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.620
And when you see this film, and
you should see it many times,

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.237
you will see that I don't do
it that often in the film.

00:32:38.237 --> 00:32:39.820
And I don't know why
he needed me to--

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.930
LINDSEY COLLINS: That
was your first comment.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.680
That was like-- Ellen was
like, I really loved it.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.047
Where was all the gasping
and hyperventilating?

00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:48.630
Literally, that was
her first question

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.588
right out of her mouth.

00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:50.567
Where is it?

00:32:50.567 --> 00:32:51.900
ALBERT BROOKS: It's in the toys.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.816
ELLEN DEGENERES: Yeah.

00:32:52.816 --> 00:32:54.010
I see.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.227
That's how they get you.

00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:56.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.776
ELLEN DEGENERES: Thanks.

00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:01.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.700
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.960
Who came up with the idea for
Sia to cover "Unforgettable"

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.627
and how did that all come about?

00:33:10.627 --> 00:33:11.710
LINDSEY COLLINS: Oh, gosh.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.418
ANDREW STANTON: I
don't know who exactly.

00:33:13.418 --> 00:33:15.700
LINDSEY COLLINS: Well, you
always wanted the song.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.440
That was always.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.850
ANDREW STANTON: I said they
got to have one syllable.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.308
That's the only
thing I care about.

00:33:19.308 --> 00:33:19.980
One syllable.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.490
ELLEN DEGENERES:
And we don't want

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.220
to know what she looks like.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.590
LINDSEY COLLINS: No, but
the song was always there.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.576
Like, you always wanted that
song at the end of the movie.

00:33:27.576 --> 00:33:29.200
And we knew it was
going to be covered.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.991
We didn't want the
original, we wanted it--

00:33:30.991 --> 00:33:33.260
ANDREW STANTON: Robbie
Robertson-- Robertson-- Robbie

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.940
Williams had actually
covered "Beyond the Sea"

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.540
on the first movie.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.490
And so I wanted it to
feel like that same sort

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.010
of complementary modern day
singer plus an old classic.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.220
And Sia was pretty much
on the top of the list.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.010
LINDSEY COLLINS: And then
we were talking to you,

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.640
and we were like,
come on, Ellen.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.098
ELLEN DEGENERES:
I was in a session

00:33:49.098 --> 00:33:52.250
and they said the song is
going to be "Unforgettable"

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.700
and they said we're
thinking of Sia.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.130
And I got my phone out--

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:56.170
LINDSEY COLLINS: Seriously.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.545
She was like, let's see how
fast we can make this happen.

00:33:58.545 --> 00:34:00.710
ELLEN DEGENERES:
I said right now.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.780
And so I texted her and she
was like, are you kidding me?

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.300
Of course.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.250
I would love to do that.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.333
So it was like that quick.

00:34:06.333 --> 00:34:07.880
She just was so excited.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.300
LINDSEY COLLINS: Turns out,
when you know Ellen Degeneres--

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.929
ANDREW STANTON: Good to
be a friend of Ellen.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:11.860
LINDSEY COLLINS: Can
happen pretty quickly.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.194
TY BURRELL: I was texting
with Sia, too, and she never--

00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:16.818
KAITLIN OLSON: That's the thing
is she was texting with me when

00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:17.840
she got that text.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.210
And I was like, all right,
go, Ellen needs you.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.202
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:24.202 --> 00:34:25.327
KEVIN VLK: Thank you, guys.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.830
So a couple things
for the audience, too.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.800
Google also partnered
with Pixar and Disney

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.900
to basically give you guys
a lot of really cool content

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.050
on the knowledge panel.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.239
If you type in "Finding
Dory" on Google search,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.469
you'll see over on
the right-hand side

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:44.699
in the knowledge panel,
there's a whole bunch of stuff

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.915
that Disney's been
doing-- trailers and gifts

00:34:46.915 --> 00:34:48.040
and a whole bunch of stuff.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:48.940
It's been really cool stuff.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.580
Thank you guys so much
for providing that.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.100
You guys probably didn't
know, but it's there.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.340
And now you guys know.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.340
So check that out.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.179
Also, to celebrate
"Finding Dory,"

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.380
and today being
World Oceans Day,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.950
everyone's tuning in just to
help our friends of the sea,

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.780
so there's a donate button
in the Livestream links

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.150
you'll see there.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.287
And after this, as well, to the
Wildlife Conservation Society--

00:35:12.287 --> 00:35:14.870
ALBERT BROOKS: Oh, I thought you
literally had friends at sea,

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.730
I was scared.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.020
KEVIN VLK: Friends in the sea.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.870
Yeah.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.050
To help save rays,
sharks, and other wildlife

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.290
