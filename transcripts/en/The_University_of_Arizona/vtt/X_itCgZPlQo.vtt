00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.440
Initially your body has a lot
of compensation mechanisms

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.580
to keep it at its
homeostasis-- that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.770
temperature that it likes to
be where, your enzymes work

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.650
optimally.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.370
So the things that your
body does to compensate

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.630
includes sweating, and
dilating your blood vessels.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.510
But at a certain point
as the temperature rises,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.650
you can't dilate your
blood vessels anymore

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.090
and you run out of liquid
to sweat, and at that point

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.470
your blood pressure goes down.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.160
And then you may not get enough
blood flow to your brain.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.930
And as you get
even hotter you're

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.140
going to have dysfunction
of the different enzymes

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.520
in your different organs.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.670
So in addition to dehydration
related kidney failure,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.130
you can have kidney
failure just from the heat.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.470
As well as liver
problems and problems

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.270
with your blood clotting.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.640
So if people have
heat exposure and they

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.310
become dizzy, light headed,
confused, slurred speech,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.270
or weak it's very important
to seek medical attention.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.640
The number one tip
I have is that we

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.050
should respect the desert.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.210
We live here in the
desert which is beautiful

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.010
but it's also dangerous.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.430
And we should take time to
be mindful of the activities

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.310
that we're planning and
what kind of heat exposure

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.790
we're going to have.
