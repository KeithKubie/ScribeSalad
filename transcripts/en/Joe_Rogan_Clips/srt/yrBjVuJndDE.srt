1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,190
The Joe Rogan experience coastal
bears. That's the big ones. You know,

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,170
brown bears and grizzly
bears are the same thing,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,680
but brown bears are way bigger and the
reason why they're way biggers cause they

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,281
live on the coast.

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:15,630
So just eating fish and dead whales
launched and anything else they can get

6
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:18,390
there. Fuck. Gorging on fucking
fatty, fatty, heavy foods.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,870
There's an awful video and awful Jamie,

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,871
I'll find it of a grizzly that's
pulling black bear cubs out of a den and

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,680
killing them and eating them.
And the mother is trying to stop them.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,070
He's trying to stop the grizzly from
eating her babies and he just swats her

11
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,480
away. Like she ain't shit. I gotta
say it's awful, dude. You shouldn't,

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,620
shouldn't play it. It definitely can't
play it and you shouldn't even watch it.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,470
I'm gonna Watch the screens
that they make and it takes,

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,490
it's a long ass video and she's trying to
fight him off, but he's like, fuck you,

15
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm eating your babies.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,920
That's one thing that bothers me the
most about the anthropomorphization that

17
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:05,450
people do with animals is
that their stance on bears is,

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,350
I don't want people to hate bears,

19
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,980
but I want people to know what a bear
really is versus what they think it is.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,671
I think they're sweet.

21
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,880
They eat honey and they're sweet and
they're nice and they don't really fuck

22
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,600
shit up. They, they're amazing.
I'm a big fan of bears,

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,740
but they all cannibals. They're
all Canam. Bears make me feel like,

24
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,340
of course there were dinosaurs. Bears
are like, that's just a fucking dinosaur.

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,280
Well, it's a a beast as what it is.
It's a beast in the purest sense.

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,260
Any beast make reminds me that we
definitely had had to have dinosaurs,

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,730
that that was just a small dinosaur.
Now nothing like a dinosaur is far, far,

28
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,580
far for Fart creepier.
They don't have any hair.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,530
I don't trust anything with no hair.
You don't have any fucking hair?

30
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,030
I have a little,
I got on my face ugly,

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,720
but I don't trust anything that like
his hair, lips, any hair on its body.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,740
What other animals or what do you mean
like fish or hairless like a snake.

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,500
Everything in the waters hairless.
Yeah. I'll trust those Fox. None of it.

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,460
None of it. That bottlenose
dolphin, Nebraska.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,290
Pinterest found you don't trust that
Dolphin. That's a weapon from Russia.

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,990
That's awesome.
They want to put a bomb on that thing.

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,040
I've had a Russian strap on. It's back.
That's the whole Dan spoke Russian.

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,790
It had a Russian strap on its back.

39
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,320
Stope like the whale that
they're talking about.

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,520
They think the Russians had trained it
to get close to boats to that it could

41
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,570
hit the boat and blow it up.
Stope you don't care. I care.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,980
Some things are cool.
I'm not rendering of t rex hair.

43
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,080
I didn't see that live here,
but I thought they think it has feathers.

44
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,690
I don't have to think those are fed.
Look at that. It has red hair by the way.

45
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,730
At the front of its face.
Well, that's the other thing.

46
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:39,390
They think that it might've been
because they think they might've been

47
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:43,500
scavengers. T rex was a ginger with
freckles. Where did you find this?

48
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:48,300
Jamie's holes. You fucking Dick Gould.
That no ginger's that are assholes.

49
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,950
How about a done story? They're all over
the place. Judges that are assholes,

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,660
you can't not find,
look at this.

51
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:58,290
Like you might have had facial
features like a vulture.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,630
They think it might have been red in the
face cause they really don't have any

53
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,020
idea what I mean when you see these
colored drawings, they just take chances.

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,700
They just, they're all made up.
The um, university of Bozeman,

55
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,150
not the University of Bozeman,
the natural history museum in Bozeman,

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Montana has a raptor that on one
side of it they had feathers on it.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,440
Try to give you like an
alternate perspective of
what it might've looked like.

58
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,570
So they had this raptor and in one
side of it it looked just like an,

59
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,300
like an evil bird.
It's really cool cause they,

60
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,800
they know now that's what it looked like.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,390
They know now that a lot of
dinosaurs had had feathers.

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,100
They've actually got fossils
of dinosaurs with feathers.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,960
So they know that the idea
that all dinosaurs were
these reptile looking things

64
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,160
is incorrect. Some of them literally were
birds. So the birds that you see today,

65
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,350
whether it's a peacock or
chicken or something like that,

66
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,490
they're fucking dinosaurs.
Yeah. That's what that is.

67
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,410
It's a dinosaur that survive are the
ones that are bigger than a chicken.

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,630
Didn't really make it, but the ones,
you know, why did the small ones maker,

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,920
they will hide that when the impact of
the crater a hit the world that it was so

70
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,730
devastating. They killed
almost everything. Yeah.
Phil and whatever was left,

71
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,970
whatever, scrounging, scavenging
little creature that was left,

72
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,970
evolved and became us.
We used to be a mole.

73
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,810
We used to be like a shrew
65 million years ago. That's
what these people, these,

74
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,160
these nonbelievers,
this is what they think.

75
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,460
You think it's ridiculous that
you think you came from a monkey,

76
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,940
you to know what they did
from Joe. I know. You know,

77
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,070
this is how crazy these liberals are.

78
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,220
You know that it's crazy to think you
came from monkey believes motherfuckers

79
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,430
take it to another level.
They, they're so crazy.

80
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,770
They think you came from a shrew
[inaudible] you were a lack,

81
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,380
a little mole cannot character.
Yup. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,730
And then that became a monkey and then
add the monkey becomes you all that shit

83
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:52,780
inside of 65 million years.
Get the fuck out of fucking wild.

84
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,170
Crocodiles are a hundred million
years old. So crocodiles are the same.

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,490
The somehow or another we went from being
a fucking true to being a person who

86
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:03,820
knows and loves Jesus and more art shit.
That's it right there.

87
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,810
That's where that thing.
