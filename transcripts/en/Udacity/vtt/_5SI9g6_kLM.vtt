00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.160
That was a big one.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.830
I think your boss would be proud of the
progress you've made on this prototype.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.730
Here's one last request though,
she wants to see two new features.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.790
She doesn't want to hold you back just
create what you think would add the most

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.920
value to this application.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.940
Then, after making sure that your
code quality is up to snuff, and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.060
that your code runs as expected,
your boss, and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.320
the Udacity code reviewers, want to know
what you learned during this process.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.350
In your project repository, we want
you to create a reflections file, and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.960
write about your experiences
working on this.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.610
We want you to answer
the following questions.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.080
How long did you spend
working on this project?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.880
What was the most rewarding
challenge you conquered?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.550
What new features did you build and why?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.330
And where do you still have room for
growth?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.570
Lastly take a step back and
look at what you've just created and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.800
compare this to Toy City One.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.770
It may feel like there's still a long
way to go before you're making web apps.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.690
But just look how far you've come.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540
Keep this momentum up and way to go.
