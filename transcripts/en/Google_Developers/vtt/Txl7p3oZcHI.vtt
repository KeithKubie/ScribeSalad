JEFF POSNICK: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.830
My name is Jeff Posnick.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.930
I'm a member of the YouTube API
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.100
And thanks for joining us
for this week's "YouTube

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.940
Developers Live." Today, we're
going to be focusing on a very

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.600
important topic, and that's
using Google+ identities and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.070
how that interacts with the
YouTube API and things

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.160
developers should know and even
some things that users

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.870
should know.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.410
So we have a special guest with
us today for the show.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.660
That's Sherry Listgarten.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.870
Bring up Sherry.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.040
Hi, Sherry.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.160
And Sherry is a product manager
responsible for

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.490
overseeing the overall
integration between Google+

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.170
and YouTube.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.040
So thanks so much for having
us on the show.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.210
We definitely have
the expert here.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.952
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: I'm happy
to be here, Jeff.

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:56.400
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.990
So for folks who aren't familiar
yet with what we've

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.040
started making available, can
you talk a little bit about

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.070
what you can do with your
Google+ identity and your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.650
YouTube channel and maybe a
little bit of the motivation

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.400
behind the overall project
in making this available?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.870
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Yeah, sure.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.460
That's a really good question.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.980
So let me give a bit
of background.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.480
So before we started doing all
of this linking between

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.000
YouTube identities and Google
identities, a typical YouTube

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.440
user would have a
Google account.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.300
And it would have
two names on it.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.310
It would have sort of a
Google name, which was

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.830
used in Google context.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.240
And it would have a YouTube
name, these strings, the user

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.910
names, which is used in
a YouTube context.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.460
And that's kind of a problematic
situation to be in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.380
for a couple of reasons.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.180
So there are a couple
of problems

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.850
that we want to solve.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.840
And I'll give some examples.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.680
A very basic example's the
YouTube names are very

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.060
restrictive and very ugly.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.010
It has to be this string.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.900
It has to be unique, nobody
else can have.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.430
And people have these kind of
strange YouTube user names,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.330
many whom would rather just
use their name or use

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.650
something like My Great Videos
or something like that.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.570
But a bigger problem is that if
you have one name that you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.400
can use with Google and another
name that you can use

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280
with YouTube, what happens if
we have a feature that uses

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.990
little bits of Google and
little bits of YouTube?

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.370
And we want to build-- we have
tons of great features like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.620
that, where we want to bring
the best of Google into

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.860
YouTube and the best of
YouTube into Google.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.010
We have no idea what to call you
if you have a YouTube name

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.430
and a Google name.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.780
And it's not just that we don't
know what to call you.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.540
But there's potential of
a real privacy leak.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.400
A lot of people are happy having
these two names linked.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.470
A lot of people are not happy
having these two names linked.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.700
And we simply don't
know what to do.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.190
So we can't do anything.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.350
And so we decided that we wanted
to get out of this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.950
state where you have two names
on one account and get into a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.910
state where you have one sort
of Google-wide identity per

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.490
account, so one name
per account.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.400
And you can use that
name everywhere.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.190
So maybe you want to start using
your cool YouTube handle

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.520
that you really like on
other Google products.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.130
That should be fine.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.450
Or maybe you want to use your
Google name, which is Jeff

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.160
Posnick, a nice normal name,
and you want to use that on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.190
YouTube instead of
JPosnick5678 or

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.960
something like that.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.310
JEFF POSNICK: Sure, sure.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.150
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Again, sort
of the main reason why we're

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.700
doing this is to build
cool features.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.830
So maybe you want to integrate
Calendar with YouTube so that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.540
you could schedule an event
and things just show up.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.200
We couldn't do that without
this single identity.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.405
We know what to call you.

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:25.900
You guys may be familiar with
the private share [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.400
Google has fantastic
sharing capability.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.390
YouTube not so much, everything
is public.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.480
But you can now take a video,
if you've merged, and share

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.280
privately and it's a terrific
feature-- with circles or

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.880
individuals.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.010
JEFF POSNICK: I definitely have
been using that a lot for

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.730
home movies and things like that
that I don't necessarily

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.307
want to be broadcast to
the entire world.

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:44.590
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Yeah.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.750
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, so that's
an awesome integration.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.880
And I know that previously we
kind of went through a process

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.760
where we started requiring all
YouTube channels be linked to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.050
just a Google account.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.230
It was not necessarily a Google
account that had a

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.730
Google+ identity,
Google+ profile.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.080
Correct me about some of the
terminology if you have a

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.700
preferred nomenclature
for this.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.960
So how is this type of
integration different than

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.640
that earlier effort to make
sure that everything was

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.870
linked to a Google account?

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.839
SHERRY LISTGARTEN:
Yeah, totally.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.140
So, like you said, the first
part was to get everybody to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.730
sort of link YouTube accounts
and Google accounts, which is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.070
really important.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.380
And that means that now Google
knows that these two

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.730
identities belong to the same
person and the same account.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.600
And we can help you out and
build some things using that.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.300
But it doesn't tell
anybody else.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.380
The rest of the world has
no idea that these

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.020
two things are linked.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.280
And that is really, really
important for some people.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.420
So the difference is that
the account linking--

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.340
get onto one account that
we did before--

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.600
was private, was Google knows
this, YouTube knows this, but

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.260
nobody else knows it.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.130
And what we're doing now is your
public-facing identity,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.590
trying to unify you're
public-facing identity so that

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.400
there's only one of
those per account.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.670
And it can access all the
services and we can

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.850
[INAUDIBLE] these really super
cool new features.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.040
We're announcing another one
coming up at VidCon in a week.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.280
I mean, we have a ton of cool
stuff that we're building once

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.190
we get everybody on a single
identity per account.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.540
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.250
OK, so that certainly makes
sense for the motivation.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.580
And I know that one thing that
kind of adds an extra wrinkle

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.110
that we announced a little while
back but has certainly

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.200
gained more traction is the
ability to not just link a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.080
Google+ profile that's
corresponding to a single

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.860
person but to link a Google+
page identity

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.250
to a YouTube channel.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.780
Can you talk a little bit more
about why we are letting

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.755
people do and why folks might
want to use a Plus page

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:39.062
instead of a single
personal account?

00:05:39.062 --> 00:05:39.510
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Sure.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.900
So, again, our goal is to have
all YouTube users having a

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.930
single Google-wide identity
per account.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.900
If they want to have two
identities, one which is Jeff

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.530
Posnick and one with just Cool
Jeff, that's fine too.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.260
But they're going to be on
two separate accounts.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.790
These accounts may be linked
to each other.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.670
So what is a Google-wide
identity?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.700
I keep talking about this.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.640
Well, OK, so Google identity
is implemented by Google+.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.770
And Google+ has two forms
of identity really.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.940
They have something called a
profile, which corresponds to

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.310
kind of a real world person.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.190
It's usually the name on the
profile's the name that you're

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.210
commonly known by.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.410
It corresponds to
an individual.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.060
But there are a lot of YouTube
users who have kind of

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.440
business or brand that they
want to maintain.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.370
It's not their name.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.160
But it's something like
Mystery Guitar Man or

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.430
something like that.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.040
And that's not a good
use for profile.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.450
But that is a good use
for a Plus page.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.510
So what does a Plus
page give you?

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.150
First of all, it lets
you use any name, a

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.150
business or a brands.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.290
There's no kind of constraints
on it.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.460
But it also gives you
lots of really

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460
cool management features.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.790
So, for example, a lot of people
right now, they have a

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.360
YouTube channel.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.590
They need some help
managing it.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.540
Maybe they go on vacation.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.610
So they share the password to
their account with all of

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.150
their friends.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.980
That's kind of a dangerous
thing to do.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.800
What you can do now with a
Plus page is you can have

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.440
different people managing your
Plus page and helping out with

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.240
your channel without sharing
your password.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.550
And so that's a really
nice feature.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.930
In addition, if you have a
couple of channels, you can

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.310
manage them all from a single
Google account.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.630
So you can switch back and forth
between them and manage

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.800
them all at once.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.190
So there's a lot of nice
features [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.860
JEFF POSNICK: Which is great.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.520
I mean, I know a lot of people
probably just have a bunch--

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.100
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Management
features for people.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.510
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.530
I know a lot of people probably
just have incognito

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.730
windows open and are like, oh
no, I need to sign into this

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.700
account to manage this channel,
or I need to have--

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.010
maybe they're using
Chrome profiles.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.200
And being able to do it all
from a central account

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.940
switcher and just go from one
channel to another really

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.170
makes my life a lot easier.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.480
We do this on our team for our
YouTube Dev channel, for

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.630
instance-- our YouTube for
Developers channel.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.550
SHERRY LISTGARTEN:
People love it.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.990
The other thing is if you're a
creator and you're sharing

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.880
your password, we've asked
creators, we said, who has

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.510
access to your channel?

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.760
They're like, I don't actually
know anymore.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.960
I've shared it with
these roadies.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.640
I've shared it with my
friend's grandmother.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.970
They don't even know who
has access any more.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.410
If you do it in the new way, you
have different managers.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.740
You know exactly
who has access.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.750
You can revoke access.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.850
You can grant access
It's really nice.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.375
You don't have to change your
password and lock everybody

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.630
out all at once.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.480
These are really, really
nice features, really

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.195
important to creators.

00:07:59.195 --> 00:07:59.530
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.410
And a lot of that we also get
as part of using OAuth 2.0,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.960
which we'll talk about a little
bit later when we get

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.870
into maybe more of the technical
portion of the show

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.750
where we talk about how
developers need to kind of

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.110
react to these changes.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.980
So that's great.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.900
OK, and we mentioned that
right now you can link a

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.845
personal or individual's Google+
or Google identity to

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.470
a YouTube channel and also
the Plus page identity.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.530
So that's great.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.940
And, I mean, do you see that
we're going to get to a point

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.240
somewhere in the future where
100% somewhere close to 100%--

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.370
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Absolutely.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.400
So we have well over half of our
active users linked in a

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.504
single identity situation,
which is just fantastic.

00:08:39.504 --> 00:08:40.789
Plus pages are taking off.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.080
I mean, people are so excited
about having access to them,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.770
especially our creators
and partners, but

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.070
lots of other people.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.940
And we hope to have almost
everybody in this single

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.460
identity, one identity per
account situation by the end

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.510
of the year.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.100
Again, if you have want to have
two identities, that's

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.590
totally cool.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.910
But they're going to
be linked together.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.470
They're not going to both be
on a same account anymore.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.590
They're going to be linked
accounts instead.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.780
JEFF POSNICK: And that's
definitely something that

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.570
developers need to
keep in mind.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.656
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: So end
of the year, Jeff.

00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:11.760
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, well, that's
a very ambitious goal.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.880
And I certainly hope
we get there.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.700
And it's something
that developers

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.410
need to keep in mind.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.920
I mean, we're not talking about
some esoteric thing that

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.130
only certain applications might
need to worry about.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.060
We're going to get to a
point where this is

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.700
going to be the norm.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.070
And there are important
implications for developers.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.070
So I actually wanted
to dive in a little

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.830
bit about that, unless--

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.186
is there anything else, Sherry,
that you wanted to

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:38.200
point out coming from a product
point of view before I

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.370
start talking about--

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.090
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: No, we're
really excited about this.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.960
And it is important for our
developers to know that,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.210
again, over half of our users
are already in this state.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.120
And it's really climbing
rapidly.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.050
I think it's over 60% now.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.450
I mean, it's just going
up every day.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.220
JEFF POSNICK: Right.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.180
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Yeah.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.780
JEFF POSNICK: OK, so on the
YouTube Developer Relations

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.330
Team, we're doing our best to
make sure that developers are

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.220
aware of the best practices that
they should be following

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.770
to deal with these accounts
in a graceful way.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.090
So I wanted to point
out a few resources

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.610
that we have available.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.120
First of all, there's a blog
post from last month.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.780
And pull that up
on the screen.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.850
It's called Google+
page identities

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.320
and the YouTube API.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.520
This is a, hopefully,
comprehensive overview of

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.480
things that developers
need to know.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.380
And it goes through some of the
same best practices that

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.510
we're going to be
covering today.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.320
So if you don't watch through
this video, you want a

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.030
reference to refer to later
on, definitely check

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.480
out this blog post.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.830
There's a link in this
video's description.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.590
And the link is part of the
GDL page for this show.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.160
So you could get to the
blog post via that.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.280
And the blog post points out
a few important things.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.990
One of the most important
takeaways is that if you are a

00:10:53.990 --> 00:11:03.350
developer and you are using
OAuth 2.0 to allow users to

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.785
authorize access for your code
to make changes to the account

00:11:06.785 --> 00:11:10.220
or read information about their
account, folks using

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.670
OAuth 2.0 don't really
need to do very much.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.910
There is a small edge case where
if you're using OAuth

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.870
2.0 as part of some Android
applications right now, things

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.910
might not work exactly as
I'm describing here.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.730
But if you're using OAuth 2.0
as part of a web application

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.290
or an iOS application right now,
you'll actually get the

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.940
scenario where the user who's
going through the

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.450
authorization [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.620
gets to determine
which channel--

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.940
and that's associated with a
Google identity-- but which

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.670
YouTube channel they would like
to authorize access to.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.870
So there's a little
screen shot here.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.830
But let me show you in practice
what this looks like

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.400
using our Google
API's Explorer.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.850
So for those not familiar, this
Google API's Explorer is

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.040
a good way of trying
out different API

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.910
calls from a web interface.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.470
And it supports OAuth 2.0
natively as part of this,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.160
which is always nice when
testing things out.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.060
So this is our standard call in
version 3 of the data API

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.440
for getting information about
the current user's channel.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.970
It puts in part snippets and
the mine equals true

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.030
parameters, which means just
give me some basic

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.350
information, the snippet of
information about the current

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.570
user's channel.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.210
Mine equals true means we
need to be authorized.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.190
And I do this right now.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.160
I'm not authorized right now.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.020
I get back this 401 unauthorized
error.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.500
So that means I need to go
through the OAuth 2.0 flow.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.180
Click over here, just say that
those are the scopes I want to

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.200
grant access to.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:44.140
And because I have two different
channels that I have

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.710
access to by virtue of having
my own personal channel--

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.250
that's my Jeffrey Posnick
channel associated with the

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.340
Google+ identity for myself.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.455
And then I happen to be the
manager of this Google+ page,

00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:02.740
+YouTube Dev, and that page
has an associated channel,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.230
YouTube for Developers.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.390
So we detect that
automatically.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.630
We know which Google account
you're currently signed in to.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.450
And we'll know that, OK, there's
two possible channels

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.180
that I might want to
grant access to.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.120
So if I choose this one, you'll
get back an OAuth 2.0

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.910
token that's associated with
my Jeffrey Posnick channel.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.630
If I choose YouTube for
Developers, you get back an

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.520
OAuth 2.0 token that's
associated with that.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.560
So for these purposes, let me
just actually choose YouTube

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.840
for Developers.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.580
And I'm going to go down and
click Execute again.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.270
And you'll see you're getting
back information for the

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.760
YouTube for Developers
channel.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.760
So this is really important.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.970
That little interstitial, that
little channel picker that

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.730
came up, you get
that for free.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.850
And once you get the token back
after the OAuth 2.0 flow

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.070
completes, that token will
behave just like any other

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.220
OAuth 2.0 token.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.060
The authorization is associated
with one specific

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.675
channel at that point.

00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:07.640
You're not getting back an
OAuth 2.0 token that has

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.850
access to both channels and
you have to set special

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.040
delegation parameters or
anything like that.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.870
That's not how this works.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.700
You will get back a normal
OAuth 2.0 token.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.670
Your code, at this point, does
not have to do anything

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.180
special to figure out which role
the user wants to act as

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.300
because they already expressed
their intent as part of the

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.540
OAuth 2.0 flow.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.510
So that actually makes it really
easy for developers to

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.460
kind of seamlessly make use of
this power and not have to

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.570
worry about dealing with the
scenario where there's

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.590
multiple channels.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.140
So that's great.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.500
And that's kind of the
best practice if you

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.500
are using OAuth 2.0.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.630
And all our modern APIs
do require OAuth 2.0.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.890
You're in good shape.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.440
So, unfortunately though, we
have folks out there who are

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.000
still not using OAuth 2.0.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.900
And it might be because they
have legacy applications using

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.980
the older GData API.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.300
And that case, there are
different ways of doing

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.160
authorization--

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.040
AuthSub, OAuth 1.0.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.390
Or probably the most common is
ClientLogin, in which there's

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.490
a username and password
supplied.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.890
So we, obviously, are concerned
about properly

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.840
supporting those
scenarios too.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.110
And we have a couple of
different things.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.490
And some of this is things that
your actual end users

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.180
need to do.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.920
So as a developer who might be
watching this show, you might

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.600
get questions from
your end users.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.510
You can point them to
these resources.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.620
In many cases, unless you're the
developer and you're also

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.570
authorizing as your own account,
these are going to be

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.430
things that are more relevant
your end users than to you.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.560
But there are two main ways of
working around these problems.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.940
And these are the options
over here in this blog

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.550
post that we detail.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.060
One of which is to
use this advanced

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.260
account settings page.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.560
And let me pull up that
page really quickly.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.190
And this is at

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.300
youtube.com/account_advanced right now.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.450
And there's a section
over here--

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.100
Signing into Older Apps.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.390
It will let anybody change the
default value when they log in

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.410
with their Google account
username and password, going

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.630
through ClientLogin,
for instance.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.930
This will change what
page they act on by

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.310
default, more or less.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.760
So if I said, any time I go
through the ClientLogin flow

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.280
as my Google account username
and password, even though I do

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.590
have a channel associated with
that Google+ identity for my

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.020
Google account, instead I would
like to act as YouTube

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.750
for Developers.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.230
And that's just kind of a way
of establishing a global

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.890
default that works for all
older applications.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.510
So that's one thing that
your users could do.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.450
The other thing that gives
people a little bit more

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.270
control and this might be
because, let's say you have

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.840
three different possibilities
and sometimes you want to act

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.120
as one, sometimes you want to
act as another, we actually

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.040
have a way of assigning login
credentials to specific

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.079
Google+ pages.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.819
And that's at this link over
here which will take you to

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.210
this help center article.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.495
And this will basically generate
a email address

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:19.849
that's not actually
used for email.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.430
But it uses kind of the
identifier and allow you to

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.950
assign a password associated
with that email address.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.540
And when you enter those
credentials, you will be

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.880
authenticated as a
Google+ channel--

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.810
sorry, Plus page
backed channel.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.360
So if you have a legacy
application that will only

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.970
take a new username and password
and you need for that

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.860
application only, so maybe you
don't want to change your

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.370
defaults, your global default,
if you need to log in you can

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.870
set the that credentials.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.370
It's not going to be
the nicest email

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.510
address in the world.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.160
It's a little lengthy, and there
might be some strange

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.170
characters in there.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.430
But it will be a work around
for your users.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.810
So ultimately though, as a
developer who might be

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.310
watching this show, what I can
tell you is that please

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.830
upgrade to OAuth 2.0.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.400
Please make the switch.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.610
If you're using one of the older
authorization protocols,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.320
switching to OAuth 2.0 will
give you a number of

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.590
advantages and not the least
of which is it'll be good

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.600
login experience for users who
have multiple channels to

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.980
choose from.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.230
So there's another thing to keep
in mind that we covered

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.620
in this article, which we also
linked to in the description

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.870
of this YouTube video so you
could check it out yourself,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.230
and this is working
with channel IDs.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.320
This is something that's a lot
more relevant as we see more

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.890
and more especially new channels
that might be set up,

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.960
which just have their Google
identity associated with them

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.670
and don't have a legacy,
I call it a

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.400
legacy YouTube username.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.810
It's kind of like the
traditional, unique identifier

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.140
that would be given for
any YouTube channel.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.020
So it is now possible to create

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.070
those types of channels.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.450
There's no legacy username.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.580
And really the only way of
uniquely identifying those

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.520
channels is with the specific
channel ID that we return as

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.990
part of our data
API responses.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.000
There are a lot of folks out
there who have older

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.510
applications that maybe have a
database that makes use of the

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.660
legacy usernames as primary
keys in them.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.430
Perhaps you have some reporting,
and you're keeping

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.770
stats about each channel
somewhere.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.290
That certainly is a legitimate
use case.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.690
But you need to be aware of
the fact that not every

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.640
channel moving forward--

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.500
and certainly this is
the case already--

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.220
has a legacy username.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.050
And we really do recommend that
everybody switch to start

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.410
using channel IDs as their
unique identifiers internally

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.320
within their applications.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.230
That will allow you to work
with any older channel.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.810
Every single channel
has a channel ID.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.270
So it's not just these
newer channels.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.460
And we have some helper methods
in both the data API

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.280
version 3 and also ways in the
data API version 2, if you're

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.320
still using that, to translate
between an older user name and

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.300
get back a channel ID.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.930
So please check out this article
that I also wrote and

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.170
follow all the recommendations
there so you don't get burned

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.820
by these channels that don't
have legacy usernames.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.500
And there's one more best
practice that we touched on a

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.030
little bit in the blog post, but
I wanted to make kind of

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.220
perfectly clear and really bring
to the forefront because

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.090
it's very important.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.030
And this is more of a user
experience best practice.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.090
There is always the possibility
for confusion now

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.760
that there are multiple channels
that a user might

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.340
choose from.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.350
And maybe somebody inadvertently
sees that

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.490
channel picker and clicks on the
wrong channel and doesn't

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.000
realize it initially.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.830
So we really are strongly
encouraging developers out

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:54.220
there who have user-facing
interfaces--

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.000
maybe it's a web page, maybe
it's an installed

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.130
application--

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.620
to display the channel title
and the profile image

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.440
associated with the currently
authenticated user somewhere

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.510
clearly in your application and
hopefully also have a log

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.840
out link to let people log
out if they see, oh, I

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.010
inadvertently authenticated
or authorized

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.800
access as this channel.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.950
I want to click this log out
link and switch instead, go

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.910
through the flow again, and
choose a different channel.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.470
So that's a very important
best practice.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.280
We know not every application
does that right now.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.480
But please keep that in mind as
something you might want to

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.890
do moving forward.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.630
So those are the best practices

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.570
that I wanted to cover.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.620
And going back to Sherry, is
there anything you feel I

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.490
should've mentioned, anything
that left out.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.660
Or does that seem to cover it
by way of best practices for

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.916
developers out there?

00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:53.050
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Yeah, I think
that was really good

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.730
using OAuth 2.0 and showing
the user who they are,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.550
especially when they're
writing.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.660
If it's a consumption activity,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.650
maybe it's not so important.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.100
But if they're uploading a video
or writing a comment,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.245
it's really important
that they know who

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:04.250
they're doing that as.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.570
So I think that that's
really important.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.260
I think we really appreciate
your team supporting our

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.630
developers so well in this
effort, new APIs and old APIs

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.020
it's really great.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.740
JEFF POSNICK: Well, thanks.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.870
And we know that this is
something that is kind of a

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.060
little bit of a brave
new world for

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.800
developers out there.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.330
So, hopefully, the information
in this video and the blog

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.310
post and the guides--

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.640
and we're happy to field
questions on Stack Overflow

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.220
with the tag YouTube-API.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.470
We've started seeing more
and more people

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.370
asking questions there.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.580
But we're happy to help folks
through this migration.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.530
And I think Sherry mentioned at
the beginning, it's going

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.130
to open up a lot of great things
for users out there.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.700
And that's the most
important thing.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.840
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: Not just
at the beginning--

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.340
forever!

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:48.840
JEFF POSNICK: Right.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.790
You mentioned it at the
beginning of the show.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.000
It is a universal improvement
for everybody

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.740
til the end of time.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.690
So great.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.080
So thank you so much for
joining us, Sherry.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.500
Just a couple of plugs at
the end of the show--

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.660
as always, Developer Relations,
Google Developer

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.930
Relations is hiring.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.360
So if you think that you might
be a good fit for our team,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.800
please check out
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.410
I also wanted to plug--

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.100
I mentioned briefly-- we have
a channel dedicated to these

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.650
YouTube-related videos.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.750
That's youtube.com/youtubedev.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.760
But there's also the main Google
Developers channel,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.780
which if you're just watching
this somewhere and you're not

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.300
already subscribed to that,
I'd highly recommend

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:35.650
subscribing.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.710
And that's
youtube.com/googledevelopers.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.550
And please check that out for
more information as we make it

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.040
available in cool new videos
in upcoming weeks.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.300
So thanks again, Sherry.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.170
And that's it for this week.
