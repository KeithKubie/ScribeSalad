00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.760
All right.
We're one day closer to launch.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.689
And we've got tons of
traffic on the site.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.810
Things are looking pretty great.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; Excellent,
well I just booked my trip to Hawaii.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.072
With the launch so close,
I'm sure nothing could go wrong.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:13.938
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:15.430
That's funny.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.314
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:18.630
&gt;&gt; It's probably nothing.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.539
I don't know, but
take look at the data structure.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.510
I must have not deleted one
of my test shopping lists.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.190
Hm, these are data seems to
have a couple of fields that

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.740
I don't really remember
putting in there.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.245
And some of these emails
look a little bit off.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.380
Man, I must be really out of it.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.240
It should be easy that to fix though.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.634
&gt;&gt; What if while you're fixing that,

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:41.480
you also future-proofed your data by
creating Firebase security rules?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.650
This would help both make sure you don't
accidentally introduce anything to your

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.790
data structure you didn't mean to, and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.000
protect your app against those
with malicious intentions.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.980
&gt;&gt; Well, it does look like we have
a little bit more time before lunch.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.680
Hey, developer, are you still with us?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.140
Maybe we could talk a little
bit about security.
