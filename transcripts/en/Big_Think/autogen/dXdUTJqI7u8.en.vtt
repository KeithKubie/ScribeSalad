then we make an organization chart for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
then we make an organization chart for
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.580
then we make an organization chart for
our corporation and then we hire people

and it's it's top-down its idea down but

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
and it's it's top-down its idea down but
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610
and it's it's top-down its idea down but
evolution doesn't work that

all these systems emerge all these

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549
all these systems emerge all these
 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.289
all these systems emerge all these
living things emerge and the good ones

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299
living things emerge and the good ones
 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.630

the good designs eat the bad designs and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
the good designs eat the bad designs and
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.309
the good designs eat the bad designs and
so there's no more bad designs there's

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
so there's no more bad designs there's
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.410
so there's no more bad designs there's
just good designs then the designs

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
just good designs then the designs
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.440
just good designs then the designs
compete and then the eat each other and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
compete and then the eat each other and
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.809
compete and then the eat each other and
so you very quickly and people run

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
so you very quickly and people run
 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.399
so you very quickly and people run
computer models about this you very

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409
computer models about this you very
 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.849
computer models about this you very
quickly end up with an ecosystem and

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859
quickly end up with an ecosystem and
 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.580
quickly end up with an ecosystem and

bottom-up in another sense that the
 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.449
bottom-up in another sense that the
self-organizing systems come into place

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459

let's all have a flash mob okay there's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040
let's all have a flash mob okay there's
 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610
let's all have a flash mob okay there's
no manager of flash mobbing it just

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
no manager of flash mobbing it just
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.370
no manager of flash mobbing it just
emerges and if it's a stupid flash mob

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
emerges and if it's a stupid flash mob
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.860

nobody shows up so then that one's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
nobody shows up so then that one's
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.520
nobody shows up so then that one's
eliminated if it's big fun like what's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
eliminated if it's big fun like what's
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.699

the one everybody likes is thrower

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
the one everybody likes is thrower
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.210
the one everybody likes is thrower
dancing - thrower yeah 200 people show

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
dancing - thrower yeah 200 people show
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.720

up to pretend to be Michael Jackson okay

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
up to pretend to be Michael Jackson okay
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.059
up to pretend to be Michael Jackson okay
it's self-organizing is what I'm going

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069
it's self-organizing is what I'm going
 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.180
it's self-organizing is what I'm going
for and that's what evolution is the bad

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190
for and that's what evolution is the bad
 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.159

designs get eaten by the good ones and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169
designs get eaten by the good ones and
 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.349
designs get eaten by the good ones and
so all you have is good ones it happens

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
so all you have is good ones it happens
 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.240
so all you have is good ones it happens
very fast

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250
