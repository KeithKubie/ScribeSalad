My name is Godfrey Mwanpembwa, Gado, the cartoonist
for Media Nation. I very much think that the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.670
World Cup in 2010 in South Africa is very
much going to benefit Africa as a whole. It

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.840
should benefit Africa as a whole. And it's
going to be a huge benefit for Africa.
