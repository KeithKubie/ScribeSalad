00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
&gt;&gt; I think India is already an economic power.
It depends what the definition of superpower,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.469
I think the world has
changed, definitely the global economies [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.600
is moving east.
But still, [INAUDIBLE] Europe and other countries

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
but definitely
chances of different stage of growth or development

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490
India has big
potential to grow and will grow [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.760
to China.
Whether we are going to have one superpower,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:38.640
I doubt it.
I think we're going to have almost always

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.070
more than one part of the
world recovering maybe their position in their

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.510
part of the world.
At the end of the day, they're all interrelated.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.429
We cannot survive to have the state position
for long.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.170
Even India will be [INAUDIBLE].
I think we have a global economy everybody

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.370
else depends on us.
But there will be more than one superpower

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.130
in the future and it's
already started I think.
