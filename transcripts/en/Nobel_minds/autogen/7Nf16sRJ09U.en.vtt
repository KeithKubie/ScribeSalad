00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
everything together and how it works
together<00:02:17.490><c> was</c><00:02:17.880><c> really</c><00:02:18.360><c> you</c><00:02:18.870><c> know</c><00:02:18.990><c> really</c><00:02:19.410><c> very</c>

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 align:start position:0%
together was really you know really very
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.460 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
