as we created NASA first we went berserk
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859
as we created NASA first we went berserk
then we created NASA a year later we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
then we created NASA a year later we
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.660
then we created NASA a year later we
redoubled our efforts in science and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
redoubled our efforts in science and
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760
redoubled our efforts in science and
technology and engineering and that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
technology and engineering and that
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649

moment I think comes from the fact

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689
moment I think comes from the fact
 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.030
moment I think comes from the fact
whether or not the public knew this the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
whether or not the public knew this the
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700

ballistic missile shell they took out
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300
ballistic missile shell they took out
the warhead and put in a radio

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
the warhead and put in a radio
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490
the warhead and put in a radio
transmitter that went beep beep the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
transmitter that went beep beep the
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.740
transmitter that went beep beep the
military folks knew that if they could

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
military folks knew that if they could
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.649
military folks knew that if they could
put a radio transmitter in a ballistic

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
put a radio transmitter in a ballistic
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.139
put a radio transmitter in a ballistic
missile shell and flied over our heads

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

that they have the new high ground so in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
that they have the new high ground so in
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.300
that they have the new high ground so in
that case the Sputnik moment was a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
that case the Sputnik moment was a
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.160
that case the Sputnik moment was a
military one and it was clear that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
military one and it was clear that
 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.760
military one and it was clear that
technology and science would be what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
technology and science would be what
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.520
technology and science would be what
would enable nations

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
would enable nations
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.230
would enable nations
to take the lead and the high ground

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240
to take the lead and the high ground
 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.250
to take the lead and the high ground
right now where we in America where for

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
right now where we in America where for

right now where we in America where for
slowing down or maybe everyone else is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
slowing down or maybe everyone else is
 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.370
slowing down or maybe everyone else is
just speeding up but the effect is we've

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
just speeding up but the effect is we've
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380
just speeding up but the effect is we've
lost our edge we've lost our leadership

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390
lost our edge we've lost our leadership
 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.230

Sputnik moment in fact we will
 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.910
Sputnik moment in fact we will
rejuvenate the space program spectrum in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
rejuvenate the space program spectrum in
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.350
rejuvenate the space program spectrum in

maybe early as the late 2020s who's
 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.850
maybe early as the late 2020s who's
going to be President on what budget so

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860
going to be President on what budget so
 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.440
going to be President on what budget so
that's a nice thing to listen to in a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
that's a nice thing to listen to in a
 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.330
that's a nice thing to listen to in a
speech because he's thinking about the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
speech because he's thinking about the
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.460
speech because he's thinking about the
future but that's not a future that's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470
future but that's not a future that's
 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.500
future but that's not a future that's
actually within reach that anyone can

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
actually within reach that anyone can
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.250
actually within reach that anyone can
act upon

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260
act upon
 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.949
act upon
I don't like Sputnik moments I'd rather

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
I don't like Sputnik moments I'd rather
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.710
I don't like Sputnik moments I'd rather
have been the leader all along why do we

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720
have been the leader all along why do we
 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.340
have been the leader all along why do we
have to be shocked into being motivated

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350
have to be shocked into being motivated
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.370
have to be shocked into being motivated
to lead why don't we just lead all the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380
to lead why don't we just lead all the
 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.500
to lead why don't we just lead all the
time and maybe that's just unrealistic

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510
time and maybe that's just unrealistic
 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.630
time and maybe that's just unrealistic
maybe that's just not human nature maybe

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
maybe that's just not human nature maybe
 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.760
maybe that's just not human nature maybe
we have to feel threatened in order to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770
we have to feel threatened in order to
 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.400
we have to feel threatened in order to
act so yes Sputnik moments work and if

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
act so yes Sputnik moments work and if
 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.470
act so yes Sputnik moments work and if
we can't lead all the time let it be a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
we can't lead all the time let it be a
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.660
we can't lead all the time let it be a
Sputnik moment that kick-starts our

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
Sputnik moment that kick-starts our
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.229
Sputnik moment that kick-starts our
heart back beating again but I can't

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
heart back beating again but I can't
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.240
heart back beating again but I can't
help but be a little disappointed that

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250
help but be a little disappointed that
 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.930
help but be a little disappointed that
we haven't stayed there that we have to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
we haven't stayed there that we have to
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.330
we haven't stayed there that we have to
have to play catch-up if we're going to

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
have to play catch-up if we're going to
 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.180
have to play catch-up if we're going to
catch up at all

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
catch up at all
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.250
catch up at all
