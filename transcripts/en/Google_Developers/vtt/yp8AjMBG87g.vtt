JASON DOUGLAS: So I'm
Jason Douglas.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:09.650
I'm the lead product manager
for Knowledge Graph and the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.220
Knowledge Graph platform.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.810
And I'm joined today by Dan
Bricley, who's a developer

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.830
advocate for Knowledge, which I
think is very deep title if

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.000
you think about it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.840
But more specifically, that is
about improving the state of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.520
structured data on the web
through things like schema.org

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.770
and other standards.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.140
So I want to accomplish a couple
things here today.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.780
One is to give you an overview
of how search is changing and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.950
how Knowledge Graph is behind
a lot of those changes, and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
how that's really increasing the
importance of structured

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.540
data, and just understanding
on the web, and what that

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.860
means for everyone here.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.630
And then Dan's going to get into
a little bit more details

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.830
about what that means
specifically, technically, in

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.930
terms of schema.org and markup
standards and the evolving

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.300
tool set to support that, and
then getting into a little

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.010
bit-- we're still in the
early stages here.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.970
And there's a lot of exciting
stuff that's just starting to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.630
happen and I think will
continue to evolve.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.880
Also, part of the goal is to
give you an overview, like I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.100
said, provide some
context here.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.950
Because there are several
sessions later in the day that

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.170
will actually dive down
deeper on some of the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.230
topics we'll touch on.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.050
And we'll try and highlight that
as we go when there is

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.980
another session that will even
more detail on something.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.530
So I'm assuming most
of the people

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.040
caught the keynote yesterday.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.750
I know it was pretty crowded--

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.780
getting a general sense.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.310
But Amit was saying that
Search is changing

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.100
dramatically right before our
eyes, which, if you think

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.770
about it, is a pretty
big deal.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.160
This is our flagship product
used by billions of people,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.590
and yet we're saying it's
changing really fundamentally.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.520
So why would it be changing
really fundamentally?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.650
Well, because the nature of the
internet and information

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.350
in our lives is changing
very fundamentally.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.180
In the last few years--

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540
all gotten smartphones,
internet-connected, more and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.410
more devices are connected.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.770
And information is not just this
research task that's done

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.410
at a desktop typing
in queries.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.290
It's part of your life, right?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.240
It's on the go.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.330
It's information as you need it,
when you need it, and just

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.390
what you need.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.250
And so Search needs to evolve to
meet that world and to meet

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.210
those needs.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.830
And we are.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:08.290
And so some of the key things
that Search is doing now to

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.970
fit in this world, to be that
seamless assistant--

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.580
I think he used the analogy of
the Star Trek computer--

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.250
as something that is available
when you need

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.790
it to answer questions.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.640
So it does simple things like,
what's playing at the Metreon

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.610
across the street?

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.760
Or when you're sitting down for
lunch how many calories

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000
are in the cheeseburger that
you're about to eat?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.520
Or just things that
you need to know.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.030
But also being able
to then follow up.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.700
And whenever you learn
something, it brings new

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.460
questions, like, well,
how does that

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.556
compare to a burrito?

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:52.785
Or what time are those
movies showing?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.890
These kinds of things that
actually require some context

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.190
of what's going on.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.330
Or even, is my flight late
for getting home?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.040
And knowing that, as an
assistant would, what flight

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.860
you were on, what you
had tickets for.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.420
And then even anticipate--

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.840
so if that flight is going to
be late, letting you know,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.230
because of course you would
want to know that, or that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.380
it's time to actually catch the
cab if you're going to get

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.630
there in time.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.970
So in order to enable all these
things, the thing that a

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.240
personal assistant would have
this really an understanding

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.000
of the real world--

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.780
is a memory of what are the
important things to know, or

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.410
what is the context
that we all share.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.610
And again, that context really
is the real world.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.020
So we're sitting here in Moscone
today, which is in San

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.410
Francisco, and there's a
bunch of things nearby.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.730
I mentioned the Metreon
for movies.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.420
And there's the museum and
tourist attractions--

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.110
all these things.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.430
These are things that we
generally know, or are very

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.720
knowable, things about
the real world.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.030
And the more of these things we
know, the easier it is to

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.630
answer questions, have
conversations, and like I

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.220
said, even anticipate needs.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.080
So the fundamental thing that's
changing in Search to

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.250
bring this about is, well, how
do you have an understanding

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.810
of the world?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.510
And one of the first things is
you have to actually be able

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.600
to think about things
as things.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.580
And traditionally, Search has
been very much about strings.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.280
So if you think about the
content on the web, the text

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.770
in documents, those are words.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.910
But there's some funny tricks
that words can play.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.280
And so I think when you see this
picture, I assume most

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.300
people in the room immediately
recognize this gentleman.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.310
But he's gone by, obviously,
very different names or many

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.690
different names over the years,
almost amusingly so.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.870
And yet I think most people
don't get too confused about

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.610
who that is.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.150
But if all you're thinking about
is strings, is words,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.625
then it actually can
be quite confusing.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:42.900
And so if you even just think
about your own systems, how do

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.010
you keep track of
these things?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.990
Well, generally, if you want to
be able to deal with name

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.580
changes in a database, you give
it an ID, and you make

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.220
the name just an attribute
of that thing.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.030
And I think if you think about
what the backing database to

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.540
most websites, a lot of people
do that for the important

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.680
things in their systems.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.800
But usually at some level as you
go down, you think about

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.130
the attributes of one of these
entities that at some point

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.320
becomes a text string.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.710
Like the location of
where somebody is--

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.490
now it's a city name.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.750
It doesn't have an ID.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.900
Or whatever it may be.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.040
At some point, it becomes
just strings.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.090
And so that's kind of the crazy
thing of being Google

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.800
that we've taken on, which is to
actually keep going up, and

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:44.880
to give everything in the world
an ID, and trying to

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.070
model all the connections and
relationships between all the

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.170
things in the world.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.410
And this is what we call
Knowledge Graph.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.410
So I'm going to talk about how
Knowledge Graph gets exposed

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.160
as features, as a platform,
et cetera.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.380
But at its core, really what
we're doing this is creating

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.670
some model of the world so we
have the context that we all

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.500
have about the real world, and
can do things like answer

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.420
questions, and converse,
and just have a

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.670
model of the world.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:26.800
Another thing, in addition to
thinking about things as the

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.990
real world stuff as abstract
entities, with the graph data

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:41.690
model, we also can more easily
take on new facts about the

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.280
world and create new connections
between things.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.300
And I think this is a lot
like the way people

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.830
think about the world.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.530
So as we said, when Snoop comes
up with a new name or

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.260
something else changes about
the world, it's actually

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.810
pretty easy to adjust
our understanding--

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:03.010
much easier than it might
be otherwise.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.350
So what is some of these
things useful

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.890
for, as I was saying?

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.690
One of the things that Knowledge
Graph can help us do

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.890
is answer very factual
questions like,

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.150
how long is the 101?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.850
I don't know if people have had
the pleasure of driving on

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.550
101, but even if you're only
doing a section of it, it

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.800
feels that long.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.940
But even more importantly,
there's some subtle things

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.020
about having this catalog
of real world things.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.620
Knowing what things exist
actually help us better focus

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.770
in on what somebody might be
looking or help a user.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.570
So if you type something
ambiguous like "giants,"

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.330
there's a lot of things in the
world that are called giants.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.790
There's multiple sports teams.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.850
There's the mythological
creature of giant.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.530
In this case, in San Francisco,
I'm interested in

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.090
seeing if there actually
is a Giants' game.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.810
But it becomes very clear,
rather than having to hunt

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.915
through results quite as much,
I can see that, no, San

00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:12.370
Francisco Giants is what I'm
really interested in, on the

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.480
right there.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.350
And if I click on that, it
automatically refines the

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.910
query to San Francisco Giants.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.240
And you start to get very
relevant information and

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.060
results about the San
Francisco Giants.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.700
So one is that they actually
are out of town right now.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.390
But you can see when
the next game is.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.460
And a bunch of information
that we have in Knowledge

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.700
Graph about the Giants-- who
the manager is, the roster,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.670
and even where they play,
which is fairly nearby--

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.130
AT&amp;T Park.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.720
And so you can even click
through and refine to that and

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.230
see information about AT&amp;T
Park-- where it is.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.720
Click through the Map to
actually get directions there.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.860
But we can go a step further.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.950
So we've sort of summarized
these things, exposed some of

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.810
the connections between
the real world things.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.780
But also it can help discover
things, that when people are

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.810
searching for AT&amp;T Park, they
may be interested in the other

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.760
sports venues around town.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.250
Or they might just be a tourist
and wanting to see

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.170
other tourist attractions.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.040
So often when people are
searching for AT&amp;T Park,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.500
they're also looking
at things.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.230
If you look-- it's hard to
see at the bottom there--

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.950
things like the ferry building,
or Fisherman's

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.320
Wharf, or Union Square, all
the well-known tourist

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.570
attractions.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.920
So one thing from a developer
perspective before we're going

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.550
to go move on to structured
markup and the web as a

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.450
whole-- but I did want to take
an aside for a minute and make

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.180
it clear that actually the
Knowledge Graph itself is

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.990
available to developers.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.360
So any information that we learn
about the world that

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.140
comes to us from openly licensed
sources, so that we

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.110
actually can redistribute it or
share it with the world, is

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.630
available and with Freebase
and the Freebase APIs-- so

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.180
developers.google.com/freebase.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.350
That's a lot of stuff.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.150
So 40 million entities and 1
billion facts covers a lot of

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.300
knowledge of the world,
which is very useful.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:29.170
So if you don't have the time to
give IDs to all the things

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.300
of a certain kind, you can use
Freebase as a catalog for

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.920
those things.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.430
And there's lots of APIs and
services for being able to

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.670
match your data, for being
able to do entity auto

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.030
complete for Lookup, get
facts about an entity,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.740
all kinds of stuff.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.360
So if you're interested in that,
there's two sessions.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.570
There's one session later today
on search and suggest

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.460
with the Freebase API.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.910
And there's also a workshop, a
hands on thing, that I think

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.280
sounds like it's going to be
pretty cool tomorrow that also

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.160
involves YouTube.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.760
So I don't remember the
exact times for

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.450
either of these things.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.710
But we all have schedules.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.850
OK, so so far I've been talking
entirely about the

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.760
Knowledge Graph and how that's
changing Search.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.270
But this is all based on just
this abstract model of the

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.650
real world.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.070
What about the web and how
content and information from

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.780
the web connects
to all of this?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.740
So I wanted to actually start
to show some stuff here.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.800
So how many people here are
familiar with rich snippets?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.250
Is this something that's
fairly OK?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.440
About a third.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.940
All right, so maybe I'll start
even a little earlier.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.015
So there has been a feature--

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.910
so I was talking about the Star
Trek computer earlier.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:14.670
And there happens to be
a new Star Trek movie.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.290
So there has been the ability
for a while in Search, that

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.580
given some structured
understanding of a page, that

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.900
we could enhance the snippet.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.360
So normally a snippet in search
results is some section

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.430
of the page that Google
believes is

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.580
relevant to the query.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.820
But sometimes you can have an
enhanced presentation of that,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.650
like if we really know that
there's ratings or reviews,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:48.740
for example, or events, or
information about a movie,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.300
those sorts of things, it can
give a more structured result

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.710
that makes it a little bit more
obvious about what's on

00:14:54.710 --> 00:15:00.480
the page, what it's about,
to help the user

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.730
choose the right result.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.640
But with Knowledge Graph, we can
go a step further, which

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.770
is that it's not just that this
is structured information

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.290
from that page.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.690
It's actually clear that that's
about the movie, "Star

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:29.040
Trek into Darkness." And so
whenever we're displaying

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.870
information about that movie,
in whatever context the user

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.210
might be, we actually know that
it is associated with it

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.110
and can highlight it.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.670
So when I see the "Star Trek
into Darkness" knowledge

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.190
panel, can see the review
scores, I'm like, oh, that's

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.400
pretty darn good.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.010
I tend to focus on the outliers,
the negative, when

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.800
I'm trying to figure
these things out.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.800
So then I can very quickly from
the movie get right to

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.580
the most negative things said
about it, and make my decision

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.600
based on there.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.400
Some people might like to do
it the other way around.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:15.700
So that's one example of
associating the existing

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.450
structured data on the web--

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.460
two entities in that
same context.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.440
But that's not all
that exciting.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.550
That was all on the page.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.370
But we can go a step further.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:31.900
So say a friend of mine mentions
that they're going a

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.436
Mumford and Sons' concert.

00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:36.780
And I'm like, I don't
even remember.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.570
Like, I didn't know
there was one.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.150
Where is it?

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.030
When is it?

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.700
That sort of thing.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.270
If I even just search for the
band, I'm able not just have

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.150
information about these facts
about who's in the band, and

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.230
what are their songs, and that
sort of thing, but from the

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.050
web, being able to learn that,
basically, what are their

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.180
upcoming events, what
are those concerts.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.970
I can see, well, in fact, it's
next week in Berkeley.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.710
But I think the key thing here
is I didn't know when and

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.540
where it was.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.400
But now it was very
easy to find.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.260
And if I click on it, I get a
very focused experience about

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.869
that specific thing.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.720
And so I immediately see,
OK, it's at the Greek.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.020
And if I want to buy tickets,
it's right there.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.410
I can find out more
about the venue.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.609
I can click through to actually
buy tickets, and got

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.670
to that result very quickly,
even though I only just knew

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.720
it was Mumford and Sons.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.110
I didn't have to figure out
how to find that specific

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.160
event or where it was.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:57.850
So these are some very early
features about how structured

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.220
information and content from
the web can connect to

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:01.900
Knowledge Graph.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.370
Like I said, I think we're at
the very, very beginning.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.890
This was leveraging the
stuff that already

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.850
existed from rich snippets.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.610
There's so much more that
I think can happen.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:18.260
And we'll get into some of the
new features towards the end

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:18.780
of the talk.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.350
But I think the key thing is
that if Search is really

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.540
starting to think about things
in terms of the real world and

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.190
these entities and how they all
relate, it's going to be

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.500
important to actually understand
websites and their

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.890
content in that same way in
order to be able to surface it

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:41.250
in the seamless way that users
are now expecting.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.730
When you're talking about
answering questions over Voice

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:48.030
on Mobile, or via Glass, or
whatever, that it needs to be

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.690
as seamless as possible.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.690
And it takes that level
understanding to be able to

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.210
surface it for users
at the right time.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.960
So with that, I was actually
going to hand it over to Dan

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.270
to actually get into
the meat of this.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.730
This is all the vision stuff
and the context for this.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.180
But we want to get into specific
[INAUDIBLE], like,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.480
well, how does this happen
and where is it going?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.600
DAN BRICKLEY: So I think
that's a great slide.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.300
Because it shows, on the right
hand side, the world of

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.320
schema.org, and on the
left, the world of

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.870
the Knowledge Graph.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.300
And I love Freebase.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.220
I love the Knowledge Graph.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.326
I carry around a lucky copy of
Freebase on my data stick.

00:19:28.326 --> 00:19:30.792
The web is a lot, lot bigger
than Freebase.

00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:32.560
It's a lot messier.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.270
So I'm going to be talking
mostly today about structured

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.280
data in the context
of schema.org.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.090
schema.org is for the rest
of the web, for that big,

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.890
sprawling chaos.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.300
And I'll start to develop
project, about its origins and

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.950
partners, and the community
we're building out at W3C.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.460
I'll also walk you through a
bit of markup, just to show

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.730
you how simple it can be, and
a bit of the data model that

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.680
sits behind it.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.100
And you've already seen the
data model already.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.140
It's graph. it's attribute
value pairs.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.290
And finally I'll say a few
more words about how

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.650
schema.org fits with the
Knowledge Graph, and give a

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.780
quick look at some of the tools
we're building up to

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.680
make your structured
data lives easier.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.810
So that's the website.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.240
It's not the most exciting
site in the world.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.240
It's patterned after
sitemaps.org which was another

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.600
collaboration with partner
search engines.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.660
So where did this come from?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.545
Why schema.org?

00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:31.310
Well, to describe real little
things in a structured way

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.390
that you can understand, that
others can understand, you

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.640
need some vocabulary.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.170
And then the question is,
which vocabulary?

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.280
A couple of years
ago, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.890
from Google had the insight
that search engines really

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.310
should be cooperating on these
vocabularies rather than

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.700
competing, and that by doing
so, webmasters' lives,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.020
developers' lives, publishers'
lives would be a lot easier,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.422
and that this would broaden the
adoption and utility of

00:20:58.422 --> 00:20:59.600
structured data on the web.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.270
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:05.100
got talking with teams over at
Bing and Microsoft, at Yahoo,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.390
and they were thinking
similarly.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.240
So from those conversations
emerged schema.org--

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.490
ta-da.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.220
So since that launch,
we've seen

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.940
quite impressive adoption.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.450
And we've been joined by,
fairly early on in the

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.500
project, by Yandex.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.160
And we're talking now with Baidu
on how schema.org can

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.970
work better in China.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.120
So maybe you weren't expecting
to see these company logos in

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:32.990
a Google Talk.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.620
But the thing is, we're proud to
be collaborating with these

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.670
teams from Microsoft, from
Yahoo, from Yandex.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.870
schema.org, with its global
ambitions to improve the whole

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.060
web, just would not be
possible without such

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.310
partnerships.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.360
We think the collaboration's
going well.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.830
We're happy, not sad.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.760
It's going well fro the
project and for

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.620
the web as a whole.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.830
But it's not just these
four organizations.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.350
So a number of individuals,
groups, organizations,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.340
companies have stepped forward
to propose extensions to

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.160
schema.org since we launched.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.510
I'll run through a few of these
here that we've already

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.650
adopted and talk about some of
the things in the pipeline.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.630
Pretty early on, we had the
rNews group from ITPC propose

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.860
a vocabulary for describing
news articles.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.320
That went in late 2011.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.170
We added late last year a
language for e-commerce for

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.580
describing offerings
on the web.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.740
We very recently added
a language for

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.290
describing data sets.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.700
I think you saw yesterday the
statistics showing up in front

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.300
page of Search.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.050
So that's, I think, a taste of
what can be coming as it

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.470
becomes easier and easier to get
hold of data sets, and to

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.540
understand just enough about the
data set to integrate it,

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.900
cross reference it, and
to provide some user

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.330
interface around it.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.400
So that's really
exciting work.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.450
And that's picking up on work
was done at W3C in the link

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.810
data working group
for government.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.600
Another really exciting
development, and, again,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.600
recent, was the LRMI, Learning
Resource Metadata Initiative.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.370
So this is describing open

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.570
educational learning resources.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.570
That was co-led by the
Association of Education

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.080
Publishes and the Creative
Commons.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.920
There's a whole pile
of other groups.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.180
And then this is
tricky problem.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.310
We've got one schema.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.645
We're trying to make it simple
as possible for all topics,

00:23:30.645 --> 00:23:32.590
for all domains, for anything
that could be

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.380
on a web page anywhere.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.570
No one really knows how to
standardize these things.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.866
I used to work for W3C.

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:41.790
I've seen web standards
made for technologies.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.320
And the key there is to be super
focused on one thing.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.890
schema.org is super focused
on the entire web.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.080
So we're making up the process
as we go along.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.580
We've created a community
at W3C.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.340
We've made it as open
as possible.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.130
The four search engines
step back and take

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.990
an oversight role.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.240
They're a handful of search
engineers from four competing

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.140
companies--

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.660
they're not the right people
to come up with descriptive

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.170
vocabularies.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.490
But they do share the role of
making sure these things can

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.780
hang together.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.450
I think going forward, W3C, the
community around W3C, the

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.960
open mailing list that we
have is the place to be.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.740
It's all linked from the
schema.org site.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.330
You're very welcome on
the mailing list.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.580
Yeah, come along.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.055
So schemas in practice.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.240
Before we jump into the markup,
I wanted to say a few

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.200
words on the basic thinking,
the conceptual

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.660
model behind this.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.380
And it's not complex.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.590
The point of schema.org is to
serve, essentially, as a

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.470
dictionary, listing kinds of
things, kinds of properties,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.010
for each type of thing that you
might have a description

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.370
of in a web page.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.360
So you see a fragment
of the schemas here.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.860
Markup describing a
creative work, it

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.985
might mention an author.

00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:58.820
It might mention the intended
audience, the date it was

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.240
created, and so on.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.570
The hierarchy is very flat.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.480
We don't try and model the
world super formally.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.890
It's just a way to organize
our properties.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.910
And so, for example,
a video object--

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.610
the description might use a
video frame size property,

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.880
alongside a bit rate property
by virtue of being a media

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.560
object, or genre, because all
these things really are

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.960
creative works of
different kinds.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.160
schema.org is just this huge
collection of properties

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.100
organized by their association
with these types.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.770
So for each property
we say which types

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.830
they make sense with.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.380
There will be a list of
properties that work with

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.290
local business, with
[INAUDIBLE], with blog, with

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.540
exercise plan.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.310
Developers should recognize the
data model immediately.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.660
Let's move on to markup.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.310
It's attribute value pairs.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.500
It's graphs.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.870
It's things related
to other things.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.320
So this basic data model
is decades old.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.570
But when we launched, we had
to become more specific,

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.770
markup exact computer structures
to put into HTML.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.750
We launched using HTML5
microdata, which gives you a

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.160
handful of attributes that
mix into your markup.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.390
W3C's RDFa Lite is another
very fine alternative.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.020
As far as Google is concerned,
they both work.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.000
In either case, the conceptual
model is the same-- things,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.970
properties, values, attribute
value pairs.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.090
So how does this look
in practice?

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:22.430
So let's described a couple of
things, keeping it simple--

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:28.220
a movie and a person,
if the person was

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.790
an actor in a movie.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.230
So this basic example gives us
enough to understand how

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.510
schema.org works, and three of
the essential patterns that go

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.740
into schema.org markup.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.500
The examples are given in
microdata syntax, by which the

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.880
words here, itemscope, itemtype,
itemprop, RDFa would

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.660
look very similar.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.980
And these are not just
two examples.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.610
If you go to Rotten Tomatoes,
Netflix, IMDB sites today,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.450
things you saw earlier, you'll
see this marked up, live in

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.680
the wild web.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.730
So here we see the simplest
microdata example.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.780
We're effectively saying,
there's a thing.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.220
It's a movie.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.390
And here's its name and here's
its description.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.070
You can't get more unexciting
than that.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.900
It's great as far as it goes.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.720
But how can we do more?

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.810
How do we integrate the
relationships between the

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.610
things that we're describing
on the web?

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.910
What if we wanted to talk
about, say, the

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.540
actor Johnny Depp?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.790
What have we got here?

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.600
Why would we want that
relationship?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.370
I think structured data, it's so
much more useful when it's

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.280
connected into larger
structures.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.170
Every new fact we learn about
the actor indirectly teaches

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.420
us just a little about the
movie, and vice versa.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.590
So let's add an actor.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.500
This second paragraph here--

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.940
you'll see we're writing a
paragraph that says, in

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.180
effect, and that movie has an
actor relationship to a person

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.090
with the name Johnny Depp.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.740
schema.org's job is
simply to be the

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.330
collection of those terms--

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.320
actor, person, name--

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.170
and to grow and grow as people
ask for new types of thing,

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.420
new types of relationship.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.340
We can go a little
bit further.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.710
Third scenario--

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.740
here we see the actor link
points off to a whole page

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.990
about the person.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.020
It's great describing Johnny
Depp inline, but we can't say

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.800
everything we want to say
about Johnny in the

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.580
page about the movie.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.420
So we start to break up our
descriptions and spread them

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.850
across the web-- a little bit of
the movie page, just enough

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.360
to identify him, and then
hyperlink across to maybe a

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.960
landing page on IMDB
or somewhere.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.370
So a href equals a pointer to
the page about Johnny, and the

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.750
relationship becomes
a type link.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.100
It says a bit more about the
association between the movie

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.085
and the person.

00:28:51.085 --> 00:28:54.520
All right, so you've seen now
the three core patterns at the

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.450
heart of schema.org markup.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.610
There are attribute value pairs,
where the value is A,

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.340
something simple like the string
"Johnny Depp." Simple--

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.770
this is the oldest data
model in the book.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:10.710
B, a thing, but you describe
it in inline with markup in

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.790
the same page--

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.050
more attribute value pairs.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.870
They're recursive.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.210
And C, the interesting one, is
where you start to spread this

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.390
across the website-- so
attribute value pairs, where

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.290
the value itself is a thing, and
the thing is described in

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.240
more detail on a linked page
somewhere, hopefully a page

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.168
that has further schema.org
markup.

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.550
So schema.org makes it possible
to do useful things

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.295
with the simplest of markup, but
also to provide mechanisms

00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:38.210
that allow descriptions from
multiple pages to be composed

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.030
to larger and larger linked
graphs of structured data.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.000
sameAs--

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.280
so we want to grow out
this graph of data.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.160
And we want to ensure that
Google understands what

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.872
entities your content and
services are pertaining to.

00:29:59.872 --> 00:30:05.030
And then to help Google and
the other search engines

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.830
understand this, we recently
proposed a new schema.org

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.450
property called sameAs.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.370
And sameAs means pretty much
what you might expect--

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.550
that it's the same entity.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.230
So you can easily point to
well-known pages for that same

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.690
entity elsewhere on the web.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.675
So examples are Wikipedia or any
Wikidata project, Freebase

00:30:23.675 --> 00:30:26.330
that we heard about earlier,
IMDB, these

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.500
other well-known sites.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.840
Any of those pages can serve as
a proxy identifier for the

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.550
thing they describe.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.530
With the sameAs markup, you
can make your web pages

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.760
unambiguous about you talking
about Paris Hilton

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.010
or Paris the city.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.400
If you want to use
a bit of hidden

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.140
markup, that's just fine.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.264
Slightly different bit
of markup here.

00:30:50.264 --> 00:30:53.050
That's pretty much it for
the markup examples.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:31:00.165
So I just wanted to try and
put the modern graph data

00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:02.970
models in context a little.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.860
So the web of linked data idea
is not a new idea. schema.org,

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.440
alongside the Knowledge Graph,
has essentially the same

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.020
graph-shaped data model as
W3C RDF, for example.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.730
Wikipedia's Wikidata project
also recently adopted this

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.635
property-centric data model.

00:31:16.635 --> 00:31:19.310
The type links idea is
older than the web.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.250
But since the web itself
recently celebrated 20 years

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.945
as an open platform, I thought
let's revisit the words from a

00:31:25.945 --> 00:31:28.400
page from 1992 on link.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.020
Types.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.390
This is one of the very first
web pages, recently restored

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.870
to the web by CERN.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.290
I think [INAUDIBLE] probably
wrote this.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.670
He said, "Some link types for
example express relationships

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.440
between the things described by
two nodes." And that's it.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.850
That was there, probably
the fifth or the

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:45.985
sixth page on the web.

00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:48.780
This idea has been there on
the web from the start.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.570
It's not a surprise.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.960
It's been there in logic
for centuries.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.960
schema.org's role is to be a
provider of this vocabulary,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.730
particularly for relationship
types.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.060
Many kinds of things it
describes in the web--

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.370
we name our types as a way
of organizing these

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.720
relationship types.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.520
So place or organization might
be associated to contained in

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.330
founder, name.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.800
Some of these properties
take strings.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.860
But a lot of them take things.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.820
And in a web context, things
can be represented by

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.570
relationships and by links.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.510
So at the heart of schema.org
and each schema.org vocabulary

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.140
is this very old and
foundational idea, that it's

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.340
useful to give names to
properties that express

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.040
relationships between the things
described by two nodes

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.850
in the web.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.200
So if that was there right from
the start, right from day

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.270
one of the web, why is
it taking us so long?

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.490
In less than two years of
schema.org rollout, we've seen

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:41.920
tons of this stuff out there.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.750
I think what's become clear to
us is that when publishes have

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:49.560
a clear and growing incentive
to add markup, up it goes.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.205
I don't have statistics handy,
but there's a lot of it out

00:32:52.205 --> 00:32:54.690
there, spread well
across the web.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.970
And the alliance of search
engines supporting schema.org

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:02.200
have given a huge boost
to this way of

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.350
thinking about data.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.690
It's actually useful now.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.610
Secondly, schema.org did make
some subtle design tweaks to

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.710
make life easier for publishers
and to aid

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.520
mainstream adoption.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.060
So I'd like to expand on that
last point briefly.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.920
We at schema.org try and
provide a unified

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.270
documentation hub.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.520
The point of this is that we
don't want busy developers,

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.290
busy publishers, having to
rummage around the web piecing

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.530
together bits of vocabulary--

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.540
something here for geography,
something here for people,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.020
something here for places, each
would path to a different

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.140
data model or different
syntax.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.590
And so we've taken on
more of that work.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.320
We've worked hard to unify
these different ways of

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.040
describing things so that you
just go to schema.org, find a

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.310
useful piece of vocabulary, and
get on with your lives.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.980
We're are trying to find a
balance by drawing together

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.580
independent designs, but
providing a consistent

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.920
environment and a consistent
data model

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.290
for widespread adoption.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.090
I just wanted to say that our
approach owes different things

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.330
to different communities.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.630
From the link data, or from the
semantic web community,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.500
there comes a concern for the
graph data model, and a

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.989
concern for supporting
decentralized descriptions.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.170
You shouldn't have everybody in
the same room when you're

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.290
creating a schema.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.270
You should have conventions that
allow different groups to

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.920
go away, come up with some
list of types, list of

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.969
properties, and a model
that allows you to

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.750
plug them all together.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.780
From the microformats community
and the HTML5

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.840
community, we've taken a concern
for simple, clear, and

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.750
developer-friendly markup.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.315
And as a semantic web person,
I think that's been huge.

00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:41.471
A lot of the semantic web work
is amazing, but is super hard

00:34:41.471 --> 00:34:43.070
for developers to
get a handle on.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.310
So we're really trying to be
simple, easy, and clear with

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.889
the schema.org site.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.949
So these conversations between
different groups in the web

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.230
community, they're
rarely easy.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.510
But I think they have led to
stronger web standards.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.050
So W3C's RDFa Lite, that learned
a lot from microdata.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.300
Microdata learned a lot--

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.510
obviously redesign of RDFa 1,
which in turn microdata also

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.775
drew upon microformats.

00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:09.930
So as far as Google's concerned,
it's the graph that

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.930
matters, the graph that
we care about.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.990
We can get the graph
from RDFa, from

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.410
microdata, from JSON LD.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.350
Schema.org's approach let's us
make parallel progress on

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.420
syntaxes and on schemas.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.400
So every new and improved schema
can be used immediately

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.530
in any syntactic format
you like.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.660
Some of the smart mail scenarios
you've heard about

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.270
this week are using
JSON, for example.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.260
It doesn't matter to us.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.700
It's all a big graph.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.600
Maybe you prefer Drupal,
XHTML, RDFa.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.320
Again, that's great.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:39.910
That's your choice.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.210
That's your website.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.190
Go crazy.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.680
The approach we've taken allows
different sites to

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.240
share common data vocabularies
even if

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.490
they disagree on syntax.

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:55.212
All right, so I'm just going to
run quickly through some of

00:35:55.212 --> 00:35:56.400
the webmaster tools.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.180
There's a session following this
one that goes into a lot

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.600
more detail on these tools.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.990
Firstly, schema.org itself--

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.540
all right, don't get
too excited.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.520
I'm going to show
you a website.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:25.400
If you visit the schema.org
site, you'll find a very

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.370
regular website--

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.270
very structured.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.610
Essentially there's a
page for every type.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.030
There's a hierarchy.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:32.870
So if we go to the documentation
section--

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.950
the full type hierarchy--

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.432
so basic types.

00:36:44.432 --> 00:36:45.340
Thing--

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.120
so in the schema.org universe,
everything is a thing.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.500
And the interesting work is
saying, well, what are the

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.620
subsets of thing?

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.800
So the creative work itself
has subsets article, news

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.330
articles, scholarly article,
medical scholarly article.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.300
We try not to go too deep.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.820
But these types give us
attachment points for

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.230
properties, and also, in a
social sense, attachments

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.010
points for collaboration.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.270
So perhaps the medical
collaboration--

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.000
focus on the medical scholarly
article type.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.400
Codes, that came from the team
at Microsoft, data catalog,

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.160
from the recent data
sets addition.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.530
It goes on.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.330
It's smaller than Freebase.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.080
It's smaller than Wikipedia.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.550
But it's hard to memorize.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.300
And it's got to the stage--

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.160
let me give you an example--

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.270
place of worship.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.762
So I'm really happy that we're
collaborating with the

00:37:37.762 --> 00:37:40.740
Wikidata project at Wikipedia.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.365
So if you look here at this
example-- place of worship is

00:37:43.365 --> 00:37:44.615
a civic structures,
is a place.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.030
We listed at launch
I think six types

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.430
of places of worship.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.340
There are many, many
you could list.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.750
And this is one of the
places where we say,

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.895
stop, we can't do this.

00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:57.590
This is where Wikipedia
comes in.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.800
And the collaboration with the
Wikidata guys at Wikipedia is

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.760
giving us a story for how
schema.org gets big, but it

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.960
doesn't get too big.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.550
And then Wikipedia comes along
and the masses of thousands of

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:12.440
Wikipedia community members can
figure out how many kinds

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.420
of place of worship are there.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.600
We don't want to
be doing that.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.070
We're a handful of search
engineers collaborating while

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.570
working for competing
companies.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.570
We're not the right people
to do this list.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.890
So that's been very important
for us, figuring out where to

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.710
stop, and where to let
others plug in.

00:38:32.596 --> 00:38:34.190
All right, that's probably
enough schema.org.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.830
So the Markup Helper
is a new tool.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.550
It helps you write markup.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.900
You put HTML in.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:04.790
You work with the interface,
and it helps you add this

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:06.900
stuff without knowing the
standards inside out.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.040
I don't know this
tool super well.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.990
So I'm going to shot up now,
point to these guys who will

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.250
be speaking later.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.470
The Testing Tool I
use every day.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.390
This used to be called the Rich
Snippet Testing Tool--

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.350
so now the Structured
Data Testing Tool.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.380
It shows you what Google thinks
your page is saying.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.150
It also shows you what Google's
custom search engine

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.680
will make of your page,
which is great.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.910
Because that's a tool that can
quite sophisticated use of

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.460
structured data now.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.360
Thirdly, instead of thinking of
your structured data page

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.080
by page by page, we
started see tools.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.660
So in Webmaster Tools for Google
Office Publishes, we're

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.760
starting to see tools
that show a view

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.010
of your entire site--

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.440
all the schema.org types
that you publish.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.270
I think as we start to talk
more about graphs, that's

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.210
going to become increasingly
important, that each of your

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.870
pages tell a little
bit of a story.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.920
Your entire website can
start to be thought

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.385
of as a data set.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.440
Finally, Data Highlighter--

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.600
so this is a tool.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.360
I think of it as a way of
getting started quickly.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.110
You can go in here, annotate
sections of a page, and teach

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.010
Google about your website.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.770
And Google will figure out, with
your help, how to turn

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.510
highlighted sections of the page
into the graph data model

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.050
of Freebase and schema.org.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.510
I think at this point I'm going
to pass back to Jason.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.240
JASON DOUGLAS: Those last
couple of things, the

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.490
developer tools--

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:17.330
the Markup Helper and
Data Highlighter--

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.690
went very quickly
through those.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.730
I think they're actually
incredibly cool, and make both

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:26.630
learning how to do markup,
and just getting started

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.520
experimenting with structured
data incredibly easy.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.730
So I would really encourage
folks who have any interest in

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:37.610
this, since it's part of the
future the web, [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.790
You guys are next, right?

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:42.580
OK, so there will be full
demos, deep dive.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.110
I'm sure you probably have no
idea what that was from just

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.630
the screen shots.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.360
But as I said, we're really
trying to make this easier.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.310
We've already seen a lot of
adoption of structured data

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.010
given how difficult it's
been historically.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.170
And I think as it gets easier,
we'll see even more.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.090
And as I was alluding to before,
I think it's really

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.550
important because, increasingly,
this is becoming

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:09.220
a core part of how we index the
web, how we understand the

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.710
world, and how everything
relates to it.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.770
And so some of the stuff that
we've been seeing so far

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.340
really is the beginning.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:23.110
It's the early days of Knowledge
Graph itself.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.550
We've been talking about how
much it's been changing

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.990
Search, but that's been over
just the last year.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:33.640
So coincidentally, today is the
exact one year anniversary

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.608
of the launch of Knowledge
Graph.

00:42:37.608 --> 00:42:40.450
Like I said, it's been
exactly one year.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.580
And so that's what's
happened so far.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.720
But I think there's
a lot of new and

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.440
interesting things coming.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.720
So one, I don't know how many
people caught this yesterday.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.730
There was the smart
mail presentation.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:43:00.200
And if you think about it, we
get a lot of notifications or

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.120
a very interesting emails that
have important information

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.390
about our world over email.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.140
And those tend to come from
websites, from services.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.330
And those emails are
often in HTML.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.440
So if you think about it, well,
everything we've been

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.880
describing with markup and
schema.org and all this stuff

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.830
is a way of layering
this structured

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.740
data on top of HTML--

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.760
works just as well
on email as well.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.320
And so they've started
to do that.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.480
So this was what was announced
yesterday.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.130
And so some of it can be like
what we saw with rich snippets

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.740
and Search, where instead of
just a text snippet, we

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.890
actually saw a structured result
with stars, or the time

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:47.110
and place of an event, or
that sort of thing.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:52.870
You can do the same thing with
something like a flight

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.050
reservation, but even
go a step further.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.690
So again, by understanding the
actual real world context of

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.150
this, we can actually join it
with flight status, which

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.050
wasn't in the email.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.310
I just know I have
a reservation.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.420
But now I can actually even know
whether the flight is on

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.770
time or not when I am looking
back at what gate is it at--

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:12.850
where's my flight?

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.890
I'm getting all this information
that I would need

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.360
in real time as well.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.110
And this is being done with
schema.org vocabulary, and the

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.920
same structure market techniques
that we've been

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.170
talking about for the web.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.510
So that's cool.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:34.000
And as I was saying, one of the
things about email is its

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.650
your stuff.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.960
It's about your world.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:41.030
And if we want to be this Star
Trek computer or that personal

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.790
assistant, then you have as
many questions about your

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.280
world, about your flights, and
your reservations, and all

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.090
this stuff, as you do about that
general world knowledge

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.890
that we're talking about, like
what's in San Francisco?

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.260
So that's things like, when
is my next meeting?

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.470
When is my flight leaving?

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.660
Where am I going?

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.900
Where's that birthday party?

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.590
These kinds of questions that,
with this level of structured

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:12.795
understanding of content, become
very answerable, so

00:45:12.795 --> 00:45:14.620
that you can actually find
this stuff, that you can

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.850
search for it as it was a
question, but even do things

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.680
like trigger now cards when
we're talking about anticipate

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.610
when this information
might be useful.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.960
OK, and then finally, and this
is one that I actually

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:38.030
personally find especially
exciting, but

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.420
it's also very new--

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:44.020
it's at the public proposal
phase at schema.org, but we're

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.590
starting to do some things
with already--

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:49.280
which is, I've been talking
a lot about things, and

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.880
entities, and all those
real world stuff.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.590
And those are the nouns
in the world, right?

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.925
Well, what about the verbs?

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.210
Verbs are action.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.370
They're where it's happening.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.850
And we haven't been providing
vocabulary for that to date.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.980
But now we are.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.360
So that can enable some things
like making information more

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:14.910
actionable.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.780
So when we look at that flight
reservation and the flight

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.980
status, actually being able to
check in with a single click,

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.580
or RSVP to an invitation.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.310
And we can actually start
to create a vocabulary.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.420
And it's basically a simple,
declarative API--

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.110
just like HTML is simple
and declarative--

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.650
for these kinds of things.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.510
We already had markup
for an event.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.850
So saying that there is an
action that you can do to an

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.110
event like RSVP actually
becomes a fairly simple

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:56.260
extension or layer
on top of that.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.540
One other nice thing about the
actions vocabulary is not only

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.800
going can it be used in this way
to provide action buttons,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.960
but we can actually use it to
describe the state of an

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.450
activity in progress, or even
in the past, like somebody

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.700
took an action, like
you did RSVP.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.090
And those things can be
described as well.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.670
And so I think it's this stuff
where you actually start to

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:30.250
see that this is more than just
connecting content to the

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.050
things, but actually starts to
become more of a platform--

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.550
like I said, a declarative
API--

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.460
that you're putting into your
website, but in a simple and

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.420
open way, just like the web.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:47.840
So that then becomes available
to any search

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.040
engine, to any client.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.100
So hopefully I gave
you some sense of

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:58.850
where things are going.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:04.520
Like I said, the follow-up talks
are the Markup Tools in

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.120
that help, which if you have any
interest in implementing

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.610
this stuff, definitely
encouraged.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.470
There's the Freebase
talks I mentioned.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:18.540
And then there's also a deep
dive on the email and the

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:23.140
searchable email stuff
later today as well.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:28.360
So with that I'll
take questions.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.540
I'm currently publishing a lot
of schema.org marked up

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.150
pages-- about 400,000 entities
that I'd like to

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.670
contribute to Freebase.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:43.420
The problem is that it's legacy
data that's cruddy.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.900
So I'm wondering, I guess, two
things-- one, the process for

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.325
actually getting our data into
the Knowledge Graph such that

00:48:51.325 --> 00:48:53.480
we can then start pointing to it
and other people can start

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.730
pointing to it, I guess
via Freebase.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:02.670
And two, what, I guess,
requirements there are for the

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.660
quality of the data that's
coming in, and whether that

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.880
can be accepted provisionally
and then cleaned

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.740
up after the fact.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.170
JASON DOUGLAS: Right.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.090
So in terms of the technical
specifics, definitely

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.710
encourage-- there's sandbox
hours and office hours and we

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:16.580
can get into more detail.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:21.890
But I think, on the quality
question, that

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:22.890
is a very big one.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:27.360
If you think about it, if you
are trying to give unique IDs

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.620
to things in the world and
building up your understanding

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.790
of the world by attaching
more things to that,

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.050
errors are a big deal.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.600
They propagate very quickly.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.160
They mess up your understanding
of the world.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.380
So generally, the Freebase
community--

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.220
and this is true with all the
work we with Knowledge Graph

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.170
and Google, too--

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:52.120
think of at least 99% quality--
so a very high bar.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.610
And that's not just
a fact accuracy.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.550
In fact, the most important
part is actually

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:57.230
the identity precision.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:00.950
Meaning that we don't have
dupes, and that we don't have

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.360
over-clustering either.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:10.420
Meaning that we're attaching
attributes of different

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.060
entities to the same
entity when

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.710
they're actually different.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.760
So it is actually a
fairly high bar.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.880
But we can talk it.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.000
We also have tools and things
that we're doing to try to

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.690
clean up data.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.650
Because there is a lot of
messy data in the world.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:28.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.290
I'm wondering, is there any
collaboration with the library

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.490
science community?

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:36.780
If they've been studying this
problem for awhile.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.320
And then on the other hand,
Facebook's Open Graph, and

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.050
there's obviously
overlap there.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.300
I was just wondering.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:50.950
DAN BRICKLEY: So let me talk
about libraries rather than

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.410
library science as such.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.500
There was a teleconference an
hour ago, which is a W3C

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.950
community group called Bib
Extend, and their mission is

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.420
to extend schema.org's coverage
of books and the

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.100
graphic content.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.710
And what they're trying to do
is reflect into schema.org

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.510
some of the conversations that
are happening in the library

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.340
world, about how library
catalogs evolved from card

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.750
catalogs to thinking about
entities and relationships.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.064
So that's really our main
connection there.

00:51:18.064 --> 00:51:20.848
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:20.848 --> 00:51:25.174
DAN BRICKLEY: Ah,
we should talk.

00:51:25.174 --> 00:51:26.424
Facebook.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.120
JASON DOUGLAS: There's a
couple things there.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:35.050
One is we try to support
whatever we

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.110
can that's out there.

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.070
So when we talked about rich
snippets, the existing

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.920
microformats standards, a lot
of existing standards out

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.370
there are supported as
part of these things.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:47.010
But when it came to schema.org,
it was really

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:50.340
important to have an open
process that was extensible,

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.410
so that groups that have real
industry expertise or area of

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.930
knowledge--

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:55.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.170
talk about library sciences,
or government data sets, or

00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:59.400
these sorts of things--

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.890
could actually go somewhere to
approach getting vocabulary

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.390
added and extended.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.740
And the schema.org model
has fit that very well.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.950
That's why all the search
engines are participating.

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:14.100
And Facebook's welcome
to as well.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.790
DAN BRICKLEY: Just one more
point on that is the

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:17.050
underlying syntax--

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.130
so when they launched the Open
Graph, I guess it was three or

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.760
four years ago, they had
to pick a syntax.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.300
And the best thing that was
around at the time was RDFA 1,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.010
which they stretched a bit.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:33.170
And RDFa 1.1 was a response both
to that stretching and to

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.070
our choice to go
with microdata.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.720
So the latest work at W3C, RDFa
Lite, is very close to

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.930
what we've been doing with
microdata and what Facebook

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.020
has been doing with
their RDFa.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.330
So I think at the syntactic
level, there is

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:45.640
a convergence path.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.810
That should make things lighter
on your web page, even

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.480
if there are two vocabularies
there.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.110
JASON DOUGLAS: Like I said,
we make our best effort to

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.550
understand everything
that we can.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:59.615
But it's easier when
people share.

00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:09.480
AUDIENCE: OK, my question is
what are the databas you use

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.940
for keeping your Knowledge
Graph?

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:16.270
Maybe it is [INAUDIBLE],
maybe it is MySQL.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.380
JASON DOUGLAS: So yeah, what
we use internally for

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.060
representing the Knowledge Graph
is proprietary, like

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.740
most of Google's
infrastructure--

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.690
or not proprietary, but was
developed to deal with the

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:35.850
scale that we're dealing with.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.850
But yeah, there are an
increasing number of tools out

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.950
there for graph data as I think
people are starting to

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.340
realize that it has some
benefits as a data model.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.060
And I certainly hope to see more
of that, that the tool

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.640
set for people managing
graphs on their own

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.876
continues to develop.

00:53:54.876 --> 00:53:57.460
AUDIENCE: In my opinion
Knowledge Graph, it's very

00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.600
interesting kind of graph.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.240
Maybe you do have
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.950
paper about some characteristics
of this.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.540
JASON DOUGLAS: Yeah, I think
there's several things.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.600
The idea of semantic
graphs have been

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.160
out there for awhile.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.930
There's a lot of academic
papers on that.

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:23.330
There also was a SIGMOD paper
a few years ago on--

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:29.260
so Knowledge Graph started
with Freebase at Metaweb,

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.020
which was a startup acquired
by Google a few years ago.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.060
That's how I came to Google.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:40.060
And the technology that we used
at Freebase, there's a

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.045
technical paper or a SIGMOD
paper on that.

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:45.840
It's called Graph D. It's not
what we're using today.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.590
But it's interesting in terms
of thinking about, what does

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:54.530
it mean from a database
perspective to have a fast

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:55.780
queryable system?

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.520
AUDIENCE: You mentioned one of
the points of schema.org is to

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.070
have something that's
easily extensible.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:09.600
But what isn't very clear to me
on the site is how you go

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.800
about getting new data types
put in, how you go about

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.380
suggesting them.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.550
I work with a lot of data.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.490
I work with a lot
of legal data.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.840
And most of the data does
not fit in any type

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.120
that you have available.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.250
I'm also very annoyed that you
called schema.org/attorney a

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.060
business instead of a person.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.380
Because an attorney
is a person.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.590
A law firm is a business.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.810
An attorney is a person.

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:42.500
But for things like case law,
code, stuff like that, they

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.820
just don't fit.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.740
The closest they fit into is
scholarly article, but it's

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.360
not scholarly article.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.030
So I really want to try to mark
it up and submit to you

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.580
guys, here's all the pieces
of information.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.460
Let's get it out there.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.000
DAN BRICKLEY: So to be honest,
initially we hid it away a

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.880
little bit.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.670
Because we weren't sure if we
were going to be drowning in

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.550
thousands of proposals from
SEO advocates and so on.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.030
And we've gradually made it
easier to find on the

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:12.990
schema.org site.

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.510
There's a community at W3C
called the Web Schemas Group.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:19.420
And as I said earlier, we don't
want to make a formal

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.110
standards committee.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.170
But we wanted to make a place
where people could come and

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.160
collaborate.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.570
And there's a mailing list,
public-vocabs@w3.org.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.950
And if you can't find that
link, I'll make it bigger

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:33.040
later today.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.380
Let's just chat afterwards.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.590
JASON DOUGLAS:
public-vocabs@w3.org is the

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:40.600
key mailing list.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.340
And generally what happens is
somebody makes a proposal of,

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.910
we think the schema
falls short,

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:47.810
exactly like you're saying.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.410
So for law, it's not
up to snuff.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:54.060
And so you can see in some areas
like in medicine, there

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.550
was a major proposal made.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.790
And so now it's very rich around
health and medicine.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:02.140
We're going to need that for
lots of verticals, and that's

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.130
why we want to do it in this
way is because we don't

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.960
understand these verticals as
well as the people who work

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.350
with that data every day.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.170
And the more that these
vocabularies can actually

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.660
reflect the data-- well, you
see, we were talking about

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.010
actions as one of
the new things.

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:17.860
DAN BRICKLEY: All kinds
of crazy discussions.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:23.000
We were arguing about writing
"labor union" or "trade

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.680
union--" eventually settled on
"workers' union," because

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.390
"labor" is spelled two ways
in different countries.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:30.930
Those are the kind of
conversations we have.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.730
We're working to get more of the
corporate conversation in

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:36.380
public, too.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.550
And that's going well.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:38.190
You can see some of the

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.710
bibliographic discussions there.

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:41.630
I just wanted to show you
quickly before we're kicked

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.430
out of the room--

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.440
the Web Schemas Group,
there's a wiki.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.380
This is all on the W3C.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.380
And there's a table of
extension proposals.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.630
So this top table are
things in progress--

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:58.300
citations, organizational
departments, which should be

00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.430
do this week, same as email
messages, TV and radio

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:02.985
improvements, comics.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.800
And then down at the bottom,
all the things we've added.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.960
So quick answer--

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.890
sling something there.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.590
Start a thread on the
mailing list.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.115
The more consensus you can build
the more likely it is it

00:58:15.115 --> 00:58:16.365
will go in.

00:58:21.795 --> 00:58:23.020
JASON DOUGLAS: All right,
one last question.

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.045
AUDIENCE: All right, so this is
perhaps a related question,

00:58:25.045 --> 00:58:29.630
And it maybe more Knowledge
Graph side of things--

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:35.010
are there any plans to index
things are a part of our real

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:38.160
world but less physical nature,
ideas, like more of

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:45.290
the Wolfram Alpha, what's
gravity, things like that,

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.140
maybe philosophical ideas.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.590
I know there's overlap
with Wikipedia there.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.150
JASON DOUGLAS: There's more of
that stuff than you might

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.380
expect already in
Knowledge Graph.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.200
I think we try.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.320
Like everything at Google, if
people are searching for it or

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.660
trying to get answers around it,
then it's going to be an

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.580
area of focus.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.040
DAN BRICKLEY: OK, Google,
what is love?

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.290
JASON DOUGLAS: That
are answerable.
