00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.730
Analogy is often considered to be a core process of cognition. A common example

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.680
of analogy we encounter everyday is that of metaphors. For example, you can

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.030
imagine someone saying, I had to break up with her. We had grown very far apart.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.300
Far apart here is a spatial metaphor. One of the famous examples

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.410
of metaphors comes from Shakespeare. All the world’s a stage, all the men and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.840
women merely players. The theater here is a metaphor for

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.570
the world. A third connection is the Rubin’s test of intelligence.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.340
The Rubin’s test is considered to be one of the most common and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.790
reliable test of intelligence, and as you well know by now,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.930
it is based entirely on analogies. An analogy is that central to cognition.
