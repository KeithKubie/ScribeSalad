00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now, there's a quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Our JavaScript interpreter is going to have to compute the value of 6 factorial,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a function call within a function call within a function call.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's turtles all the way down.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How many different environment frames will be created by the interpreter for

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
factorial 6 above?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Include the global frame in your answer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
How many total environment frames will we be juggling at the same time?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Fill in the blank.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Question 2--In how many of those frames will n have the same value?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So if you could find 3 frames where n was 77, then the answer here would be 3.
