00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:07.290
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from my day Monday.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.470
Um, was it April? I'm going to go with April,

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:14.910
April 25th, 2016 what's going on? Hello?

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.650
How are you? Yy, Ya. Um, I just got back from, uh, Iowa,

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210
uh, connected through Phoenix. Could not get a direct flight out of Des Moines,

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.380
Moines international airport and De Moines, Iowa.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
One of the greatest international airports you'll ever go to.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.000
My hotel was right next door to it. I was,

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.460
I was there for about three hours before the show. Okay.

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.320
I think I heard three jets take off. That's fucking awesome.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.780
It's a decent size airport too, but there's very little people, you know,

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.260
come on on and corn fields, you know,

14
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.790
getting out of the death metal fucking band rehearsal and going to the des

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.790
Moines international airport to fucking go anywhere. Evidently, um,

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.200
breezed right through security, all the whole thing. What I love fucking,

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.620
I love little airports. Um,

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.790
I love them the way some of these chicks loved that dude who left that fucking

19
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.670
band, those poor fucking little girls. How could he too? Um,

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.690
what a fucked up parents film their kids. An embarrassing moment.

21
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.570
I could see if siblings do it, but it always seems like a lot of parents,

22
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:28.500
they just filmed their fucking kids and it's just like all those girls who

23
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.680
fucking got filmed or film themselves, you really should take it down.

24
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.640
But once it's updated yet you're finished, you fucking done.

25
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
You can't run for president with that on your fucking profile history.

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.220
I wonder who's gonna be the first one to run for president. Right.

27
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.600
And then they just pull up, uh, you know,

28
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.440
some clip from their childhood on Facebook or on Youtube or some shit,

29
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.760
some video of them either saying something fucked up or getting hit in the balls

30
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.600
and then crying like a little girl or something like that. You know.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.710
Do you remember that time when that fucking dead fat kid threw that thing at the

32
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.250
little kid and the kid ran over and he threw the skateboard at him and the kid

33
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.970
fucking fell down and let out a cry leg. Oh,

34
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.440
I can't even fucking do it in that moment.

35
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.510
That kid's life is far as any sort of leadership role is over.

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.380
You know, and I know what you're saying. You Go, well, look at him bellies out.

37
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.890
Dare Eaton Ring dings running around with his high pitch voice.

38
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.570
Who's gonna follow that into battle?

39
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.200
It's like people fucking develop later in life, you know?

40
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.650
But you should have seen me when I was a kid. A better yet.

41
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:41.130
It was good thing you didn't fucking orange hair,

42
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.080
you know, fucking total introvert, lunatic,

43
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.880
Luna tick literally could not talk to a girl without my face turned beet red.

44
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.290
I was a fucking mess.

45
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.730
If that was fucking videos of that or all the fucking ass kickings I took,

46
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:00.070
I remember a girl beat me up enough when I was in third grade.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.600
This fifth grade girl beat me up because I was playing with this kickball and

48
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.270
her sister came up, was playfully taken away from me.

49
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.690
So I ran up to take it back and she was running along the school and I ripped it

50
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.490
out of our hands, you know,

51
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.300
used to playing with boys and she's Kinda careened into the side of the school.

52
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.470
Which of course is made of brick cause you know, if it catches fire,

53
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.920
you know you want something to be able to rebuild on, you know,

54
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.830
I mean all those rugs and everybody inside are going to go up like a fucking

55
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.401
bowling alley.

56
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.630
But you want the main structure cause the town's got to pay for it. So anyways,

57
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.180
he goes into the building, hit her ahead and as I'm like, Oh fuck,

58
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:38.014
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.490
Her fucking sister showed up and there's a big difference between third grade

60
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.600
and fifth grade. She looked like a substitute teacher.

61
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.920
I mean that's how much fucking older she looked at me and she fucking just

62
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.690
rained these fucking punches down on me. And uh, I held it together,

63
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.840
you know, I, you know, I waited till the end of the round.

64
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.390
I knew I was going to lose the decision and I was all right.

65
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:01.720
I was trying to walk it off. It really fucking hurt. And then some girls,

66
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.300
I forget what she said to me, but it actually made me cry.

67
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.970
He said something supportive. I have no idea. So, um,

68
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.980
yeah. Now, if there was video of that, I mean that's it. If they ever had,

69
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:17.830
I mean there's a guy you want running the country,

70
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.580
get beat up by a girl and start crying.

71
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.773
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.520
<v 0>Hi. How's he going to keep America safe? How's he gonna keep children safe?</v>

73
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.050
How's he gonna keep Jesus safe and then that's going to be under them at the end

74
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:36.110
of it. All these fucking people. You've just film your fucking kids

75
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.330
all this oversharing.

76
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:42.720
I don't give a fuck that your kids 13 years old is in love with the boy band.

77
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.420
Stopped filming the fucking, I mean, I,

78
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.290
I'm not talking about the kids who filmed themselves,

79
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:48.180
but just sometimes it's parents, which is really weird.

80
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.450
Like I hate those families that I'll get into their care van and they start

81
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:55.380
singing songs or doing dances and that just, wow.

82
00:04:55.381 --> 00:05:00.330
That's the funnest family ever. You know, I can see through it. You know,

83
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.630
the second that camera turns off, the dead turns into Joe Jackson

84
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.430
starts beating their asses all over the fucking house. Um,

85
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.100
anyway, sorry, that was just a complete, uh, a complete left turn.

86
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.980
But, uh, I dunno,

87
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.070
I'm actually fascinated with that dude leaving the boy band at the height of

88
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:27.510
their fucking popularity, you know, just as far as, you know,

89
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.180
being in the entertainment business going, all right, and how do you do this?

90
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:32.640
Did he make enough fucking money? You know,

91
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.390
God damn well his manager and everyone around him stole from the guy.

92
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.180
Did he make enough fucking money? The thing about it is,

93
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.980
is he's so young, he's going to look like that guy for a while.

94
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.060
So it's not like, you know,

95
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.170
he's at that age where he can just slip back into the, uh,

96
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.750
you know, like at my age, I'm going to be 48 and 10 years. I'll be 58.

97
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:57.890
I'm going to look way fucking different. Okay.

98
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.610
48 is the last sort of like, you know,

99
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.090
I could go down and maybe play some pickup hoop and I could get picked last.

100
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.700
That's it. And then 48 to 58 that's, you know,

101
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.280
when you start getting the chicken neck, you know,

102
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.500
you start getting your fairs in order.

103
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.420
Fucking 21 you know, just barely got to be 30 right.

104
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.570
A little over 30 I should say. So if I was him,

105
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.930
I would shave off that fucking facial hair and I would just start eating

106
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.330
McDonald's and I've just become a fat fuck.

107
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.570
And then I just wait to see I why you don't want to be a fat guy.

108
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:39.440
If you're a fat guy then then you like feel like famous in a different way.

109
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.900
Like everybody looks at you but you don't have a show, you know?

110
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.160
If you get to that level of fat, all right, don't get like circus fat.

111
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.550
<v 2>All right.</v>

112
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.800
<v 0>That'd be funny if he did that and it was just so good at everything.</v>

113
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:52.380
He became like the fattest guy ever, you know?

114
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:55.230
And then everyone was staring at him again. He's just like, fuck, I just,

115
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.830
I can't not be famous. Um,

116
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.360
<v 2>okay.</v>

117
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.910
<v 0>Anyways, good luck to that kid. And, and parents take,</v>

118
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:06.090
take down the fucking videos. You got damn kids. You fucking Weirdos.

119
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.720
There's probably some pervert out there that likes to jerk off to fucking girls

120
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.740
crying to boy band members who just left has probably a fetish at this point.

121
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.920
You know, it's nothing else left to jerk off. You create a new,

122
00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:19.770
literally create a new type of porn.

123
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.230
All right. Anyways, plowing, plowing ahead.

124
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.090
Now I know what all you guys take. I'm going to talk about, you know,

125
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.860
you're going to be like, oh I saw a big sports story. Oh boy, your boy.

126
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:38.370
I hope buddy. I hope he didn't fucking record his podcast before that went down.

127
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.000
Well I didn't, I didn't. Okay, I will talk about that later.

128
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.660
I just don't give a fuck the way I used to. Um,

129
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.000
but let's get to what I really give a shit about.

130
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.060
It's only two things I give a fuck about right now.

131
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.300
Gave seven in St Louis

132
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.500
and fucking gave five back in Atlanta,

133
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.050
the Boston Celtics.

134
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.670
I missed every fucking second of the last two games cause I was on the road.

135
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.060
I missed all of them. It was fucking driving. I didn't have my foam raw,

136
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.770
so my fucking leg was going down.

137
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.730
Now my head to fucking pull over at a rest area, you know, stretch it out.

138
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.953
You know what I mean?

139
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.520
Keep my head on a swivel looking for fucking truckers,

140
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:28.420
questioning their sexuality and fucking a, what are they? These serial killers.

141
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.630
Serial killers, love a fucking rest area. So anyways, um,

142
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.120
I missed, I missed all of that. All I know is that they came back,

143
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.230
they tied it up. I was so happy and I did see that clip of whoever that was,

144
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:45.440
was it a smart on the fucking smart on the Celtics,

145
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.970
barely getting touched and literally throwing himself out of bounds. I made,

146
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.560
I know he got fined five grand.

147
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:54.530
They should've given him at least like $1,000 off.

148
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.960
Just cause he kinda hurt himself. He went up so high.

149
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:01.410
That was one of the worst fucking dives I've ever seen in my life.

150
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.110
And uh, I mean, I even picked to the Celtics, probably tease them about that.

151
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.990
By the time we got to the locker rooms like Jesus Christ to just flopped to the

152
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:14.910
ground. You fucking jumping up in the air. Um,

153
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.950
anyways. And the St Louis Blues, what the

154
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.903
<v 3>fuck?</v>

155
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.090
<v 0>You know, I already went to a heartache with my team.</v>

156
00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:26.320
I fucking hitch my wagon to you guys. You get up three to one. I knew,

157
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.190
I fucking knew they had to win game five game fight. You know, so,

158
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:33.430
so fucked up about a seven game series is you're up three games to fucking one

159
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.920
and you thinking like, oh we gotta deal with just fucking win one. No,

160
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:39.760
you fucking have to win game five cause the seconds you don't win game five,

161
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.300
the last two games, the pressure's on you. All of a sudden it goes,

162
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:46.720
oh now wait a minute. The last game five a deal.

163
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:50.380
The other guys when the next game tied up, yeah. You know, I'll die right now.

164
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.830
Anything could happen. Chicago,

165
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.010
black cops have the momentum going into gage Saturn. The Seiko,

166
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.080
his blues have a history of playoff collapses. You know,

167
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:03.650
that's all they saying on the fucking,

168
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.490
<v 3>oh my God. Oh my God,</v>

169
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.970
<v 0>I had such belief in this team.</v>

170
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:14.120
I still believe me when I'm fucking three games to one and I was sitting there

171
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:17.300
and I said, without a doubt, I said, the fucking Celtics,

172
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.170
we're gonna win game three. I called it and then I talked shit. And I said,

173
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:23.540
like, I said, this selfish, we're going to win game three.

174
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.910
The fucking St Louis Blues are gonna win game six and they were up three to one

175
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.530
before I went on stage in Kansas City. Uh,

176
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.510
and I was thinking like, all right, they got that fucking, was it Elliot net?

177
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.070
He's playing great. They got, they have a size advantage, Yada Yada.

178
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.810
I think of this looks pretty good. So I go on stage, right?

179
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.410
I do my shit and Dick Jokes for about a good hour and a half.

180
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.940
I come off the stage,

181
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:54.941
had a great fucking show and I walk in the green room and all the fucking a

182
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.210
black Cox, you fucking cheesing ear to ear grid.

183
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.720
The cut to Mike Millbrae and I see the final score was,

184
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.330
it was at like six to three and I was just like, what the fuck happened?

185
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.110
Tell you what happened. Five minutes. It's fucking goals is what happened.

186
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:10.990
I've yet to see the highlights of that. But, um,

187
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.790
I'm recording my podcast right now and I'm,

188
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.940
and then I got to go over to the writers room here working on episode three

189
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.460
written by yours truly for next season.

190
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.290
Who hypes the cartoon fucking 13 months before it comes out this guy.

191
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.680
Um, and then I'm going to be a,

192
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.460
I'm taping the blues game so I'm not going to be on Twitter or any of that shit

193
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:35.300
just in case you guys, uh, you know, send me scores and shit,

194
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:37.970
but I'm gonna I can't wait to fucking watch that game.

195
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.200
It's going to be great either way. I want to see St Louis Win,

196
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.610
but uh,

197
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.670
you just have to respect the fucking greatness of the Chicago Blackhawks during

198
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:52.430
this era. If they come back from this. I mean, it's just, you know,

199
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.120
it goes beyond and I, he got to have guys like that guys said,

200
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.710
have one fucking what'd they went to already? Two or three to,

201
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.330
I think they should and they still want to win more. Very rare.

202
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.520
It's very rare. Most of the Times that guy wins. One, he's done, you know,

203
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.390
or he wins three and he just says fucking he keeps eating until his belt buckle

204
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:18.130
bursts. You know, that's what usually fucking happens with superstars. Um,

205
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.220
so anyways, I can't wait to see that. And then the game game,

206

five of the Celtics is tomorrow night, so I'll be taping both of those. Um,

208

I got hit by a jeep, right.

255
00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:26.140
I hit on my head. And then I went into the house and I was like, mom,

256
00:15:26.141 --> 00:15:27.990
I got hit by a car. And she's like, well, why?

281
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.210
Mike, God watching all those, uh, those clips of them

282
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.500
just lit it. You know what? I never fucking saw him in concert.

283
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:05.500
He came out here and did like 20 shows,

284
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:09.550
sold out at the, uh, the La Forum.

285
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.400
I remember Nia went and I was just,

286
00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:14.830
I forget what the fuck I was just on the road.

287
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.130
It was like the first couple of nights I had gigs still out here and then I

288
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:24.660
left, you know, for like data, like a 10 day run.

289
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.690
And he knocked out all those shows with some shit and I came back and I remember

290
00:17:27.691 --> 00:17:29.610
thinking, I, you know, and I'll catch him on the next one.

291
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.750
And unfortunately that's not how life works. And, um,

292
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.420
I gotta tell you though, like

293
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.270
the level that that guy affected people, I mean,

294
00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:45.190
they literally lit up the Eiffel Tower in purple. I mean, as far as an artist,

295
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:48.910
that's about as, it's about as big as honors. You get all these

296
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 0>like monuments around the world getting lit up in purple. Man, I, I hadn't like,</v>

297
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:57.720
I knew that we loved him here. I had no idea.

298
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:01.290
Like the level of fame that that guy had. Man, it's fucking crazy. So,

299
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:03.983
<v 3>um,</v>

300
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.990
<v 0>57, Jesus, question 48, that's all I was thinking like, good Lord,</v>

301
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.450
I've got to lay off the sys. Um,

302
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.610
<v 3>okay.</v>

303
00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.410
<v 0>Anyways, uh, I wanna thank everybody came out to all my, uh, my shows this,</v>

304
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.450
uh, this past weekend, um,

305
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.900
had a great fucking time play one of the most beautiful theaters I've ever

306
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:27.901
played to play the Fox theater in St Louis and they take you upstairs and if you

307
00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:30.190
ever get a chance to take a tour of the place,

308
00:18:30.191 --> 00:18:32.560
you have to see some of the signatures that are on the wall.

309
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.660
Please don't sign the fucking wall.

310
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.620
It's like fucking people did that next to like Stevie Ray Vanns.

311
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.650
Like one of my pet peeves is when somebody fucking huge signs a wall and then

312
00:18:44.651 --> 00:18:49.450
all these fucking jerk offs, right? Like within the name. You know what I mean?

313
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:50.710
It's like you're nowhere near that guy.

314
00:18:50.711 --> 00:18:53.470
Get the [inaudible] sign on the same fucking wall.

315
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.143
<v 3>Um,</v>

316
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.020
<v 0>David Bowie was really cool. David Bowie actually signed next to his name,</v>

317
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:03.690
but he just scribbled as, you can't even tell it, so I'm a fucking hypocrite.

318
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:06.150
So I signed near his, but uh,

319
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.140
what was so cool was the whole Stevie Ray David Bowie story from back in the day

320
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.180
when a Stevie ray went to,

321
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:17.181
was at the Monterey Jazz festival and they got booed off stage and David Bowie

322
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.880
was in the crowd, but love Stevie's playing. Um,

323
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.400
and afterwards came up to them and blah, blah, blah.

324
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:25.740
That's how we ended up playing on his let's dance album.

325
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.860
And then he wanted Stevie to go out on tour with them and Stevie just wasn't

326
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.930
feeling it. He went to some of the rehearsals and just like,

327
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:33.840
I can't fucking do this. I want to go back to Texas and play in my trio.

328
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.110
Started all over again and then, um,

329
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.460
became a giant on his own rather than being part of David's band. And, uh,

330
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:46.080
just the two of them, just to be that close. Like what was Jerry Lewis?

331
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.140
<v 3>MMM. [inaudible].</v>

332
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:54.650
<v 0>Of course. Now I forget. Sammy Davis Jr Tony Orlando.</v>

333
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.740
Just some, a bunch of random shit too. And all this shit from the 80s,

334
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:01.490
like the Thompson twins, all this crazy stuff in there.

335
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.750
Um, and they really kept it well. And Stevie signed it twice,

336
00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:09.570
once in 1987 and then another time,

337
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.293
<v 3>um,</v>

338
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.450
<v 0>I think right before he died and like the in step tour and, um,</v>

339
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.900
I got there a little bit late, so I didn't get a chance to see the theater,

340
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.790
like the actual theater where people were sitting,

341
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:22.770
thank God until after I did the show.

342
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:25.260
Cause I would have been a little intimidating. Um, came out afterwards.

343
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:29.160
It was fucking amazing and um, had a great show.

344
00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:31.740
And then the next day I went to, uh,

345
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.100
went to Kansas City and played this sprint.

346
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.530
<v 3>Yeah. And um,</v>

347
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.620
<v 0>I did a run with a j cat,</v>

348
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:47.240
a Predator and um, we were going,

349
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.470
we wanted to get barbecue and we tried to figure out where to go. That's right.

350
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.530
And they told us to go to that fucking Oklahoma Joe's or some shit.

351
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.820
So we fucking pull up there and um,

352
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.440
there's like a fucking two hour line outside the place.

353
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.460
And I'm just sitting there like,

354
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:06.940
there's no fucking way this is the line for this place.

355
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:10.120
But the royals had a game. So I guess it's like a family tradition out there.

356
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:13.780
People just do that shit. So we were like, well fuck that place.

357
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:18.370
So the next place I had on my list to maybe try out was this other place, Q 39.

358
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.260
And um,

359
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.220
it's the best barbecue I've had since saws when I was in Alabama.

360
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.110
It was fucking, it was the best. I will say it's the best brisket I ever had.

361
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.730
We both thought it a couple of Combo plates. So, um,

362
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:34.811
you know,

363
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:39.811
we ended up having to smoke chicken brisket ribs and um,

364
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.040
fuck else was there. Oh. And of course pulled pork and it was fucking amazing.

365
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:49.330
But I have to tell you, dude, right after that, man, I felt like I, I've,

366
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.290
I just, I'm too old to eat like that. I mean,

367
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:57.400
I'll spare you the fucking details, but my body was just like, yeah,

368
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.150
you know, you ever see somebody show up at a club and they're already drunk?

369
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.670
Like how quickly they get thrown back out into traffic.

370
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:04.990
Yet that's what happened with me.

371
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.733
<v 3>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.430
<v 0>It was not a, a, it was not a good thing. Um,</v>

373
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.320
was not a good thing at all. So anyways, uh,

374
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.670
but it was delicious and I didn't even eat that much. Oh, wait a minute.

375
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:24.100
Now he did. Then we got dessert too. Yeah, it was kind of a bad day.

376
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.120
It was a bad thing, but it was funny.

377
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:27.460
I didn't eat shit for the rest of the fucking night, but, um,

378
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.420
I had a great time. Uh, later on that night I hung out with a bunch of friends.

379
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.670
I've been going to Kansas City for a long time, so, uh,

380
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.210
and a buddy of mine out there who built my early, my first website,

381
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:39.430
him and his wife showed up. So we were just hanging out, having drinks,

382
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.360
just having a great time.

383
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.460
And then the last day was I got to go up to Iowa and, uh, Ames Iowa,

384
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.320
just north of Des Moines. And, um,

385
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.120
I finally went to that state during a sunny month and it was green and it was

386
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.250
fucking beautiful. And, um,

387
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.950
demoine really underrated city fucking gorgeous river runs right through it and

388
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.830
they got this beautiful two mile loop that you can walk around.

389
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.340
I wish I had time to do that. I forgot that that was there. I had, like I said,

390
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:09.940
I hadn't been in Iowa since I played penguins in Cedar rapids,

391
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:14.500
which I heard is no longer there. Cause the river overflow to some shit. Um,

392
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.200
but anyways, just had a, uh, had a great time up there and I got to tell you,

393
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.210
that's the fucking place to own a Ferrari Iowa.

394
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.200
That is the fucking place, man. Because I,

395
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.030
you see people run around a motorcycle with no helmets on and shit.

396
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.810
That is the place to own a motorcycle that is the place to own a fucking super

397
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:40.090
car. That is the fucking place to own a gun. You have to have a gun.

398
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:43.450
These fucking icons who live on the coast and they're all jammed in with people.

399
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.920
It makes sense that you don't want everybody have on a gun.

400
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.970
<v 4>All right.</v>

401
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:51.230
But there's this tipping point where the population becomes so fucking little

402
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.650
that then it, you're kind of on your own out there. All right?

403
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.670
So if you fucking weird ass neighbors shows up dressed like face, I mean,

404
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:02.240
you're going to call the fucking cops by the time I was joking on stage,

405
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:06.110
by the time they drive up your driveway, like half your family is fucking dead.

406
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.250
That driveway is, I swear to God. And somebody, some of these spreads are like,

407
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.760
uh, I dunno. They're like fucking

408
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.153
<v 5>okay.</v>

409
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:16.820
<v 4>They look like they're like a,</v>

410
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:21.280
like you could land a Goddamn DC 10 on a damn thing. So, um,

411
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.640
all right, so here it is. The big news,

412
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.680
the big news this week that I found when I got up right, was, uh,

413
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.320
actually I didn't find it til I connected.

414
00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:37.120
I flew from Des Moines to Phoenix and then I connected, um, you know,

415
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.390
get my connecting flight and it was late and I looked at my Twitter and people

416
00:24:40.391 --> 00:24:43.060
started sending me all this shit about Tom Brady, the suspension.

417
00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:45.910
Somehow somehow it came back,

418
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.250
it fucking blew my mind. I was always under the impression that like either way,

419
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.670
once you appealed it, that last thing was the final thing.

420
00:24:54.671 --> 00:24:58.630
I've never seen an appeal of an appeal. Maybe there's been one.

421
00:24:58.631 --> 00:24:59.221
I just remember what,

422
00:24:59.221 --> 00:25:02.020
I remember when Al Davis wanted to move the Raiders and they were like, no,

423
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:04.690
you can't do it. And he goes, well I'm fucking doing it anyways.

424
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.140
And then they had a court battle and he won and that was it.

425
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.940
The NFL just said fine. Um, maybe there was a bunch of appeals on that,

426
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:16.350
but that one came out of nowhere. And um,

427
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.753
I don't know, man.

428
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.320
I don't want to sit here and fucking be a big baby about it or anything like

429
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:26.830
that, but I did just really seems like it just went above and beyond.

430
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.640
It's just really extra. I don't, I don't understand.

431
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.240
I don't get the fucking NFL. I really don't.

432
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:38.590
I don't get why certain things, you know, you knock a woman out in an elevator,

433
00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:42.760
you get four games, you get two games at first. Right.

434
00:25:42.761 --> 00:25:46.330
Then they bumped it up to four cause everybody bitched and then they like,

435
00:25:46.331 --> 00:25:49.660
oh no, wait a minute. Wait. And we mean you're, you're out of football for good.

436
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.060
<v 0>You know, the subtext of that of course was no,</v>

437
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.810
we're going to lose a bunch of fucking money from women and guys who remotely

438
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:59.810
give a shit about women aren't going to buy our fucking jerseys and shit.

439
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:04.040
So now all of a sudden we give a shit. Right? Um,

440
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.300
so I just have to think that this really isn't a money thing.

441
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.330
They actually lose money when Tom's not playing.

442
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.660
So I really think this is just personal.

443
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.150
The Patriots did something to piss off the fucking NFL.

444
00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:21.610
I know a lot of you guys who aren't patriots fans think I'm just trying to make

445
00:26:21.611 --> 00:26:24.850
up an excuse. But the reality is, is the NFL,

446
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.080
the only thing they give a fuck about is money. All right?

447
00:26:29.081 --> 00:26:31.180
The way they handled all those concussions,

448
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.330
the way they finally did that bullshit payout,

449
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.370
the way they make money off of a raising cancer,

450
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.270
<v 4>fairness by having pink jerseys,</v>

451
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.790
not letting you know that only 3% of the or whatever goes to research and they

452
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:48.960
pocket the other 97% the way whenever they put a camera on, you know,

453
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.670
the service men and women that they hooked up, you know, gave them free tickets,

454
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:57.330
give them a round of applause and then they count that as a fucking commercial

455
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:01.650
and they charge whatever branch of service those people are in. You know,

456
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.940
how filthy they are there and only give a fuck about money. You know,

457
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:07.470
Tom Brady's captain America,

458
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.180
like the Patriots and nut guy looks like a movie star and they make more money

459
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:15.270
if he's in the game and you're talking about literally a cons,

460
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.550
hairs worth of air. They, they appealed it in one in the NFL still was like,

461
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:25.230
no, fuck you. Fuck you. So, um,

462
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.980
I, it's just, it has to be personal because,

463
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.400
and I don't want to name any fucking names here. Okay.

464
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:38.510
There's other guys just as big as him who had some really questionable fucking

465
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:43.521
shit that went way beyond fucking air pressure and a ball.

466
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.000
All right. And it was just like, yeah, whatever.

467
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.800
No biggie, no blood, no foul. So, um, yeah,

468
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:56.400
I think it's official at this point that, uh, pay as a patriots fan,

469
00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:01.430
I am not paranoid when I say the NFL fucking hates the Patriots and has it out

470
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:06.870
for them because they're actually shooting themselves in the foot monetarily

471
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:11.550
here over fucking air pressure over something that they lost in court and like a

472
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.810
fucking year ago. So, um, I dunno,

473
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.800
I dunno what we did.

474
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:20.850
I would love to know behind the scenes it's gotta be some Robert Craft Shit,

475
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:23.010
I would think, you know,

476
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.520
I can't really think of anything else because,

477
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.790
<v 0>you know, I'm trying to be honest here, but like, you know,</v>

478
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:34.560
some of the other infractions, without naming names,

479
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:39.180
I'm trying to be a class act here of certain things that went through the mail,

480
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.010
wink, wink, you know, just shit like that and it's just sad. Nothing,

481
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.420
no story.

482
00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.103
<v 4>Okay.</v>

483
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.050
<v 0>Um, and not to mention, you know,</v>

484
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.170
the colts owner in his own fucking investigation,

485
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:55.650
they found out that four of their footballs were also under inflated. So

486
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.570
you were talking about going on almost a year and a half ago that this happened.

487
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:04.050
This shit still fucking go. And so, I mean, all right. The NFL hates us and no,

488
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:06.090
Tom Brady for four games. I guess that's, you know,

489
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.210
<v 4>whatever. We're still gonna win</v>

490
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.310
one too good. I'm still going to fucking win.

491
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.750
All you're going to do is just make bill Belicheck a better fucking coach and he

492
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:20.550
already prepared for this last year,

493
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:23.250
so when we get fucking Janeane Garofalo in there again,

494
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.140
I think he goes to with too, I'm looking forward to it. Um,

495
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.830
all right, there you go. There's all of that type of stuff. Uh,

496
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.750
what a fucking weekend I had, man, I,

497
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:36.790
I can't tell you how much fun I had going out there and um,

498
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.790
uh, doing those shows, man, and uh, working on my act and all that. It's great.

499
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:47.440
I have like, I have the best fucking life I could possibly have.

500
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:47.890
Uh,

501
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.000
right now I'm writing on this the exact fucking show I want to do with a bunch

502
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.840
of hilarious people during the week and every other week I get to continue my

503
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:58.180
dream doing standup comedy. So, um,

504
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.890
and I'm working towards tape and another space Spec spacial special later on

505
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:03.160
this year.

506
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.160
And I'm also starting to get the audio together for hopefully a vinyl release of

507
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.400
, uh, my show at Madison Square Garden.

508
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:16.330
Obviously I want that one to come out after my standup special, but, uh,

509
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.760
you know, I'm hoping to do like a,

510
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.760
like I'm not going to say what I'm hoping to do with that vinyl album, but a,

511
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.610
it's going to be fucking cool if I do it right. If I don't fuck it up.

512
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.110
All right. So anyways, here we go. Let's read some questions here for the week.

513
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.880
Uh, Bill, when I travel out of town for games, I bring the stick.

514
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.390
Oh, this is about foam rollers. Um, cause dude,

515
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.040
I'm telling you that foam roller changed my fucking life.

516
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.180
Any old people out there like me? If you're young, you should fucking do it.

517
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.280
It's the greatest goddamn thing ever.

518
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.820
There's nothing better than like I, you know,

519
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:54.940
other than eating right in that type of stuff, um,

520
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.080
finding love and not having your quarterback suspended for four games over

521
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.720
subcounty air pressure, there's nothing better than, um,

522
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.280
that just being able to move your fucking body and stretching is the best

523
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.013
really.

524
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:16.240
Yoga Pilati is all of that shit is probably the best shit you can do because it

525
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.260
really keeps you in shape.

526
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:21.250
It really keeps you flexible without hurting yourself. I can't help it.

527
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:25.150
I'm a child of the eighties, so I'll always have that world gym, Gold Gym,

528
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:29.880
push it up. No, pay it. Okay. I always have to fucking, you know, do it. Why do,

529
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.870
what are you benching? What are you benching there kid?

530
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.040
I always had this always gonna be in B. Um, but anyways,

531
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.410
these foam rollers, I'm telling you, they, if they're the shit, so,

532
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:40.780
but I never heard of this. This kid's recommending the stick.

533
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.720
It doesn't sound like a paid advertisement. It isn't. He said,

534
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:46.030
I can fit it in my carry on you.

535
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:48.370
It'd be great as if this kid invented it and he's actually getting a free

536
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:53.320
commercial. He said, I can fit it in my carry on or in my gear bag.

537
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:54.940
Um,

538
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.620
so it travels a lot better than any foam roller and it's a lot easier to do just

539
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:03.250
sitting in a chair and not having to roll around on the floor.

540
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.720
You might like it. Uh,

541
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.310
it's what keeps me functional when I have three to four hurling games,

542
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.590
crazy ancient Irish sport to play in a day at a tournament. Well, wait a minute,

543
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.760
wait a minute. Wait. I gotta look this up. You know, if it's an Irish sport,

544
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.490
you know, two things, you know, it's fucking crazy. And you know,

545
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:25.180
there's nobody stretching hurling. It shows so many puking.

546
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.250
Okay. It's an Irish game resembling field hockey. All right.

547
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:32.400
I'm not trying to start anything with Ireland, but uh,

548
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.970
that's a woman's sport over here.

549
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.810
They run around wearing skirts and I know you guys don't do the killed thing.

550
00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:40.250
So what the fuck is going on here? All right.

551
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:43.400
Played with the shortest stick in a broader oval blade.

552
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.610
It's a national game of Ireland and may date back to the second millennium BC.

553
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.880
All right, so you're all forgiven. You didn't know any better. All right,

554
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:57.640
let's see some images for this sake. Oh fuck that. That's not a,

555
00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:02.050
that's a club. I would play that fucking game.

556
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.880
That is a fucking club. Jesus Christ.

557
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.310
Look at those fucking helmets they wear.

558
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.820
Yeah, they look like fucking butch goring.

559
00:33:14.821 --> 00:33:17.460
And then somebody took a welding class for the first time ever.

560
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:18.973
Butch Goring's hockey helmet.

561
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.110
Butch Goring's hockey helmet by the way is legendary.

562
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.340
He had the same piece of shit helmet I think for right up from the juniors.

563
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.200
And um, he just paint every time he went to a new team,

564
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.600
he would just paint it. I remember he finished with the, uh,

565
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.560
did he finish with the Bruins? I remember he played with us. Oh,

566
00:33:37.561 --> 00:33:40.350
those were the days. Oh, those were the days. Jesus Christ. Look at this guy.

567
00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:44.430
Take it. One of those fucking paddles right to the face. Um,

568
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.673
<v 2>okay.</v>

569
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.760
<v 4>Wow. Okay. I get shit faced and watched that.</v>

570
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.140
That is the weirdest looking thing I've ever seen. It's like a,

571
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.340
it looks like the beginning of a goalie stick and then you amputated it. Right.

572
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:04.320
Just beyond the heel. About a third of the way up the blade. Um,

573
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.930
all right, so the ski, you know what Dude, I really appreciate that.

574
00:34:06.931 --> 00:34:11.610
I'm going to check that out. Um, the stick good stuff. Thank you.

575
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:17.010
All right. China by Billy boy. I'm Iranian living in China.

576
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.250
Jesus, he goes, yeah, right. Iranian.

577
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.990
I think the only place that you might not have any fans is North Korea and

578
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:29.460
that's only because they don't have access to the Internet. Um, anyways,

579
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.130
I have watched, I'll speak it of which jade,

580
00:34:32.131 --> 00:34:36.420
who I worked with this week is Brazilian. And she mentioned, you know,

581
00:34:36.421 --> 00:34:39.480
she was thinking about maybe doing some standup down in Brazil and how that

582
00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:42.630
scene is starting to get going. And uh, I was just wondering,

583
00:34:42.631 --> 00:34:47.580
anybody from Brazil listening and if you do, if you have any suggestions, um,

584
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.370
cause I've always wanted to take my wife down there.

585
00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:54.150
She's always wanting to go and uh, I'd love to go down there.

586
00:34:54.151 --> 00:34:57.150
I guess it's cold this time of year, right? My wife's not into the cold.

587
00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.980
I personally like it. You know what I mean? That's all good for me. Um,

588
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.900
I have no problem with that whatsoever, but uh,

589
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.390
let me know what's going on down there and I'm psyched you guys are getting some

590
00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:07.260
standup shit going.

591
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.610
Cause I'd like to see your Chappelle's Louis C K as in David tells us what I'm

592
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:12.181
looking forward to.

593
00:35:12.181 --> 00:35:14.670
All these like India and all these places that are starting to get comedians.

594
00:35:14.671 --> 00:35:17.760
I can't wait to see the greats that come out of those, uh,

595
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.960
those different cultures. Um, all right. So anyways, let me continue on here.

596
00:35:21.961 --> 00:35:22.321
Anyways,

597
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:25.980
I've watched all your videos on Youtube and followed your podcasts for more than

598
00:35:25.981 --> 00:35:29.280
six months. Uh, you are indeed a funny guy though.

599
00:35:29.281 --> 00:35:31.530
My Chinese wife does not get your jokes.

600
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.640
Women around the world do not like my, maybe I should charge her,

601
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.880
change her to one with better tastes. I think he's given me shit there he goes.

602
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:48.840
I think you have so many fans here, especially among ex patriots. Well,

603
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.720
if you're in Hong Kong, yeah, I did a show out there. He goes, ah,

604
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:54.430
I don't know if you've ever been in China, but really hope, uh,

605
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.900
you get your ass here someday looking forward to hear back from you.

606
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:02.760
Please fuck yourself every day in the morning before breakfast. Um,

607
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.850
yeah, I was in Hong Kong last year. I'd never been to the mainland,

608
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:09.000
but I heard when you go to the mainland it's just straight Chinese,

609
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.120
you know what I mean? Like all the expatriates seem to be in Hong Kong.

610
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:14.430
So I would go to mainland China,

611
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:18.690
but I just feel like other than seeing the Great Wall and uh,

612
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.980
eating some delicious food,

613
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:22.800
I don't think I could do a short there cause I didn't want to be worried that

614
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:25.890
not enough people would be able to understand what I'm saying and even if they

615
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:29.850
could understand it, I think maybe I just, I dunno,

616
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.070
I think they'd be like your wife. Like I don't get what he's talking about. Um,

617
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.480
anyways. Okay. Continuing on Hillary hot sauce.

618
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.210
All hot sauce. Hillary. Um, Yo Billy,

619
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:48.840
listen to your Thursday podcast in the bit about Hillary and the hot sauce is

620
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:50.940
actually true. Um,

621
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.200
there are interviews with her talking about this over a decade or so.

622
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.040
Apparently in the 90s, she learned how healthy it was to eat hot peppers.

623
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.990
And so she did. And she grew to love hot sauce.

624
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:04.080
It's also known that she kept a lot of hot sauces at the White House where she

625
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:06.870
lived. Anyways, for some reason I felt bad for her,

626
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.040
so I thought I'd write you well, here's the fucking thing. You know what?

627
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:14.760
You know what I like? I like fried chicken. Okay.

628
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.900
I would never bring that up if I was talking to a bunch of black people trying

629
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:22.710
to get their votes, you know what I mean? Even if she is into it,

630
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.420
what you just say, she is fine. It's still a fuck. It was, it was just tacky.

631
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.620
A hot sauce. I always had a, you know, it wasn't lipstick.

632
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:36.360
It wasn't anything like that. All the other bullshit that she has. Um, yeah,

633
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:40.800
I just don't buy it. And um, I just think they're lying sacks of shit.

634
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.680
And I've had 20 years experience watching them on TV.

635
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.550
I lived in New York when she was a senator there at senator there.

636
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.740
I watched Bill Clinton for eight fucking years. I can't stand them.

637
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:52.020
I think they'll literally fucking say anything.

638
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.230
I think they're bought and paid for it. They are the fucking devil.

639
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.730
Not Literally, they're evil,

640
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.240
but they're just the same evil that you're dealing with and it doesn't make a

641
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:03.000
difference that she's black. If she's got a dick or a vagina,

642
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.670
it's going to be more of the same if you pick her.

643
00:38:05.671 --> 00:38:08.610
And I think that's why you have to fucking extreme people.

644
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.120
I think people are sick of that and that's why Bernie still in it.

645
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.060
And Trump is still in it because I think generally speaking,

646
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:17.490
people know that whatever the fuck we're doing, it's not working.

647
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.660
It's not fucking working. So, and maybe it's not. Maybe nobody can fix it.

648
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.340
You know what I mean? You got fucking what,

649
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:27.090
a four or 500 million people you can get to all the go get them all to try to

650
00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:29.040
tug the rope in the same direction. I mean that's,

651
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.870
it's a very difficult thing to do at a, I don't know,

652
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.610
I just wish the election was tomorrow and we could just get it over with us.

653
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:41.260
I saw this funny sign on the Internet and it said 2016 everybody sucks

654
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.340
or something like that. Something about all the candidates they'll be,

655
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.040
there's not, I don't know. I put you, did I have to fill up the,

656
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.870
you know what I had to make up for me just butchering that thing.

657
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:52.630
I might have to put the, uh, the picture of it,

658
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.650
which I probably won't be able to find, so I think I'll just have to take it.

659
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.920
Um, then I fucked that up. All right, let's read the last two.

660
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:05.020
We're advertising's here. Uh, advertisements. Advertisings Sherry's berries.

661
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.640
Where the fuck are they? God it,

662
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:08.880
<v 3>all right. Here we go.</v>

663
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.290
<v 4>Oh, I should probably make a prediction here, right?</v>

664
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.543
<v 3>Um,</v>

665
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.850
<v 4>I don't know how to, you don't, I'd have no prediction for game seven.</v>

666
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.800
I want the blues to win.

667
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.653
<v 3>Um,</v>

668
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.510
<v 4>fuck. You know what? Fuck it.</v>

669
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.993
<v 3>Okay.</v>

670
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.900
<v 4>You know what? I'm not gonna say anything. Cause at this point,</v>

671
00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.330
blues fans are going to hate me if I fucking predict them again.

672
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.160
You know people get all fucking with that Mojo Shit. You're going to jinx them.

673
00:39:38.161 --> 00:39:41.040
Fuck it. I'm just going to watch the game. All right. Dollar Shave club,

millions of others.

683
00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:10.380
One reason is because they deliver amazing razors right to your door for a third

684
00:40:10.381 --> 00:40:13.150
of the price of what the greedy razor corporations charge that.

You'll get a first class shave when you use the executive blade without hurting

689
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.090
your wallet. Another reason is their doctor academies ECC,

690
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:31.530
but using it the with the executive ratio makes the blade glide gently for the

691
00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:36.330
smoothest shave ever. Dr Carver's shave butter isn't your average shave cream.

730
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.150
They'd like type the whole fucking menu.

731
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

732
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.930
<v 4>Teleco was introduced in the fucking Wu Tang. Um, all right. Gash,</v>

733
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:04.100
cash and banking. I listened to your podcast today and about about money.

734
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:07.670
How was just a number while relating to paychecks?

735
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.610
I couldn't agree more. Um,

736
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.420
that they are intentionally phasing out cash period. Every payday.

737
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:18.200
I go to the bank and I take out all of my cash except what is needed to cover my

738
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:22.580
bills and the bank. People look at me like I'm an idiot on a regular basis.

739
00:43:22.581 --> 00:43:26.420
I walk out of there with seven to eight grand in cash at least once or twice a

740
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:27.110
month.

741
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.770
And they actually interrogate me about why I'm taking all my money out of the

742
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:33.470
bank and how come I don't need my money in the bank?

743
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.760
All my friends think I'm a conspiracy theorist because I buy silver by the pound

744
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:41.330
and other precious metals. Dude, you need to shut up.

745
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.930
Stop telling your friends that you do this shit.

746
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:47.570
You're opening yourself up to get robbed. All right.

747
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.870
Just act like you're just taking everything down to the fucking bank.

748
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.210
Why are you telling me this? All right.

749
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:55.460
All my friends think I'm a cause fairs that buy silver Silverado.

750
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.880
I refuse to keep money in the bank. And if we ever go into a great depression,

751
00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.840
the government collapses.

752
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:04.010
They're going to seize everybody's money in the bank accounts guaranteed.

753
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.160
Uh, so I'll keep all my cash hidden at home,

754
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.520
which if the currency crashes really in the end,

755
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:12.920
it doesn't do me any good because it won't be worth shit.

756
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:16.310
But I don't like the government to know how much money I have at any given

757
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:18.800
moment. I think it's a good practice. So yeah,

758
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:21.830
I think people should take their money out of the bank. Every payday,

759
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.680
actual physical money and dollar bills.

760
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.280
Plus when I had the cash in my hand and I run out of it,

761
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:30.530
there's no way I can spend more than I have.

762
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.230
I also don't believe in credit cards. Everything I bought was with cash,

763
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:37.440
even cars, $30,000 cars bought with cash.

764
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.090
It may throw up a few red flags but fuck them. No, it doesn't. Not if you're,

765
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.810
you know, not if you're, if you're paying taxes on all,

766
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:50.580
once you deposit it in the bank, there's a record of it. And um,

767
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.760
I think the banks want to know what you're doing with it.

768
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:55.980
They always want to know what you're doing with your money cause they want to

769
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:57.120
make money off your money.

770
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.990
So what you do every week by giving them money is you give them an interest free

771
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:07.830
loan on their money. I guess they give you a couple of points interest. Um,

772
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.710
they provide the service of keeping your money safe, allegedly,

773
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:13.770
even though they're a bunch of crooks and then they load loan it out to your

774
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:17.580
fellow countrymen at super high rates. And you know,

775
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.730
this is nothing too. If you put seven, eight grand in there,

776
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:24.780
they can loan seven, 8,000 begins a hundred percent loan out all that money,

777
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.730
like, I don't know, like times three or some, some shit. It's crazy.

778
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.900
Back in the day, like when you ran a bank responsibly, what it safe,

779
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:35.220
he had 10 grand in the bank.

780
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:38.220
You could only loan out like there was a certain percentage,

781
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:41.310
you couldn't go past like 30%.

782
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.980
I can't remember what it was, but you know,

783
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.360
so the money was still there and that the bankers through paying off politicians

784
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:52.020
kept getting that money, that number, that percentage, um,

785
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.980
bumped up and up and up and up. And they kept getting more and more deregulated,

786
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:59.010
more and more deregulated. Now when you put the money in, they can loan it,

787
00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:01.170
you put a thousand in, they can loan, they can loan out.

788
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.390
Not only a hundred percent of that thousand,

789
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.630
they can loan like another $3,000 off of that thousand thousand for you,

790
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.780
you, you and you. Um, so they basically counterfeited like three grant.

791
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.310
As far as the shit that I've read,

792
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:15.820
and I haven't looked that stuff up for awhile.

793
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.460
Things might've changed after 2008 but it's a, it's a pretty shady thing.

794
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:21.241
But I will tell you,

795
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:26.040
I don't feel comfortable having a bunch of cash in the fucking house, you know?

796
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.990
Uh, I always hear the first 48 plain in my head. So, you know,

797
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.060
good luck to you. You know what I did after a while?

798
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:35.820
I just tapped out of conspiracy theory. I've got a fucking dog.

799
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:39.150
I watched sports and I just, I, I'm just,

800
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.740
I take comfort knowing that it can only die once. That's what I do. All right?

801
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.580
Okay. Oh, Jesus. Another fucking hair loss thing is this to me.

802
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:51.510
Another guy asked me, should I shaved my head? Should I not shave my head?

803
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.070
She liked glue something on there. Hey. Oh, flowers for billion.

804
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.850
Uh, I'll keep it short. Parentheses and thinning.

805
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.160
I've been losing my hair for the past couple of years.

806
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:06.030
It's thinning at the top and is been doing so for six years.

807
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.100
Um, I know you've gone through the same predicament and you're very perceptive.

808
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.730
I'm gonna go out on a limb. I think I know.

809
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.920
I think you know what I'm talking about here. He goes, I am,

810
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.480
I know it shouldn't matter and should, I should probably just shave it.

811
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:24.150
But I love my hair. My God. Do I love my hair?

812
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:27.560
I remember when I used to get my hair cut, every Barbara's stylist, stylist,

813
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.020
I went to said how it was so thick and I would never have to worry about going

814
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:35.500
bald. Those lying fucks. So when it started thinning, I,

815
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.470
I like most guys started reading everything I could.

816
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:41.680
I found out that most men have had success with Propecia.

817
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.780
It's a one day a pill that you take 60% of men every growth.

818
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.410
Well, 30% keep what they have. Um,

819
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.740
now what does that mean? 60% of regrowth in 30% of that 60%.

820
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.760
Yeah, I guess that that would be, yeah, that's obviously what that be.

821
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:05.320
Keep what they have no or was that the other 30,

822
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:08.500
60% keep what they have. Oh,

823
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:12.670
60% Jesus Christ bill have regrowth. 30% keep what they have.

824
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:15.670
So now are we up to 90%? Yeah, I guess you would be.

825
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.030
And it seems not to work for about 10% of men.

826
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.740
So it seems like a no brainer to at least try. Right. Well, for about 2% of men.

827
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.150
All right, dude, you said 60, 30, 10 and now two, we're up to 102% here.

828
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:32.830
So there's some fucking overlap. Um, it makes their dick not work.

829
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.110
They complain of weaker to know erections. Um, since look up. Look,

830
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.780
sorry. That's fucking hilarious. He keep your hair to get the girls.

831
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.380
You'd come home and then your Dick doesn't work. Uh,

832
00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.270
that's exactly why I don't fuck with that shit cause she could never have your

833
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:48.190
cake and eat it. So I just feel like a,

834
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:51.010
there's got to be some sort of damage that it does. I just, you know, dude,

835
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:55.990
I'm 48 years old. What am I going to join a boy band? It's fucking over.

836
00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.820
Do you know, I've gotta be honest with you. If you don't fight aging,

837
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:04.300
it's pretty painless. You know, I go to the gym, you know,

838
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:06.820
I keep myself in good shape at all of that other shit.

839
00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:09.730
These fucking is fucking woman was telling me this weekend that,

840
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.310
that out here in Hollywood, you know, uh, probably around the country. I Dunno,

841
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.070
they have, this is the most as most disgusting thing as far as vanity,

842
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:20.260
I think I've, I've heard in a long time, do you know they have,

843
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:24.870
they have botox parties. Like they come over, they drink drinks,

844
00:49:24.871 --> 00:49:28.120
they watch a show or something like that and then you can go over and Kiki yet

845
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.200
like that shit that makes you face look like the joker to shot into your face.

846
00:49:34.831 --> 00:49:39.720
Like this foreign chemical under your skin, you know,

847
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.260
I guess it's just skull right there and it is protecting your brain.

848
00:49:43.261 --> 00:49:47.460
But I just feel like somehow it's got a leak in there. Right?

849
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.530
Or it goes into your fucking bloodstream or something somehow and ends up in

850
00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.200
your brain.

851
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.460
I'd see you just literally injecting chemicals into your fucking face.

852
00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:59.610
It's the amount of people that won't do heroin,

853
00:49:59.611 --> 00:50:01.950
but we'll put botox in their body. It's just, I don't know,

854
00:50:01.951 --> 00:50:05.130
I guess it's whatever the fuck your into. Um,

855
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.120
<v 3>okay.</v>

856
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.740
<v 4>I Dunno. I, I, like I said,</v>

857
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.540
if he just accept the fact that, you know,

858
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:17.860
you're no longer young and you dress your age,

859
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:22.150
you know, you, you don't look that you have to keep yourself in shape. You,

860
00:50:22.151 --> 00:50:26.080
you look fine. You know what I mean? You don't look sexy.

861
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:29.150
You're not attractive, but you shouldn't be.

862
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.850
You should have gotten all that out of your fucking system.

863
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:36.080
This whole fucking thing that you got, like these, these, you know,

864
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:40.160
these broads on the fucking a real housewives walking around with their butt

865
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:43.820
dazzled jeans that got like four kids and they're still fucking putting,

866
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:49.430
you know, worker jeans on. It's like, what are you doing? You're a mom.

867
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:54.310
You know, the husband's walking around with fucking tank tops on. I just don't,

868
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:57.620
and just put on a sport coat. He supposed to be adults.

869
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.370
I Dunno. I blame Madonna. Um, no I don't. She looks great.

870
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.370
What am I talking about? Uh, you know, he goes, oh, what the fuck?

871
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:10.370
What the fuck? Shut up. It's still banger. All right. Sudbury,

872
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:14.520
the ugliest place in Ontario, Canada, a dear Billy Bird.

873
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.990
Please talk about your experience traveling through Sudbury.

874
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.910
I didn't think it was ugly. I thought it was cool.

875
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.230
Did you notice how there were no trees in the area above 10 feet tall or so?

876
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.450
Most of the vegetation in the area was destroyed by acid rain be caused by the

877
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:33.920
massive, um, mining operations in and around Sudbury.

878
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:38.330
Our stupid tourist attraction is the largest nickel in the world. Luckily,

879
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:42.560
they solved the population problem by building a gigantic smokestack,

880
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.800
currently the second largest freestanding chimney in the world to spread the

881
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:53.420
pollution out over a larger area. Industry has been winding down.

882
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.000
So now we have more unemployed,

883
00:51:56.001 --> 00:51:59.720
hardworking Canadian rednecks and ever great place.

884
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:04.100
Can't wait to get anywhere else. That's fucking hilarious.

885
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.020
I of course it may have a future as a writer.

886
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.010
Mancy l fucking Kuma works when you hate where you live.

887
00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:12.970
I didn't hate where I live,

888
00:52:12.971 --> 00:52:17.110
but I mean there's just certain things you can fucking bring it out of you. Um,

889
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.050
I had no idea. I didn't know any, I didn't think about that.

890
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.650
I had a great time when I was up there. And, uh, you know,

891
00:52:23.651 --> 00:52:27.130
I'm a nerd when it comes to traveling. I like going to places I haven't been to.

892
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:32.350
And at this point there's nothing I like doing better than not going to the

893
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:34.840
major city. Um,

894
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:40.720
I've been to all of them a thousand fucking times. They're great. But, um,

895
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:46.270
I dunno. I like going and I like going to the other places. Demoine deadwood,

896
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:47.853
right?

897
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:52.480
Is that when I went to and fucking Louisiana begins with an S.

898
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.030
I can't remember. It wasn't New Orleans.

899
00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.190
It doesn't begin with an s Schenectady Shreveport right now.

900
00:53:00.191 --> 00:53:03.760
Fucking though. Anyways, uh, open relations.

901
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.690
Hi there, Billy bald bags. Uh,

902
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.290
what the fuck is up with open relationships these days?

903
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:14.350
I'm a 37 year old lady,

904
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.970
unexpectedly widowed. I'm sorry to hear that. And after eight years,

905
00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:21.730
after eight years with my husband, uh,

906
00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:24.780
I'm getting back out there in the dating world and have discovered a plus

907
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:29.900
plethora of people who are in an open or polyamorous relationships.

908
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:32.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

909
00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:37.630
<v 4>I don't know what polyamorous mates, alright. Open relationship means like,</v>

910
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:40.780
yeah. You know, keep it clean. I don't want to know about it.

911
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:44.201
Uh, don't make,

912
00:53:44.201 --> 00:53:49.201
make sure it's nobody I know polyamorous m or a

913
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.230
do do, do,

914
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:56.860
do is a practice or desire for intimate relationships evolving more than two

915
00:53:56.861 --> 00:53:58.720
people also they have three together.

916
00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:01.563
<v 3>Um,</v>

917
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.790
<v 4>that's so fucking weird. Does a couple like breakdown the game tape afterwards?</v>

918
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:08.640
Like I just felt like you licked her pussy letter bro. Better than mine.

919
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.750
You know? Do you make like halftime adjustments when you switch and positions?

920
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.093
<v 3>Um,</v>

921
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.190
<v 4>open relationship.</v>

922
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

923
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.390
<v 4>Does it get me in trouble? Rules to be looking at this online.</v>

924
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.690
This isn't my search engine from relationships.

925
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:27.470
Six rules of for doing the whole open relation thing, right?

926
00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.110
One, don't do it to don't do it. All right. Open relationship. Alrighty.

927
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.750
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

928
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.100
<v 4>Okay. Here we go.</v>

929
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.240
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

930
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.380
<v 4>One, understand what an open relationship actually is.</v>

931
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.440
A, there's a lot of confusion, confusion,

932
00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:47.440
confusion about what is and what isn't an open relationship.

933
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.220
Some people who are in long distance relationships say they are in,

934
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:52.870
in an open relationship. They both hook up with whoever,

935
00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:57.090
but just don't talk about it by the word. Open connotes honesty. All right.

936
00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.890
So they have to know about an open relationship and knowledge as a couples can

937
00:54:59.891 --> 00:55:03.820
have their needs met by other people. If you're really okay with that,

938
00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:07.030
why keep it a secret? All right. Um,

939
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.750
it's actually a great point. If you are okay with it, it shouldn't bug you.

940
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.590
<v 7>What'd you do today honey? Oh, I went doubt all tape.</v>

941
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.790
I had some chip blow me on the way home and I got a pizza.

942
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.780
<v 4>Oh, that's great. I take thunder games, hunger games,</v>

943
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.800
whatever the fuck they call funder games. Um, make sure you're doing it right,

944
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.420
doing it for the right reasons.

945
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.390
Are you interested in an open relationship just because you want to be with

946
00:55:32.391 --> 00:55:36.470
other people or is it that you're interested in physical experiences with other

947
00:55:36.471 --> 00:55:37.100
people,

948
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.400
but you want to stay committed to sharing your emotional and spiritual self with

949
00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:45.140
one person? That's where it gets complicated. Set some boundaries. No Anal.

950
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:50.210
Every person, every person's guidelines are different.

951
00:55:50.211 --> 00:55:53.840
But there are always things to think about before you enter into an open

952
00:55:53.841 --> 00:55:56.030
relationship. Um,

953
00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:00.230
do you both need to be present in order for sex with other people to be okay?

954
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.960
Can you be with one gender and not the other?

955
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.950
Are certain sex acts off the table? These are all important things.

956
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:11.510
Uh, this is just like the early days of USC. All right. No more eye gouging.

957
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.800
You can't do that thing where the other guy puts the finger in your ass and then

958
00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:18.930
you go, all right, I give, I give right? That's actually a wrestling move.

959
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.770
You can believe it. Um, anyone you hooked, tell your other partners.

960
00:56:21.771 --> 00:56:24.880
Anyone you hook up with outside relationship deserves to know the deal.

961
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.280
Try say something like, I find you attractive,

962
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:30.100
but you should know my partner and I are in an open relationship,

963
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.960
so there's someone else in my life. That way they can be fully informed. Okay?

964
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.670
Keep it healthy. That's obvious. Have regular checkups.

965
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.630
There you go. All right, so now that I'm a little more fucking educated,

966
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:47.650
what the fuck did that just say? Oh, 60 turn-ons for better sex?

967
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.360
I thought it was turn for over 60. I think I am a little dyslexic.

968
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.670
I'm all right, so she says she's getting in there and everybody. Okay,

969
00:56:57.671 --> 00:57:02.020
so there's a bunch of like husbands and wives looking to hook up with her or

970
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:04.150
people who was saying that they're in open relationship. She goes,

971
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:04.961
I read this recently,

972
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:08.560
started dating a great guy who lives with the mother of his kids and his

973
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:11.260
supposedly sexless domestic partnership.

974
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.290
We have a great connection and we enjoy each other's company,

975
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.650
but he doesn't have a lot of extra chill time due to his family commitments.

976
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:22.840
I have kids too, the same age as his even. I keep telling him,

977
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.750
let's all hang out together, but he is hesitant,

978
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:30.780
which makes me question the openness of his open relationship or maybe he just

979
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:34.720
wants to fuck you. Right. I keep telling him, let's hang out together. Okay.

980
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:39.160
I should have walked away sooner, but he gives really good head. Jesus Christ.

981
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.350
I'm not ready for anything too serious.

982
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.980
I just wish she had more time to spend with me socially.

983
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:49.150
This seems to be more and more common. These, I'm so cool and modern.

984
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.300
I'm going to fuck you and then go home to my wife. Hipsters.

985
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.440
Should I keep seeing this guy? Uh, thanks for your insight.

986
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:59.230
I'm a former Bostonian living in Hawaii. I am a huge fan.

987
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.460
You keep me laughing through some hard times and I fucking love your old

988
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:08.080
freckled face more. Oh, thank you. Um, I would say, uh,

989
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:12.800
yeah, I, I dunno, that's all fucking it. Look,

990
00:58:12.801 --> 00:58:16.700
if you just want to fuck around, but like this guy obviously doesn't yet.

991
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.540
He obviously doesn't want to do anything more. Even if he didn't have a room,

992
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.910
wasn't with somebody else. If he doesn't want to hang out with you,

993
00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.100
then that means he just wants to be fuck buddies,

994
00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:27.320
which is totally cool if you know that that's the deal.

995
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.890
If you're all right with that, I would continue seeing him. If you're not,

996
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.160
I would move on. And if you're sick of meeting people like that,

997
00:58:34.161 --> 00:58:38.150
I'm sure there's men who, um, that didn't work. I was gonna say,

998
00:58:38.151 --> 00:58:41.840
men who are sick of meeting women who are in an open relationship. Yeah.

999
00:58:41.841 --> 00:58:44.860
Guys would be like, yeah, that's cool. You don't want to hang out. Perfect.

1000
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:50.420
Up Top. Sounds good to make. Um, yeah, I w I,

1001
00:58:50.421 --> 00:58:53.120
if you're your age, how busy you are and all that shit,

1002
00:58:53.121 --> 00:58:55.010
and I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm 10 years old. And he said,

1003
00:58:55.011 --> 00:58:58.580
I'm not talking down to you. You're 37. You got fucking kids,

1004
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:02.300
kinds of people you're going to meet in the civilian world are also going to be

1005
00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:06.230
married with kids. I'm saying are divorced. I mean, I'm, I would join,

1006
00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:10.670
I would join a dating site. That's what I would do. And uh,

1007
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:16.220
just say what you want and I would fucking go out and try and find it when

1008
00:59:16.221 --> 00:59:20.540
you're ready, when you're ready. But um, you know,

1009
00:59:20.541 --> 00:59:21.980
as far as that other shit, I mean, that's

1010
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.600
<v 0>up to you. I have no, I have no fucking idea.</v>

1011
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.830
It just made me happy then I'm fucking married. Um,

1012
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:32.240
and Ah, Jesus Christ more and more fucking brutal Goddamn Shit.

1013
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:34.660
And I even get to, I know you guys all heard the,

1014
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.350
some sad news about comedians this past week, man. Just fucking brutal.

1015
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:43.610
Absolutely fucking brutal. Maybe, uh, feel very lucky and blessed.

1016
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:48.320
So once again, thank you to everybody that keeps coming out to my shows and, um,

1017
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:50.870
