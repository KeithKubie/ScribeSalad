00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.350
Alright we're back. So let's, let's, let's think

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.400
this through, so the teacher gets to suggests to

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.623
the student any, any question. The teacher knows

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:08.773
the answer, and the teacher would like the learner

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:10.606
to get the answer as quickly as possible.

00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:13.639
Not requiring the full 20 questions if, if possible.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.655
So what do you think, what do you think

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:17.850
the teacher could do as a good strategy here?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.980
&gt;&gt; For 20 questions?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.737
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:21.411
&gt;&gt; So, if, if we think of the set of

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.160
possible people as being these sort of hypotheses. And you know

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.112
which of the hypothesis is correct and which is wrong, then presuming the

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:37.256
teacher can keep all this in her head, I guess the right thing to do would be to

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:42.728
always pick an X, such that it gets rid of as many of the hypotheses is

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:44.423
possible. But what, what, do I mean by

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:47.155
that? I mean, it gives the most information.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:50.242
&gt;&gt; Well, but there's a, there's a very strong kind of information that you

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.100
could get in this particular case. So, so, so let's imagine that this set

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.550
of questions is, is this sort of, you can ask any question in the universe.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.673
&gt;&gt; So, I give you some question, I oof.

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:02.650
&gt;&gt; Let's, let's try this because remember

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.850
we did this before, you thought of a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.970
person, and you had me ask questions. So I want you to think of a person.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.330
&gt;&gt; Alright, and I want you to tell me what question I should

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.170
ask, that's going to figure out who the person is as quickly as possible.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440
&gt;&gt; Okay. Is this person as

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.220
good in his field as his namesake is in his field?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.140
&gt;&gt; Is it Michael Jordan?

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.583
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:24.410
&gt;&gt; Is it the Michael Jordan who's a professor at Berkley?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.653
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:25.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.207
&gt;&gt; You could have asked if I say, is it Michael I Jordan?

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:31.366
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think I knew the initials of the two Michael Jordans.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.745
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Michael Jordan, for, for people who

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:35.309
don't know is a professor at Berkley and

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:37.062
one of the giants in machine learning. And

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.141
he is literally the Michael Jordan of machinery.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:40.506
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:45.210
Alright, but, but, but you could've done this in one question, right?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.000
If you had to ask me, if the first question was, is the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.369
person, and then the actual person. You knew that the answer to

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.350
that would be yes. And so I would've gotten it in one step.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.360
&gt;&gt; Hmm, that's true.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.987
&gt;&gt; So, given a, you know a, a sufficiently,

00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:02.087
helpful teacher. You can, you can do this in one.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:03.143
&gt;&gt; Well, that make sense, right? So

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.717
basically, if my questions include, is this

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:09.907
the correct hypothesis, then you should always just ask that question.

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:10.610
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.533
&gt;&gt; But that seems, that seems like cheating.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:18.004
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I would, I. You're right and all I was really trying to do

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.804
is show that, it's a very different problem,

00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:21.289
when the, the question has to come from

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.540
the learner's side. That kind of question from

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.160
the learner's side would be pure folly. Because

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.330
it would, it, it, the learner would not

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.698
know what person to pick. If the person started,

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:32.854
if the learner started to ask questions like, is the

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:35.880
person Michael I Jordan? The answer's very likely to be no.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.720
In which case that's not very helpful. Now, a really helpful

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.220
teacher could potentially change the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.530
target. But that's, that's definitely cheating.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.150
&gt;&gt; Mmm. OK, fair enough.
