00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.630
Okay. So far in this course, we've looked

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.470
at a lot of different topics. We've looked at

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.070
gathering data, and extracting it from a variety of

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.710
different formats, auditing our data for quality, and then

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.900
cleaning up our data. We've also looked at the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.460
mongoDB query language. In this lesson, we're going to begin

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.330
to explore our data, using the MongoDB aggregation framework.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.780
Using this powerful set of tools, we'll do some

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.790
initial analysis, and we'll also take a look at how we can

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.890
use the aggregational framework, for some

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.090
additional data cleaning, where that's warranted.
