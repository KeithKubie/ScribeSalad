that's exactly right

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360
that's exactly right
 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.010
that's exactly right
what we need is more information that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020
what we need is more information that
 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.230
what we need is more information that
the government collects not personal

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240
the government collects not personal
 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.940
the government collects not personal
information but general information to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
information but general information to
 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.590
information but general information to
be shared with the public at large with

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600
be shared with the public at large with
 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.030
be shared with the public at large with
NGOs with the society at large so that

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040
NGOs with the society at large so that
 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.640
NGOs with the society at large so that
they can then look at that data and

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650
they can then look at that data and
 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.070
they can then look at that data and
really see what is happening in our

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080
really see what is happening in our
 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.190
really see what is happening in our
society we now have the software tools

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200
society we now have the software tools
 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.400
society we now have the software tools
to do that we now have the interest in

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410
to do that we now have the interest in
 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.620
to do that we now have the interest in
the public to do that and that's why we

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
the public to do that and that's why we
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.110
the public to do that and that's why we
need to move ahead and make more and

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120
need to move ahead and make more and
 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.090
need to move ahead and make more and
more of that government information

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100
more of that government information
 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.770
more of that government information

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.650
 
there's a huge difference if you look at

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660
there's a huge difference if you look at
 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.790
there's a huge difference if you look at
