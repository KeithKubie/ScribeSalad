00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.490
What does the term absolute value mean?

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.860
Absolute value represents the distance
that a point is from zero.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.160
The important thing about absolute
value is that an absolute value

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.329
cannot be negative because
distance can't be negative.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.860
Absolute value is represented like this

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.250
with two vertical lines around
a number or expression.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.017
So for example, if we're talking about
the absolute value of negative five,

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:29.254
it looks like this.

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:31.076
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:35.780
So how far is negative five
from zero on a number line?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.660
Write the number of units
away it is here, and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.440
what is the absolute value of negative
five, write your answer here.
