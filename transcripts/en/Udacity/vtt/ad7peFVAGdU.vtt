00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.510
Okay, here's my answer. All we had is, is a simple

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.920
change. We just changed that function, instead of using hashlib md5,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.070
to now use hmac, and pass in our secret, plus our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.030
string s, and return the hexdigest of that. Now, this is

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.370
actually quite a bit more secure. So, as long as we

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.190
have a secret that nobody knows, and normally this would be

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.000
a long string of random characters that you generate and probably

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
store somewhere else in some other module, even if the attacker knows

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.110
our algorithm or, you know, watched this, this lesson

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.450
as long as he doesn't know what the value

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.380
of secret is, he can't produce fake values. Let's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.980
go ahead and give this a test. We're going to say,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.242
print make_secure_val test. We'll give this a run. And

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:44.580
we see output, our value plus our hash. And let's,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.322
let's make sure this works properly, so we'll send

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:52.620
it to a variable and we'll say, print check_secure_val x.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.490
So we take what we outputted here and run it

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.330
back into our function, and we see that we get

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.650
our result. And if we're to modify x somehow, add

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.280
some junk to the end of that string, we get

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.660
back nothing. So, with just a quick a quick simple

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.489
change, we add, introduce this notion of a secret. Now

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.270
somebody who knows our algorithm still can't make fake values.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.810
So let's go ahead and try this out in practice.
