00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's keep doing some Laplace
transforms. For one, it's good

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.580
to see where a lot of those
Laplace transform tables

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.210
you'll see later on actually
come from, and it just makes

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.780
you comfortable with
the mathematics.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.340
Which is really just kind of
your second semester calculus

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.230
mathematics, but it makes you
comfortable with the whole

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.630
notion of what we're doing.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.110
So first of all, let me just
rewrite the definition of the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.865
Laplace transform.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.990
So it's the L from Laverne
&amp; Shirley.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.780
So the Laplace transform of some
function of t is equal to

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.700
the improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
st times our function.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.180
Times our function of t, and
that's with respect to dt.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.030
So let's do another
Laplace transform.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.830
Let's say that we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.765
now our function f of t, let's
say it is e to the at.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.850
Laplace transform
of e to the at.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.160
Well we just substituted it into
this definition of the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.410
Laplace transform.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.040
And this is all going to be
really good integration

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.760
practice for us.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.180
Especially integration
by parts.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.910
Almost every Laplace transform
problem turns into an

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.370
integration by parts problem.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.740
Which, as we learned long ago,
integration by parts is just

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070
the reverse product rule.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.840
So anyway.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.380
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.300
e to the minus st times
e to the at, right?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.150
That's our f of t.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.600
dt.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.500
Well this is equal to just
adding the exponents because

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.670
we have the same base.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.160
The integral from 0
to infinity of e

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.630
to the a minus stdt.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.780
And what's the antiderivative
of this?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.400
Well that's equal to what?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.160
With respect to C.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.150
So it's equal to-- a minus s,
that's just going to be a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.920
constant, right?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.710
So we can just leave it
out on the outside.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:35.720
1/a minus s times e to the a
minus st. And we're going to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.760
evaluate that from t is equal to
infinity or the limit as t

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.940
approaches infinity to
t is equal to 0.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.270
And I could have put this inside
the brackets, but it's

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.190
just a constant term, right?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.820
None of them have t's in them,
so I can just pull them out.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:58.260
And so this is equal to 1/a
minus s times-- now we

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.340
essentially have to evaluate
t at infinity.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.190
So what is the limit
at infinity?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.400
Well we have two cases
here, right?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.510
If this exponent-- if this a
minus s is a positive number,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.700
if a minus s is greater than
0, what's going to happen?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.910
Well as we approach infinity,
e to the infinity just gets

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.260
bigger and bigger and
bigger, right?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250
Because it's e to an infinitely
positive exponent.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.540
So we don't get an answer.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.050
And when you do improper
integrals, when you take the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.590
limit to infinity and it doesn't
come to a finite

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.850
number, the limit doesn't
approach anything, that means

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.750
that k the improper
integral diverges.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.025
And so there is no limit.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.250
And to some degree, we can say
that the Laplace transform is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.480
not defined with a minus s is
greater than 0 or when a is

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.040
greater than s.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.665
Now what happens if a minus
s is less than 0?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.270
Well then this is going
to be some negative

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.620
number here, right?

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.740
And then if we take e to an
infinitely negative number,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.450
well then that does approach
something.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.690
That approaches 0.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.860
And we saw that in the
previous video.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.820
And I hope you understand
what I'm saying, right?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.830
e to an infinity negative number
approaches 0, while e

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.670
to an infinitely positive
number is just infinity.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.980
So that doesn't really
converge on anything.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.420
So anyway.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.250
If I assumed that a minus s is
less than 0, or a is less than

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.990
s, and this is the assumption I
will make, just so that this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.140
improper integral actually
converges to something.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.410
So if a minus s is less than
0, and this is a negative

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.470
number, e to the a minus s
times-- well t, where t

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.700
approaches infinity will be 0.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.230
Minus this integral
evaluated at 0.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.220
So when you value this
at 0, what happens?

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.140
T equals 0.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.520
This whole thing becomes
e to the 0 is 1.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.980
And we are left with what?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.875
Minus 1/a minus s.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:19.710
And that's just the same
thing as 1/s s minus a.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.540
So we have our next entry in our
Laplace transform table.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.670
And that is the Laplace
transform.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:41.800
The Laplace transform of e to
the at is equal to 1/s s minus

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.650
a, as long as we make the
assumption that s is

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.790
greater than a.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.930
This is true when s is greater
than a, or a is less than s.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.710
You could view it either way.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.350
So that's our second entry in
our Laplace transform table.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.310
Fascinating.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.460
And actually, let's relate this
to our previous entry in

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.970
our Laplace transform
table, right?

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.350
What was our first entry in our
Laplace transform table?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.810
It was Laplace transform of
1 is equal to 1/s, right?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.730
Well isn't 1 just the same
thing as e to the 0?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.930
So we could have said that this
is the Laplace-- I know

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.280
I'm running out of space, but
I'll do it here in purple.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.780
We could have said Laplace
transform of 1 is the same

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.790
thing as e to the 0
times t, right?

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.170
And that equals 1/s.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.075
And luckily it's good to see
that that is consistent.

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:39.950
And actually, remember, we even
made the condition when s

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.350
is greater than 0, right?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.565
We assumed that s is greater
than 0 this example.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.820
Here again, you say s
is greater than 0.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.920
This is completely consistent
with this one, right?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.600
Because if a is equal to 0, then
the Laplace transform of

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.360
e to the 0 is just
1/s minus 0.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.690
That's just 1/s.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.950
And we have to assume that
s is greater than zero.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.895
So really these are kind of the
same entry in our Laplace

00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:06.980
transform table.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.840
But it's always nice in
mathematics when we see that

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.740
two results we got in trying
to do slightly different

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.730
problems actually are,
in some ways,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.660
connected or the same result.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.320
Anyway I'll see you in the
next video and we'll keep

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.570
trying to build our table of
Laplace transforms. And maybe

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.130
three or four videos from now
I'll actually show you how

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.180
these transforms are extremely
useful in solving all sorts of

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.080
differential equations.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.710
See you soon.
