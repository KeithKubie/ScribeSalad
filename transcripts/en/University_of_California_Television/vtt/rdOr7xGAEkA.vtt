00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:03.926
(upbeat music)

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.020
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.370
of International Studies.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.920
Our guest today is Edward Alden

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.990
who is the Bernard L.
Schwartz Senior Fellow

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.080
at the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.840
He's a former Washington Bureau Chief

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.500
of the Financial Times.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.160
And his new book is The
Closing of the American Border

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.543
Terrorism, Immigration
and Security Since 9/11.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.730
Ted, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.250
Welcome back to Berkeley.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.440
- Thank you for having
me on the show, Harry.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.273
I appreciate it.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:00:59.450
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.700
- I was born in Schenectady, New York.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.770
But my family moved to Vancouver
when I was quite young.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.170
My father got a job at the
university there in Vancouver.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.700
And so, my growing up years were all

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.960
in Canada, in Vancouver.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.250
- And looking back, how do
you think your parents shaped

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920
your thinking about the world?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.970
- Well I think they shaped it

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.700
in all sorts of different ways.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.140
But one of the
acknowledgements that I make

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.880
in my book about the many
trips I took across the border

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.440
with my father when I was young.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.250
Vancouver's very close to
the U.S./Canadian border.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.880
And my dad had a hobby that took him down

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.140
into Washington State a lot.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.950
So I have a lot of early
memories about travel

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.290
across the border and dealing
with the border officials

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.210
in Canada and the United States.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.630
The concern at that
time was primarily that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.880
you were gonna try to
bring back a bottle of wine

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.840
or something you weren't supposed
to bring back into Canada.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.198
(laughs)

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:47.210
- Those were the days.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.300
- And could you hide it under the tire

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.600
in the back seat without them finding it.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.070
- And was there much
discussion of politics

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.920
and international affairs
around the dinner table?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.650
- Not a lot, though my
father over the years

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.980
has gotten more and more
interested in politics.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.591
But we always sat down as a
family at the dinner table.

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.330
And we discussed whatever
was on anybody's mind.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Since three of the four
children were boys,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.591
it was usually sports.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.749
But we did have good family
dinner table conversations.

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.930
- And where did you do your undergraduate

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.100
and then graduate work?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.700
- I did my undergraduate
all over the place

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.510
in Canada actually: at
Carleton University in Ottawa,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.270
and at the University of Victoria.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.390
And then I went out to work as
a journalist for a few years.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.760
And then I went back and finished off

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.020
at the University of British Columbia.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.390
And then, I came down here to Berkeley

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.370
to do graduate work in political science.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.960
- And here at Berkeley,
who did you work with?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.230
- I worked with a number of people

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.030
in the Political Science Department,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.400
primarily with Ernie Haas,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.490
and with Ken Waltz in
International Relations.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.190
And then, I became very
attracted to the work

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.020
of a sociologist, Franz
Schurmann, and worked closely

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.790
with him on a number
of different projects.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.680
I also did a couple of
courses with Todd Gitlin

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.090
who was a strong influence on me

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.760
during my time here at Berkeley.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.350
- And one of your first publications,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.570
I noticed, was with Franz Schurmann,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.740
and published by the Institute
of International Studies.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.560
- Yeah, he generously
agreed to work with me

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.670
on a project and pushed it.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.150
And it was a tremendous
learning experience for me.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.860
He is such an impressive
intellect, a linguist,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.990
speaks in a dozen different
foreign languages,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.060
and of course, in the
early part of his career

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.010
was an expert on China.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.667
I was attracted to his work
on American foreign policy,

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.070
and in particular, a book
called The Logic of World Power

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.220
which I still think is the
best single analysis out there

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.880
of the origins of the Vietnam War,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.540
how and why it was the
U.S. got itself embroiled

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.600
in that war.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.300
- And in both the case
of his China studies

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.030
and his U.S. studies, he really focused

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.208
on the power struggles
within the bureaucracy.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.320
- Very much, very much.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.910
It was, you know, his analytical framework

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.470
was that there were power battles

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.180
inside the administrations,
be it the Chinese Government

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.680
or the United States Government.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.870
And that those affected
very profoundly the policy

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.110
that ended up being presented
to the rest of the world.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.250
And the other thing about Franz

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.600
that was very influential for me was that

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.788
he was not just a
scholar but a journalist.

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.070
And during the time I worked with him,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.330
he wrote a weekly column
for Pacific News Service

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.490
in San Francisco.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.680
And really persuaded me, which
I think I wanted to believe

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.890
since I had come with a
journalistic background,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.140
that scholarly work and
journalism were complementary,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.340
that they weren't antagonistic.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.814
- And how has that worked for you?

00:04:29.814 --> 00:04:32.520
'Cause it's an important synergy.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.480
One is not the other,
but they can actually

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.250
learn a lot from each other.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.270
- I think in my case, it ended
up working out very well.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.990
I mean, I decided not to
continue on the academic path.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.470
I went back to journalism.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.280
But I ended up working
for the Financial Times

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.560
which I think is probably
the most scholarly

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.440
of the world's daily newspapers.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.010
I mean, there are many
people who work for the FT

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.270
who are, by any reasonable standard,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.030
experts in the issues they cover.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.870
They know as much or more about
what they're writing about

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.910
as the best academics, the best
practitioners in the world.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.390
So that was really a kind
of perfect home for me,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.750
a kind of halfway house between
scholarship and journalism.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.330
And now with the Council
on Foreign Relations,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.820
I think very similar in a lot of ways.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.700
You have people who are, you know,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.910
many people who are practitioners

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.790
who've worked in government.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.430
There are former journalists there.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.280
But of course, there's a scholarly bent

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.113
to a lot of the work.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.840
So I've tried to blend
the two in what I've done

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.100
in my career.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.440
- And when did you go
to the Financial Times?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.270
- I joined in 1998 as part.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.390
I became the Bureau Chief
in Toronto in Canada.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.940
And then, about two
and a half years later,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.830
at the tail end of the
Clinton administration,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.750
I came down to Washington to
work in the Washington Bureau.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.950
And then eventually
worked my way up the ranks

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.040
of the Washington Bureau to become

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.730
the Bureau Chief there in Washington.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.710
- How did Washington change
during this interval?

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.130
I mean, was there really
a noticeable impact?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.870
- The noticeable impact for
me was not so much the change

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.710
of administrations, but it was 9/11.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.280
I mean, I came in on the tail end

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.710
of the Clinton administration
when, you know,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.718
possibly with the exception of the effort

00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:14.810
to broker an
Israeli/Palestinian peace deal,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.210
the agenda was really
dominated by nonsense.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.440
It was, you know, the
Monica Lewinsky scandal,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.400
the impeachment proceedings,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.340
the sort of cultural war that was going on

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.430
between the Republicans and the Democrats.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.510
And then, of course, you had the drama

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.310
of the Bush/Gore election.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.200
But it quickly went back to a

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.050
kind of a business-as-usual sense.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.710
I mean, you may remember early
on in the Bush administration

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.310
the controversy over stem-cell research.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.680
And that was the big issue.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.880
And so there wasn't really
that much on the agenda.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.220
And then 9/11 hits.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.110
And it really was, for me and I think

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.740
for everyone in Washington at the time,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.573
a transforming kind of experience.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.040
Washington acquired a
seriousness after 9/11

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.700
that it hadn't had for a long time.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.600
- But before 9/11, you had as an interest

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.740
the whole problem of competitiveness

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.080
and how one addresses those problems.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.530
Talk a little about that interest.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.070
'Cause it seems that that interest,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.320
together with your crossing
the border with your father,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.660
seems to have helped
point you in the direction

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.010
of the book we're about to talk about.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.050
- No, I think that's correct.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.920
As a journalist, beginning
after I left Berkeley

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.050
and throughout the 1990's,
the major issue I wrote about

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.100
was international trade.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.560
I covered the NAFTA negotiations,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.726
the Uruguay Round negotiations,

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:41.650
the fights with Japan in the early part

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.460
of the Clinton administration.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.930
So I became something of an
expert on international trade.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.870
And then when I joined
the Financial Times,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.100
wrote more broadly about
international economic issues.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.820
The Financial Times is really

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.600
the newspaper of globalization.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.160
That was and is still for the
Financial Times the big story.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.510
And then so after 9/11,
in a way what I needed

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.090
to figure out as a reporter was, you know,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.560
what are the implications
of this new order

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.940
thrown up by 9/11 for globalization,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.410
for the linking of global economies

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.800
that we had seen grow so
dramatically in the 1990s.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.840
So that was the way in which
really my economic interests

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.200
led into the topic of this book.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.870
- Now interestingly enough,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.530
as a prelude to 9/11 there was a document:

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.530
namely the Rudman-Hart
Commission Report on Terrorism.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.400
And really it pointed
out the contradictions

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.720
within globalization.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.330
Tell us about that.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.860
- Well, it was interesting
because literally

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.640
the first story I wrote
as a result of 9/11

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.320
was about the Hart-Rudman Commission.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.870
On the morning of the attacks,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.260
I was supposed to have a day off.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.960
And I was at home and
turned on the television

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.280
just in time to see the
second plane hit the Towers.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.480
And after determining
have we got our kids home,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.570
and after determining my wife was fine,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.700
I got on the train going
into Washington D.C.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.140
'cause I had to get to work.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.610
And it was the strangest experience.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.470
There were packed trains
coming out of Washington D.C.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.090
I was literally, other than the driver,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.970
the only one on the train
going into Washington D.C.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.280
And I got to the office.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.520
And by the time there, of course,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.610
our whole office had mobilized

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.477
and there were people
working on the big story.

00:09:29.477 --> 00:09:31.000
You know, what happened?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.833
What's been hit?

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:32.800
What are the consequences?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.410
And I thought well what can I usefully do.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.690
And I thought well, I'll try to do

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.270
some kind of forward-looking piece

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.430
on what are the policy
implications of this gonna be.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.630
And I immediately stumbled onto
the Hart-Rudman Commission.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.190
Because of course, they had anticipated

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.610
precisely what had happened.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.767
They had said, "We're likely to experience

00:09:49.767 --> 00:09:50.860
"a major terrorist attack."

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.700
They'd reported in 1999.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.390
And so for the paper of September 12th,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.500
I wrote about that report and said

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.690
this is going to open a
debate in the United States

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.880
about whether we need a
Homeland Security apparatus.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.800
And it really went from there.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.550
And as you suggest, the
Hart-Rudman Commission

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.450
understood the dilemma which is

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.890
how do you improve security
against a terrorist attack

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.500
without putting sand into
the gears of globalization,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.220
without throwing away the free mobility

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.790
both in terms of goods
and in terms of people.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.440
That was and is

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.030
one of the primary
features of globalization.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.380
- And then let's bore into
that problem a little.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.400
Amy Chua has been a guest on our program.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.530
And in a recent book,
she really points out

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.530
on the one hand how power of empires

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.500
over the years has been highly dependent

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500
on the influx, or use of talented people

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.880
from all parts of the world.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.320
So in a way, one component
of globalization is

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.580
if you're gonna stay ahead competitively,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.300
you've really got to
attract the best people,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.650
the best students, and
essentially have open borders.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.050
- Yeah, I was influenced by Amy's book,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.690
and also by a kind of more
contemporary version of it.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.523
Contemporary in the sense that

00:11:16.523 --> 00:11:18.210
she's written a history of empires.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.130
Contemporary version by Richard Florida

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.400
who wrote a book called The
Rise of the Creative Class.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.230
And it was the same argument.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.530
The argument is that the
economies that flourish

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.819
are the ones that are best at attracting,

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:34.340
integrating, making maximum use

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.660
of the world's most talented people.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.290
And Amy argues it in that
book that this was true,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.340
even though you might not have thought it,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.860
for the Roman Empire and for
other great empires in history.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.870
It's certainly been the
case for the United States.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.380
The danger she points out is that openness

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.760
sometimes creates the seeds
of its own destruction.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.160
That there can be negative consequences

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.190
from openness that cause countries

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.060
to turn their back, to close down.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.840
And one of my motivations
for writing the book

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.450
was the fear that after
9/11, the United States

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.840
had begun to implement
measures that in a way

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.820
were going to kill the goose
that laid the golden egg:

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.130
this openness, this magnet for talent

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.440
that the U.S. has been for so many years.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.750
- And you, you actually
in your own research

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.491
cite a lot of examples of how, in a way,

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.670
interdependent we are.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.080
To read you back some of them,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.270
as early as 1990, a
third of Silicon Valley

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.220
scientific and engineering workforce

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.710
was made up of immigrants,
primarily from China and India.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.830
By 1998, there were nearly
3,000 firms in the region

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.680
led by Chinese or Indian chief executives

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.894
accounting for more than
6.8 billion in sales

00:12:43.894 --> 00:12:45.660
and 58,000 in jobs.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.660
And more than half of
the PhDs in engineering

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.380
and science are from foreign countries.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.270
So it's a real connection,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.980
a flow of

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.980
human resources that
really makes our vitality

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.410
as the leading global power real.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.930
- Yeah, I think there's
absolutely no question about it.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.000
And there's been recent
research looking at patents

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.620
as an indicator of innovation.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.490
And immigrants file
for and receive patents

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.450
at a much higher rate
than American citizens.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.440
And the reason is not that they're smarter

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.900
or more entrepreneurial necessarily,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.180
but that we are attracting
a lot of foreign scientists,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.878
engineers, the sort of
people who are likely

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:31.870
to file patents.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.820
They come; they study
at U.S. universities.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.653
They remain here.

00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:35.700
They become part of companies.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.980
They start their own companies.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.690
And it's absolutely been an
engine of American innovation.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.820
And innovation has
really been at the heart

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.100
of American economic leadership.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.850
I mean, getting back to
the competitiveness themes.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.440
If you had to point to a
single factor that accounts

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.460
for the American ability
to stay at the top

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.030
decade after decade after decade,

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.683
it's our capacity for innovation.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.260
- Now, you touched on
the other side of this

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.410
which in talking about
Amy, namely the whole

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.990
well, it's a historical experience

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.860
but it's very much an American experience

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.440
where you close down the borders.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.340
In other words, you
have periods of openness

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.250
followed by clamps downs
because of security,

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.140
because of nativism,
because of nationalism.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.380
Talk a little about that
in the history of the U.S.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.420
Because even before 9/11,
that has been our story.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.610
- Yeah, there have been periods.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.390
And my analysis of it is
a little bit different

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.030
than a lot of the histories.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.100
I mean, a lot of the
histories look at economics

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.350
as driving this, that the United States

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.060
opens in times of economic prosperity

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.770
and closes at times of economic recession.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.080
And if that's correct, we
may well be on the cusp

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.440
of an even more serious closure.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.960
But when I went back and
I looked at that history,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.640
it seemed to me that the missing component

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.854
in a lot of the analysis was that

00:15:01.854 --> 00:15:04.740
there was a security fear as well.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.730
I mean, the big closing
that we're all familiar with

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.530
took place after the First World War

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.920
and really preceded the
depression of the 1930s

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.940
that, of course, became worse at that time

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.217
because there weren't jobs
here for people to come to.

00:15:15.217 --> 00:15:16.920
And all countries in
the world closed down.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.820
But really, a lot of the
post World War I closing

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.640
resulted from the fear of
importing European conflicts.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.490
You know, we had watched
the conflagration.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.610
We had participated in it in Europe.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.220
And many people thought well
we don't want to import that

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.053
into the United States.

00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:35.760
And that was a lot of the
impetus for that closure.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.790
And I think what we
saw post 9/11 was again

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.240
a similar sort of thing.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.600
And the closing we've seen is nothing

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.670
compared to what we saw
after the First World War.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.290
But it was the same fear.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.100
And the fear is that while
openness brings many benefits:

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.600
it attracts talented people;

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.750
it allows you to bring in imports of goods

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.750
at higher quality, lower price.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.880
Openness also allows things
that we don't want to come in.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.640
I mean drug smuggling,
international criminals,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.130
and as we found out with 9/11, terrorists.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.600
And so, I think it has been true

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.155
at a number of points in American history

00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:14.060
that security fears have
really driven this closing down

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.033
as much or more than economic concerns.

00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:21.480
- In the period before 9/11,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.130
you do an interesting account

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.890
of the differences in California

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.450
toward immigration policy now

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.880
versus the policies of Texas.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.950
And I think it's worth talking about this

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:42.860
because President Bush,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.160
President George W. Bush,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
had been governor of Texas.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.160
And so he had a very interesting take

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.020
pre 9/11 to the border.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.300
So compare that, his position, with that

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.720
say of Governor Wilson here in California

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.770
and what explains the differences.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.290
- Well, one of the events
that I recount in my book

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.420
was a clash between Governor Bush,

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.070
who was then governor of
Texas, and Governor Wilson

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.460
at the 1996 Republican Governors
Association Convention,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.310
the first one that Bush had attended.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.620
And at the time, Wilson was really a star

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.438
in Republican ranks,
was seen as a potential

00:17:25.438 --> 00:17:27.260
presidential contender.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.890
And his star was rising largely
on the immigration issue,

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.130
Prop 187, English-only initiatives.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.430
And California, of course more
than really any other state,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.390
had experienced some of the
economic, cultural conflicts

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.360
that come with high levels of immigration,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.910
particularly high levels
of illegal immigration.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.730
Texas, intriguingly, had always had

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.850
a slightly different take on it.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.360
I think partly because
Texas has very low levels

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.210
of social services.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.023
You know, one of the arguments
about illegal immigration

00:17:56.023 --> 00:18:00.220
is people come in and you have
to provide schools for them.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.600
You have to provide
hospital medical services.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.650
This is a huge cost for states.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.120
In Texas, the level of social
services are fairly low

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.400
and have always been fairly low.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.640
And so in Texas, you
had a business community

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.100
which was very supportive of immigration

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.820
from Mexico in whatever capacity,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.910
be it legal temporary worker programs

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.210
or be it unauthorized immigration.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.280
And really, Bush had a
different take on this issue

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.310
when he became president.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.330
He didn't like illegal immigration.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.670
But he thought that finding a path

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.680
to regularize immigration
flows from Mexico

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.440
needed to be a crucial priority
for his administration.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.586
So he really saw the Wilson
elements of the Party

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.570
as destructive for the Republican Party.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.570
He thought the future
of the Republican Party

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.190
required bringing Hispanics
and Hispanic voters

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.410
into the Republican
Party, and thought Wilson

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.230
and the policies Wilson was advocating

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.351
were working against
that long-term interest.

00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:57.040
- It's this very intriguing point because

00:18:58.335 --> 00:19:01.534
the evolution of the Republican Party

00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:06.534
is conflicted on the one hand
tapping American nationalism,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.120
American exceptionalism,
nativism on the one hand,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.670
keeping the other out, so to speak.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.210
And on the other hand, powerful elements

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.100
of the business community,
both in agriculture,

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.060
and well especially in agriculture,

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.310
that want open borders so that
the immigrants can come in.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.471
So there's a history of a
legislative struggle here

00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:36.170
that's really fascinating.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.200
And in fact, what had happened was that

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.200
in making it impossible, you described,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.000
for Mexicans to go back to Mexico

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.730
after working here for intervals

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.700
during a year, there was a clamp down

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.220
which essentially froze
that cross-border migration

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.030
which increased the
population in the country.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.430
- Yeah, I think you've
described it very well.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.820
There's an internal struggle
that's long been there

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.650
in the Republican Party
that pits essentially

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.720
the business elements of the Party:

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.050
agriculture, multinational business,

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.410
you know, hotels,
restaurants, other places

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.870
that employ a lot of lower skilled labor,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.510
versus the more kind of cultural,

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.170
nativist elements of the Party.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.895
And Bush was firmly in
the pro-business wing

00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:27.130
of the Republican Party on that issue.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.800
And you know, as you describe in the 90s,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.570
we had seen the nativist
elements really acquire

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.160
much more of a voice, not
only in the Republican Party

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.460
but the Democrats really
had responded to that.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.960
The pressure coming from the
border states like California

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.190
had already led to significant increases

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.560
in enforcement at the southern
border during the 1990s.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.760
And one of the unfortunate
consequences of that

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.830
was it exacerbated the
problem of illegal migrants

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.340
settling in the United States.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.570
It used to be that there was a fairly easy

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:00.530
cross-border flow.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.650
People would come and work for
part of the year and go back.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.730
Well as you begin to set
up barriers at the border,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.110
as you raise the cost, if
people have to hire smugglers

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.600
to get them across, when they
come into the United States,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.550
they're gonna stay.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.630
And if they decide to stay,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.710
they're gonna bring their families over

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.620
which means you have not just the men,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.990
but the women and the
children coming over.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.440
And then once they've decided to do that,

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.960
they may well not stay in California

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.230
or Arizona or Texas.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.720
They will fan out into the country

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.420
to where the work opportunities exist.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.930
And so we've seen immigration pressures

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.510
in parts of the country:
Iowa, North Carolina, Alabama,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.780
places where we'd never seen them before.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.770
- 9/11, the attack comes and

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.090
you focus on many individuals,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.110
and we'll talk about some.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.600
But the key figures here are Bush,

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.233
and we've laid out a vision
that he had prior to 9/11.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.600
And then, but the other key players become

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.350
Secretary Ridge who ultimately becomes

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.070
Secretary of Homeland Security,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.760
but at first is an advisor
in the White House,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.603
and the Attorney General John Ashcroft.

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:09.450
And before we get into
the specific battles,

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.700
one has a sense that there's
certain characteristics,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.750
that these people were
very vulnerable after 9/11

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.340
and were really looking for handles

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.930
to deal with the problem,
and some might say

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.080
to cover the embarrassment
of what they let happen.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.180
- Yeah, I would be a little
more charitable in the sense

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.730
that I think everybody that I interviewed

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.900
who was in the government
at that time believed

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.270
that 9/11 was not gonna be a one-off,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.510
that there were going
to be follow-on attacks.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.370
And that in fact, there might
already be terrorist cells

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.770
in place in the United States with plans

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.130
to carry out follow-on attacks.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.060
So I think there was
a kind of desperation.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.310
There was a feeling that we'd been hit.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.850
We'd missed the signals
that we were gonna be hit.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.200
The damage was catastrophic.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.620
And we had no idea of knowing
whether we might be hit again

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.200
and no sense of how to go
about looking for the people

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.620
who we were worried might hit us again.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:08.030
So I think the motivation
wasn't so much embarrassment.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.570
It was desperation.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.910
It was this feeling that

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.470
the threat was real and imminent

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.100
and we had no idea what to do about it.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.703
- So help us understand
what the response was

00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:28.522
and how particular sets of problems

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:30.360
were dealt with.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.400
And I think one has to

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.200
to start with the Justice
Department, in a way.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.540
Because you're really saying that Ashcroft

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.050
suddenly realized that
the only tools he had

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.280
to deal with the problem
came out of the Immigration

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.520
and Customs side.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.720
- Well, I mean, you look at
this from their perspective.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.790
Okay, they in the Justice
Department believed

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.040
that another attack was almost
certainly going to come.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.640
And there were two ways it might happen.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.060
Either there were terrorist
cells that were already

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.893
in the United States.

00:24:05.893 --> 00:24:07.800
They'd come here as did the 19 hijackers

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.850
and they were waiting.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.090
Or else there were people who
were gonna come from abroad.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.910
I mean, all 19 of the
hijackers came from abroad,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.450
came to the United States on visas.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.610
They weren't people who
had been living here

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.650
for long periods of time.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.537
And so, how do you try to deal with this?

00:24:20.537 --> 00:24:24.340
I mean, if you had an FBI
that had strong connections

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.840
in the Arab and Muslim
communities around the country,

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.020
maybe you could find informers.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.610
Maybe you'd have some way
of gathering information

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.443
that was useful.

00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:32.860
But the FBI didn't have those contacts.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.853
And so domestically, the only
tool they could think of was

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.980
like the hijackers,
they're likely to be here

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.100
on temporary visas of
some sort or another.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.770
So we're gonna go out
and we're gonna start

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.400
arresting people, asking questions.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.950
If people give any indication
that someone down the street

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.640
might have some connection
to terrorist acts,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.560
we're gonna hold these people.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.160
We're gonna find immigration violations.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.993
And there often were.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:54.960
I mean, there were a lot
of people, there still are,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.610
a lot of people living in the
United States out of status.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.020
And that's an extremely powerful tool.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.060
If you find someone with even
a minor immigration violation,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.960
you could hold them for
long periods of time.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.740
There are some due-process limitations.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.540
But as we discovered after 9/11,

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.800
it was easy to steamroller over those.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.560
So they ended up
arresting a lot of people,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.000
holding them for long
periods of time after 9/11.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.890
And then at the borders,
they began to set up

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.340
a series of new screening
mechanisms and other hurdles

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.010
to try to keep out potential terrorists

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.430
who might be trying to come
into the country after 9/11.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.150
So immigration law was central
to both of those responses,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.560
both as a way of holding people

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.150
you had a concern about domestically

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.300
and as a way of keeping people out

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.060
that you had reason to be
concerned about internationally.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:43.830
- So at the Canadian border,
I mean, you cite the figures

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.870
that the traffic, the
automobile industry and so on,

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.910
the truck traffic is unbelievable.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.560
So in the first days, you
essentially get a clamp down

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.550
in that traffic.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.940
- Yeah, the immediate
response right after 9/11

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.960
was really literally to close.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.206
Well not quite literally,
I'm going a little too far,

00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:03.740
but a virtual closure of the borders.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.840
What happened at the
Canadian and Mexican borders,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.360
which had never happened before,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.710
was they went to what was
called a Level One Alert

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.610
which meant that every vehicle,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.070
every individual crossing the border

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.120
was subject to maximum
detailed inspection.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.460
You know, you went through
every inch of their car

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.690
to make sure there wasn't
something in that car.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.360
And this was indiscriminate.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.950
You know, you could have a
trucker who was moving auto parts

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.370
across the border and ran
that route two times a day

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.860
every day for the last 10 years.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.130
He was subject to the
same level of scrutiny

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.620
as someone you'd never seen before.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.200
And the result was really to shut down

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.670
the economic system that
operated across that border.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.060
And this was most apparent
in the auto industry.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.690
Because the auto industry
on both sides of the border

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.870
is fully integrated.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.680
You have cars that are
assembled in the United States

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.580
with parts that come in
from Canada, and vice versa.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.770
And it's a real-time system.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.450
You know, the parts leave the factory.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.620
They've got 10 hours to make
it into the United States

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.000
to the assembly line.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.880
And if they don't make it,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.130
then the assembly line shuts down.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.270
And that's what we saw happen
in the aftermath of 9/11

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.010
because of the border closure

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.770
and the delays that that caused.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.770
- Now, there's throughout the
book a very interesting theme.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.700
And this takes us back to what
we were just talking about.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.700
There is a sense that America

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:24.250
was into a mode of saying
globalization is great.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.720
And so you had in place pluses and minuses

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.720
in the bureaucracy for
responding to this crisis.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.110
And let's talk about that.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.470
Because I think it's very important.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:43.470
So the hijackers on the
9/11 flight were identified

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.960
first not by the FBI.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.300
But I guess it was the
Immigration and Naturalization.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.133
- It was Customs actually, Customs first.

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:50.970
- It was Customs.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.380
And tell us how that came about.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.360
Because within two hours, they
knew who the hijackers were.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.780
- Yeah, this was a fascinating story

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.300
and something that I
think should have been

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.433
part of the 9/11 Commission
Report, but they overlooked.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.650
This was very interesting because Customs,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.640
of all the organizations in
the United States Government,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.920
had been the most sophisticated
at trying to deal with

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.130
the negative consequences
of globalization.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.580
And this was particularly
the case for drug smuggling.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.120
You know, open borders make
it easy for drug smugglers.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.490
And so, Customs had
tried to develop systems

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.470
to help it identify drug smugglers:

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.510
people coming in on airplanes
who would be carrying drugs

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.270
on their person, may have
in fact swallowed drugs.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.260
And how do you identify those people?

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.930
Well, one possibility is
everybody coming off the plane

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.580
from Colombia or from Mexico

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.610
or from countries that
are sources of drugs,

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.610
you're just gonna inspect them all.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.380
You'll put them all into
secondary inspection

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.300
and you'll do searches on everyone.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.240
Well if you do that,
you're gonna slow down

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.400
the traffic tremendously.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.750
People will complain to Congress.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.583
Congress will get upset.

00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:51.820
You can't do that.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.160
It wasn't possible to have
free movement and do that.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.760
So Customs had developed
specialized systems to try to say

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.790
who is it that we need to be
worried about on these planes.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.420
They had received voluntary agreements

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.040
from the U.S. airlines
in which the airlines

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.600
would share data on incoming passengers

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.160
so that Customs would know, you know,

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.880
was this ticket purchased with cash

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.430
which was always a red flag.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.830
Was there a credit card that we know

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.770
might be connected to the drug cartels?

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.810
Was it purchased in places that we know

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.660
are used by the drug cartels?

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.890
Does this passenger fit
profiles of drug smugglers?

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.160
So they could try to narrow
the number of searches.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.680
And what happened was
it was quite effective.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.820
They actually reduced the number of people

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.530
who were pulled into secondary inspection

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.830
by about a quarter.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.720
But the drug seizures went up.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.330
So this is a long way of
answering your question

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.163
and I apologize.

00:29:40.163 --> 00:29:41.920
But one of the interesting things

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.970
about that passenger information data

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.400
was that the airlines had
no way to segregate it.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.770
So information on domestic passengers,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.160
information on international passengers

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.430
were part of the same database.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.110
Customs had access to both.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.220
This wasn't known at the time.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.740
I think the ACLU and others
would have had things

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.410
to say about it had they known it.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.630
But the result was that when 9/11 hit,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.640
Customs had immediate access
to the passenger lists

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.850
and that same kind of data:

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.950
you know, credit card purchases,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.900
where the ticket was purchased,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.368
for all of the passengers
on the four flights.

00:30:10.368 --> 00:30:14.050
There were two of the 19 hijackers,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.580
and we can get back to this if you want,

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.930
but two of the 19 hijackers
had been identified already

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.220
by the CIA as al-Qaeda operatives.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.140
So those names flashed up immediately

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.250
when Customs did the search.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:26.920
And they were able in various
ways to link those passengers,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.730
some by credit card and other information,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.120
some by the fact that they
just sat beside each other,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.953
to the others.

00:30:31.953 --> 00:30:34.637
And within two hours they
went to the FBI and they said,

00:30:34.637 --> 00:30:36.317
"We think there were 19 hijackers.

00:30:36.317 --> 00:30:37.610
"We think these are the guys."

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:38.740
And they were right.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.960
- And the other side of this,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.960
because there were mechanisms
in play to make it easier

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.020
than one could believe
to get into the country.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.597
And here we have the case
of a different bureaucracy

00:30:52.597 --> 00:30:54.310
and a different part of the government,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.233
namely the Visa Service,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.479
having moved to the notion of

00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:03.100
well let's make it easy
as possible for everybody.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.520
Let's make it even more easy for Saudis

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.850
coming into the country.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.530
And let's make it so
that the travel agents

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.970
issue the visas when Saudis buy tickets.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.803
Talk about that.

00:31:15.803 --> 00:31:17.420
Because that was the dark side.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.610
- Oh no question, no question.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.200
I mean, the attitude in the 1990s was

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.990
people coming to the United
States is a good thing

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.823
for the United States.

00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:24.700
We want them to come here.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.250
We want them to be tourists.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.130
We want them to spend money.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.760
We want them to go to
American universities.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.580
We want them to get treatment
in American hospitals.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.400
All of this is a good thing for us.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.920
And the restrictions were
really all economic ones.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.120
We want to know that
the people who come here

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.230
have enough money to
come here, return home,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.520
and that they're not
intending to come here

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.910
and overstay their visas,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.260
and live and work in the United States.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.200
Though an awful lot did anyway.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.230
But the Saudis were
considered virtually no risk.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.190
I mean, their records were clear.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.590
Saudis came to the United States.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.670
They spent a lot of money.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.720
They went to the beaches.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.553
They partied.

00:31:56.553 --> 00:31:57.400
And they went home.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.400
And so, for the visa
officers in Saudi Arabia,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.300
the scrutiny of Saudi visa
applicants was extremely low.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.350
There were some who were
attuned to the concern

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.420
over terrorism, but not very many.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.530
And so the result was we
did everything we could

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.160
to expedite Saudis coming
to the United States

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.580
including the scheme
involving travel agents

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.990
which, you know, there's been
a lot of confusion about it.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.630
The travel agents didn't grant the visas.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.060
But it just was a way to expedite it.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.050
Saudis could give all their information

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.883
to travel agents.

00:32:27.883 --> 00:32:29.890
The travel agents would pass
it over to the U.S. Embassy.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.390
The U.S. Embassy would
stamp the passports,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.480
get it back to the travel agents,

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.500
and they'd be on their way.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.863
- And of course, a lot ...

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.640
How many were Saudis of the terrorists?

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.621
I think it was seven.

00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.543
- 15, I think it was 15, yeah.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.160
- Now, let's go back to Ashcroft.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.690
Because what Ashcroft discovers is that

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.170
if he's gonna be able to act,

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:55.170
that Immigration has courts basically

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.560
that had become routine.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.380
Namely, they'd find somebody
who had committed a violation.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.830
They'd bring him into
court and orders issued

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.663
for him to leave.

00:33:05.663 --> 00:33:06.930
But often, they didn't leave.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.763
- [Edward] Right, right.

00:33:07.763 --> 00:33:10.490
- And Ashcroft saw this as a tool

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.770
where he could act very quickly.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:12.860
That's very important.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.270
Talk about that.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.880
- They took a set of lessons away

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.240
from a particular incident
that occurred prior to 9/11.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.530
On the night of September
10th, close to midnight,

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.870
Zia Jara, who was the
pilot of the United flight

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.330
that was crashed in
Pennsylvania when the passengers

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.380
stormed the cockpit.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.420
- [Harry] The terrorist pilot?

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.490
- The terrorist pilot,
yeah, the terrorist pilot.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.070
Zia Jara was pulled over
driving 95 miles an hour

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.810
on Highway 95 which runs
up and down the East Coast.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:40.780
He was pulled over in Maryland,

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.850
just south of the Delaware border,

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.483
heading north for New York.

00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:46.780
And the policeman pulled him over,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.150
ran the usual Wants and Warrants.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.870
There was nothing in the database,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.493
so he wrote a ticket for
$270, gave it to Jara.

00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:54.550
Jara went on his way and
the next day, of course,

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.870
he got on the plane and
was part of the hijacking

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.070
of that flight.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.650
It turns out that at the
time, Zia Jara was living

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.630
in the United States illegally.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.780
He had overstayed a visa
and actually violated

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.960
the terms of his student visa.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.200
And it wasn't just Jara.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.930
A number of the hijackers,
including all of the pilots,

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.940
at some point in time
had been out of status

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.150
in the United States.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.910
So Ashcroft and his people looked at this

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:17.130
and they said if we could begin enforcing

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.350
our immigration laws more aggressively.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.360
You know, say that local cop when he ran

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.757
the Want and Warrant, the
information had flashed up,

00:34:23.757 --> 00:34:25.067
"Zia Jara has overstayed his visa.

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:26.180
"He's here illegally."

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.210
The whole point is he would
have pulled him into custody.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.970
And perhaps, 9/11 never
would have happened.

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.200
So they saw immigration enforcement

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.310
as being a vital counter-terrorism tool.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.510
That if we just enforce
our immigration laws

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.510
aggressively across the board,

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.620
perhaps we'll catch the next 11 hijacker,

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.040
or at least make it a lot harder

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.010
for them to organize and
carry out another attack.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.680
- But these extreme
measures, at one level,

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.720
there's just a lot of
zero results basically.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.400
Because in terms of the
people they detained

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.290
who they were looking for terrorists

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.053
without any information,
they found nothing.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.160
And so it is often the case

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.260
that you're looking for
a needle in a haystack

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.910
with the hope that that
one needle will then prick

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:15.750
the bubble of the terrorist plan.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.120
- It's a very good way to define it.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.700
The problem with immigration enforcement

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.830
as a counter-terrorism tool is that

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.510
immigration is a huge world.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.430
I mean, there are millions of people

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.554
who come here every year on visas.

00:35:26.554 --> 00:35:29.770
By best counts, there's
something like 12 million people

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.220
living in the country without papers,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.960
illegal immigrants living in this country.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.670
The volume of travel is extraordinary.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.450
And the notion that somehow
just by being aggressive

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:41.280
across the board in enforcement
of that set of laws,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.410
you're gonna catch these handful of people

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.950
that you're worried about is a long shot.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.520
And in fact, that was what
the experience showed.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.430
That aggressive immigration enforcement

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.070
identified a lot of illegal immigrants.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.180
There were a lot of people were,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.690
and still are, being deported.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.030
But it didn't help to identify hijackers.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.690
And a lot of what I write about in my book

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.080
is it wasn't just illegal immigrants.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.330
Sadly, there were a lot of
people who were here legally,

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.990
who were trying to come here legally,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.520
whose lives were really turned upside down

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.100
by getting caught on the wrong side

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.510
of this immigration enforcement campaign

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.330
even though they had no
connection to terrorism at all.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.660
- You make a dichotomy between the cops

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.550
and the technocrats.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.010
We'll talk about the
technocrats in a minute.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.550
But give us a summary
statement of the cops.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.550
And Ashcroft is the key cop both in being

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.230
head of the Justice
Department, but also in what

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.250
he sought to do and what
he felt he had to do

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.600
in this period of vulnerability.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.370
- Well, I mean, Ashcroft talk,

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.645
the cops who's interested
in how they call themselves.

00:36:41.645 --> 00:36:43.330
It was a self-definition.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.276
The technocrats, I made up myself.

00:36:46.276 --> 00:36:49.290
But Ashcroft described what he called

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.030
a spit-on-the-sidewalk
strategy which he attributed

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.647
to Robert Kennedy when Kennedy said,

00:36:54.647 --> 00:36:56.447
"We're gonna go after organized crime.

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.783
"And if they spit on the
sidewalk, we're gonna pull 'em in

00:36:58.783 --> 00:36:59.890
"and charge 'em with that."

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.280
Well, he saw immigration
law as his equivalent

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.840
of a spit-on-the-sidewalk strategy.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.730
There's a DHS official who
put it to me very nicely.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.527
He said, "Immigration law is like tax law.

00:37:08.527 --> 00:37:10.290
"You're guilty until proven innocent."

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.030
And so, it was a powerful
tool for Ashcroft.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.300
If there were people out
there that they had any reason

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300
to be concerned about,
they could pull 'em in,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.250
charge 'em with some minor
immigration violation,

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.660
and hold them for a long
time for questioning.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.040
And so they saw that as the most powerful

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.730
law enforcement tool they had.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.180
And they used it to the hilt.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.410
- Now, tell us about the
technocrats and about Ridge.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.970
Because Ridge had been a
governor of a border state.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.000
And he was brought in
in the White House first

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.500
for Homeland Security, and then

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.361
the first head of the Department.

00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:43.560
- Yeah, Ridge really came at this problem

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.680
from a different perspective.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.440
I mean for Ashcroft, there was one issue.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.660
The issue was how to prevent
another terrorist attack.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.640
And if there were unfortunate consequences

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.510
of those enforcement efforts,

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.640
he didn't really care
about it all that much.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.540
That wasn't his job.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.730
His job was to prevent
another terrorist attack

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.670
and to use whatever tools he had.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.130
Ridge looked at the problem differently.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.690
Ridge had been governor of Pennsylvania,

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.370
thought of himself as a
border-state governor.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.390
He grew up in Erie which
is right on the shores

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.751
of Lake Ontario.

00:38:08.751 --> 00:38:11.480
Had a lot of interaction
with the Canadians.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.830
Thought very much about
economics, as all governors do.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.510
Governors spend a lot of
time trying to attract

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.790
business to their state,
trying to attract investment.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.580
And so he came into the job
with a very similar perspective

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.860
to that that was laid out in
the Hart-Rudman Commission

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:29.060
which is the challenge here
was to tighten the borders,

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.150
to secure ourselves against terrorists,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.240
but to do so in a way
that it didn't interfere

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.550
with the free flow of goods
and the free flow of people.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.130
So he always looked at his
job both at the White House

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.330
and the Department of
Homeland Security as twofold:

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.830
improve security, prevent
another terrorist attack,

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.190
but do it in a way that
preserves an open economy.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:53.600
- Uh-hmm, and in this context,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.410
the central idea is what
you call risk management

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.010
and Smart Borders.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.680
Tell us what those are.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.110
- Well, there's sort
of two elements to it.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.090
Risk management means you have to think

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.920
about the consequences of the measures

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.100
you're putting in place.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.430
There's no perfect defense
against terrorism, right?

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.320
I mean, there's an unlimited
number of potential targets:

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.530
every shopping mall, every subway.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.000
You can't prevent them from
hitting you everywhere.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.530
And so you have to think
well what are the measures

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.730
that we can put in place
that give us the biggest bang

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.740
for the buck, that
provide increased security

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.420
but with minimal disruption
to our daily lives.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.052
And so that's the basic
concept of risk management.

00:39:33.052 --> 00:39:35.880
The idea of Smart Borders
was to sort of extend

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.430
that concept to the borders.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.250
So what you wanna do is
you want, at the borders,

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.770
to be as targeted as you possibly can,

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:47.540
to spend your time
inspecting and scrutinizing

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.050
those people and those shipments of goods

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.650
that you have some reason
to be worried about,

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.730
much along the model of
what Customs had done

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.020
with drug smuggling.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.880
To use just one example,
what they've tried to do

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.540
at the northern border,
and it hasn't happened

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.810
as rapidly as it should,
but is create what they call

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.110
these NEXUS lanes which are special lanes

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:04.620
where if you're a commercial driver,

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.300
or you're a frequent crosser, you can go

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.097
to the U.S. government and
say, "This is who I am.

00:40:08.097 --> 00:40:09.661
"This is all my information.

00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:11.717
"Run background checks on me.

00:40:11.717 --> 00:40:14.357
"And when you're satisfied
that I'm a good person,

00:40:14.357 --> 00:40:16.187
"then I get to drive
through this special lane

00:40:16.187 --> 00:40:17.777
"where I don't have to
wait in the long lines

00:40:17.777 --> 00:40:18.610
"at the border."

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.350
That's Smart Borders.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.620
That's separating out
the people you don't need

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.140
to be concerned about so that the people

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.320
and shipments of goods
that you need to focus on

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.860
are much smaller.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.810
And your likelihood of identifying things

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:32.813
of concern goes up.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.043
- In this story of these struggles,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.690
who prevailed, I guess is the question?

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:47.244
But also, why didn't Ridge?

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:50.290
Did Ridge succeed or did he not?

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.230
And why do you think?

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.300
- I think early on,
Ashcroft clearly prevailed

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.083
and over some very strong opposition.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.950
Not only from Ridge and
the people around Ridge,

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.420
but from people within
the Justice Department

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.080
including the Head of the Immigration

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.420
and Naturalization Service
at the time, Jim Ziglar,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.220
who objected vociferously
to the way in which Ashcroft

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.100
wanted to use immigration
law for these broad roundups

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.230
and for restricting people
coming into the country.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.900
But Ashcroft prevailed because nobody else

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.360
had an immediate solution.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.930
The Smart Borders idea was a good idea.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.680
But the tools weren't immediately there.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.550
I mean, it required creating databases,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.980
gathering information
that really didn't exist

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.170
immediately after 9/11.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.560
Some of the mechanisms had
been put in place previously,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.090
but they'd never really come to fruition.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.777
Whereas Ashcroft had an immediate answer.

00:41:37.777 --> 00:41:38.727
"I've got a set of tools.

00:41:38.727 --> 00:41:40.220
"I can use them aggressively."

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.360
And so really for the
first two years after 9/11,

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.400
Ashcroft won almost every battle:

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.140
with the White House,
with the State Department,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.820
and with detractors within
his own Justice Department.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.890
- In a way, you can say

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:53.470
that the national agenda became fear.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.260
And that in turn was linked

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.510
with the politics of the Republican Party

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.713
in looking forward to the next election.

00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:06.830
Did that national vision and agenda

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:11.830
make Ridge's efforts

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.060
more difficult even to
the point of losing out?

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.870
- Yeah, I think over time
it became a bigger issue.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.100
I think immediately, sort of 2001, 2002,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.500
I don't think politics was
uppermost on anybody's mind,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.080
even within the White House.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.660
But as the midterm election approached,

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.010
it became clear to people
in the White House,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.390
to political operatives,
that the war on terrorism

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.790
was a very good issue for the president.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.230
And I talked to a lot of
people in Homeland Security

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.670
who say they were
constantly under pressure

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.810
from the White House
to do dramatic things,

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.480
to run exercises, to make announcements

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.740
that constantly emphasized to the public

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.430
the threat of another terrorist attack.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.380
This was something that
was good politically

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.300
for the president.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.850
And so in a way, this issue
began to spin out of control.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.330
And we talked earlier about
the president's desire

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.670
to maintain open borders,
to do agreements with Mexico

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.130
to regularize the flow.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.190
Over time, this began
to spin out of control

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.610
because his party, partly
for political reasons,

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.460
began to emphasize more
and more the threat

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.610
that oh my God, terrorists
are gonna cross the borders,

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.313
come into the United States
and carry out another attack.

00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:20.700
- And this political agenda,
which is emerging over time,

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.090
was reflected in the fact that
even after Homeland Security

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:28.380
was established as a
cabinet-level department,

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.540
there remained an Office
of Homeland Security

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.820
in the White House that
Ridge had to deal with.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.530
- Yeah, I don't think that was
entirely a political thing.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.630
I mean, the people that staffed

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.070
the Office of Homeland
Security were by and large

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.470
professionals of one sort or another.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.360
It was headed for a time
by Richard Falkenrath

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.170
who now runs Homeland Security

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.740
for the New York City Police Department.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.293
But it created a struggle.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:55.260
DHS was kind of ill-formulated
from the outset.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.730
I mean, Ridge's original idea,

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.810
which I report on in the book,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.130
was that actually there should just be

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.960
a merger of the border agencies.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.610
I mean, he originally was not a supporter

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.530
of creating a big Department
of Homeland Security.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.000
That came as a result of
pressure from Congress

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.090
and the feeling in the White House that

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:10.923
they'd better get with the program

00:44:10.923 --> 00:44:12.770
or it was gonna be
forced down their throat.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.070
But nobody ever figured out
what DHS was supposed to do.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.970
Some people thought it
was supposed to coordinate

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.540
government-wide efforts
on homeland security.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.890
But the fact that an
Office of Homeland Security

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:24.900
remained in the White
House meant that you had

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.290
a White House agency that also saw itself

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.510
as the coordinator.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:32.970
So there was a structural
conflict built into the creation

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.500
of Department of Homeland Security

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.120
which meant that DHS was not only fighting

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.250
with Justice and fighting with State,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.690
but it was often fighting
with the White House.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.860
- And you point out that Homeland Security

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.990
never had a planning office under Ridge.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.960
And that that may have
been a great mistake.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.960
- Yeah, as it was put in an
article I quoted actually,

00:44:54.367 --> 00:44:56.470
"A planning office is Bureaucracy 101."

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.540
You need some place where
you're thinking about

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.580
the department's long term
goals, its strategic vision.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.610
And that was never part of
the initial formulation.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.960
There is one now in DHS.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.650
It was implemented under Chertoff.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.460
The only thing that kind of
looked like a planning office

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.850
was in the portion of
DHS dealing with border

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.260
and transportation security.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.180
And I think it's not a
surprise that that part

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.830
of the operation actually
was much more effective

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.030
say than the disaster recovery part,

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.710
as we saw the disaster
and the mismanagement

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.560
of Hurricane Katrina and
the collapse of FEMA.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.040
I think you can attribute some of that

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.630
to the lack of any sort of policy vision

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.360
within the department as a whole.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.085
- Going back to what you
learned from Franz Schurmann,

00:45:38.085 --> 00:45:43.085
it would seem that the
fragmentation of the government,

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:47.120
the separation of powers, the whole thing

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.240
that at one level has made America

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.230
a very vital place and a great democracy,

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:59.230
in a situation like this
becomes a monster basically.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.660
You point out that once Homeland
Security was established

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:08.410
and all these agencies were
put under its umbrella,

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:13.410
that it had an amazing
reporting responsibility

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:14.973
to the Congress.

00:46:14.973 --> 00:46:15.806
Tell us about that.

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:17.050
- Oh, it was absurd.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:18.540
There were more than 80 committees that

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.870
the Department of Homeland Security

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.020
had to report to in Congress.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.400
They spent most of their
first year writing reports

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.470
to Congress about what they hadn't done

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.530
since they hadn't had
enough time to do anything.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.963
But the larger issue of
bureaucratic politics,

00:46:30.963 --> 00:46:34.870
the problem was that even
though the White House

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.590
was putting out papers talking
about a national strategy,

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.600
talking about the border of the future,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.220
and the Smart Border, what
was happening was incoherent.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.500
You had some of these
Smart Border measures

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.210
being developed, but alongside
it you had this whole

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.390
aggressive immigration
enforcement campaign.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.680
You had parts of the
government working very much

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.000
at cross-purposes.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.950
And what we saw as a result
was in 2002, 2003, 2004,

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.270
there were tremendous restrictions

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.070
on people trying to come
to the United States.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.480
I mean, the number of
visas granted for people

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.950
to travel here fell from
close to eight million

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.640
to fewer than five million in two years.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.170
And so you had different
parts of the government

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.890
all kind of falling over each
other to try to put in place

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.570
new border security measures
without thinking about

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.570
well, what are the consequences of this

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.680
going to be in the real world.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.780
What is the effect gonna
be on all the people

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.750
we wanna come to this country
and that we have relied on?

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:33.120
And so the result was really
a kind of traffic wreck

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.010
that we saw take place in 2003, 2004.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:39.470
One, as I write, an awful lot
of people, people we wanted,

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:40.720
couldn't get into this country.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.190
- And in a way, there were
really very great costs

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.840
to our soft power.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.860
Because in addition to
this inflow of people

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.140
at all levels: students,

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.300
prominent businessmen,

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.280
whoever,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.980
that the economic consequences of that,

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.010
there is also a consequence in the way

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.330
we're perceived in the world.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.700
- Yeah, I think there were economic

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.030
and diplomatic consequences.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.610
The economic consequences you refer to,

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.760
I mean, for the first time since the end

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.660
of the Second World War,
we actually saw a decline

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.930
in the number of foreign graduate students

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.763
coming to the United States.

00:48:14.763 --> 00:48:15.760
They began to go elsewhere.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.390
And the figures are very clear even though

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.530
we've, fortunately,
seen a bit of a recovery

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.880
in the last year or so.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.820
I talked to an endless
number of business leaders

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.167
who said, you know, "We
can't get visas for people

00:48:26.167 --> 00:48:27.817
"who wanna come in and buy our products.

00:48:27.817 --> 00:48:29.870
"We can't get visas for employees."

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.160
A lot of companies began
to set up operations abroad

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.830
because they couldn't get the
people that they wanted here.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.900
So we paid an economic price there.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.940
In a way, the diplomatic price
I think was almost bigger.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.500
One of the easiest
interviews for me to arrange

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.050
and the most interesting was

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.070
with Secretary of State Colin Powell.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:47.210
Because he said he dealt
with this constantly.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.060
Every meeting he had with foreign leaders,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.670
he would get complaints about the way

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.340
their people were being
treated when they tried

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.320
to come to the United States.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.710
I mean, both, you know,
senior diplomatic officials,

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.700
even told me this story about the daughter

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.120
of a member of the Thai royal family

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.640
who came here on a student visa.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.700
Arrived three days before
she was supposed to

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.040
under the terms of the visa,
got slapped in handcuffs,

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.690
sent on a plane back to
Thailand, told she couldn't come,

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.430
would have to reapply for a student visa.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.770
There was huge diplomatic
fallout from this.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.700
And I think it was broader
than just the leadership.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.180
You know, we hear a lot
about the consequences

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.970
of Iraq, and the torture
policy in Guantanamo

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.990
all of which I think was very real.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.510
But most people, of course,
didn't experience that directly.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.690
But almost everybody, at
least in the upper levels

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.880
of a lot of countries around the world,

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.903
tried to come to the United States.

00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:33.560
They have family members
who have tried to come

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.393
to the United States.

00:49:34.393 --> 00:49:35.280
They have friends who have tried to come

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.277
to the United States.

00:49:36.277 --> 00:49:38.720
But to the extent that
they were mistreated

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.720
at our borders, those are
stories that have reverberated

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.553
across the world.

00:49:42.553 --> 00:49:43.850
And the message went out:

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.400
the United States doesn't
want you any more.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.830
And that was a very very
costly message for us.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.480
- You're touching on an
important point which is

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.683
the link between political leadership,

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.280
lack of vision and so on,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.520
and then the actual
implementation by bureaucracy.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.900
So that you can have a
sense that our security

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.040
requires we do certain things.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.730
But at the border, it is implemented

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.830
by somebody who may be having a bad day

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.270
and who may not like important people,

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.350
who may be doing the right
things in the right way,

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.090
but there's always a rotten apple.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.169
That's very important.

00:50:22.169 --> 00:50:23.002
- Well, I think that's part of it.

00:50:23.002 --> 00:50:26.450
But I also think you have
to, you have to think

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.210
when you're talking about bureaucracies,

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:30.770
what is the core mission.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.590
Every bureaucracy, to some extent,

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.800
is defined by its core mission.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.340
And if you think about
the border functions,

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.100
be they the consular officers abroad,

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.750
or the customs and immigration officials

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.560
who meet you at the airport
or at the land borders,

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.920
throughout the 1990s,
the core mission had been

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.230
facilitate travel.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.020
We want people to come here.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.760
And in fact, if you do
too much to make it hard

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.400
for people to come here,
you may hear about it.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.800
You know, somebody might
call their congressman.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.250
And their congressman
might call your boss.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.083
And you might get a call,

00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:00.157
"Why are you making it so difficult

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.300
"for people to come here?"

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.820
After 9/11, that mission
changed completely.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.670
The mission became keeping terrorists out

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:07.840
of the United States.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.850
And so nobody: no consular
officer, no border official,

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.510
was gonna get slapped on
the wrist for saying no.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.690
But if they said yes to the wrong guy,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.220
it might cost them their career.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.690
So the bureaucratic mission
really changed overnight.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.980
And that had a profound effect on all

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.860
of the frontline people who are the face,

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.480
in a sense, the face of the
United States Government

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.250
to much of the world.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.230
- Let's talk now about your conclusions.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.400
Because you identify three.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.453
Walk us through them.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.860
- There are both sort
of specific conclusions

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.693
and broader ones.

00:51:41.693 --> 00:51:45.370
I think the most important
broad conclusion I draw

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:49.090
is that we have to think
about immigration policy

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:51.310
and counter-terrorism separately.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:53.040
I mean, there are times
when immigration law

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.050
can be quite useful.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.870
You know, if you identify
somebody who you think

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.380
has terrorist connections, you
don't have a criminal case,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.820
you wanna deport them.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.300
Maybe you can find an immigration
law violation and do that.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.400
But the notion that simply
by tough enforcement

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.760
of immigration law, you're
gonna find and deter terrorists,

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.950
I think has just been
proven not to be the case.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.830
What you find are you
find illegal migrants.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.930
And there may be good reasons to do that.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:18.340
But I really think we need to separate

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.020
the discussion of these two issues.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.650
And I hope we do that going forward.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.200
And I see them conflated all the time.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.940
I mean, Secretary Chertoff
talks about the construction

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.010
of the fence on the border with Mexico

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.610
as a counter-terrorism
national security measure.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:32.550
And that's just ridiculous.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.400
We can't point to a
single case of terrorists

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.090
using the southern
border as an entry point.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.340
And if so, the fence
probably wouldn't deter them.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.370
So that would be my biggest conclusion.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.540
Secondly, I just think we
need to be far more proactive

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.980
about attracting the people
here we want to attract.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.570
There are still measures in
place, post 9/11 measures,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.260
that really humiliate a
lot of people who come,

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.690
particularly from Arab
and Muslim countries.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.660
And those numbers have not recovered.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.110
The number of visas from
places like Pakistan

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.060
and Saudi Arabia and
others are still way down

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.540
from the pre-9/11 levels.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.010
We need to think about how
we can attract the people

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.450
we want from those countries
and elsewhere back.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.020
Not just worry about
the enforcement problem,

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.680
but worry about the
attraction problem as well.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.850
So those are really the
heart of my conclusions.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.110
- A name, as I think back about the book

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.040
that I'm not sure occurred in your book,

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.863
was Vice President Cheney.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.880
And what is interesting
is he's been identified

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.220
with the One Percent
Solution by Ron Suskind.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.880
Meaning that if there was a 1% chance

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.140
of something happening,
then you came down hard

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.590
to prevent it from happening.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.900
This, I think, non mention of Cheney

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:43.680
and then the whole failure
to adopt risk management

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.370
is something that's important.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:48.730
Because even though he
doesn't seem to be hovering

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:52.450
all over this, there is an inability

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.540
to understand that concept.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.430
- I mean, to be fair, I do think actually

00:53:56.430 --> 00:54:00.220
that the department has
over time begun to implement

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.840
a number of these risk
management measures.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.290
I think we're much better
off now than we were

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:05.500
in the immediate aftermath.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.660
So I think there has
been some real progress.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.110
Cheney, right, is not a
leading character in my book.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.160
I think from everyone I talked to,

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.070
his staff just wasn't
that actively involved

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:17.080
on this set of issues.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.200
But the philosophy that he brought,

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.740
this notion that the
mission was to do everything

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.810
in our power to prevent
another terrorist attack

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:26.260
and consequences be damned,

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.460
was absolutely the philosophy that we saw

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.770
in this whole set of issues as well.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.670
So I think in a way, he
hovers over everything

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.390
that the Bush administration
did, this issue included,

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.470
even though his staff
wasn't as actively involved

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:40.960
day to day as say they were on Guantanamo

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.860
or on interrogation policy
or some of the other issues

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.080
we've heard about.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.760
- And I think we wanna
emphasize the point that

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.840
what you're really saying is that

00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:54.900
the immigration debate, 'cause
there was a debate going on

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.610
and hopefully there was gonna
be reform, bipartisan reform,

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.890
of all the problems
related to immigration,

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:05.450
that terrorism, the
counter-terrorism fight became a tool

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.990
in that debate which corrupted both.

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.350
- Yeah, and I think it
hijacked the possibility

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.620
of doing immigration reform.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.610
I think the specter hanging
over all of the discussions

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:17.540
in 2006, 2007 was, you
know, we have to have

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.790
perfect border security.

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:21.440
And it was used, I mean
terrorism was used,

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.087
by those who really wanted to crack down

00:55:23.087 --> 00:55:24.350
on the illegal immigrants.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:25.640
It was used by those people as a tool.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.970
It was a powerful argument.

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.803
You know, it's one thing to say

00:55:27.803 --> 00:55:29.950
well they're overcrowding the
schools and the hospitals.

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.930
It's another to say well you know,

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.950
an illegal migrant might
carry out a terrorist attack.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:35.460
So there were people who had an interest

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.990
in conflating the two.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.990
- What now are we left with with regard to

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.650
your understanding and interest

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:47.340
in this whole competitive challenge?

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.600
Because your book was written, I believe,

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.480
before the research financial
crisis that we're still in.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.810
So the question become
how does this play out

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:03.810
and what will be its impact
on the relative decline

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.690
in the world of the United States

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:08.360
which may be occurring for other reasons?

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.210
- I mean, this is very much
a kind of long-term issue

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:12.947
as opposed to a short-term issue.

00:56:12.947 --> 00:56:16.530
I don't think immigration
or immigration policy

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:17.370
is gonna be the way we get out

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.160
of the current economic recession.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.900
In fact, I think we'll see
the immigrant numbers drop

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.930
because the jobs just
aren't gonna be here.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.710
But longer term, the United
States has put itself

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.800
in a difficult position.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.950
For many many years, we
had this game to ourself.

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.080
I mean, if you were a
talented ambitious person

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.780
who wanted to travel
abroad to further yourself,

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.040
you were gonna come to the United States.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.180
You know, we have the
world's best universities,

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.900
best research facilities,
most dynamic companies,

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.330
and a very open policy
that was very friendly

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:46.600
and attractive to these people.

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.170
And they came to the United
States in great numbers.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:50.990
What happened after 9/11 is a lot

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.520
of the rest of the
world's caught onto this.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.730
I mean, the British, the
Canadians, the Australians,

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.950
the Germans, even the
Japanese are implementing

00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:00.690
many measures to try to
attract foreign students.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.850
They're making immigration
procedures easier

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:03.683
for these people.

00:57:03.683 --> 00:57:06.190
They're making it easier for
them to find work afterwards.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.568
We are now in an ...

00:57:08.568 --> 00:57:10.380
And countries like China
and India, of course,

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.650
are trying to keep these people.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.110
They're implementing policies domestically

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:14.780
to attract them back home.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.730
So we are now in a competition
for the world's talent

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.000
such as we haven't faced
in the post war period.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.880
And I think that's
gonna be a difficult one

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.713
for the United States.

00:57:24.713 --> 00:57:26.389
We have many advantages.

00:57:26.389 --> 00:57:27.870
People still wanna come here.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:29.450
We still have the world's
best universities.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.440
There are a lot of ways in which

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.900
we can win this competition.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.080
But we're in a fight on
the competitiveness front

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.850
that didn't exist before 9/11.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:40.650
- Ted, on that note which
I guess there's an element

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.843
of hope in it, but also a discouragement,

00:57:43.892 --> 00:57:45.010
let me show your book again,

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.420
The Closing of the American Border.

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.990
And I wanna thank you very
much for coming on our program

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.450
and coming back to Berkeley.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.330
- Thank you for your time, Harry.

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:54.420
I enjoyed it very much.

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.800
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.421
for this Conversation with History.

00:57:59.421 --> 00:58:02.004
(upbeat music)
