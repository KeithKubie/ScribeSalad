Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today, I'm gonna finish up

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.170
our episodes on civil rights by talking about
affirmative action. There's a few things I'm

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.880
not gonna do in this episode, though. First.
I'm not gonna try to defend all aspects of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.110
affirmative action, I admit it's a problematic
concept. Second, I'm not gonna say that affirmative

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.850
action isn't necessary or that it's racism,
I'm pretty sure that that debate will go on

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.529
in the comments. What I am gonna do is define
affirmative action, describe how the courts

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.129
have dealt with it, and try to explain why
it has existed and continues to exist.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:39.109
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.679
So let's start with the easy part and define
affirmative action. Affirmative action is

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.859
a government or private program designed to
redress historic injustices against specific

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.149
groups by making special efforts to provide
members of these groups with access to educational

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
and employment opportunities. I like this
definition because it also explains why affirmative

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.859
action exists - to redress historic injustices
which means discrimination. The key aspect of

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.729
affirmative action is that it provides special
access to opportunities, usually in education

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.049
and employment, to members of groups that have 
been discriminated against. Now, where affirmative

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.810
action gets controversial is when you look
at the two ideas of access and opportunity.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.100
When you poll Americans they generally favor
equality of opportunity although they usually

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.950
don't like it when the government tries to
promote equality of outcomes, usually by redistributing

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.009
wealth, but I'm getting ahead of myself. This
means that Americans generally think that

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.440
other Americans should have an equal shot at
success even though they don't imagine that all

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.980
Americans will be equally successful. Not all of us
can be Donald Trump, although not all of us want to be.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.700
Since we tend to believe in the USA that education
and jobs are the keys to success, equality

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.429
of opportunity is tied up in access to these
two things, and that's why they are the focus

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.090
of affirmative action efforts. Here's where
it gets tricky. In order to increase access

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.009
to education and job opportunities for members
of groups that are historically discriminated

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.749
against, affirmative action programs try to
ensure that they get extra special access

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.829
to jobs and schools, which, to many people,
is not equality of opportunity. Legal types

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.609
often will use the metaphor of a thumb on
the scale to describe the added benefits that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.920
affirmative action programs supposedly provide,
but we could also see it as a head start in a foot race,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.240
which is the metaphor I prefer for reasons I'll explain
in a bit. But first let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.660
So while affirmative action started with LBJ
ordering government agencies to pursue policies

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.610
that increase the employment of minorities
in their own ranks and in soliciting contracts,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.599
the first time it made a splash at the supreme
court was over the issue of university education.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.619
Specifically, in the landmark case of Regents
of the University of California versus Bakke

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.700
in 1973, the court ruled on the issue of racial
set-asides, or quotas, in admissions at the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.689
University of California Davis, Medical school.
Of the 100 slots available to incoming med

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.840
students, 16 were set aside for racial minorities.
Bakke claimed that this meant that some people

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.689
who were less qualified than he was, at least
he felt so, got into Davis med school and

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.209
Bakke didn't. So he sued, claiming that the
quotas discriminated against him because he

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.689
was white. The supreme court ruled in Bakke's
favor, saying that racial quotas were not

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.470
allowed since they didn't provide equal opportunity,
but they also ruled that affirmative action

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.049
programs were allowed if they served a compelling
government interest, and were narrowly tailored

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
to meet that interest. In other words, if
they'd passed the test of strict scrutiny.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.750
One of the more interesting things about this
decision is the kind of stuff the court said

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.409
constitutes a compelling government interest.
They rejected the idea that righting historical

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.700
wrongs was something that the government should
undertake, probably because it opens up all

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.450
kinds of historical cans of worms, especially
the question of who decides when and if a

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.909
historical wrong has been redressed. What
they did say was that compelling government

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.819
interest was ensuring diversity in university
admissions. This is true in general, and as

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.409
long as we can imagine there being universities,
the state has an interest in seeing that their

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.370
classes represent diverse viewpoints. Diversity
benefits both the members of the minority

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.300
and majority groups, at least in the minds
of the court. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.220
This is just a pretty serious video I don't know when I
was gonna get that eagle punch in so I just did it there.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.340
The early 1970's were the high tide of affirmative
action in the U.S, and ever since then the

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.640
courts have looked less favorably at affirmative
action claims. Because they apply strict scrutiny,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.349
most affirmative action claims are struck
down. This was clarified in the case of Adarand

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.780
Constructors Inc. versus PeÃ±a in 1995 which
dealt with racial preferences in the hiring

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.299
of subcontractors on government projects.
Although this case meant that the government

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.120
was not supposed to give preferential treatment
to minority-owned businesses, or those that

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.590
employed a large number of minorities, a government
report from 2005 found that at least as far

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.640
as the federal agencies were concerned, the
practice was still widespread.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.540
In most of the cases it hears, the court has
struck down affirmative action provisions

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.000
because they fail one or another of the strict
scrutiny tests, but the basic idea that universities

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.740
can create programs to build and maintain
a diverse student body has been upheld.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.080
Two relatively recent cases involving the University
of Michigan show how complicated it can be.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.100
In the 2003 case of Gratz versus Bollinger,
the court ruled that Michigan's undergraduate

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.780
admissions policy, which awarded extra points
to people in racial minority groups, was unconstitutional

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.430
because it was not narrowly tailored to meeting
the goal of student body diversity. In the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.220
same year, in the case of Grutter versus Bollinger,
Bollinger just keeps showing up to the supreme

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.780
court because he was the President of the
University of Michigan at the time, lucky.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.290
The court ruled that the admissions policy
of Michigan's law school was narrowly tailored

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.190
to meet the goal of promoting diversity although
it said that in 25 years such a program might

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.030
not be necessary. So at the time we're making
this episode, the idea that universities can

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.120
take race into account in their admissions
so that they can create a diverse learning

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.110
environment for their students is still constitutional,
but the supreme court looks very carefully

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.830
at the actual policy that the university has
in place, and if it looks anything like a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.480
quota, they'll strike it down. Turns out there
was another place to punch the eagle. Two times!

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.140
Affirmative action remains controversial and
it looks like eventually it's going to disappear

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.580
but maybe not right away. In 1996, Californians
passed a ballot initiative - Proposition 209

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.220
- that effectively outlawed affirmative action
in public employment, public contracting,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.130
and public education, especially university
admissions. After this initiative, also known

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.380
as the California Civil Rights Initiative,
passed over vocal and organized opposition,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.190
the graduation rate among African Americans
in some California universities went up. On

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.090
the other hand, the enrolment rate of African
Americans at many UC schools declined, and

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.870
it only returned to 1996 levels in 2010. Other
states like Michigan had passed laws similar

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.970
to California's Proposition 209 making it
harder and harder for affirmative action programs

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.000
to flourish. But as is often the case in politics,
people's response to affirmative action differs

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.880
depending on how you ask the question. When
phrased as an anti-discrimination measure,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.160
ballot measure like Prop 209 are quite popular,
but when people are asked if they want to

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.240
get rid affirmative action their responses
are not always so positive. Support for affirmative

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.870
action remains, and I suspect that this is
because many people still recognize that some

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.430
form of support for minority groups is needed
in the U.S.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.500
And this brings me back to the reason why
we have affirmative action in the first place.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.860
While the courts have ruled that attempting
to correct the historical injustices of slavery

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.030
and Jim Crow laws are not a compelling enough
interest to justify affirmative action, for

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.860
many, they are. Minority groups, and in particular
African Americans, have suffered from horrible

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.050
treatment and legal disability from the time
they began arriving as slaves in 1619. Even

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.830
after the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964,
full equal opportunity was still not a reality.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.300
Opinions vary on whether affirmative action
is still necessary today, and your point of

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.460
view depends a lot on your personal history
and your politics, which as we'll see in the

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.340
next few episodes, are deeply intertwined.
