00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.905
We just mentioned Blue Button,
which began in the VA in 2010,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.876
and was adopted by ONC in 2012.

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:14.116
Their SNI work group expanded
the standard, added more structure,

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:18.760
and dealt with direct integration
to create Blue Button+.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.920
This graphic from the Blue Button+ site,
shows how it can be used in conjunction

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.380
with direct, to move the data from the
providers, EMR, to the patients, PHR.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.940
This one shows that Blue Button+ can
be used to bring data from multiple

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.590
providers, into one patient
manage technology, such as a PHR.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.280
The data itself is in an XML document,
formatted according to CCDA.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.250
You should recall that CCDA documents
are constructed from templates for

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.070
the document, its sections,
and the actually data entries.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.490
Here's a list of some of the sections
of the Blue Button+ CCDA.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.010
More recently,
the Blue Button+ rest API effort,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.340
is offering a restful API approach
to using Blue Button+ for

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.380
both its traditional role, push, where
providers send the files to patients.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.655
Or their designated PHR app,
as well as pull, where patients can in

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:25.529
effect subscribe and receive updates, as
new data comes into their providers EHR.
