00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.500
- The team care.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.270
We don't have 32, but we
have select members of

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.590
the Medical Therapy
Unit of San Mateo County

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.270
who bravely are covering what 32

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.087
might cover in another context.

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:28.810
(audience laughing)

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.070
And so it's my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Christina Buysse,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.420
who is a developmental-behavioral
pediatrician

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.670
at Packard Children's at Stanford

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.210
with a special interest in working with

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600
children with motor disabilities.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.310
She spends time at Stanford
Spina Bifida Clinic

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.330
and in the California Children's Service

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.380
Medical Treatment Program.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.220
And I'll let her introduce Helen Phung,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.200
who is a PT supervisor at CCS in San Mateo

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.463
and Patty Walsh, who's the
chief therapist at CCS.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.940
We're thrilled to have you here.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.660
And would you, are you planning to present

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.968
individually or jointly?

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:15.330
- [Woman] We're gonna present jointly.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.883
- Okay, great.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.310
- So that was quite a talk to follow

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.630
and I think it illustrated
well the complexity of

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.410
taking care of kids with
cerebral palsy, in particular,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.450
and other motor disabilities.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.720
One of the things I like best about my job

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960
as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.360
is that I often get to work
on inter-disciplinary teams.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270
I see some of my colleagues from my

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.980
developmental-behavioral
field out in the audience

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.640
and I'm gonna be working with
two ladies today in this talk

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.440
who each have over 30 years of experience

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.980
working at the San Mateo
medical therapy unit,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.580
working with children
with CP, CCS, or with CP.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.130
So these ladies have
over 60 years together,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.623
working in this field.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.920
And the CCS Medical Therapy unit,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.610
one thing that has really impressed me,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.750
and what makes it different
than some of the other

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.040
inter-disciplinary teams that I work on

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.860
is that it's a place where we're
not working to find a cure,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.710
we're not working to make quick fixes

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.720
or to solve problems that are acute

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.340
and then kind of go away.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.430
It's a place where
children can be seen from

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.710
the first year of life until they're 21,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.270
as often as one to four times a week.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.966
So relationships are formed in this clinic

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.220
and milestones are celebrated,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.200
disappointments are
shared with the family.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.780
So it's a really unique
place in my work profile,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.330
where I get to kind of see
what it looks like day to day,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.410
to help parents through
the grieving process

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.740
and to work through the
developmental milestones

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.100
that all children have,
such as middle school,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.010
high school, graduation, things like that.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.840
Helen and Patty have been
practicing family-centered care

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.270
and shared decision making since

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.250
before those terms were even coined.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.270
It's a really impressive
place and I'm just

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.620
a part-time member of the team,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.720
but wanted to share what's going on there.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.453
Okay, so we have no disclosures.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.140
This is our clinic.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.160
This is a school, and in
this school and another one

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.513
is where the medical
therapy program is housed.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.630
California Children's Services
was established in 1927

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.840
by the State of California to provide

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.180
medical care coordination
for children birth to 21.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.460
And there's a, I'm gonna be
talking about CCS Administration

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.700
and the CCS Medical Therapy Program.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.450
And they're two different entities

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.600
under the umbrella of CCS.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.860
So the eligibility for CCS is based on

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.410
medical diagnosis and county of residence.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.533
And, again, it consists of CCS
Administration and the MTP.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.830
The administration program is administered

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.890
by each county in the state of California.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.890
And it arranges, directs, and pays for

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.070
medical care, equipment,
and rehabilitation

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.550
for children with specific diagnoses.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.410
And there's a wide range of diagnoses

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.810
that are CCS Administration-eligible,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.400
from genetic to endocrine
disorders to neoplasms

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.910
to different neuromuscular disorders.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.920
Clients must be both medically
and financially eligible

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.360
to receive CCS Administration services.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.260
There is a CCS pilot project
that was started in 2014

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.500
in the San Mateo Medical Center.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.210
Senate Bill 586 determined that

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.010
the Department of Health Care Services

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.910
should establish a
Whole-Child Model program.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.450
And this incorporated the CCS services

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.930
under the Medi-Cal managed care plan,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.200
or Health Plan San Mateo
in San Mateo County.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.850
And this has been going on, and in this,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.930
CCS San Mateo has a contract
with Health Plan San Mateo

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.780
to do their care coordination.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.320
And what's different
about the pilot program

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.580
is that it improves care
coordination for CCS children

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.000
for both their CCS and
their non-CCS conditions.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.280
Meaning that if a child who has diabetes,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.480
and therefore has a CCS
Administration care coordination,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.780
if they break their arm
while playing baseball,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.910
that orthopedic surgery
will be covered, you know,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.710
will be coordinated under the
care coordination of the CCS.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.120
This project maintains the CCS
program standards unchanged,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.000
including that the
services are provided by

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.230
CCS paneled providers.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.250
And it's a comprehensive treatment plan

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.440
that focuses on the whole child.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.070
So far, we're happy to say that
there's been minimal impact

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.230
on the availability of services

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.070
at the Medical Therapy Program
through this project program.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.300
And I believe it's gonna be unveiled

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.720
in six other counties
in the next few months,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.293
and maybe even further
over the next few years.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.750
So now let's talk about the
Medical Therapy Program.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.960
This was established about 20 years after

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.950
the CCS Administration, in 1945.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.200
It's funded half and half by
the state and by the counties.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.100
And the Medical Therapy
Program specifically provides

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.470
physical and occupational therapy,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.100
for children with specific
medical diagnoses.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.820
So in our county, and probably others,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.320
the speech therapy and
other developmental services

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.420
for children with these medical diagnoses

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.060
are provided by the regional center.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.850
The eligibility for children and families

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.580
to enroll in the MTP does not
require financial eligibility.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.750
So we have a quite wide range
of socio-economic status

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.590
in our patients at the
Medical Therapy Program.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.530
They do have to live in
the county of residence

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.163
and the main determining factor
is the medical diagnosis.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.050
Children are served from birth,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.883
or time of diagnosis
or concerns, to age 21.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.980
And the services are
provided in two schools

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.150
in San Mateo County, pictured
here, and one satellite.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.980
And people are brought to the clinic

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.453
that is closes to their home.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.270
Anybody can refer to the CCS MTP.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.080
Parents can refer, teachers,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.910
any medical professionals, social workers.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.920
The only requirements for the
referral are an application,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.810
which can be downloaded at the URL

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.800
that's listed on this slide,
a current medical report,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.170
and a doctor's prescription for

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.600
the first OT and PT evaluation.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.140
Because the MD or myself, or whoever else

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.170
is doing the medical care conference,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.840
will not be seeing the child until

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.550
after they've already begun their,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.623
had their evaluation and begun therapy.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.140
The eligible diagnoses for the
CCS Medical Therapy Program

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.700
are neurologic, so children
with cerebral palsy

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.810
make up the vast majority
of children in the MTP,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.650
but we also see kids with spina bifida,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.410
spinal cord injuries,
traumatic brain injuries,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.470
and I'll talk a little
bit about the diagnosis of

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.240
at risk for cerebral palsy,
under the age of three.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.270
Orthopedic diagnoses are seen,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.170
including osteogenesis imperfecta,

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.120
arthritis, arthrogryposis, amputations.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.100
And we also neuromuscular disorders,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.183
such as spinal muscular
atrophy and muscular dystrophy.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.040
So the kids who are at risk for CP,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.080
this is an eligible diagnosis that raises

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.530
the most questions and concern,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.130
so I just wanted to talk a
little bit more about it.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.960
Children can be applicants for
CCS under three years of age

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.260
if they have two or more of

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.160
the following neurological findings.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.700
So if a primary care physician is worried

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.860
because a child has
persistent primitive reflexes

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.110
and increased DTRs, or abnormal posturing,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.410
or hypotonicity or
asymmetry of motor findings,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.550
then they're referred and at age three

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.440
we make a determination if that child

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.240
indeed has cerebral palsy,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.060
or maybe a neurologist or someone else

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.470
makes that diagnosis prior to age three.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.580
But by age three, if
we have determined that

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.660
the child does not have cerebral palsy,

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.190
then their services are
transitioned to the school district

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.230
or to other providers for their

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.003
occupational and physical therapy needs.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.270
So we're gonna go through
the lives of three children

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.610
to kind of demonstrate
what we do at the clinic.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.760
And we're gonna start out with Ava.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.840
She is an adorable girl
who is now three years old.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.410
She was born at 36 weeks gestation.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.100
She was small for gestational
age and stayed in the NICU

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.360
for about two weeks
working on feeding issues

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.833
and also with temperature instability.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.560
When she came into our CCS MTP program

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.290
she was about 11 months old.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.540
And she was referred by
her primary care physician

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.150
because she was not yet
sitting independently,

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.880
she was using her right
hand more than her left,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.620
her lower extremities
demonstrated hypertonia,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.760
and so we accepted her into the program

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.500
with a diagnosis of at
risk for cerebral palsy.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.490
And you can see on the
growth curve at the right

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.040
that the upper one is her height

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.700
and the lower one is her weight.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.530
She was well below the third percentile

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.530
for her weight, height,
and head circumference,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.903
which is not pictured here.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.330
So over time, she continued
to grow very slowly

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.250
and has never been above
the third percentile

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.650
for weight, height, or head circumference.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.700
She had a head MRI, which was normal.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.530
Some facial differences were noted

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.200
and because of this, genetic
testing was performed.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.820
The initial round was normal,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.020
but a second round of genetic testing

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.690
revealed a diagnosis, which
explained her growth difficulty,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.883
developmental difficulties,
and her physical findings.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.670
Over time, feeding has continued
to be a challenge for Ava.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.540
She is currently syringe fed,
and she's been working with

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.160
occupational therapy on
her oral motor skills

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.490
since she came into our program.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.790
She does, however, have
nice fine motor skills,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.750
so the occupational therapist
has been able to focus

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.270
mainly on oral motor skills.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.460
She over time, at about 18 months of age,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.040
began to sit unsupported and then crawl

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.260
and then stand independently.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.920
At three years of age, she's still

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.581
not quite walking independently.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.810
But she does use all of
her limbs symmetrically,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.950
she requires no braces or equipment,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.900
and she has quite limited language,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.770
despite receiving speech therapy

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.233
through the regional center
for the past couple of years.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.050
So at age three, Ava came in to

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.980
our medical therapy conference
and we had our meeting,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.640
which the families attend as
well as the physical therapist,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.310
occupational therapist, a family liaison,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.580
sometimes a social worker,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.260
depending on the needs of the child,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.610
and we had a nice discussion.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.780
At that time, she was taking
one or two steps when held,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.010
she had nice movement
patterns that suggested

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.390
she's capable of walking
without assistance,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.690
she had completely normal muscle tone

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.830
and deep tendon reflexes and was using

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.493
her arms and legs symmetrically.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.530
So at that visit, we did not give

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.560
a qualifying diagnosis of cerebral palsy,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.560
which was sad for us,
because we love this family

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.840
and she's a really sweet girl.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.930
So she's not gonna continue
the services at CCS MTU

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.260
after turning three,
but instead her services

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.650
will be transitioned
to the school district

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.243
and to private therapists for
her ongoing OT and PT needs.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.890
- The child is first evaluated
at an initial assessment.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.950
The family is met by our parent
liaison and social worker

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.270
for the first part of the hour.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.780
Then, the PT supervisor and therapy chief

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.530
do a brief assessment using
several of those listed

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.780
and make a determination as to whether

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.483
the child would benefit from OT and PT.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.280
At the initial assessment,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.010
the CCS program is
explained to the parents,

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.503
as well as expectations
for their participation.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.240
Other resources that the
family may qualify for

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.020
are also provided.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.120
Once the child is assigned
to one of our therapists,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.580
they will do a much
more in-depth assessment

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.373
using those listed.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.870
Strength may be determined
using a manual muscle test

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.410
depending on the child's
ability to follow instructions.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.530
But if they aren't, then
the therapist simply

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.113
watches them move and sees
what they're capable of doing.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.100
Activities of daily living.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.470
This includes all self-care activities

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.640
and takes into consideration
the age of the child.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.640
It can range from oral
motor and feeding skills

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.550
to dressing and basic hygiene.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.550
For the older children, it might include

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.960
higher-level activities
like making a grocery list,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.533
going to the store, and
making a simple meal.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.400
Fine motor skills.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.000
The OTs focus on upper extremity use,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.810
including reach, grasp, and release,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.803
prehensile patterns, and manual dexterity.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.170
Gross motor skills.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.400
Both OTs and PTs work to
improve gross motor skills.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.660
OTs focus on the development
of self-care activities

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.910
while the PTs work on mobility and gait.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.740
The therapist may provide
individual treatments

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.020
or co-treat together.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.770
A co-treatment session consists
of both therapists present.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.280
This provides an extra set of hands

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.750
to facilitate the desired
patten of movement

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.530
in order to achieve the therapy goal.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.510
So for example, if they
were helping the child

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.280
learn to remove the jacket,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.620
the PT might work on weight
shift and trunk rotation

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.453
while the OT would work
on arm and hand control.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.940
Gait.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.260
Our PTs work to get the kids mobile

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.080
using their individual
strengths and abilities.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.900
Many children walk well
without any assistive devices

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.160
while others rely on them.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.650
Braces often play an important role

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.933
in providing support,
alignment, and stability.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.740
Balance is key in performing any activity.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.470
Therapists build balance
activities into their therapy

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.710
from the very beginning.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.860
Here you see a little girl on a swing,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.603
someone on a vibration board,
and someone on a balance beam.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.960
Posture and alignment.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.540
Therapists focus on both
posture and alignment

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.350
in order to teach kids
how to best engage muscles

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.910
that will enable them to
maximize their strength

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.270
and range of motion
and move with fluidity.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.730
The goal is to minimize long-term effects

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.500
from poor alignment that could lead to

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.693
chronic pain and further disability.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.390
How are therapy services determined?

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.920
This is a list of
commonly used assessments

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.460
that are standardized.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.980
They're selected depending on
the child's ability and age.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.190
Most children entering our program

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.760
between infancy and six years are assessed

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.120
using the Peabody Developmental Scale

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.430
in order to obtain a baseline of

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.483
their fine and gross motor abilities.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.610
And the classification scales,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.020
Dr. Chamber went into
lots of detail on that.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.810
There's three kinds:
the gross motor scale,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.430
the fine motor scale, and
the communication scale,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.710
each having a rating of one to five,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.300
five being the most involved.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.150
The scales have been extremely
helpful, like he said,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.350
for everyone to have
the same mental picture

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.013
of how the child performs.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.770
- So, once the objective
data has been collected,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.493
the therapists work with
parents, oh, let me.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.993
Oh, okay.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.870
Therapists work with parents and the kid

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.220
to determine functional goals.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.380
The COPM, or the Canadian
Occupational Performance Measure

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.980
is a tool in which the parent
and the child, if appropriate,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.630
list skills that they want to do,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.703
need to do, or are expected to do.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.670
After the goals are established,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.140
the therapists develop a treatment plan.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.350
And the treatment can include
the hands-on treatment,

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.920
and it could be separate
OT and PT sessions

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.420
or it could be a co-treatment.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.480
The sessions could also be provided in

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.830
an intensive treatment model,
in which a child receives

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.610
frequent therapy sessions, maybe
two to three times per week

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.670
for a number of weeks, up to 12 weeks,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.680
to work on a very
specific functional goal.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.550
This is paired with a home program

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.873
to practice and incorporate
in the normal home routine.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.870
There are multiple factors that go into

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.360
determining therapy frequency.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.330
And I know this is a question
a lot of parents have,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.670
how do therapists determine

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.703
how often the child is getting therapy?

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.330
Over time that a child is seen at CCS,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.600
their frequency will change
based on their needs.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.360
A child is seen more often
when they're making changes

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.530
as a result of hands-on therapy.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.200
And an increase in therapy
could be a result of,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.990
after a surgery or procedure.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.750
It could be because a child is motivated

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.990
to achieve a new goal, or if
they have new equipment needs.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.100
For example, they're
working on power mobility

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.230
and then you need to determine access

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.740
and they need practice
with driving skills.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.670
A decrease in therapy could be

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.270
if the goal is to just maintain skills,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.490
if the child is not
interested or motivated

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.000
to participate in therapy at that time,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.930
and when the family is more independent

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.560
in their home program and in handling

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.340
their equipment and bracing.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.260
A decrease in therapy
frequency does not mean

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.490
that therapy will not increase again

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.940
because therapists are constantly

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.623
reevaluating the frequency.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.100
Besides OT and PT services,
the medical therapy program

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.260
includes MTC, or the CCS clinics.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.660
And this is a team meeting with the child,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.260
the parents, the
therapists, the physician,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.160
the parent liaison, and social worker.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.090
In San Mateo County, the
way that we divide kids up

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.800
for the medical therapy conference,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.250
kids birth to six years old see

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.180
a developmental pediatrician,
like Dr. Buysse.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.770
Kids seven to 11 see a physiatrist.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.320
When they turn 12 and
until they're 21 they see

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.280
a physiatrist who
specializes in transitions.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.280
If they have orthopedic needs,
they see an orthopedist.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.040
And the kids who have Kaiser
see a Kaiser physiatrist

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.090
who comes to the medical therapy unit.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.220
Because Kaiser sends their physiatrist

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.840
to the medical therapy unit,
Kaiser kids are the only kids

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.913
with HMO that are seen in
the medical therapy clinics.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.640
Kids are seen at the
medical therapy conference

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.620
every six months if they
have active therapy,

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.290
which is once a week or more often,

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.110
and every 12 months if they
have monitoring therapy,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.320
which is less than once a week.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.720
The role of the physician at
the medical therapy conference

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.730
is to determine medical
eligibility at age three,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.580
to supervise the therapy
program, recommend equipment,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.283
make referrals to specialists,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.610
provide hip surveillance with x-rays,

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.963
and help with transition planning.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.310
We also have a social worker.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.210
And the social worker's
role is to provide resources

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.360
for the family regarding
housing, social security,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.660
health insurance conservatorship.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.910
He helps providing information

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.350
on transition for kids approaching 21,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.000
makes referrals to psycho-social services,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.020
and helps find financial assistance

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.933
from charitable organizations.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.520
We also have a parent liaison.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.380
She has a child who's 11 years old

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.220
who has been in our program
since he was six months old.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.770
She provides support to families

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.760
from a parent's perspective,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.490
helps families with navigating

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.120
the school system, the
regional center system.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.000
She connects families with each
other, runs a parent group,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.750
she does our bulletin boards
and our parent newsletter.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.700
We also have durable
medical equipment clinics,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.900
in which vendors come to
the medical therapy unit

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.210
to evaluate for, deliver,
and repair equipment.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.750
The child, the family, and the therapist

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.150
are all present at these clinics.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.100
In addition, the therapists help obtain

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.790
necessary documentation and prescriptions

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.180
to help families get equipment
through their insurance.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.620
For equipment that's
covered through Medi-Cal,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.150
the authorizations for the
equipment's actually done

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.550
in the medical therapy unit.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.780
We also have clinics where the orthotists

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.070
come to the medical therapy unit

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.530
to evaluate, cast, and deliver braces.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.880
And the therapists work
closely with the orthotist

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.293
to determine the fit and
function of orthoses.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.970
We have dental clinics,
which is similar to

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.070
the dental program that Dr.
Glasman talked about yesterday.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.860
It's provided by Ravenswood
Dental Clinic through a grant.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.900
It's for children under 12 years old.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.660
A dental hygienist and a dental assistant

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.720
who specialize in working
with kids with special needs

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.370
comes to the unit once a month.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.070
And they are able to do cleanings,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.520
x-rays, and simple treatment.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.670
We also have monthly activities
of daily living groups.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.440
So we provide activities
in a group setting

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.540
to work on things like
dressing, meal prep,

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.500
household chores, community
skills, such as shopping,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.480
money management, and
public transportation.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.350
We have a weekly exercise group.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.130
And these are group activities
to work on strengthening,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.120
stretching, balance, and coordination.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.130
And we have each of these
groups at each of the sites,

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.253
so both in San Mateo and San Bruno.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.350
We have a yearly prom, and
this started nine years ago

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.610
when some kids in the exercise group were

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.980
talking about their high
school proms and saying how

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.640
they didn't really feel
comfortable going to them.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.470
So the first prom was planned
to help them learn about

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.350
grooming and social etiquette.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.380
And since then, it's become a yearly event

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.070
that everyone looks forward to.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.240
It's open to children
that are 10 years old

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.573
and their families, and older.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.880
We have, everyone gets all dressed up,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.250
and we have donated
clothes, to make sure that

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.780
everyone's able to come
looking their best.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.210
It's a community effort,

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.120
with donations from local businesses

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.940
for food, decorations,
flowers, and makeup.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.030
We have volunteers who run a makeup,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.640
hair, and nail station before the prom,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.470
and we have a volunteer
DJ, who plays lively tunes,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.253
and we have photographers
throughout the event.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.710
So just to give you a little better idea

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.153
of some of the MT services,
I wanted to meet Taylor.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.680
Taylor had a rough start due
to fetal maternal hemorrhage,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.090
resulting in global
brain injury, seizures,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.593
and she was in the NICU for 12 days.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.390
By 11 months, she
demonstrated increased tone

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.980
and reflexes in all her extremities

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.040
and asymmetrical use of her hands.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.090
She was diagnosed with
cerebral palsy at 24 months

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.040
and started her services at 11 months

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.860
through the Early Start program,

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.193
and CCS when she was almost three.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.160
She's now eight years
old, with a diagnosis of

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.140
spastic quadriparesis, GMSCS level four.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.440
She has increased tone throughout,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.150
with her legs more affected than her arms

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.670
and the left side more
affected than the right side.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.410
She has impaired balance
and protective reactions,

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.313
impaired sensation and
visual motor skills.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.180
She has tightness and weakness
in all her extremities

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.980
and her trunk and she has
difficulty dissociating

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.343
or isolating movement throughout.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.010
She's able to sit independently
and turn to either side,

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.010
but she does have a rounded spine

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.440
and flexion posturing in
her arms and her legs.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.550
She scissors at her legs.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.520
You can see, these are two pictures.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.020
The first was a few years
ago and the second one,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.660
the lower one, is just recently.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.070
And she had a selective dorsal rhizotomy

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.340
a little over a year ago.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.660
And it has made a difference
as far as her posture

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.810
and her ability to work on some of

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.563
her independent living skills.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.610
For fine motor, she's able
to reach over her head

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.130
without a loss of balance.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.120
She has difficulty using her arms

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.560
and precise movement of
her fingers and hands.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.707
She has some hypermobility
of her joints in her hands

00:24:56.707 --> 00:24:59.550
and some hypomobility, as well.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.403
So she uses hand splints
for fine motor function.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.720
She's able to feed herself,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.390
take off her socks and a shirt overhead.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.000
She needs some help to take off

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.290
a sweater that's open in the front.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.820
And she's able to push large
buttons through buttonholes

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.173
using a thumb splint.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.550
For mobility, she's able
to roll, commando crawl,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.840
and get up to sitting by herself.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.290
She transitions to standing
with some help, contact guard,

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.390
up to kneeling, and then a
little bit more assistance

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.260
to come all the way up to standing.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.140
She needs moderate assistance to get

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.000
from her bed to her wheelchair.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.853
And she's dependent for
toilet and tub transfers.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.670
She walks on level surfaces and up stairs

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:41.730
with moderate assistance,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.300
but in a gait trainer she's
able to walk in an open space.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.130
She uses a manual wheelchair
at home and in the classroom

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.890
and for longer distances
she uses power mobility,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.380
but because of her visual motor
issues she needs supervision

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.240
and she's working with

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.703
an orientation and mobility specialist.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.080
Her strengths are her communcation
skills and social skills.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.260
She has age-appropriate
play skills and interests.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.160
She's willing to try anything
and loves coming to therapy.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.600
At the last therapy evaluation,
the OT goals were determined

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.100
by Taylor, her parents, and the OT.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.900
And the goals are to put on
an open-front shirt or sweater

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.420
and to hike her pants up
while standing with one hand.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.410
For PT, they came up with these goals:

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.650
stand with one arm support for 30 seconds,

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.840
and to get herself into bed

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.993
positioned in the correct orientation.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.950
She's currently receiving twice a week PT

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.520
and twice a week OT.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.580
Over the time that she's been at CCS,

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.950
her frequency has fluctuated between

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.400
one to four times a
week, based on her needs.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.570
Some of the things that
they take into consideration

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.270
when considering Taylor's frequency are

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.270
the fact that she works
really hard in therapy

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.240
and by the end of the
session she looks different

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.070
than she did when she started.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.100
She continues to progress in her skills.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.680
She's had various orthopedic
surgeries, she's had Botox,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.390
and she's had the
selective dorsal rhizotomy.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.770
And she's, her age-expected
skills have changed

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.300
because she started at age three
and now she's at age eight.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.450
So there's always
something new to work on.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.100
The therapists have provided consultation

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.280
in a variety of settings,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.470
including home visits and school visits.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.380
They've also consulted with orthopedists,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.700
especially in preparation
and after surgeries,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.850
with neurologists, and
with the physiatrist,

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.520
especially in relation
to different muscles

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.940
that might benefit from Botox injections.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.890
At the spasticity management
clinic it was determined,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.630
they decided that she would go through

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.757
a selective dorsal rhizotomy.

00:27:44.757 --> 00:27:49.210
And the therapists were
part of that team approach.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.210
And after the rhizotomy,
the therapists consulted

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.270
very closely with the inpatient rehab team

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.050
at Children's Hospital Oakland

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.550
to ensure that the transition
from in patient rehab

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.383
to outpatient CCS Services was smooth.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.140
The therapists have worked
very closely with the parents

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.553
to develop an home activity program.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.690
She attends the medical therapy
conference every six months

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.700
because she's getting active therapy.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.413
She sees a physiatrist at this time.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.380
The therapists have
helped the families obtain

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.110
her manual wheelchair, power
wheelchair, her gait trainer,

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.933
adaptive tricycle,
stander, and toilet seat.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.100
And the therapists have also
the family obtain her AFOs.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.930
And she's currently on trial using a SWASH

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.490
to keep her hips in the hip abduction

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.310
because she's having a little bit of

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.233
recurrence of some hip issues.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.860
So Taylor's come a long way,

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.620
but she has many challenges ahead

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.370
as she heads into her preteen years.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.110
And we're gonna continue
to work with her family,

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.580
her medical providers, and teachers,

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.890
to maximize her abilities,
ensure she has the tools needed

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.403
for what lies ahead as
a teen and as an adult.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.960
- I'd like to introduce
you now to Rebecca.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.130
Rebecca is a 32-year-old female

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.710
with a diagnosis of spastic quadriparesis.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.560
She's a Bay Area native,
the oldest of two girls.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.680
Her sister is a physical therapist.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.270
She graduated with a BA and
MA from Notre Dame de Namur

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.583
and she's a marriage and family therapist.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.340
Her mother's pregnancy was uneventful

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.450
until about 28 weeks,
when her water broke.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.440
Mom was hospitalized and
administered steroids

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.880
to develop the baby's lungs.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.930
Rebecca appeared the
next week, at 29 weeks,

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.313
and was weighing in at
two pounds, 3.7 ounces.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.920
She was only ventilated for 24 hours.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.830
She had an NG tube for less than a month.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.500
She was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.283
and in the NCIU for two months.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.930
At six months, she had her heart surgery

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.780
to correct he Tetralogy of Fallot

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.063
and then returned home after recovery.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.210
Rebecca's parents noticed that

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.810
she was not meeting her
developmental milestones

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.283
and they discussed this
with their pediatrician.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.970
She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy,

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.040
spastic quadriparesis,
and then referred to

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.730
the Golden Gate Regional Center,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.920
where she entered an Early Start program

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.593
and received PT, OT, and speech.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.860
At age three, she was referred to CCS.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.940
At the time, the therapist
met with her parents

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.100
and determined what was important to them.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.800
The primary goal for both
parents was mobility,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.150
followed by socialization,
education, and just,

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.293
they really wanted to
maximize her opportunities.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.220
Her services after the
Golden Gate Regional Center

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.480
took place at an early
childhood education preschool,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.450
where she benefited from the services of

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.070
a special education
teacher and classroom aids.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.330
Housed at the same facility was one of our

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.100
medical therapy units,
where she received OT and PT

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.993
and was eligible for
services until she turned 21.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.540
The PT did an evaluation, they
looked at her increased tone,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.070
her decreased range of motion,
her postural alignment,

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.930
her balance, mobility, and gait,

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.590
and came up with a treatment plan

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.163
and therapy frequency, which was weekly.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.060
The OT did a similar
assessment, looking at range,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.240
increased tone, weakness,
postural alignment,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.980
fine motor skills, self
care, and perception,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.650
and also came up with a therapy plan

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.603
and recommended therapy on a weekly basis.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.880
Early on, it was determined
that she would benefit from

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.590
a manual wheelchair, a walker, and AFOs.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.540
At age 11, she received her power chair.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.510
These four pieces of equipment
have remained very critical

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.580
in her mobility to this day.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.260
And she uses them to get around the house

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.943
as well as in the community.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.980
At age six, she had
soft tissue lengthenings

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.950
of her hip adductors, hip
flexors, and hamstrings.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.570
PT did a home visit to
evaluate how things were going

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.703
and if additional durable
medical equipment was needed.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.990
Rebecca's parents focused on mobility

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.320
and throughout her childhood
they took her everywhere,

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.110
did everything with her.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.810
They enrolled her in a
variety of community programs

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:50.520
and they were really quite successful

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.373
in promoting her ability to
navigate her surroundings.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:02.250
In her adult life, Rebecca
lives in San Francisco.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.030
She graduated from grad school in 2010

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.540
and completed her credentials as an MFT.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.133
She shares an apartment
and works full time.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.377
Of importance to Rebecca is
exercising on a regular basis.

00:33:18.377 --> 00:33:20.890
She heads to the gym in her neighborhood

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.220
two or three times a week.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.650
And she says that it helps her feel looser

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:29.620
and that the benefits of
working out last a couple days.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.310
Like other 32-year-old young ladies,

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.163
she enjoys travel, restaurants,
movies, and sporting events.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.750
In terms of self care,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.760
she's now independent
with upper body dressing,

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.350
she can manage clothing for toileting,

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.640
but she requires maximum assistance

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.920
to don lower extremity garments.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.010
She's independent with basic grooming,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.190
including putting her contacts in,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.760
and she benefits from
assistance for bathing,

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.733
cooking, and household chores.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.130
Rebecca is independent,
driving her own van.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.850
She's able to enter it, transfer
out of her power wheelchair

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.180
and into the driver's seat.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.893
She uses her van every day to get to work.

00:34:16.274 --> 00:34:18.700
She's a very lucky individual in that

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.270
she lives in California,
where it's usually sunny.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.710
When it rains or there's inclement weather

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.620
this can impair her mobility
and be downright hazardous.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.960
In this picture, she's
on a glacier in Iceland

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.100
and you can see that she
depends completely on her friend

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.480
to stay in an upright
position, standing in the snow.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.620
She loves to travel and
she's been to many countries.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.030
She's told me that it's not
easy to find medical providers

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.790
when traveling, or even at home,

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.170
because there's a scarcity
of trained physicians

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.900
that are familiar with her condition.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.360
Anyone who travels quite a bit
has probably had a situation

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.990
or an incident where you check
your bags, get on the plane,

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.360
and afterwards you go to the
conveyor belt and you watch

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.480
and A, you're worried that your
luggage isn't gonna show up

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.660
and B, when it does, you see that

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.850
the wheel fell off the
suitcase and the handle's torn.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.280
With Rebecca, in addition
to accessibility,

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.930
she has to really think twice about

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.120
what equipment she takes along on a trip.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.990
And she's told me that at
least two or three times

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.983
in her travels her
equipment's been damaged.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.720
And whether it breaks
at home or on vacation,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.270
it's always hard to find a provider

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.743
and it renders her immobile.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.800
Even though she is very capable
of handling her own affairs,

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.970
getting new equipment
and dealing with repairs

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.680
is quite a deal and she
has to be very persistent.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.570
So as you can tell from
these case studies,

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.770
we take the kids through
many stages of their lives.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.140
At CCS, it takes teamwork
to move the kids forward

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.880
to live independently
so that they can have

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.133
fulfilling lives.

00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:09.746
(audience applauding)
