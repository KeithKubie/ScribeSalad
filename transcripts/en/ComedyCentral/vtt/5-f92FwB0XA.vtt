I'm like,

There's no...
there's no rules."

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.448
Fucking they won.
They did it exactly right.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.082
They got the pot,
and they ate it.

I-I go to UFC events a lot,
and my friend gets me tickets--

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.771
Joe Rogan.
He's my buddy.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.272
And I like to get high.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.108
I like to get super fucking high
and go to UFC events.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.942
The first three or four
were really fun, you know.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.444
It was exciting,
people punching each other,

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.146
but then it got fucking boring
after a little bit,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:23.850
so I needed to get blasted
on marijuana edibles.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.618
Yeah, my friend's like,
"How do you smuggle 'em in?"

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.953
I'm like, "In your stomach,
that's how you smuggle them in."

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.422
Just as soon as you get
to the parking lot,

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.690
you just eat that shit
and then

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.792
fucking have a great time
at the UFC.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.293
It's, like, six hours long.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.929
Those pot cookies last
sometimes six, seven hours.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.365
And we--in L.A.,
we have the best system.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.001
You just go to a dispensary
like a fucking gentleman,

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.103
stop by a store,
say, "What are you doing?"

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.705
Like, "I'm going
to a UFC event."

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.106
They're like, "Oh, I got
just the cake for you,"

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.541
and they'll fucking pick
one out.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.710
They'll help you
with it, too.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.712
Anyway, so we take
these pot breath strips.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.346
Have you guys ever had
the pot breath strips,

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.948
the marijuana breath strips?

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:56.983
No?

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.317
All right, well--
You've had them.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.053
They're great.
They come two to a pack.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.721
They're in those little, like,
Ziploc bags--

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.723
the ones that
are, like, that big,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.992
the ones that
are, like, only for drugs.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:09.361
[laughter]

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.399
There's nothing else you have
to keep fresh in that size.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.667
Like, what else--

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.569
What, you have to keep
one apple seed

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.805
from going sour?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.373
I don't know
how they manufacture those

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.208
and think they're
for anything else.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.077
They're for fucking heroin
and crack

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.747
and a little bit
of pot edibles, so...

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.348
They're breath strips.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.084
They're like Listerine breath
strips, but they have--

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.918
I don't know
how they make them--

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.320
scientists, pothead scientists
that put marijuana in them.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.223
The proper dose is half of one.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.426
They come two to a pack,
so it's a party for four.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.763
And you have to fold it in half
and crease it

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.164
and then tear it in half.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.832
You eat half.
The other person eats half.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.768
It does not make your breath
smell good, by the way.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.403
Yeah, it makes it
smell like weed.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.038
You need a real breath strip
after you're done with it.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:54.741
So one time I took a full one.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.108
Oh, no, I took one
and a quarter,

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.777
'cause somebody
wasn't gonna join in.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.612
So we're like, "Fuck it.
Let's just keep going."

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.614
And I was high for 27 hours.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.051
[laughter]

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.420
Yeah, it's too long
to be high for.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.122
I woke up in the morning. I was
like, "I'm really groggy."

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.125
And then by 3:00 p.m., I'm like,
"Why am I still groggy?

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:16.128
Oh, I'm high as shit.
I'm still super high."

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.130
So I take them with Joey Diaz.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.732
We take them.
We sit there.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.100
We're like,
"Oh, I kind of feel them."

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.369
And then after a while,
we're like...

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.704
Like, you just get blasted.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.739
It's a fun way
to watch the fights.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.873
It really is.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.376
It's hard to score the cards...

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.477
like, to score the rounds.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.545
Like, "Who's winning?"

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.813
I'm like, "I don't know.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.415
"They're both trying
really hard.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.116
"I know they're both good
at sweating,

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.651
"so maybe one round apiece.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.453
I don't know."

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:43.989
Yeah, when somebody
does get like, "He won 30-27,"

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.825
you're like,
"Oh, so close!"

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.260
And everyone's like,
"It was a blowout."

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.429
You're like,
"Well, I don't know, man.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.164
I don't know."

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.965
It's the best way
to watch fights.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.401
And I would tell people on
podcasts and stuff

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.802
and on Twitter how I did it,

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.437
and people are like,
"Oh, that sounds so cool."

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:00.673
And after a while, I was like,
I feel bad for the people

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.108
who can't live life
like a California person does,

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:04.643
you know,
doesn't have access

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.413
to the medical grade marijuana
shit we have all the time.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:11.451
So I decided I was gonna,
like, bring some to Vegas

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.453
to a fight
and just give 'em to a fan,

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:17.023
and just let him watch a UFC
the way I watch UFC,

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.024
fucking obliterated
out of my mind

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.126
on a marijuana edible.

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:22.995
And instead of just
handing it to somebody,

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:26.465
I decided I was gonna have
a scavenger hunt.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.334
Yeah, so Rogan does the
weigh-ins on Friday afternoons,

00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:31.137
and then the fights
are on Saturday night.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:34.339
So half the stadium will get
shut down for the weigh-ins,

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.041
and I can walk back there
with him.

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.345
So I have access to half
of the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:43.215
I can just walk around,
and I just hid stuff.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.818
I just--they're, like,
that small, they hide anywhere.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:49.789
So I taped it to the bottom
of a men's bathroom sink,

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.190
and then I made
a bunch of clues.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.692
Like, on the second floor,
I made a bunch of clues,

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.493
and I put 'em on Twitter,
like, every two minutes.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:56.496
I timed 'em out for when
the fight started the next day.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.864
One was like, "If you want
to get high, go up a level,"

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.000
you know, I made--
second floor, you know?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.002
And then, like, "Don't forget
to relieve yourself

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.371
before a long trip,"
shit like that.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.072
And eventually
somebody got to the bathroom.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.674
He followed the clues,

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:10.242
got to the bathroom,
was like, "I think it's here,"

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:11.710
and fucking went
underneath the sink

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.245
and pulled off
this little drug bag.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:17.082
And he fucking did it.
He had a great time.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:20.319
Yeah, I felt like Robin Hood,
everybody.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.921
It was wonderful.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.590
[cheers and applause]

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.391
It's the power of giving.

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:28.394
And I started doing it
more and more.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.595
I got off on it.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.897
For 20 bucks, you could
make someone's day.

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:34.500
I would tape them to a pillar,
like, down here,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.701
just this small, you know?

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.069
You can just tape it
right there.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.870
And I went to see
if, um, somebody found it,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.272
and I was walking by
the section it was in.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.774
Like, this is, like,
three fights later.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.742
I went by like this
to, like, see.

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.177
And some usher comes by,
and he goes,

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.513
"What you're looking for
is no longer here."

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.584
[laughter]
Yeah.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:56.288
I guess a bunch of people
had come by, like, looking.

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:58.123
'Cause that's the thing--
I don't tweet, like,

00:05:58.123 --> 00:05:59.791
"Hey, party's over.
Somebody found it."

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:01.126
I just, like, put the clues out,

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.563
and then when somebody gets it,
they get it.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.598
Oh, it's great.
It's so much fun.

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.033
And then I started doing it
at comedy shows, too.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.968
One time I just taped
those breath strips

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:12.371
to the bottom of a chair
in Philadelphia,

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.306
and then I wrote on Twitter--
no clues.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:16.542
It was like, if you follow me,
look under your chair.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:17.910
If you find it, you get it.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.312
If not, somebody
at the next show will get it.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.913 line:91%
If not, somebody
at the next show will get it.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.448
So the very first show,
Wednesday night,

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.916
these two, like,
22-year-old kids--

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.317
they just waited
till the show was over

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:26.986
and went under all the chairs.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.154
Yeah, and they found it.

00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:30.589
Yeah, somebody's like,
"That's cheating."

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.158
I'm like,
"This is fucking drug hiding.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.627
There's no...
there's no rules."

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:37.930
This isn't Milton Bradley,
all right?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.832
Fucking they won.
They did it exactly right.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.834
They got the pot,
and they ate it.

00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:44.336
So, yeah, it was a lot of fun.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.272
One time I hid a lollipop
in Austin,

00:06:47.272 --> 00:06:49.842
outside in the parking lot,
outside Cap City Comedy Club.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.844
And some pregnant lady
found it.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.111
- Ha!
- Yeah.

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:54.847
She was like,
"Is this safe to eat?"

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.916
And I'm like, "I don't think
they've done any studies

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.084
"on that at all, so...

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.454
Yeah, eat it.
I would eat it."

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.189
Better safe than sorry,
you know?

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.623
'Cause what if
she didn't eat it,

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.592
and then they do tests, like,
years later,

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.294
and they find out
it would've been safe

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.361
and she didn't eat it?

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.030
She'd never forgive herself.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.167
[laughter]

00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:18.203
Is that what
"better safe than sorry" means?

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:19.805
Am I interpreting it right?

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:21.807
So my friends are like,
"You're gonna get in trouble."

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:23.676
I'm like, "I'm not gonna get
in trouble. I'll be fine.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.611
I'll be totally fine,"
because I'm a good person.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.012
I'm like Robin Hood.

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:29.048
Robin Hood didn't get
in trouble, did he?

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.482
[laughter]

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:32.952
All right, anyway,
back to my story.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.221
So I was
in the Mall of America,

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.523
and people are like,
"Are you gonna bring those"--

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.057
We called it
"hunt for the edible."

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:40.559
That's what I did.

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:42.328
That was a hashtag on Twitter--
"hunt for the edible."

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:43.829
And I would delete all the clues
after somebody found them.

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.531
I would go back there
and fucking delete them all.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.400
Anyway,
I was in Mall of America.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.469
I was like, "Well, what better
place to bring fucking drugs...

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.871
you know?

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:55.908
So I hid, uh, I hid
these marijuana breath strips

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.010
in an underwear aisle
of a J. Crew

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.713
at the Mall of America.

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:04.016
Yeah, there was a--there was
a comedy club upstairs.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.318
Rick Bronson's House Of Comedy
was all the way upstairs,

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:07.986
and I hid it, and then
I made a bunch of clues.

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.856
And, I mean, this is big.
Mall of America's massive.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.057
There was, like, 50 people

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.358
running around
the Mall of America

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:15.427
looking for these
pot breath strips.

00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:17.096
And, anyway,
I sent out all the clues

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.430
on, like, auto-release.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.165
So, every two minutes,
one would go out.

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:21.667
And then I was outside my show
getting ready to go on.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.435
I was just texting,
and all of a sudden,

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.704
I heard somebody to my right,
"Ari, can we talk to you?"

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:28.741
And I looked up, and it was
a Mall of America cop.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.008
Yeah, and then on my left

00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:33.445
was a Minneapolis, like,
state trooper.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:36.582
And I was like,
"Well, fuck. All right."

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:39.585
[laughs] And I was like,
"What's going on?"

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:42.187
And they go,
"Did you hide drugs

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.690
in the underwear aisle
of a J. Crew?"

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.594
[laughter]

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:51.096
And, I mean,
I was gonna deny it,

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:54.934
but that wasn't a lucky guess,
you know?

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:01.473
Like, they must've already known
at some point.

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.208
They're not just going
to random people--

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:06.545
"Did you hide drugs
at a J. Crew underwear aisle?"

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.147
No.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:10.883
So I was like,
"Yeah, I did, so?"

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.652
And they're like,
"That's super illegal here."

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:16.589
I'm like, "Yeah, obviously.
I'm really scared."

00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:21.326
By the way, mall cops,
in general,

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.627
they can go fuck themselves.

00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:24.396
They don't have
any power whatsoever.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.164
I was with Dice once,
and he was smoking in a mall.

00:09:26.164 --> 00:09:27.466
I think at the Beverly Center.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.168
And I was like,
"What are you doing, man?

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.602
You can't smoke in a mall."

00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:33.105
And he goes,
"Really? I'm smoking, so..."

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.840
[laughter]

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.175
Yeah.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.943
And then some mall cop
comes up.

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:39.644
He's like, "You got to put
that cigarette out."

00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:42.014
He goes, "Okay,"
and he fucking stamps it out

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.348
and was like,
"There. Sorry."

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:45.184
And then we walked away.

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.618
And I'm like,
"See, you got in trouble."

00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:48.754
He's like, "No, I smoked half
a cigarette.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.656
You smoked none."

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.658
Good point, Dice Man.
Good point.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.126
So, uh...

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.994
But these Mall of America cops,
they're, like, top shelf.

00:09:55.994 --> 00:09:58.531
Of those shitty mall cops,
they're the best of the best.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.366
They have their own jail
and stuff.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.534
So I had to talk my way
out of it with the mall cop

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:04.135
and with the fucking
state trooper.

00:10:04.135 --> 00:10:06.038
And so Rick Brunson--
he got on the phone.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.672
He lives in Edmonton.

00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:09.475
The guy who owned the comedy
club got on the phone with me.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.176
He goes, "Don't smile.
I'm gonna talk to you.

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.011
"Don't smile, 'cause they're
looking at you, so...

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.048
"No matter what I say.
Act like I'm yelling, I guess.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.482
I don't know."

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:18.985
He goes, "First of all,
I don't give a shit.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.786
"Like, I know this is
an early booking for you,

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.487
"but we'll have you back--
don't worry about it.

00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:23.856
"But I can talk you out
of trouble with the mall cops.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.357
"They wanted to ban you
from the mall forever,

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:26.692
but that's not gonna happen."

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:30.229
He goes, "Did you hide acid
at an H&amp;M?"

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:32.064
And I was like, "No."

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.400
[laughter]

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.068
"Is that what people
are saying?"

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.569
And he goes, "Yeah."

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:39.305
I'm like, "No. I mean, yeah,
keep saying that.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.473
"That sounds way cooler,
but, no.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:43.242
I hid marijuana at a J. Crew."

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.677
And...
and he goes, "What is it?"

00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:47.245
I'm like,
"It's marijuana breath strips."

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:48.914
He goes, "They make
your breath smell good?"

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.515
I'm like, "No, they do not.

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:52.918
They make your breath
smell awful."

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.586
And he goes, "Well, listen,

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:56.722
"okay, you're for sure
going to jail.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.890
"I can get you out of trouble
with the mall cop,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.092
"but the Minneapolis trooper--
like, you're going to jail.

00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:02.761
"But I need you to do me
a favor, man.

00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:04.030
"Next time you come,

00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:08.266
I was like, "All right, fine."

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:09.435
And so I got back.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.036
They start calling,

00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:12.905
like, anyone else in town
that could headline the show,

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.740
'cause I'm not gonna be
able to, you know?

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.441
Right then, some fan,
by the way, came over.

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.277
A lot of times my fans give me,
like, weed on the road,

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.611
which is pretty cool.

00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.747
And some lady, she, like--
into her purse.

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.549
She's like,
"Ari, can I talk to you?"

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.217
'Cause the cops are behind me
by, like, five feet.

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:28.120
And I was just like,
"No, no, don't."

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.089
Like, I'm like...
you know?

00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:33.291
It's that thing when you open up
the door and a cop's there.

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:34.693
Like, "Everything all right?"

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:37.930
Like, "Yeah, everything's fine,"
you know?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.465
But I had to say it
without saying it, you know?

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:41.766
And so I was like, "No, no."

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.303
But then it was
just Swedish Fish, so...

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.071
So, anyway,
so this Minneapolis trooper,

00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:47.606
he's like, "Explain to me
what happened here,"

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:52.545
and I was like,
"I-I hide...you know...

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:57.816
"marijuana
across the country...

00:11:57.816 --> 00:12:02.321
"in, like, different areas
to give people the experience

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.423
of what it's like
to live in California."

00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:06.992
And he was like,
"You sell this stuff?"

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:10.395
I'm like, "No, I don't sell it.
I just give it away.

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:13.298
I'm like Johnny Appleseed,
I guess."

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.934
[laughs]
Like--like--Johnny Appleweed!

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:17.102
Fuck!

00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:18.436
[audience groaning]

00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:20.439
For sure that's
what I should have said!

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:23.576
[cheers and applause]

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.612
And I'm like, "First of all,

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.346
how did you find out
that I did that?"

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:29.748
And he goes,
"Here's your Twitter feed, man.

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:31.917
"It's just a list of clues.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:35.253
"It's just you going, 'Here are
the drugs I'm about to hide.'

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:36.789
"And then the next one's like,

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:38.624
"'Here's where I'm hiding
the drugs.'

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:39.958
"And then fucking 17 clues

00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.960
on how to find the place
where you hid the drugs.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.196
He's like, "I'm not gonna get
my fucking detective badge

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.364
for this."

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.833
And I guess
what happened was

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.002
the first guy to follow the clue
went in there,

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.636
found it, went
right to the underwear aisle,

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:52.971
was like, "Oh, here it is,"
was like, "Yeah!"

00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:54.640
And then he left,
and then somebody else

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.974
was following the clues,
like, two minutes behind,

00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:57.509
and they went in there,
and they're like,

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:59.144
"Oh, nothing's there,"
and they go,

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:01.379
"It must be here somewhere,"
and they just start fucking...

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:02.948
throwing shit around
in the underwear aisle

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.951
of the J. Crew
until they got kicked out.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.820
And then five minutes later,
somebody else would come in

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.821
and just start
fucking throwing--

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.724
Like, "Where the fuck
are these drugs?"

00:13:12.724 --> 00:13:14.860
It happened, like,
eight or nine times to them,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.230
and they're like, "Are we
in the worst terrorist attack

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.666
of all time?"

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:24.035
So then somebody called
one of the employees

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:25.670
and was like, "Hey,
I saw there's some drugs

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.406
being hid under your thing,"
and they found me.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.174
It was super easy to find me,
and so...

00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:32.043
this cop was like, "All right,
so explain to me what it is.

00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:35.247
It's marijuana
inside a breath strip?"

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:36.748
I'm like, "Yeah."

00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:38.684
He asked me the same--"Does it
make your breath smell?"

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.218
"No, it's terrible."

00:13:40.218 --> 00:13:41.520
And I think he thought

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.856
I was just, like,
a good person, I guess.

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.690
[sighs] And I didn't have
any ill intention.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.760
I wasn't selling it. I wasn't
trying to make a profit.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.829
I was just giving it to people--
Johnny Appleweed.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:53.432
[laughter]

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.269
And he goes,
"So explain this to me,

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.536
"was it a real breath strip,

00:13:58.536 --> 00:14:00.439
or was it
a marijuana breath strip?"

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:02.274
And I was like, "It was
a marijuana breath strip."

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:04.609
And he goes, "No, no, no,
was it a real breath strip,

00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:07.079
or was it
a marijuana breath strip?"

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.447
And I was like,
"You no, no, no.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:12.384
"You didn't hear
what I just said?

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:15.053
"I just told you
the fucking answer, idiot.

00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:18.457
"You fucking
hard of hearing?

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.258
It was
a marijuana breath strip."

00:14:20.258 --> 00:14:23.462
And he goes, "No, idiot,
listen to what I'm saying to you

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:25.464
"out loud where people
can hear me.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:26.731
"Was it a real breath strip,

00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:28.066
or was it
a marijuana breath strip?"

00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:30.636
And I was like,
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, all right.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:33.439
"Oh, man, I misunderstood
the question completely

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.407
"the last two times.

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.642
"I did not get that at all.

00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:39.378
"Now that I hear it completely,

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.813
"I'd like to strike from the
record my other two answers,

00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:44.249
"'cause those were
completely wrong.

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:45.817
"Uh, that was
a real breath strip.

00:14:45.817 --> 00:14:48.553
I hid a real breath strip
in the J. Crew underwear aisle."

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.388
And he goes, "Well,
then that's just mischief,

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:51.756
"so I don't see a crime here.

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:54.259
Go apologize
to the manager of the J. Crew."

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.760
And he let me off,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.931
and that is when I figured out
what white privilege is.

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.067
[laughter,
cheers, and applause]
