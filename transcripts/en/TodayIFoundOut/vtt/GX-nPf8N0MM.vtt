00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.750
Established in West Wycombe by Sir Francis
Dashwood in 1749, the Brotherhood of St. Francis

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.630
of Wycombe was anything but saintly.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.770
Devoted to wicked fun and debauchery, for
the next two decades, many notable individuals

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.770
in England counted themselves members, such
as the 4th Earl of Sandwich, John Montagu,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.460
Baron George Dodington, member of Parliament
Thomas Potter, and, while not a full member,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.640
distinguished guest Ben Franklin, who was
a friend of Dashwood’s and is known to have

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.050
attended meetings when in town.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.480
In these meetings, the group drank, ate and
fornicated at will, trying their hardest to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.060
live up to the future moniker of “Hellfire
Club”.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.420
Although the Order first met in London at
the George and Vulture pub, beginning in 1750,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.370
Dashwood leased Medmenham Abbey, a rundown
former Cistercian abbey, which was close to

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.370
his home.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.980
Rebuilding it and excavating what are now
known as the “Hellfire Caves” beneath

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.860
it (a network of man-made caves extending
over 1,500 feet into the hillside), Dashwood

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.210
had the inscription Fay ce que voudras (“Do
what thou wilt”) placed over the entrance,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.460
and the members complied.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.890
Mocking certain religious groups, during the
get-togethers, the friars referred to each

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.040
other as “brothers,” addressed the leader
in a given year as “Abbot” and called

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520
the prostitutes in attendance “nuns.”

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.610
In those caves, they also play-acted at pagan
rituals, drank copiously of wine and port,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.750
gambled, laughed and joked around and, of
course, enjoyed the company of women.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.990
In the 1779 work, Nocturnal Revels, it describes
the general activities of the meetings:

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.930
They however always meet in one general sett
at meals, when, for the improvement of mirth,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.030
pleasantry, and gaiety, every member is allowed
to introduce a Lady of cheerful lively disposition,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.060
to improve the general hilarity.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.470
Male visitors are also permitted, under certain
restrictions, their greatest recommendation

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.670
being their merit wit and humour.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.550
There is no constraint with regard to the
circulation of the glass, after some particular

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.600
toasts have been given: The Ladies, in the
intervals of their repasts, may make select

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.470
parties among themselves, or entertain one
another, or alone with reading, musick, tambour-work,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.490
etc.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.440
The salt of these festivities is generally
purely attic, but no indelicacy or indecency

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.190
is allowed to be intruded without a severe
penalty; and a jeu de mots must not border

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.110
too much upon a loose double entendre to be
received with applause.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.420
Hellfire_Caves_tunnelAlthough their mock-pagan
activities ultimately led to rumors of satanic

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.310
rituals at these meetings, there is no real
evidence to support this.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.531
In fact, the Order’s founder, Dashwood,
even devoted himself to rebuilding, at no

00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:43.640
small expense, a local church at this time,
the nearby St. Lawrence.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.730
For the members, the whole charade was simply
a bit of farcical fun, rather than its constituents

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.980
actually being devoted to pagan ideals.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.790
Or as member MP John Wilkes put it- “a set
of worthy, jolly fellows, happy disciples

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.240
of Venus and Bacchus, got occasionally together
to celebrate woman in wine and to give more

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.270
zest to the festive meeting, they plucked
every luxurious idea from the ancients and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.330
enriched their own modern pleasures with the
tradition of classic luxury.”

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.690
All good things must come to an end, and the
Friars’ fun began to wind down around 1762

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.420
when Dashwood was appointed to be the Chancellor
of the Exchequer- a job he was terrible at.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.030
For instance, a tax he imposed on cider, the
Cider Bill of 1763, so incensed the populace

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.720
that they nearly rioted; he resigned shortly
thereafter.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.250
By this time, he had also become a member
of the House of Lords as Baron Le Despencer.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.790
In addition to Dashwood becoming respectable,
another key member of the Order, the aforementioned

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.880
member of Parliament John Wilkes, was forced
into exile after he was caught printing Essay

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.760
on Woman, a parody of Essay on Man, by Alexander
Pope.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.569
The former’s blasphemous, libelous and debauched
content was considered illegal at the time,

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.580
landing Wilkes in more than a little hot water.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.420
And if you’re wondering, it’s generally
thought today that fellow Order member and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.260
MP Thomas Potter, son of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, was the actual author of the work,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.750
not Wilkes.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.650
Together with many other brothers having left
the area or died, this Hellfire Club became

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.861
defunct by 1766 and the caves stripped of
their former scandalous adornments and other

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:21.199
evidence of the noteworthy group’s former
meetings there.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.500
The Brotherhood was not the first Hellfire
Club, and that one was founded in London in

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.160
1718 by Philip, Duke of Wharton.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.360
Its membership was secret although many believe
Wharton’s closest friends, including his

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.639
cousin the Earl of Hillsborough, the Earl
of Lichfield and Sir Ed.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.969
O’Brien, were a part of it.

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.699
The first Hellfire Club also began the practice
of ridiculing religion as a practice of the

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.249
meetings, and according to some reports, the
members dressed-up as characters from the

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.850
Bible for their get-togethers.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.930
Unusually, women and men were admitted to
club membership as equals, and meetings were

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.990
held in a number of places, including The
Greyhound Tavern and at members’ houses.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.610
Having too much fun, apparently, after Wharton’s
political rivals convinced him to, King George

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.029
I enacted a law against “horrid impieties,”
in 1721, which pretty much ended this first

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.039
Hellfire club, losing Wharton his seat in
Parliament in the process.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.650
Undeterred, the next year Wharton became the
Freemason Grand Master of England.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.339
Apparently a popular idea, other Hellfire
clubs have been established through the years

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.830
and these include the Phoenix Society, founded
in 1781 by Dashwood’s nephew Joseph Alderson

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.550
in honor of Dashwood who died that year; this
club has continued through the present day

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.199
at Brasenose College, Oxford.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.099
Other colleges and universities also sport
Hellfire Clubs, including Trinity College

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.610
in Dublin and Maynooth University.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.650
Dashwood’s friend, the famous painter William
Hogarth who is perhaps best known for The

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.659
Rake’s Progress, painted a parody of Dashwood
titled Sir Francis Dashwood at his Devotions.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.340
In the portrait, Dashwood is on his knees
in the posture often used to portray St. Francis

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.870
at prayer, but instead of a Bible, Dashwood
peruses an erotic novel, and instead of contemplating

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.729
the mystery of the Trinity, Dashwood contemplates
the image of a naked woman.

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.759
Dashwood lived a colorful life, spending most
of his young adulthood travelling Europe after

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.289
ascending to his Baronetcy at the age of 15.

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.490
At one point he impersonated the King of Sweden
in order to seduce the Tsarina; on another

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:51.829
occasion, he was expelled from the Papal states.
