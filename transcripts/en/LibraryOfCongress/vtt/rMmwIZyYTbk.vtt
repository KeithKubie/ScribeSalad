&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: OK.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.600
Before we start, I do again
want to do a little shout-out

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.960
to our ASL interpreters who
have been doing a super job here

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.260
today [applause].

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.910
So, it's always important.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.210
All right.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.960
I want to just introduce you to
Gayle Osterberg who is director

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.690
of communications at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.990
Doesn't that sound great?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.060
So, Gayle, welcome [applause].

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.370
&gt;&gt; Gayle Osterberg: Thank you.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.500
Thank you so much.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.430
You run a very tight ship over
here on the Fiction stage.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.730
Welcome everyone.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250
It's so nice to see you all.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.770
We spend such a long number of
months preparing for this event,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.020
and it's always so exciting to
be here and to see you all come

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.120
out and celebrate books
and reading with us here

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.420
at the convention center.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.720
So, thank you.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.960
Thank you for coming and
spending your Saturday with us.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.660
I also want to take a
minute and say thank you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.980
to our many sponsors who not
only make it possible for this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.230
to be a free event, but
just to have the event.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.170
It just wouldn't take
place without all

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.150
of their generosity and support.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.960
Many-- Thank you [applause].

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.680
Thank you.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.270
Many of them have booths
down on the expo floor.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.670
So if you happen to be down
there and see Wells Fargo,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.480
the Washington Post,
IMLS, NEA, NEH,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.550
many others, tell
them thank you.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.100
That would be so wonderful.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.020
And if you're interested
in donating yourself,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.250
it's very easy, loc.gov/donate.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.780
No contribution is too small
and it will go a long way

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.090
to helping us make sure
that we can continue

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.720
to have this event each year.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.600
Now, our next guest and I
want to tell you this first

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.100
so that you write it down and
remember our book signing is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.910
from 4:30 to 5:30 in line
number 7, so make a note.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.430
She is the best-selling
author of 30 novels,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.560
many telling rich
stories of the south

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770
with wonderful women
protagonists

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.550
who are navigating
life's changes.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.640
Her most recent novel, Before
We Were Yours, is a compelling

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.310
and heartbreaking story inspired
by actual events that occurred

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.530
in Tennessee over three decades
in the early 20th century.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.020
Everyone is reading this book.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.770
How many of you have
read this book?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.250
I posted a picture of
it when I was reading it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.370
at the beach earlier
this summer,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.520
and all of my friends
immediately commented.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.140
And I thought I would share just
a few of them because I think

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.680
that they were very on target.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.130
That was one of those
books I wish it didn't end.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.870
This book gave ways to thousands
of children who deserve

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.020
to have their story told.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.240
This took a heartbreaking
story and made it something

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.530
that I could not put down.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.520
My view is that this writer
not only has revealed something

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.070
troubling about our
collective history

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.020
but she's also told
us a beautiful

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.420
and inspirational story
about second chances.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.950
I loved this book and I can't
wait to hear her talk about it.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.290
Please welcome to the
stage for her debut,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.510
National Book Festival
appearance, Lisa Wingate.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:23.540
[ Applause ]

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.120
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate:
Well, good afternoon.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.280
This kind of room is
sort of my dream room,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.570
a room full of book people.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.280
I have been a book nerd
since Ms. [inaudible] told me

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.340
in the first grade that I
would be a writer somebody.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.580
And I just believed her because
first grade teachers don't lie.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.030
There's this thing when
you're young and you want

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.820
to be a writer and I've been
writing stories all my life.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.140
But there's this thing you dream
of you think you will grow up

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.580
and you will become a
writer and it will be

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.690
like what you see on TV.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.130
And on TV, writers drive around
in Ferraris and they live

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.420
at the beach and they
go in the grocery store

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.980
and everybody knows
who they are.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.050
And you never actually
see them writing.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.850
They just go around
being writers.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.890
But you get into this business
and you find out it's not really

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.900
like that for most people.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.380
Most people are going
to work long and hard

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.580
to achieve even a
full-time living in writing.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.450
It's a tough business.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.590
But you always dream that
you will have that book,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.990
that book that just
blasts out into the world

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.040
and takes on a life of its own.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.270
And this book for me has
been that dream book.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.570
It's not my first book.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.270
This is actually novel
number 30 for me.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.930
So, I'm kind of an
example of how

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.860
to achieve your dream
in 30 novels or less.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.200
But-- Thank you [applause].

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.380
This story, my agent put
the call out on a Wednesday.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.630
By Thursday, 10 of
the biggest publishers

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.280
in New York wanted to see it.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.510
By Friday, we had what for
me was a huge preempt offer

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.860
on the book if we would sell it
then and not send it to auction.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.260
My agent said I don't
think we should take it.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.790
I think we should let it go to
auction I think will do better.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.590
So, I kind of squeaked out.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.510
OK, if that's what
you think is best.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.620
And those things always happen
on a Friday so that you can fret

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.470
about it all weekend,
which I did.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.940
And-- But by Monday, it was
going to auction and it sold

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.250
to Random House Valentine,
a division of Random House,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.680
and ended up with
the most amazing crew

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.790
of the longtime publishing
professionals

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.640
who have worked together for
years and have been fantastic

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.630
to this book and never ending
in their support of it.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.820
So, the book came
out a year ago, June.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.420
And the first week it came out,
it landed just a few slots off

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.520
of the New York Times list.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.890
And unfortunately, that's
not like horseshoes.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.840
You don't get points
for being close.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.280
So everyone was saying to me,
Lisa, your book is doing great.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.780
But what they weren't
saying was,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.800
but it landed just
off the Times list.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.390
And usually, you figure your
first week, maybe your first

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.130
and second week are really
your only chance because that's

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.760
when all your presales
come in and whatnot.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.230
So, it didn't make it then.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.530
It didn't make in the end.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.830
We thought-- It was
still steaming along.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.630
We thought maybe July 4th week
because nobody puts out a lot

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.740
of their heavy duty books
on the 4th of July weekend.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.130
It didn't make it then.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.610
This book carved its way

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.950
onto the New York Times
list eight weeks out,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.810
which hardly ever happens and
it wasn't because Oprah called

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.220
or anything like that.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.060
It was just people.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.800
It was just the power of
word of mouth that was people

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.620
who read it, who told
someone, who crammed it

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.230
into someone's hand in
an airport bookstore,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.970
who told their book group
we should read this.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.210
It was just people who shared.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.640
It was people.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.840
So if you think it doesn't
matter that we still talk

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.500
about stories, that we
still talk about things

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.920
that impassion us,
things that matter to us,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.190
things that grab us by the
heart and soul, it does.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.790
There is still incredible power
in just the sharing of story.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.080
And if you really think about
it, National Book Festival,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.910
we could have an
international book festival

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.540
and we could invite
people from every culture.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.870
And if language were
not a barrier,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:14.290
we would all have this one
thing in common from a chalet

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.290
in France to a city in
America to a village in Africa

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:24.770
that we all process the world
through story in some way.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.490
We all catalog our
history through story.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.560
And so for me, that is
such a magnificent thing

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.890
and it's the best thing now.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.110
I'm thrilled we didn't make the
New York Times list our first

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.560
week out because there's
no better way for me--

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.910
for this dream to have
come true than for the book

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.630
to make it eight weeks out

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.860
and it has actually
stayed there ever since.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.950
So, whatever else happens--
Thank you [applause].

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.970
Whatever else comes
to this book,

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.840
it's already been
the dream for me.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.510
I'll answer a few
of the questions

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.490
that people ask me
the most about it.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.200
And then whatever you
want to know, I would love

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.150
to answer any questions
that you have.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.840
People always ask and
that you always get

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.200
in the press interviews
when a book is coming out,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.710
does any of this come
from your own life?

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.060
Did you experience any of this?

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.440
Is this your family history?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.920
And this story-- And in case
you don't know the story,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.350
it's based around
a piece of history

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.370
that was America's
largest adoption scandal

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.600
which took place from the '20s
through the '50s in Memphis

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.580
under the direction of a
woman named Georgia Tann

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.810
who ran the Tennessee
Children's Home Society

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.990
and pretty much ran
adoption within Memphis

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.040
and within the state of
Tennessee and specialized

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.470
in providing children for
the wealthy and the famous,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.380
many Hollywood celebrities,
Joan Crawford,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.140
June Allyson, Dick Powell.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.580
Politicians adopted through her.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.570
The-- While many of the
children were orphans,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.260
many of them were
also just stolen

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.130
from poor families
to fill orders.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.500
So, that is the history
this book is wrapped around.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.950
I don't have-- I'm not
close to the history

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.910
of it on the adoption side.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.080
There aren't a lot of adoptions
in my family that I'm close to.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.850
My brothers used to try
to tell me I was adopted.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.980
We look so much alike that
there would be teachers,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.720
substitute teachers would look
at me say, you have a brother

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.910
in the sixth grade, don't you?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.650
And I hope you're
nothing like him.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.090
So as a little girl not
only is that frightening

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.520
but it's not a confidence
builder

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.050
to be told you look
like your brothers.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.440
But where I felt the
closest to this story or one

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.930
of the places I felt close to
it, because this story is--

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.690
because the true history is in
Memphis, it's a river story.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.280
If you know anything
about Memphis,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.770
if you've ever been there,
if you spent time there,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.300
Memphis is a river town.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.110
The river is the heart and
soul and lifeblood of Memphis,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.170
the showboats, the
paddle-wheelers.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.770
That's the identity of Memphis.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.910
And I do know about
life on a river.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.650
As a kid, I grew up
in this little sort

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.940
of horseshoe-shaped
1970s neighborhood

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.410
where every house sat on
an acre or two or five.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.160
And right through the middle

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.170
of this neighborhood ran
this little dirt bottomed

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.200
Oklahoma creek.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.880
And it was just a
trickle on a summer day.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.230
A couple times a year when it
really rained, it did come up

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.800
and flood some of
the low-lying houses.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.550
But to us kids, that creek
was every river from the Nile

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.120
to the Amazon to the Congo in
darkest Africa and, you know,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.840
we were Tarzan and Zorro
and Laura Ingalls Wilder

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.240
and Swiss Family Robinson.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.420
And if we had read it in
a book or seen it on TV,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.800
we went down in that creek
and we played it by the hour.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.460
And nobody had to tell us
kids how to make up a story.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.150
We just did it because we were
bored and there was nothing

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.670
to do back in those days
unless it was Saturday morning

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.870
and there were cartoons on.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.450
And so, we go down that creek.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.860
And about once a week, we
would make up our minds

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:34.390
that we were going to go farther
down that creek than any kid

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.690
in the history

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.510
of the neighborhood
had ever been before.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.360
And we'd pack a little backpack
and we'd set out in the morning

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.540
and we journey and journey
and we'd stop at some point

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.650
and have our lunch
and we'd go on.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:52.140
And we'd go until we thought
we had traveled for miles.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.670
And we would start to tell
each other scary stories

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.310
about how far away
from home we were

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.380
and maybe we wouldn't
get home before dark,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.880
and maybe our mamas would have
to call the police to come look

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.020
for us and kidnappers might
get us and we might need

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.690
to defend ourselves
from wild animals.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.870
And we'd get about half
scared and then it would get

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.480
to be sort of supper time.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.760
And the thing about that
creek was it had an arbor

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.060
of trees over it.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.600
You couldn't tell time of day

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.140
down there unless
it was high noon

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.860
and the sun was coming
straight down.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.070
You had no cognition
of time of day.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.850
So, it would get toward
evening and a lot of you

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.080
in this room probably remember
what happened when it got to be

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.510
about supper time
back in those days.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.510
The mama calls, would go
out across the neighborhood.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.860
So, we would be down in the
Congo looking for lost tribes

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.800
of men or out on the prairie
with Laura Ingalls Wilder

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.100
and we'd hear Laura,
Lisa, Annabeth.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:52.940
And we would come up out of
that creek and we were still

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.890
in someone's backyard
the whole time.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.330
But the thing about it was

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.460
because that creek was its own
little world, because it was dug

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.800
down into the soil, because
you didn't hear voices,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.140
you didn't hear cars, you
didn't hear people up top,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.320
it was its own universe.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.360
You were not conscious of what
was happening above the banks.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.590
And that is exactly the
life these kids are living

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.580
in this story on this
little shanty boat

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.820
that their parents built in
the Mississippi River right

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.640
up until they dock up in Memphis
and their lives intersect

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.340
with what is going on
in Memphis in 1939.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.310
People ask me how did I
come across the true piece

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.640
of history Georgia Tann and
the Tennessee Children's

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.940
Home Society?

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.360
Why did I decide
to write about it?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.920
Why did I put it in a novel?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.590
For me, every story has a
spark and I never know what

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.660
that spark is going to be,
but something will come

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.990
across my mind from somewhere
just a story someone tells me,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.020
something I read in the
newspaper, a historical marker

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.870
when we've stopped to empty
the trash on a family vacation.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.550
I never know, but something
will come across my path

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.200
and it just explodes my mind.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.730
And I think why didn't
I know about that?

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.390
Do other people not know about?

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.860
What more is there to know?

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.520
How did that happen?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.720
The spark for this story I came
across completely accidentally.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.590
I had never heard
of it, which is odd

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.750
because I've spent quite
a bit of time in Memphis

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.980
but nobody had ever come
to me and said, you know,

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.820
if you want a great story to
begin to, there was this woman

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.600
and she sold all these
thousands of kids into adoptions

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.630
and made herself wealthy
and I had never heard of it.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.730
But where I felt closest to it

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.990
and where it most exploded
my mind and drove my passion

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:59.930
when I came across the truth
was as a parent because as much

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.830
as I love writing and sharing
stories and storytelling

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.560
and meeting people and
all of the things that go

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.670
with this life of story,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.760
my favorite job was still
being a mom to two little boys.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.780
And as I'm digging into the
true history of Georgia Tann

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.480
and the Children's Home Society,
what happened to these kids

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.100
who were plucked up out of
their lives through no fault

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.190
of their own and dropped
in an orphan house

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.320
and they don't know what's
going on, why they're there,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.280
what's happening, there's
no counseling going on,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.520
they literally are in their
lives one day and not the next.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.340
And as I'm studying up on this
after I first heard about it,

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:46.980
I'm thinking of my own kids at
two and four and six and eight,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.160
these two little pieces of my
heart and how innocent they were

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.080
and how helpless they were.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.800
And what if-- how would
they have handled something

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.100
like this.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.010
And I'm thinking of myself
as a parent, you know,

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.240
what if one day someone took my
kids and I couldn't find them

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.330
and I couldn't help them
and I couldn't get to them

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.540
and I maybe didn't even
ever know where they were

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.490
and perhaps I never
saw them again.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.730
What would that be like?

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.180
And to just put you in that
head space a little bit,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.990
imagine with me now, it's the
'20s through the '50s some time,

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.940
you are a person who desperately
wants to be a parent.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.970
You come from a culture
where within about a year

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.480
of the wedding, everybody
has babies,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.510
it's just it's what's done,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.620
not less than nine
months from the wedding.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.390
My grandmother's first baby
was born nine months to the day

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.380
and we came that close to
being the town's scandal.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.740
But it never happens for you.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.650
And you maybe apply
to adopt maybe

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.580
through your Catholic orphanage
or your children's home

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.520
in the town or children services
or whatever is around you.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.060
And maybe because you have
a divorce in your history,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.610
maybe just because you're older
by that time, maybe because you

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.590
and your husband are different
religions, for whatever reason,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.730
there's never a child for you.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.030
You get to a certain age.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.530
It becomes clear there never
will be a child for you.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.810
And then all of the
sudden, you hear--

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.550
maybe you hear it from a
friend, maybe you read about it

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.300
in a newspaper, maybe you open
your Saturday evening post

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.500
in 1930 and there's this big
splashy article called the

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.720
baby market.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.960
And it is about this place where
you can go and you're going

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.590
to be able to make that
dream happen just like that.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.940
And not only that, you're going
to be able to pick hair color,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:58.520
eye color, age, gender,
one child or two,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.870
would you like them to look
alike or maybe one that looks

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.810
like your husband and
one who looks like you.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.690
I mean, it sounds like
science fiction, doesn't it?

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.830
Little Stepford children all
made to order just the ages

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.240
and colorings and everything
that somebody wants.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.500
But it's the '20s
through the '50s.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.600
So, these are not
robot children.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.260
They're real children.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.020
And while some of them really
are orphans who need homes,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.830
the dark side of this
history is where the rest

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.060
of them are coming from.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.400
And to put you in that
head space a little bit,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.900
imagine the other
side of the story.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.300
You are a parent who's
down on your luck.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.740
It's maybe the depression
and you've lost your farm,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.250
dad's lost his job,
maybe dad has died and--

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.800
or ran out and left the family
and you're a woman with a bunch

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.090
of kids to take care of,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.790
or maybe you're just a young
girl who's gotten yourself

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.060
in trouble with a man
who will not marry you.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.650
But for whatever reason, you're
desperate, you're hungry,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.740
you need medical
care or something.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.320
You go to a free milk and
bread clinic, a doctor's office

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:14.500
that advertises care for
people who can't pay, whatever.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.650
The people there are
very nice to you.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.830
They tell you they will
solve all your problems.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.360
They want you to sign a few
forms which you maybe can

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.220
or can't read because you
quite well may be illiterate.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.910
You think all your problems
are solved when you live there.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.090
What you don't realize is that
you have just been spotted

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.310
by a doctor, a nurse, a worker

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.650
in an orphanage,
a police officer.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.220
You have just crossed
the radar of Georgia Tann

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.990
and the Tennessee
Children's Home Society.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.550
And it is very likely that
someday soon, you will turn

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.550
around and your children
will be gone.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.970
And if you even know
what happens to them,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.260
if you can muster the resources
to go to court and try to fight

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.230
for them, you will simply
be told they have been given

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.860
to people who can give
them much more than you can

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.030
and you will not be
getting them back.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.070
That is the startling
reality of what happened,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.140
all these decades in Memphis.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.350
When I started to dig into
it, I had questions of course

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.610
as you probably do, how could
something like this happen,

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.600
how could it be allowed to go
on, why didn't people stop it,

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.430
and that was really the
basis for starting the novel.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.870
I wanted to-- I found
that it hadn't been talked

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.170
about very much.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.160
I found that the state of
Tennessee had worked very hard

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.570
and a lot of people in powerful
positions around the country

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.870
who were in some way tied

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.030
to these adoptions had
worked very hard to quiet it

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.490
down after the scandal
finally broke.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.150
I wanted to know what
happened to these families

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.190
and what became of them and
how she got away with this.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.520
How did I come across it?

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.300
Completely by accident.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.040
I was up late working one night
and had left the TV playing

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.370
but I turned off the sound
because it just gets lonesome.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.990
When you know you're pulling
deadline, you're going to be

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.250
up all night and even the dog
gives up on you and goes to bed.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.740
It just gets lonely.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.080
So about 2 in the morning,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.610
Discovery Channel's
deadly women cycled on

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.020
and it was an episode
called Above the Law.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.570
And it was about people who,
because of their connections,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.580
were able to commit
heinous crimes

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.060
and never been prosecuted.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.930
And at that point, it was a
segment showing this big white

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.870
house and the front room was
full of babies and bassinets

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.860
and I just thought, what
in the world is this about?

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.310
And that was my introduction
to the history

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:58.290
that became the topic
for this book.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.530
As I was doing the research, I
came across the fact that some

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.490
of these kids were stolen
from camps on the river,

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.580
that these people who lived in--
they lived in the shanty boat

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.140
on the river which
there were tens

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.160
of thousands living the shanty
boat life during the depression

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.600
and before and after
and it seemed

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.310
like such a fascinating life.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.990
And I started to hear the voices

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.100
of these five little
kids growing up,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.940
these little stairstep
siblings growing up on the river

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.160
and in particular the voice of
the oldest girl Rill who's 12

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.600
when the story starts.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:42.820
And this is what she
experiences as in reality.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.270
It's something completely
random that brings these kids

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.170
across the radar of Georgia Tann

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.620
and the Tennessee
Children's Home Society.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.040
In the novel, it's because
Queenie, the mother,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.700
is giving birth to what is
expected to be child number six

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.410
in this little shanty boat
family and there are problems

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.360
with the birth and that
necessitates a trip

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.470
to the hospital which in Memphis
at that time was all it took

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.510
to bring you across the radar.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.920
This is what happens in the
morning when Rill is waking

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.690
up after being left to care
for the younger children.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:30.370
Chapter 12, Rill Foss
1939, in my dreams,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.040
we're free on the river.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.190
The Model T engine
Briny fixed to the back

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.460
of the boat drives
us upwater easy,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.620
like we haven't got
any weight at all.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.300
Queenie sits up top of the cabin
like she's riding an elephant.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.730
Her head's tossed back,
her hair flowing out from

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.540
under her feathery red hat.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.600
She's singing a song she
learned from an old-Irishman

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.070
in one of the shanty camps.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.330
Well, ain't she pretty
as a queen?

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.840
Briny asks me.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.230
The sun is warm and
the song sparrows sing

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.070
and the fat bass jump
out of the water.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.950
A flock of white pelicans flies

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.260
over in a big old arrow
shape pointing north,

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.710
which means we got the whole
summer still ahead of us.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.450
There's not a paddle-wheeler
or a flatboat or a tug

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.500
or old barge anywhere in sight.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.580
The river is ours.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.800
It's only ours.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.510
Well, and what's that make
you, Briny asks me in my dream.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.640
Princess Rill of Kingdom
Arcadia, I shout out.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.190
And I know I am the
luckiest little girl

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.440
in the whole wide world.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.370
They're in a better place to
be than our Kingdom Arcadia.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:58.040
Briny sets a honeysuckle
flower crown on my head

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.860
and he makes me a princess
for real just like the kings

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.570
in all my storybooks did.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:10.380
In the morning, when I
wake from that dream,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.410
there's still a sweet
taste in my mouth.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.540
It lasts until I open my eyes
and think about why my brothers

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.050
and sisters and me are
all five in Queenie

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.890
and Briny's big bed together.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.880
We're flopped out
across the mattress

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.390
like a fisherman's sketch
all sweaty and slick.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.490
Queenie is not here.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.140
It barely gets through my head
before I know what's pulled me

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.840
from my dream.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.590
My heart jumps up and
I jump up with it,

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.150
pulling one of Queenie shawls

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.950
over my nightgown while
I cross the shanty floor.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.030
It's old Zede on the
other side of the door,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.970
old Zede who's always been
like a granddaddy to all of us.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.470
But even through the
window glass this morning,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.990
I can see that his
white-whiskered face is long

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.540
and sad.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.630
My gut pulls tight
like a slipknot

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.020
as I open the shanty door.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:12.650
Zede's hand feels
heavy on my shoulder.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.390
It's meant for a comfort, but
I want to run away from it.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.030
I want to scat off
somewhere down the riverbank,

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.980
my feet flying so fast,
they barely leave tracks

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.880
in the washed-up sand.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.610
Tears shove up my neck
and I swallow hard.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:38.970
Queenie's babies didn't
make it out, Zede says.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.490
Something inside me
dies, a little brother

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.920
or a sister I was planning to
hold like a new china doll.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.790
Not either one of them, I ask.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:59.520
The doc said no, couldn't
save neither one of them.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.940
Said it wouldn't of made no
matter if'n Briny got your mom

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.090
into the hospital sooner.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:11.010
The babies just wasn't meant
for this world, that's all.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.560
I shake my head hard, trying to
wick those words out of my ears

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.580
like water after a swim.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.640
That can't be true.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.000
Not in Kingdom Arcadia.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.110
The river is our magic.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:31.530
Briny always promised
it'll take care of us.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:37.790
Well, but what'd
Briny say, I ask.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.340
He's pretty broke up about it.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.860
I left him there at the
hospital with your mama.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.550
They got some papers
to sign and whatnot.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:54.310
The docs hadn't told her
about losing the babies yet.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.030
Reckon Briny will when
she's woke up good.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.410
She'll be all right,
the doc said.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.510
She'll be all right.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.060
I hear it again in my head,
but I know it ain't true.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.830
Nothing makes Queenie happier

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.230
than a brand-new,
sweet baby to cuddle.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.960
She's birthed all five of us

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.740
without hardly more
than a whimper.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.690
How could she have
lost both of these two?

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:24.390
Queenie ain't going
to be all right.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.690
Not after this [applause].

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.510
Thank you.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:38.890
[ Applause ]

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.020
So in the story as in life, it's
that one little random thing,

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.530
the fact that Queenie goes
into labor near Memphis,

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.840
the fact they dock up there,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.830
the fact that these babies
can't be delivered on the boat.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.190
One of the things that's
happened since the book came

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.490
out I've heard from a lot

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.670
of people whose families
really are tied

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.060
into the Tennessee
Children's Home Society

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.500
who were either adoptees or
family members on the birth side

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.410
who lost children to Georgia
Tann or who are descendants

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.710
of one side or the other.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.380
And, you know, the
ways these kids came

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.210
into those hands are
so completely random.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.230
One of the things I've learned--

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.290
People always ask you what's
your takeaway from a book

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.450
or what do you hope other
people will takeaway.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.580
One of the things I learned
now is learned something

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.930
from the characters in the book
which is weird because they come

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.620
out of your head, you know,
so how do they know things

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.090
that you kind of don't know.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.940
But I always learn
something them.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.170
And one of the things that that
I learned from the characters

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.540
in this story comes from
the modern day character

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.620
because the story is
told in two parts.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.870
So, the modern day part is
told through the eyes of Avery,

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.070
this 30-year-old daughter
of a political dynasty,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.980
senator's daughter in
Aiken, South Carolina

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.820
which interestingly enough
I wrote this book right

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.120
between elections.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.470
Nobody cared about politics.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.720
So now, everybody wants
to know, are they supposed

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.410
to be these people
or those people.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.280
No, they're not any
people that we're talking

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.150
about in politics today.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.220
But there's something
Avery says as she's digging

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.880
into the Tennessee
Children's Home Society

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.630
and how her family might
be connected to it.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:27.060
Her main fear is just was her
family in any way involved

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.980
in the cover up, you
know, were they involved,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.700
were they culpable in
letting this go on?

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.280
Does she bear the sins
of past generations?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.230
And she says to herself
as she's been giving kind

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.040
of a nice answer about
what may have happened.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.930
She says to herself, it's the
things you want to believe

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.230
that you need to look at
the most closely of all.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.990
And now as my lesson to
me, I think in this book is

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.280
that those things that I
want to believe, those things

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.560
that fall easy on my ear, and
they taste sweet on my tongue

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.590
and they fit with everything
that's convenient for me,

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.290
I need to dig into those things.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.680
I need to be bold enough
and true enough to dig

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.930
into those things and
think is this really true,

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.420
is this really plausible.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.410
Thousands of people had this
going on right under their nose.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.110
It was not quiet.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.470
These kids were advertised
in the newspaper

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.560
as perfect Christmas presents.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.320
People knew you could
get a baby in Tennessee

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.590
when you couldn't get
one anywhere else.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:35.190
People knew that thousands of
kids were being sent out state

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.770
and they just believed
what was easy to believe

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:42.150
because they didn't want to
confront what might be true.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.130
So, that was my lesson to me.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.520
I'll finish up with kind of
a fun story and then I'm--

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.670
I want to take any
questions you have.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.110
So in a book, you never know

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.320
with the research what
will be tough to research.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.550
And it's never what you think.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.550
So in this book, one of the
tough things was just propulsion

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.520
on the river, how are
the boats getting around,

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.900
because it's the end of
the steam era, it's--

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.600
we're almost to World War
II, gasoline is getting big.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.310
And I needed them to
have a motorized skiff,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.110
a little jon boat type
of thing with a motor

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.500
so they can get Queenie
across water to the hospital

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.800
and so they can go up current

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.030
in the Mississippi
River and whatnot.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.490
And so, I asked my two little,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.100
not little anymore,
fishermen I raised.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.970
What kind of a motor would
be on a jon boat in 1939?

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.810
And surprisingly, they
could not tell me that.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.700
So, I did a little research
and I found this one

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.020
that was called a water witch.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.550
And I like that, water witch.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.350
I just thought that sounded
powerful and kind of antique

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.990
and it was sold in the series
catalog, that water witch.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.910
So, I put a water witch on
the back of Zede's boat,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.270
and they use it to take Queenie
across water and whatnot.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:03.360
And so it turns out
as I'm working,

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.220
a water witch is the hardest
kind of motor to research

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.810
in the entire world
as far as I can tell.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.400
I can't found out how fast can
it go, how do you start it,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.760
how do you steer it,
can it go up current

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.060
in the Mississippi river.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.530
I can't find out anything.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.360
So, I even go to the motor
museum/convenient store

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.290
in Hot Springs, Arkansas to
see if I can see a water witch.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.670
I can't find one.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.260
So, I do what you do
when you're a writer

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.780
and you don't really want
to give up your water witch.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.640
I-- You just fudge it.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.660
So instead of saying how
they start the water witch,

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:43.540
you say something like, and
the motor roared to life.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.840
So, I do that.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.140
I send it in.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.440
It's an editorial.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.010
People in-- Editors in New York
really don't know how you start

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.020
a water witch either in 1939.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.270
So, it's all going fine.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.110
I go for a writer's
weekend with my favorite--

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.020
one of my favorite writer
friends, Judy Christie,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.750
and we're down on Caddo Lake
in Texas and it's a beautiful.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.640
So, we're out on the porch
and Judy is very organized.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.480
So, she's got our
time all divided up.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.200
In this hour, we're going to
brainstorm this book plot.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.070
In this hour, we're going
to talk about the bookmark.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.750
And in this-- So, she's
got our day lined out.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:24.390
Meanwhile, in a cabin next
door, Sam the fisherman is bored

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:25.690
because it's the
middle of the day.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.280
It's too hot to fish.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.660
So, we're out on our deck.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.190
Sam sat on his deck.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.030
Y'all come on over,
I've got iced tea.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.330
All right.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.630
Well, Sam, we're working.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.930
We'll get over there later.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.230
We go out on the dock.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.530
Sam is out on his dock.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.930
Y'all come over, I've got a
swing and it's shady over here.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.170
So, this goes on the whole trip.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:47.860
And by the end of the trip, Judy
says, look, Lisa, we have to go

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.930
over and see Sam's cabin
because we don't want

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.550
to hurt his feelings.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:56.010
So, we go and I walk into this
place and I have my iPhone,

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.970
and I am like a photographer
at a Paris fashion shoot.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.230
Because remember, I have
raised little fishermen.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.960
I want to show them what
kind of a shack they can have

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.260
if they stay in college
[laughter]

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.550
because this is a
fisherman's shack deluxe.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.780
The cabin-- The handles
are little bobbers,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.110
little red and white bobbers.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.760
The lamps are fishing poles.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.200
The shades are fishing hats.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.790
The toilet paper is
on a fishing reel.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.480
The toilet seat is clear Lucite

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.130
with fishing lures
embedded in it.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:35.110
So, I take all these pictures.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.790
I turn to head out and
there in the bay window

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.670
that overlooks the
lake is Sam's big desk.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.590
And right beside the
desk is this motor

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.410
on a stand all nicely repainted.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:53.450
And I get a little
closer and I see the W.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.610
And I get a little closer
and I look at Sam and I say,

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:02.180
is that a water witch?

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:08.230
And Sam says, yes, that's
my 1939 fully restored water

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.530
witch [laughter].

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:15.870
So, I take two lessons from that
because I believe everything

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.610
in life comes with a lesson.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.280
One is that never give
up on your research

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.520
because you never know when it's
just going to fall in your lap.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.510
And secondly, you should
never ignore your neighbors.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:39.300
[ Applause ]

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.600
So, questions?

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.080
What else-- What can I
tell you about the story?

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was lucky enough to
get an advance copy of the book

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.470
and loved it, but was
very compelled to it

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.180
because my grandmother was
actually put in an orphanage

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.450
when her father was killed
in an automobile accident

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.040
and her mother could
not care for five kids.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.100
So, I was wondering if you
had discovered other incidence

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.130
or have heard of other incidence
similar to the one in Tennessee

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.260
because my grandmother lived
in South Carolina at that time.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.060
So, I'm just wondering if this
has brought out more history

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.630
that you have perhaps come

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.130
across that you didn't
know about.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.430
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: Yes.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.020
So, has it brought
out more history

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.980
where there are other
places where this went on?

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.280
There certainly were.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.450
In fact, not too far from
there in Augusta, Georgia,

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.830
there was a lawyer who was kind

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.240
of doing the same
thing even afterward.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.290
And even in recent
times, there are states

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.150
that have their adoption
laws so loosely regulated.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.330
It's very easy to bring
in a woman from Russia

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.190
or some other country and call
her a resident of the state

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.630
and then sell her baby into a
very expensive private adoption.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.720
So, similar things still go on.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.900
There were other orphanages
also where this kind

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.230
of thing was going on.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.150
Some of it was a
creature of the time.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.210
Some of it definitely
was a creature

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.980
of some social engineering.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.250
The idea-- Georgia Tann could
say right out in public,

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:34.560
in the newspaper articles
things like if you take them

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.710
from these cows and these
breeders and you place them

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.950
with people of high type and
surround them with beauty

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.260
and culture, they can become
anything you want them to be.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:51.300
She purported the children as
blank slates and basically,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.600
you know, that they--

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.360
people could mold them
into anything they wanted.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.380
And it was a recipe
for very bad adoptions

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.610
because a child is
not a blank slate.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.450
Even a baby is not
a blank slate.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.150
And certainly a five, six,
seven year-old who knows that he

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.760
or she has a family
is not a blank slate.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.340
So in some ways, yes, it was
a creature of a time period

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.410
when people really had no
other options sometimes

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.600
but to leave a child
in an orphanage.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.950
And the idea was sort of that
the parents were almost--

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.400
or that the adoptive families
or the families who took them

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.250
in were almost doing them
a favor by taking them

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.570
in which sounds like you
have some of that history

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.620
in your family and
probably looked at the story

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.920
in a different way
because of that.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.850
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: People have
asked me a lot how she got away

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.750
with it.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.770
And really, she was not someone
anyone would have suspected.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.410
Part of the reason she got away
with it is because she came

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.140
from the upper crust of society.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.210
She was a judge's daughter.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:19.830
She drove around in a limousine.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.130
She lived in a mansion.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:25.300
She was not anyone, anyone
would have suspected of needing

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.650
or wanting to be
selling children.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.950
Yes?

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.470
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, this is more of a
question about craft I guess.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.460
But you're such a
prolific writer.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:42.180
I guess I wanted to hear some
of your insights about kind

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:48.970
of the hard work that it takes
to, you know, produce each book

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.870
from start to finish and
what you've kind of learned

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.950
over the years about the
process side of things.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.880
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: OK,
so the writing process.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.050
Writing process is a
tough thing because it's--

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.390
so individual is
different for everybody.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.390
And so, I always feel a
little bit like when I talk

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:11.220
about writing process,
I want to first say,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.720
but if this isn't
the way you do it,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.070
that's fine because
there is no right way.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:20.430
For me, I'm not an
advanced plotter so much.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.270
I have a rough three-act
structure

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.820
of the story in my mind.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.220
And I always start out--
When I have a piece of truth

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.440
that I want to talk
about, I always start

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.230
out with just thinking
who would tell that story,

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.340
what eyes are you going to
look at the story through.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.710
And then, I have sort of a
rough three-act structure

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.510
that comes partly
just from imagination

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.340
and partly from the research.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.590
And if you're curious
about that, there's--

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.050
I used to teach a class in
three-act structure and--

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.140
because every story is
structured that way.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.690
And if you're curious about
it, you can go to my website

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.400
which is [inaudible], but
the materials are on there.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.480
And that's helpful to me.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.290
But a lot of the story is going
to develop out of the research,

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:07.070
out of the time as
I'm writing it.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.120
Sometimes, I will
literarily quit

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.780
for the day thinking one thing
will happen and I'll wake

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.910
up in the morning with
something else in mind.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.220
So, I never know.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.990
I write a certain
amount everyday.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.940
Different people are different.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:26.160
But if I sat around and waited
to-- until I felt inspired or--

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.310
yeah, I just would never write.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.170
I mean, for me, it's
a little like sitting

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.500
down everyday to
take the ACT test.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.010
It's just hard.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:39.620
And I think-- And what foils
most people is finding some kind

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.160
of a groove you can get into.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.210
You know, we all have our--

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.920
we're kind of like
baseball players.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.970
You know, different ones
do different things,

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.180
kind of get in the
groove to get up to bat.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.090
And I think for a writer, that's
one of the most valuable things.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.670
You just find what gets you
in your groove and then figure

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.970
out how you're going to get back

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.180
in the groove day
after day after day.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.970
I'm a fairly fast writer.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:06.400
I can turn out a book in four
or five months and manuscript.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.910
And, you know, that's
not right for everybody,

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.590
but it's what works for me.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.090
&gt;&gt; Hi. I actually
have two questions.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.020
One, what are you
working on now?

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.750
And then in your research,
did you have an opportunity

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.360
to meet anyone from the
Children's Home or descendants

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.450
of people who had
been in the home?

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:28.750
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: OK.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.050
So, what am I working on now?

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.430
I am working on a new book.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:36.230
I just-- Just recently, I
had actually kind of started

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.670
and finished the manuscript
about something I had in mind

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.440
for a while to write about.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.660
And then few months ago,
history lightning struck again.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.700
And I just came across another
piece of history and thought,

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.720
oh, you know, this is really the
story I would want to do next.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.870
I feel such a passion
for this story.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:59.390
And I would tell you about
it except I'm not allowed to.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.130
But every story has its own--
you know, it's the same process.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.470
It's discovering the history
and how to make it work

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.470
within the story and I
am so excited to bring

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.950
to light this piece of history
because it's another one

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.250
that involved so many people.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.320
I'm like how do people
not know about this?

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.360
What was the second question?

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.310
&gt;&gt; Did you have an opportunity
in your research to meet any

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.390
of the people who
have been in the home

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.750
or descendants of those?

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.050
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: To
meet the real people.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.830
So, yes. So, I had met a couple

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.030
and interviewed them
when I started out.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.230
And it was odd because neither
one of them, they were OK

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:39.380
to talk to me but they
didn't want me using their

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.680
name anywhere.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.980
In other words, they
didn't want to be outed

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.570
as having been adopted from
the Tennessee Children's

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.870
Home Society.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.170
So, the book comes out.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.280
I start hearing from adoptees
and families of adoptees

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.340
and families who are still
searching for family members

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.130
that they've never found.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.660
And then people start asking me,

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.540
would you ever get
a reunion together

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.740
of people who are connected to?

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.120
So last summer of last--

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.190
this past June, I had
an event in Memphis.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:14.110
And so, we did have a
reunion and got about 25

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.510
of them together and they
ran the gamut from people

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.820
who were adopted as babies,
people who were old enough

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.900
to remember, four daughters
of a woman who was stolen

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.820
with her six siblings
out of the front yard

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.830
of their little shanty house.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:35.180
So, it was quite an experience
and we ended up doing a couple

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.840
of presentations where they
got on panels and talked

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.730
about their experience.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:44.030
And not many of them had
reunited with family and things.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.920
And so, it was an
amazing experience.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.680
Oh, I think we're
on last question.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.560
We got just a couple
more minutes.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.440
&gt;&gt; Well, I was just going to ask
you about that my mother was one

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.050
of the children from the
Memphis Children's Home.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.760
And she was constantly trying

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.690
to find her mother every
day before she passed away.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.680
So, you were just saying
that there are stories

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.980
of reconciliation between
children who were adopted

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.980
and then were able to
reunite with their parents.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.630
Can you say what that was like?

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.360
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: There are many.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.450
There was a woman in Memphis,
Denny Glad [assumed spelling],

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:22.820
who is kind of like the Trent
Turner character in the book

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.620
who helped a lot of
adoptees find their paperwork

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.350
and find their families.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.010
One of the things
that made it hard was

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.170
that so much paperwork
was altered.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.700
So a lot of times
when people got--

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.740
they fought for years
to get the records open

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.760
because Tennessee had
sealed all the records.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.070
Once they did, a lot of times
the records were incorrect

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:42.820
and didn't help.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.610
So, Denny Glad was instrumental,

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:46.550
not only getting the
paperwork opened,

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.530
but in helping people read
between the lines and going

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.430
around and checking court docket
books and all kinds of things.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:58.060
And she did help reunite many
who found their birth families.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.090
Often with wonderful results,
sometimes not, you know.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:03.390
It just depends.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.920
And there are many who--
like your mother, who--

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.010
they'll just never know.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.090
That's one of the reasons
why everybody doesn't reunite

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.810
in the novel because I felt like
it wasn't fair because there are

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.930
so many people who
will have to just live

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.540
with those questions
all their lives.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.840
&gt;&gt; OK. Thank you.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.720
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate OK.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.020
Yes?

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.170
&gt;&gt; Yes. I was wondering, I
have noted some timeliness

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:34.920
of your book subject to
current events and wonder

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.080
if you saw an increase in sales

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.850
after the children
were separated

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.660
from their parents
at the border.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.960
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: So,
many people-- Yes.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.650
Many people have equated
what was happening

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.820
with Tennessee Children's Home
Society with the children--

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.410
the border crisis
for the children.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:56.550
Oddly, that was coming up in
June right as I was meeting

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.770
with these people whose life
experience is tied into this,

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:04.620
and what I learned
from them is--

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.340
and even the children and
grandchildren of these people,

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.310
what happens to children, the
damage done to children travels

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.240
down through the generations.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.630
The people-- The descendants
will tell you this experience.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.530
Even people who were
adopted as babies

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.910
and had wonderful
adoptive parents,

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.780
they will tell you this
experience being tied

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.780
into Georgia Tann and the
Tennessee Children's Home

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.340
Society and what happened
informed everything

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.220
about my mother's
life or everything

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.000
about my grandmother's life.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.040
And so, you know, I think, yeah,
the lesson to learn from it is

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.380
that whatever adult
battles are going on,

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.280
children should never
pay the price for them

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.580
because that goes
down [applause].

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.880
One minute.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:59.480
&gt;&gt; I was wondering about the
famous people, all the people

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.780
that had adopted these--
what ever happened to--

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.180
or do they have to give the map.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.420
I mean, when it was found

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:12.770
out that they had adopted these
children, it must have been hard

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.070
for the children as well.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.420
And what ever happened
to them, were they ever--

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.980
I mean, is it criminal
or what happened?

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.210
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: Nobody
was ever prosecuted.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.190
Georgia Tann died as the
scandal was breaking.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.950
So, she was not prosecuted.

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.780
But that made it very easy
for everyone to just say, oh,

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.300
it was just her and she
had everybody fooled

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.360
because she was dead
at that point.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.470
So, you know, she was
a very easy scapegoat.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.880
No children were sent back
to their birth families.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.530
Of the 22 who were in custody

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.070
of the Tennessee Children's
Home Society at the end

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.790
when the scandal broke,
only two were given

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.540
to their birth family, back
to their birth families

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.510
and the rest were adopted out.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.760
&gt;&gt; What about June Allyson and--

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.850
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: They-- None of
those children were sent back

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.280
to their birth families.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.100
The records were quickly and
quietly sealed and life went on.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.670
&gt;&gt; And we only know now
that that's what happened.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.120
I mean, did anyone know at
the time that June Allyson

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.250
and Joan Crawford had
adopted these children or?

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.660
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: You know,
some of them did in adult life,

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:20.610
go back and find their birth
families back in Tennessee.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.280
And not all of the
children were stolen.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.640
A lot of them were children who
had been given up by families,

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.530
who couldn't raise
them or whatever.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.310
&gt;&gt; And so, there was no
embarrassment for June--

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.610
for these famous people?

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.910
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate: No.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.630
It was in the press a lot,

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.610
but they just all said our
adoption was legitimate

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:45.530
and we didn't pay anything but
the normal fees and that was it.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.130
&gt;&gt; Lisa Wingate:
Thank you [applause].
