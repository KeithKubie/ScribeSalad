00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.299
Ah, theme parks.

00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:02.659
Don’t ya just love ‘em?

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.050
They’re great places to eat $12 hot dogs,
see countless kids on leashes, and….

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.850
pass kidney stones?

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.730
Hey peeps, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.249
You may have heard of kidney stones and how
painful they are.

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.720
Chances are, a few of you have had to suffer
through them already because ten percent of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.960
people will have a kidney stone at least once
in their life.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.539
One of these unfortunate souls claimed he
passed his stones while riding a roller coaster!.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.010
Researchers followed up on his claim and found
that the bumps and jolts of a roller coaster

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.480
can help kidney stones make their way through
the body, with a 64% chance you’ll pass

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
the stone!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.550
Crazy, right?

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.579
But what exactly are kidney stones and how
do they get in your body?

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.219
Kidney stones, also known as nephrolithiasis,
are small, hard mineral deposits formed in

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.660
the kidneys that pass through the urinary
tract and leave the body through the urethra.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.030
For those of you that don’t know, *whispers*
that’s where your pee comes out.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.760
They typically occur when some of the minerals
in your pee become highly concentrated.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
See, your urine has over 3,000 different compounds
in it, including salts and a wide variety

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.250
of minerals.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.840
When the amount of fluid gets out of balance
with the minerals, or when your urine lacks

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
the right substances to break them up, they
may clump together, forming a kidney stone.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.440
One of the most common types is formed when
a compound called calcium-oxalate becomes

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.130
highly concentrated.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.570
These are aptly named calcium stones.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.430
Kidney stones, in general, vary in shape,
texture, color and size.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.850
They can be as small as a grain of sand, as
big as a golf ball, smooth, jagged, or even

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.850
sharp.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.510
I don’t know about you guys but I definitely
don’t want a sharp, golf ball sized object

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.290
coming out of my urethra!

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.960
Most kidney stones are passed out of the body
in a few days, but they can sometimes take

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
weeks.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960
Ouch!

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.630
The buildups can cause excruciating pain in
your side, back and lower abdomen, frequent

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.770
and painful urination, nausea, and bloody
urine.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.300
Some people have even said that passing a
kidney stone is more painful than childbirth!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.100
The amount of pain you’ll feel is pretty
dependent on the type of stone.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.950
Smaller ones can easily be passed with the
help of lots of water and some pain medication.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.100
But more serious stones may not come out that
way.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.289
Sometimes they’re too big to exit the urethra
and sometimes they’re wreaking too much

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.780
havoc on the kidneys and urinary tract to
be left alone.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.300
Stones that can’t be passed naturally will
need to be broken up by shock waves, surgery,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.450
or a scope that’s inserted up the urethra.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.660
So obviously the best thing is not to get
these bad boys at all.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.110
One of the main causes of the buildups is
not drinking enough water, which allows the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.580
salts and minerals to build up and stick together.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.590
Your diet can also make a difference.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.130
Certain foods, like spinach, nuts and chocolate,
have a high concentration of calcium oxalate.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.330
And medical conditions like gout, urinary
tract infections, and certain metabolic disorders

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.470
can increase your likelihood of getting the
stones.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.890
Even your genetics could play a part because
kidney stones can run in families.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.770
So if your gramps has had ‘em, be sure to
keep an extra eye out for any symptoms.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.590
But if you get stuck with them anyway, maybe
just take a quick trip to a theme park to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:18.300
speed up the process.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.000
Have you had kidney stones before?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.420
Was it as painful as it sounds?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.090
