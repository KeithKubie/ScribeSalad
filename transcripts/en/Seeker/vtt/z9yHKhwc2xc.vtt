00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.409
Shhh you hear that?

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:10.590
Yeah I don’t either… but it’s making
me feel creeped out.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.320
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.390
The world is loud and noisy.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.130
And it seems to be only getting noisier.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.330
Obviously exposure to loud noises can cause
hearing damaging.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.460
But some studies like one published in the
British Medical Bulletin, show that it cause

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.240
a range of ill health effects, like anxiety
and stress, and another study showed it may

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.610
even raise blood pressure . And that’s just
the sounds you can hear.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.469
There’s a whole world of sound that’s
below our range of hearing that can also be

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.469
damaging.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.149
Infrasound typically describes sound below
20 hertz.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.760
Usually, it’s too low for humans to pick
up, yet some animals communicate in this range.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.399
Like elephants vocalize in a low rumble that
we can’t hear.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.620
But infrasound can be artificial too: loudspeakers
and public address systems, industrial machinery,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.870
that kind of thing, can kick out sounds that
are too low in frequency for humans to hear,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.559
but can make us sick.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
A study published in the journal indoor and
built environment found that infrasound could

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.509
be contributing to a condition called “sick-building
syndrome”.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.570
A condition where office workers complain
of nausea, dizziness, migraine, fatigue and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.640
tinnitus with no attributable cause.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.150
Yet this study suggests that infrasound, typically
of about 7hz, might be responsible.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.310
Unfortunately, infrasound isn’t regulated
all that well.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.039
A recent report in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society A questions the idea of what

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.630
makes up “safe” sound levels in a working
environment.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.189
The report suggests that workplace exposure
to both infrasound and ultrasound often exceeds

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.289
current guidelines.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.930
There’s concern too that the guidelines
are too low, and outdated: coming from research

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.219
that’s 40 years old.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.969
And even then the evidence for the guidelines
isn’t strong enough, they are based on the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.299
average response of small group, often of
adult males.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.259
The researchers back then didn’t didn’t
reach any strong conclusions, just preliminary

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.460
guidelines, believing that more research would
be done.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.979
But in the ensuing decades, not much has changed.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.220
So basically the lead author is saying…
“more research is needed”.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.750
But there is evidence that infrasounds cause
more than just headaches.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.290
Some researchers think it might be responsible
for that creepy “haunted house feeling”.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.550
One paper published in the journal of the
Society for Psychical Research suggests that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.180
a standing sound wave of specifically 18.9
hertz is responsible for some of the spooky

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.200
happenings in their lab.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.100
Researchers at Coventry University kept seeing
moving things out of the corners of their

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.590
eyes, their hair kept standing on end, they
felt simply dreadful anytime they were in

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.590
the lab.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.330
But one day they noticed a piece of equipment
was vibrating without an apparent cause, and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.040
discovered that an extractor fan was creating
a standing wave at, you guess it, 18.9 hertz.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.090
When they turned off the fan, one of the authors
described the feeling as “if a huge weight

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.220
was lifted”.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.320
And researchers have tested this on a larger
audience.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320
Literally.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.390
British scientists played music to a large
auditorium filled with people...and slipped

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.950
infrasound into some of the songs.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.740
Some people in the audience said they felt
“uneasy or sorrowful, getting chills down

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.570
the spine or nervous feelings of revulsion
or fear” when the songs contained infrasound.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.570
Spooky right?

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.570
No, it’s science.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.900
But don’t be so put off by soundwaves yet.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.120
Not all of them are creepy! in fact soundwaves
can do some pretty cool stuff!

no reason?

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.990
