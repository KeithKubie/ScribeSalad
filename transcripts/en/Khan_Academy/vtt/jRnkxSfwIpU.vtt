00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.162
- [Voiceover] So we're told
a cupcake requires 35 grams

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.623
of sugar and 50 grams of flour.

00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:07.780
So let me underline that.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.042
"A cupcake requires 35 grams of sugar

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.306
"and 50 grams of flour."

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:15.661
And then they tell us,

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.888
"A muffin requires 30 grams of sugar."

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:19.810
So let me underline that.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.452
"A muffin requires 30 grams of sugar

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.342
and 65 grams of flour."

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:28.768
All right, so what are they
going to ask us to actually do?

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:33.768
"Shawna needs to use up at
least 460 grams of sugar."

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:35.617
So let me underline
this in different color.

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.791
She needs to use up,

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:42.780
"Shawna needs to use up at
least 460 grams of sugar

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.543
"to make cupcakes and muffins,

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:50.360
"and she wants to use at
most 970 grams of flour."

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.137
So let me use another color.

00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:54.375
"And she wants to use

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.955
"at most 970 grams of flour.

00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.984
"Let's form a system of inequalities

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.399
"to represent Shawna's conditions.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.545
"Let C denote the number
of cupcakes she makes

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.215
"and M the number of muffins she makes."

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.535
All right, "Write an
inequality that represents

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:16.376
"the condition based on the
number of grams of sugar."

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.837
So the condition based on
the number of grams of sugar.

00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:20.822
That's what we underlined here in green.

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:24.758
"Shawna needs to use up at
least 460 grams of sugar

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:27.138
"to make cupcakes and muffins."

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:28.635
So let's see how we can write that out.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.199
So how much sugar she's
gonna use for the cupcakes?

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.835
Well, we're told right over here

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:38.480
she requires 35 grams
of sugar per cupcake.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.012
So the amount of sugar
that she's going to use

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:41.819
for all of the cupcakes is going to be

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.469
35 grams per cupcake,

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.919
let me write that a little bit neater,

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:50.994
35 grams per cupcake times
the number of cupcakes.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:52.535
So this is how much sugar total

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:53.920
she's going to use on the cupcakes.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.777
35 grams per cupcake

00:01:55.777 --> 00:01:57.519
times the number of cupcakes.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:58.830
And then how many grams of sugar is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.829
she going to use for the muffins?

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.459
Well, that's going to be 30
grams of sugar per muffin.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.502
So plus 30 grams

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:10.380
of sugar per muffin

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.516
times the number of muffins.

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.281
So times M.

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.336
So this is the total
sugar from the cupcakes.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.437
This is the total sugar from the muffins.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.725
And so if you add them together,

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.036
this is a total sugar that she's using

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:24.241
and we're told that she needs to use up

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.842
at least 460 grams of sugar.

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:28.641
So everything here is in grams.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.323
So this has to be greater than or equal.

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:35.723
She needs to use at
least 460 grams of sugar

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:37.243
to make both of these.

00:02:37.243 --> 00:02:37.765
So that's it.

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:39.996
We can just set up the
inequality that represents

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.700
the condition based on the
number of grams of sugar

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.637
which is this condition right over here.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:47.297
Now let's see, this next question.

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:50.280
Let's see, "Write an
inequality that represents

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.923
"the condition based on the
number of grams of flour."

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.345
Well, that's what we underlined
in orange right over here.

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.274
She needs to use no at
most 970 grams of flour.

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:02.597
So no more than 970 grams.

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:05.697
So how would we express
that as an inequality?

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.532
Well, how much flour is she
going to use for the cupcakes?

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:11.312
Well, she used 50 grams
of flour per cupcake.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:15.274
So 50 grams per cupcake
times the number of cupcakes.

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:17.933
That's how much flour she's
going to use for the cupcakes.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:19.779
And then for the muffins,

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.068
she uses 65 grams of flour per muffin

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.452
times the number of muffins.

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:29.332
So this is the total amount of flour

00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:31.214
that she is going to use

00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:36.214
and this has to be less
than or equal to 970 grams.

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.373
Less than or equal to 970

00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:41.615
and we're done.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.652
And so you could actually,
if you wanted to,

00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:47.694
you could say, "What pairs of C and M

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.357
"satisfy both of these inequalities?"

00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:52.493
And then you could say,
"Okay, that's the combination

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:55.035
"of the number of cupcakes
and muffins she can make

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.275
"in order to satisfy
her actual conditions."
