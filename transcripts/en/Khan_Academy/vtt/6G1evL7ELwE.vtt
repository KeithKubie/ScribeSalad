00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:02.411
- [Voiceover] I don't think
it's any secret to anyone

00:00:02.411 --> 00:00:05.622
that water is essential to life.

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.547
Most of the biological,
or actually in fact

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.665
all of the significant
biological processes

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:11.437
in your body are dependent on water

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:13.459
and are probably
occurring inside of water.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.860
When you think of cells in
your body, the cytoplasm

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.120
inside of your cells,
that is mainly water.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.858
In fact, me, who is
talking to you right now,

00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:24.320
I am 60% to 70% water.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.388
You could think of me as kind of this big

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:29.335
bag of water making a video right now.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.722
And it's not just human
beings that need water.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.850
Life as we know it is dependent on water.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.125
That why when we have the search for

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.422
signs of life on other planets

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:40.206
we're always looking for signs of water.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.224
Maybe life can occur in
other types of substances,

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:47.947
but water is essential
to life as we know it.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.518
And to understand why water is so special

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:52.578
let's start to understand
the structure of water

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:54.912
and how it interacts with itself.

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:58.766
And so water, as you
probably already know,

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:03.540
is made up of one oxygen
atom and two hydrogen atoms.

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:08.068
That's why we call it H2O.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.928
And they are bonded with covalent bonds.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:12.884
And covalent bonds, each of these bonds

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:14.994
is this pair of electrons
that both of these

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:17.699
atoms get to pretend like they have.

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:19.763
And so you have these two pairs.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.221
And you might be saying,
"Well, why did I draw

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:22.732
"the two hydrogens on this end?

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.671
"Why didn't I draw them on
opposite sides of the oxygen?"

00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:30.061
Well that's because oxygen also
has two lone electron pairs.

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.249
Two lone electron pairs.

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.325
And these things are always
repelling each other.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.633
The electrons are repelling
from each other, and so,

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.906
in reality if we were looking
at it in three dimensions,

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:42.849
the oxygen molecule is kind
of a tetrahedral shape.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.178
I could try to, let me try
to draw it a little bit.

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:48.427
So if this is the oxygen right over here

00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:50.730
then you would have, you could have

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.153
maybe one lone pair of electrons.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.542
I'll draw it as a little
green circle there.

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:57.702
Another lone pair of electrons back here.

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:00.013
Then you have the covalent bond.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.425
You have the covalent bond to

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.953
one hydrogen atom right over there.

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:11.288
And then you have the covalent bond

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:12.639
to the other hydrogen atom.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.139
And so you see it forms
this tetrahedral shape,

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.473
It's pretty close to a tetrahedron.

00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:21.165
Just like this, but the
key is that the hydrogens

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:23.596
are on one end of the molecule.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.999
And this is, we're going
to see, very very important

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.244
to the unique properties, or to the,

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:32.278
what gives water its special properties.

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:35.010
Now, one thing to realize
is, it's very, in chemistry

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.602
we draw these electrons very
neatly, these dots up here.

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:40.220
We draw these covalent bonds very neatly.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.795
But that's not the way
that it actually works.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.389
Electrons are jumping around constantly.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.974
They're buzzing around, it's actually

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.293
much more of a, even when
you think about electrons,

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.808
it's more of a probability
of where you might find them.

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:54.062
And so instead of thinking
of these electrons as

00:02:54.062 --> 00:02:56.614
definitely here or
definitely in these bonds,

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.754
They're actually more of in this cloud

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:00.645
around the different atoms.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:03.228
They're in this cloud that
kind of describes a probability

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.823
of where you might find them as they buzz

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:07.121
and they jump around.

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.785
And what's interesting about water

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:13.245
is oxygen is extremely electronegative.

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:16.809
So oxygen, that's oxygen
and that's oxygen,

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.789
it is extremely electronegative,
it's one of the more

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.785
electronegative elements we know of.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.894
It's definitely way more
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:27.606
And you might be saying, "Well, Sal,

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.553
"what does it mean to be electronegative?"

00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.989
Well, electronegative
is just a fancy way of

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.863
saying that it hogs electrons.

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:39.631
It likes to keep electrons for itself.

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:43.686
Hogs electrons, so that's what's going on.

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:46.414
Oxygen like to keep the
electrons more around itself

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.176
than the partners that it's bonding with.

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:51.226
So even in these covalent bonds, you say,

00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:52.811
"Hey, we're supposed to be
sharing these electrons."

00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.491
Oxygen says, "Well I still want them to

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.347
"spend a little bit more time with me."

00:03:56.347 --> 00:03:58.540
And so they actually do spend more time

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.543
on the side without the hydrogens

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:03.022
than they do around the hydrogens.

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:05.642
And you can imagine what
this is going to do.

00:04:05.642 --> 00:04:09.512
This is going to form a
partial negative charge at the,

00:04:09.512 --> 00:04:11.659
I guess you could say,
the non-hydrogen end

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.568
that is the end that has, that's
well I guess this top end,

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:16.039
the way I've drawn it right over here.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.963
And this Greek letter
delta, this is to signify

00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:20.485
a partial charge, and it's
a partial negative charge.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:21.985
Because electrons are negative.

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:23.421
And then over here,
since you have a slight

00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:24.958
deficiency of electrons, because they're

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.935
spending so much time around the oxygen,

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:31.492
it forms a partial positive
charge right over there.

00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:34.791
So right when you just
look at one water molecule,

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.546
that doesn't seem so interesting.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:38.626
But it becomes really
interesting when you look at

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:41.091
many water molecules interacting together.

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:45.283
So let me draw another water
molecule right over here.

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:49.411
So it's oxygen, you have two hydrogens,

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.117
and then you have the bonds between them.

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.879
You have a partially
negative charge there.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.302
Partially positive charge on that end.

00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:00.227
And so you can imagine the partial,

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:02.978
the side that has a partially
negative charge is going to be

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:05.940
attracted to the side that has
a partially positive charge.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.699
And that attraction between these two,

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.017
this is called a hydrogen bond.

00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:15.093
So that right over there
is called a hydrogen bond.

00:05:15.093 --> 00:05:16.948
And this is key to the behavior of water.

00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:19.050
And we're going to see
that in future videos.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.900
All the different ways that hydrogen bonds

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.593
give water its unique characteristics.

00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:25.909
Hydrogen bonds are weaker
than covalent bonds,

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.627
but they're strong enough to
give water that kind of nice

00:05:29.627 --> 00:05:32.756
fluid nature when we're
thinking about kind of normal,

00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:35.529
or you could say, normal
temperatures and pressures.

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.278
This nice fluid nature, it
allows these things to be

00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:40.586
attracted to each other,
to have some cohesion,

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:43.532
but also to break and reform
and flow past each other.

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:46.186
So you can imagine another
hydrogen bond with another

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:49.802
water molecule right over here.

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:52.774
So put my hydrogens over there.

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:57.194
Put my hydrogens, your
bonds, partial negative,

00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:00.941
partial positive right over there.

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:03.486
And so we'll see in future
videos, hydrogen bonds,

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:05.807
key for water flowing past itself.

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:08.824
Key for its properties to

00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:10.953
its ability to take in heat.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.862
Key for its ability to
regulate temperature.

00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:16.966
The key for its ability is
why lakes don't freeze over.

00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:20.564
It's key for some of
it's properties around

00:06:20.564 --> 00:06:22.911
evaporative cooling and surface tension

00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.461
and adhesion and cohesion,
and we'll see that.

00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.126
And probably most important,

00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:29.265
and it's hard to rank of these things,

00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:31.152
if we're thinking about
biological systems,

00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:33.654
this polarity that we
have in water molecules

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:35.023
and these hydrogen bonding,

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:37.448
it's key for its ability to be a solvent,

00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:39.547
for it to be able to have

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:43.091
polar molecules be
dissolved inside of water.

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:45.242
And we'll see that in future videos.
