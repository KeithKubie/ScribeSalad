know it's not it's not the career of the
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.950
know it's not it's not the career of the
career of choice so we actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
career of choice so we actually
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.190

so that there are three points that are
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980
so that there are three points that are
borne out of this index which are which

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
borne out of this index which are which
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719
borne out of this index which are which
are fantastically interesting to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
are fantastically interesting to
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730
are fantastically interesting to
understand the first is that I think

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
understand the first is that I think
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.219
understand the first is that I think
there's worldwide consensus that

it's fantastically important to
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440
it's fantastically important to
understand also that the vast majority

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
understand also that the vast majority
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749
understand also that the vast majority
of people that we polled said that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
of people that we polled said that
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219
of people that we polled said that
actually performance should

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229

China actually the state as it teaches
 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.130
China actually the state as it teaches
is quite higher because they equated it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140
is quite higher because they equated it
 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.580
is quite higher because they equated it
closely to that of being doctors I think

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
closely to that of being doctors I think
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.180
closely to that of being doctors I think
that's a fairly important comparison and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
that's a fairly important comparison and
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.369
that's a fairly important comparison and
the third point that comes out is with

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379
the third point that comes out is with
 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.940
the third point that comes out is with

you've got science but this I think

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
you've got science but this I think
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.879
you've got science but this I think
completes the entire data set when you
