00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.189
Oh man, that guy is such a pain in the mesentery,
you know what I mean?

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.570
What’s up DNews friends, Trace here.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.570
Last year was crazy.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.449
I mean, at the start of 2016 we had, like,
50-some organs tucked into our bodies according

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.179
to Merck, but by the end of 2016, we had one
more -- the mesentery!

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.250
That’s right, science has just reclassified
the mesentery from a group of tissues to an

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.250
organ!

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.100
You likely have no idea what the mesentery
is, which is fine.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.080
Just know it’s a fold in the lining of your
abdomen (as if it wasn’t crowded enough

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.719
in there) and it suspends and attaches intestinal
organs to the abdominal cavity; it also transports

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.670
lymph and blood to the gut.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.980
One of the first to describe it was Leonardo
da Vinci, and throughout history, doctors

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
have debated whether each part of the mesentery
is individual -- each intestine had it’s

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.480
own -- or if it was one complete thing.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.880
In a new study in The Lancet Gastroenterology
&amp; Hepatology, researchers finally lit the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.630
mesenteric candle, outlining and clarifying
the mesentery’s structure, from a bunch

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.880
of individual tissues, to one whole organ.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.530
They claim that while it’s specific function
(aside from suspension) is unknown, it is

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.560
definitely all one thing.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.299
Once the study was published, I guess that
makes it official, reversing “over 100 years

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.510
of anatomy.”

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.750
Woo, celebrate!

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.610
I say, “I guess” because there’s not
exactly some worldwide regulatory group for

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.610
organs.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.360
We just… decide that something is a system,
organ, tissue, or group of cells based on

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.420
what it’s made of!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.520
We all know what cells are, the most basic
form of life.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.070
But, when enough cells with a similar function
and construction get together, they become

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
a tissue!

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.700
Then, if different tissues work together:
that’s an organ!

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.700
Organs together?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
A SYSTEM.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.890
Want some examples?

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.460
Red blood cells are cells, but taken together,
they’re a connective tissue!

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.649
But the platelets, antibodies, white blood
cells and whatnot… those need blood vessels

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260
to move through the body.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.479
Blood vessels are collections of different
tissues, and thus are organs, and, of course,

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.950
the heart is an organ.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.060
Taken together, these organs and tissues form
part of the circulatory system.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.069
So, this new organ which “hasn’t been
acknowledged much as of late,” according

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.940
to the researchers, has now been defined as
a group of tissues working together inside

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.940
the gut.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.940
Which is exciting!

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.980
Though, the “discovery” of new body parts
does happen.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.370
In 2015, a study was published in Nature detailing
a possible new part of the body: a lymphatic

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.870
vessel system that drains the BRAIN ITSELF.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.540
Previously thought to not exist, it was right
there in the mouse brain from the study…

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.500
we should have it too, they figure, but we
just didn’t know these “central nervous

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.190
system lymphatic vessels” were there…

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.400
Chances are, the mesentery’s designation
isn’t going to be life-changing for you,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
but we’ll see!

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.221
The incredible thing about organs, is that
once we realize something is an organ, we

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:03.580
can diagnose disorders and diseases using
the organ as a basis.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.129
For example, understanding that there are
central nervous system lymphatic vessels in

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.420
brain could help people suffering from “MS,
Alzheimer's or autism!”

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.049
So, once researchers determine exactly how
the mesentery normally works, then doctors

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.590
can figure out what is abnormal, and begin
to build the field of mesenteric science -- which

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.510
could have implications for abdominal diseases.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.640
In fact, it’s already started.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.810
The lead researcher convinced Gray’s Anatomy
of the Human Body, (Grey’s with an A) that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.530
the mesentery was an organ last year when
they updated their manual.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.330
So now, med students may only know it as a
single organ…

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.310
And history marks yet another tiny turning
point in the twisting bowels of science.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.439
Which sort of begs another question…

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.209
why isn’t all scientific knowledge free?

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.950
Lucky for you, we looked into that here.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.520
What do you think about our new organ?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Sexy?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.580
Keeping you in suspense?

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.800
Really got you in the gut?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800
I'll stop.
