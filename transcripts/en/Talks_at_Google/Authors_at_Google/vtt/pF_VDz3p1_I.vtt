00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.580
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Thanks everyone for tuning
in today, whether you're on video conference

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.940
or live here at the campus.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.680
Couple logistics before we get started.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.580
My name is Rachel O'Meara.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.530
I'm a Wellness Champion for the Optimize Your
Life series.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.431
I work out of San Francisco, but as part of
the Optimize Your Life series, this is a global

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:28.430
initiative that helps to keep all Googlers
healthy, whether it's mental or physical types

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.430
of health.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.600
So, we're really excited to have Mark Thornton
here today to talk.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.950
There will also be time at the end for questions.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.479
So for anyone who has a question in the audience,
you can use the mic that will be in the center

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.809
aisle, or if you're on video conference, if
you can wait 'till the end that would be great.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.579
And we'll take your question that Mark will
repeat.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.469
So, a couple things to talk about just before
I hand the microphone over to Mark.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.809
There is a couple things to be aware of as
this is one of the talks of the Health series.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.830
You can find out a lot about what's happening
for future talks at go slash O-Y-L.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
And they also have a Google+ page you can
follow.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.690
There's also, anyone who's interested, can
also sign up to be a fellow Wellness Champion.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.570
And all that means is you're an advocate to
help bring people in to speak that you feel

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.480
would be worthy to come in and share their
insights.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.920
And you can sign up at go slash goto slash
wellness champions.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.310
So, first a bit about Mark.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.240
A couple points I want to highlight.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.150
And I have to admit, this is not how I would
have introduced him when I met him at Burning

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
Man last year.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
[laughter]

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.150
But it's worth plugging.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.710
So, Mark is the former Chief Operating Officer
at JP Morgan private bank.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.720
And he's also the best-selling author of "Meditation
in a New York Minute."

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.140
We do have some copies of that available here
just for five dollars.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.420
We do have a limited supply.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.801
So if we run out, they are taking names for
future purchases that, I think, we'll get

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.230
the book in about two weeks.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.610
And that's for the Mountain View folks.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.849
And Mark also works with clients like Wharton
Business School, Harvard, and INSEAD.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.420
So without further ado, please welcome Mark
Thornton.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.420
[applause]

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.640
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Oh, good.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.330
Thank you.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.599
Can you all hear me OK?

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.620
OK, great.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.639
Thank you.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.330
So, a quick question.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.360
How many of you are brand new to meditation?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.569
Just raise your hand.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.569
Wonderful.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.700
How many of you have a very serious, rigorous,
committed daily practice?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.840
Great.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.579
How many of you tried meditation before and
found it just incredibly frustrating?

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.579
Great.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.579
Thank you.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.180
So, my name is Mark Thornton.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.659
And really, the purpose of today is to share
with you as much information as I can.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:02.140
I think when I was 26 years old and I'm from
Australia originally and I was in London,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.639
and I would describe myself as a hyped-up,
caffeine-addicted, stress junkie.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.209
I was so stressed that I was grinding my teeth
at night and I had to wear a mouth guard.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.230
I also started to lose my hair.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.999
So, I was 26 and thinking, "I'm gonna be bald
and toothless by 30."

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.999
[laughter]

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.260
I'm glad you all laughed at that.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.959
Nothing wrong with bald and toothless, but
it really prompted quite a deep inquiring.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.110
At the same time in my life, my father had
just been diagnosed with cancer.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:51.260
And he linked very much the last three years
of job stress with his illness.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.510
So, I was gonna be bald and toothless by 30.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.159
There was a chance I might not make it to
30.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.199
So, I went on a particular search.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.540
And my search had to end up in India.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.359
But there, I was passionate about trying to
find spiritual techniques that I could work

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.659
with every single day.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:20.080
So, as a COO, I didn't have five minutes to
spend with my girlfriend, let alone low disposition,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.780
mantras, candles, ambient whale music, all
that sort of stuff.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.780
So I was very fortunate.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.390
I met a teacher and he taught me practices
that I could do anywhere, anytime, and that

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:43.440
were really as powerful as taking retreats
and living in the Himalayas and those sort

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440
of things.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.950
So, I want to share as much of that with you
as possible.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.300
Does that sound interesting?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.060
No one wants to talk about tantric sex or
something like that?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060
[laughter]

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.400
That's the advanced course and it's very,
very expensive.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.620
But fun.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.450
Very fun, too.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.450
[laughter]

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:10.010
So, I come bearing some good news because
meditation has gone from weird and funky and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.530
we now have on your side some really incredible
examples of institutions that are on board

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.340
with this revolution.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.980
So, I teach at places like INSEAD.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.570
I teach at Wharton Business School.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.060
I teach at Harvard Law School.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.550
Elite firms like McKinsey &amp; Co. are now introducing
meditation as a key practice for associate

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.280
partners and partners.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.370
If you look at the top five cancer hospitals
in the US, all of them mention meditation,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.240
not as a cure, but as a complementary alternative
practice.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.220
It's the same with the top five heart hospitals.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.810
And in terms of science--I won't go into this
too much--but we have like a thousand plus

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.340
studies on the scientific benefits of meditation.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.640
And I'm almost a bit embarrassed because I
was asked by the US Army to come up with a

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.030
list of the benefits of meditation and the
science behind it.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.030
And as I was compiling all the data, I felt
like a fantasist.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.930
Like, I was saying, "Well, not only can it
reduce stress, it helps you with decision-making,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.980
[chuckles] reduces your mental activity, helps
you with focus.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.810
It helps you with all this stuff."

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.610
Pages and pages of scientific benefits.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.900
So, there's a lot of stuff there.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.950
Typically, what I teach in companies, the
results of staff and teams typically get is

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.820
the capacity to do more with less.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.740
They have an idea of better resilience, a
greater capacity to focus on what's really,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.950
really important to them.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.440
Also, the sense of a master mindset, like
no matter what throws at you, you have the

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.840
capacity, the poise, the balance, the alignment
to really cope with it in a masterful way.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.750
If you don't do this, it's more of the same--a
sense of job fatigue, a sense of the in-tray

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.650
is too, too big and I can't source it, complete
energy depletion.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.030
So, this is some of the benefits.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.150
There was a famous study by Towers Perrin.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.830
It reviewed 90 thousand employees for different
companies, different industries.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.860
And they found out that 20 percent of them
were fully engaged, going above and beyond.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.740
Forty percent were enrolled, which means capable
but not really at peak performance.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.440
And 38 percent were disengaged and disenchanted.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.080
So, it means that if this was a football team,
two would be really engaged, nine are not,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.800
and four are either on the sidelines or looking
the other way.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.400
So, I wanna share with you some signs.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.110
And the signs are emerging and they are becoming
more and more encouraging.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.740
The signs used to be confusing.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.740
[laughter]

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.610
But we have some really interesting things.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.650
Check this out.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.960
From Harvard Business Review, look at what
is the number one top article that people

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
were reading.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.670
"A Roadmap to a Life that Matters."

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:11.550
And increasingly, peak performance leaders
and teams are focusing on questions of not

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.740
just delivery, not just execution, not just
efficiency, but how do you create a life that

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.730
matters for you and your team and your company
and the planet.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.550
The other exciting news you have on your side
is a strange ally, a strange institution of

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.600
the US Army.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.201
The US Army has just introduced a program--it's
been going on for a year and a half--and it's

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:38.800
called Comprehensive Soldier Fitness.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.380
With more than a decade at war, the Army is
finding that soldiers are coming back and

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.560
PTSD is a really, really big issue for them.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.590
So, the Army has now redefined what it means
to be Army strong.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:09:05.020
So to be Army strong, they're defined as five
key domains--family, physical, social, emotional,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.230
and spiritual.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.490
So every member of the Armed Forces is going
through a psychometric testing to identify

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:23.190
each soldier's capacity in depth and strength
in those five different domains.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.560
The remedial 25 percent are given additional
training to boost up their strength.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.830
And the top five percent become teachers.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:36.460
I saw this when I was teaching at Fort Hood,
which is the largest Army base in the US.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.130
I was teaching a leadership team.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:43.250
And the guy showed me this and I said, "I've
been trying to share this message to Wall

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.560
Street people for years."

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.360
And here, the US Army is coming out and saying
soldiers need to have emotional intelligence.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.880
Soldiers need to have spiritual dimension
as a key part of how they define their strength.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.330
So, you probably know this, but one of the
things I think when I talk with top teams

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:09.880
is your next step at Google, your next outbreak
of top performance, it's not gonna come from

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.990
working harder.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.020
If you're at Google or JP Morgan, you are
already working more hours than you can possibly

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.430
handle.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.089
So, working harder is not gonna get it.

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:25.180
And the New York Times wrote an article that
said that the cost of job stress in terms

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:34.060
of absenteeism and lost productivity, health
costs, was more than a trillion dollars annually.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.560
The National Institute of Occupational Health
and Safety said that the health costs alone,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:46.200
which means people actually end up in hospital
or seeing a medical practitioner, is 200 billion

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200
dollars.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.320
That's roughly the economic cost of Hurricane
Katrina every year.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.900
Another study said that 50 percent of Americans
suffer from anxiety.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:03.840
And there was a great long-standing study
from the State of Massachusetts Department

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:12.290
of Education Health and Welfare, which said
that America's number one killer, which is

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:20.850
heart attack, happens most frequently on one
day of the week.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.070
Have a guess what day that is.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.070
&gt;&gt;Audience: Monday.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.070
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Very good.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.550
And not only one particular day, but most
frequently at one specific time on that day.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.740
Have a guess what time that is.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.880
[audience murmurs in response]

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.710
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Nine AM.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.920
Exactly.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.240
So work, literally, is killing us.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.390
Which means we've mastered two speeds--fast
and crashing.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.050
[laughter]

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:52.360
The second myth that I tell every top leader
is the myth that stress equals results.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.529
This is a big one.

00:11:55.529 --> 00:12:02.240
And I was talking with the managing director
from a pharmaceutical company in London last

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.170
week.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.430
And she argued this point with me.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:14.600
It turns out, I found out that she's actually
on six month's leave because of burn-out.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.290
This myth is so prevalent that even if you
have hit the wall and you're burnt out, that

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.820
you're still addicted to this fantasy that
stress creates results.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:32.580
So stress, the definition of stress, is a
physical, chemical, or emotional factor that

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.350
causes bodily or mental tension and may be
a factor in disease causation.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.149
Awesome.

00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:45.839
You don't want this stuff to be what gets
you your results.

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.800
The opposite is true.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:55.980
The less stress you have as a peak performer,
more happiness, more results, better health.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:03.100
And the key insight for this is if you speak
to any peak performing athlete, you say, "Tell

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:10.529
me about the link between stress and results,"
they'll look at you strange and say, "Well,

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:11.910
there is no correlation."

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.460
Or, they try and reduce the stress.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.600
I'll give you an example.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.740
I was talking to a friend of mine who is the
coach for the Swedish Winter Olympic team,

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.110
Runne Gustafson, and we did some trainings
together.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:28.150
And he said that he trained specifically cross-country
skiers.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.830
What he noticed was when he reduced the signs
and symptoms of stress, lower heart rate,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:39.870
lower respiratory rate, those sort of things,
his skiers could ski further and faster.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:47.020
Now, the idea is if you're already at peak
performance, you've already got enough effort

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020
on top of that.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:55.339
The only people I know who need more stress
is maybe the United States Postal Service.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.339
[laughter]

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:58.690
They probably need more stress.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.550
[laughter] But not folks at Google.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.600
And the mistake is always been that--.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.890
It's like looking at a car.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.270
And people have just noticed that when the
car is revving and there's a lot of effort

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.910
with the engine, there's a lot of exhaust
coming out.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:22.490
And I've concluded that the exhaust is running
the car.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:30.150
It's like if you're studying leadership and
you go and you peer into the toilet of a leader,--

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.860
[laughter]

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.900
and you stick your finger in and you go--.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.089
[Mark Thornton sniffs]

00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:38.310
This is what's driving the leader.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.310
It's not.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.310
Stress is a by-product.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.310
It's a waste product.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:46.480
You have complete permission now to reduce
it.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.630
The mistake is thinking that this is driving
this.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:57.360
So, what gets results from peak performing
athletes is not effort, but optimum effort.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:05.120
If you think about a tennis player at Wimbledon,
the difference between a winning shot and

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.020
a losing shot is infinitesimally small.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.830
So, it's that absolute optimum effort.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.640
Too much effort--losing shot.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.950
So, it's optimum effort we're going through.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.089
And I'll talk more about that in a moment.

00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:19.860
The other myth is that meditation is too hard.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.740
We're gonna break that myth for you.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.029
So, meditation is.

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:30.300
So, I also just wanna with you, before I get
into the definition of meditation, is that

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:38.780
I wanna share a story about my--I think it
was probably the worst day in my career at

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.580
JP Morgan.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.300
I'd just been made COO.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.640
We had bought a bank called Robert Fleming
in London.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.010
And pretty much it was a disaster.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.610
We were exactly a year over schedule--a year
behind schedule.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.730
We were ten million pounds over budget.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.310
And the portfolio management trading team
that we'd brought in, they hated us.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.050
They were a conservative English boutique
thing.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.160
And I thought the brash Americans were taking
them over.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.459
So, 40 percent of their portfolio managers,
including the people who are driving the majority

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:22.300
of the revenue, wanted to leave.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.910
So, that was my first day as COO.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.450
So what I did was I took action.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.450
I called meetings.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.810
I shouted when I needed to shout.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.010
I did stuff.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:38.940
But then, someone came to me and said, "How
can you be so calm?"

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:45.180
And I realized with a shock that I actually
was.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.680
That actually, after years of meditation practice,
what I'd learned is to take action from that

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.779
place of center.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.990
Now, I wasn't asleep under my desk.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.110
I wasn't in a Lotus position and I wasn't
avoiding things.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.520
I didn't ask people to light candles.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.760
I used to work on the training room floor.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.079
So, it's a busy environment.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:09.610
So, I share that because there's a real way
in which these practices I wanna share with

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:15.260
you can become an integral part of your every
day.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.250
So, what is meditation?

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:27.650
So, meditation is the effortless resting of
your attention on your center, on your core,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.020
on your heart.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.260
And by heart, I don't mean as in the sense
of your physical heart--the muscle.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.600
I don't mean it in terms of some Eastern practices
about the heart's center.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.870
I mean it in terms of the phrase, "the heart
of the matter."

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.170
To get to the heart of the matter is to get
to the essence.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.960
So, to explain it, I'll share with you a model
of--.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.190
And this isn't specifically true.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.920
It's more like a metaphor.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.950
But it was created two and a half thousand
years ago by an Indian sage called Patanjali.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:09.430
And he shared this model of how you are made
up as a person.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:19.710
I'm not sure if you can see this up there,
but--.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.650
OK.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.590
So, this is you, a badly drawn you.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.470
But he said this represents your physical
body.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.730
And this is quite a dense quality.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.730
You can see it.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.730
You can touch it.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.470
And this is the outside of the body.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.570
And this is the inside.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.760
What also seems to be true is that if you
close your eyes, what you're aware of is there's

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:59.740
another layer of who you are, which is thoughts.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:06.530
And deeper than that now is there's another
layer of feeling.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:13.260
And there's other different layers.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.170
But as Patanjali said as you drop deeper and
deeper inside now, he said there was a place

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:23.080
that you end up that was that he called the
center.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.970
Now, everyone in this room had many, many
experiences of the place called center, many,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.290
many times.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.850
You've experienced when you've gone for a
walk in nature.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.000
You've experienced it when you've been relaxing
watching the sunset.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.780
Maybe it's an inspiring art.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.990
Maybe you've written a beautiful book.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.050
It's looking at the eyes of the beloved.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.040
It's holding a child--that first gaze you
have.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.679
Maybe it's like that total absorption in a
task that you love doing.

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:59.429
So, I just wanna ask you when you experience
those, what are those qualities that you experience

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:02.170
when you experience that center?

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.340
Let's just call them out.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Love.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.110
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Love.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.110
Beautiful.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.110
Love.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.270
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Peace.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.400
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: What else?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400
Wonder.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400
Gorgeous.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.690
Thank you.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.330
What else?

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.330
Warmth?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.799
Thank you.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:22.799
Yes.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.270
What else?

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.270
Presence?

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.270
Beautiful.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.559
Thank you.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.200
What else?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.490
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#3: Tranquility.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.960
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Tranquility.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.600
Thank you.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:48.950
So, it is this body's passionate belief that
what the world needs most now is leaders and

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:56.090
people who can access these qualities wherever
they are.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:03.290
And this, in my humble opinion, is business
critical, mission critical.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:09.050
If you have access to these qualities that
are already inside you, then nothing has to

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.020
be manufactured or created.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.200
Then, how you lead will be radically, radically
different.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.960
A leader who can connect with the quality
and frequency of love, he will lead his or

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.910
her team differently.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.770
You will ask different questions.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:31.250
You will have different visions about the
future for your team, your company, your planet.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:43.140
So, all of meditation is, is simply pathways
to directly access this unchanging deep part

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.660
of who you really are.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.460
And these pathways that are Buddhist, Zen,
Hindu, Christian, different practices, breath,

00:21:52.460 --> 00:22:00.630
body, mantra, tantra, all these different
paths are simply doorways into the direct

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.210
essence of who you are.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.040
Does that make sense?

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.070
[chuckles] Great.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:17.200
So, I've completely lost where I am.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.630
So, the first thing is this sounds very nice
and wonderful, but how do you build that into

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.890
your every day?

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:36.049
So, the first thing is to, what I call, O-W-F-P,
which is the optimal work flow pattern.

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:42.550
And there really are some incredibly dazzling
slides, which portray this very beautifully.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.020
[chuckles] We just don't have access to them
at the moment.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.020
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#4: It's coming.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:53.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: So, I wanna show you an example
of really how this can happen.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:23:01.210
And the explicit invitation here is that everyone
in this room has at least an hour every day

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.880
that you can be practicing.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.380
Now, does that sound like a lot?

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.540
Good.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.250
It is a lot.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:16.250
But in the "Meditation in a New York Minute,"
what we're doing is we are doing an hour a

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.100
day cumulatively, not consecutively.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:27.500
And what I mean by that is taking two seconds
by the water cooler and breathe differently.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.260
As you're walking from meeting to meeting,
take using those times to shift your breath.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.460
When you're standing in line at Starbuck's,
rather than over-thinking, over processing,

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.520
over-analyzing everything, just listening
to your own mental code of spam, there's a

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.850
way in which you can use those moments, which
I call a "dead time" to really take time to

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.200
connect very deeply.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:24:00.789
And the reason why I'm so excited to share
that is because for years I struggled with

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:05.309
trying to do 20 minutes in the morning, 20
minutes at nighttime.

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:06.570
And it was just--.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.780
I couldn't do it.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.549
So, I kept beating myself up that I wasn't
deep enough.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:12.010
I wasn't committed enough.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.440
I didn't have the willpower.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.340
It turned out, I just had the wrong set of
practices.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:24.460
And my excitement is that when I could do
these micro doses cumulatively up to an hour

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.770
a day, that was as profound as sitting in
a cave.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:34.669
It was as transformative, it was as easy to
access these qualities.

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:42.010
And the reason is that the mind, which is
this code which keeps producing output--and

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:52.770
some of it's genius, most of it's average,
and a lot of it is quite destructive and limiting

00:24:52.770 --> 00:25:01.980
and real spam--it needs to be that constant
interruption throughout the day is what the

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.980
mind needs.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.370
Twenty minutes in the morning is great.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.370
You get peaceful.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.370
And then you have like, 15 hours of sheer
adrenaline rush, caffeine-fueled anxiety.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.110
And 20 minutes at night.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.110
But in this way, we're really trying to break
this up.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:23.490
So, just a visual example of this is the old
approach to doing your job and leading was

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.830
Hamburger Hill.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.830
We're gonna be like the US Marines.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.700
We're gonna take it at any cost.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.940
The new approach is finding a moment of center.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.309
She's a karate person.

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:34.360
I don't know why.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.380
But, yeah.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.090
Taking a moment of calm.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.560
And from that place of center, then you can
take massive action.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.059
Then, you have perspective to move a different
range of movements.

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:48.850
You also become Asian, strangely.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:49.850
[laughter]

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:50.980
Which is--.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.799
I don't know why that is.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:56.710
Really the production values here are not
good.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.200
[laughter]

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.650
So, moment of calm.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.650
Lots of action.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:06.320
And the key thing is returning to that center,
to that place of calm.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.230
So, it's not an "either/or," but it's an "and"
in both.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:19.231
I wanna show you an example of a 70-pound
pit bull versus a cat to show how you can

00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:23.530
have alignment and center in the midst of
intense activity.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.630
[laughter]

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:32.370
How cool was that with the little paws?

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:36.750
But she's completely composed.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:46.289
So, what this means for you is-- this O-W-F-P--means
that you're continually interrupting and continually

00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:47.600
making breaks.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.280
So, there are practices that we can do when
you're talking to someone, you can find a

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.450
way to be more grounded.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.190
When you're presenting in a meeting, you can
find a way to become more centered.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:03.450
Or, as walking to and from meetings, you can
use that rather than just to mentally rehearse

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.380
a whole lot of bad stuff, you can introduce
new programs, new codes that are more supportive

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:14.200
of this type of quality.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.169
I apologize to dog lovers.

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.320
That's that.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:24.360
The other really important thing is with stress,
you are only ever stressed by three things.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.059
That's it.

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:27.059
Period.

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:28.620
The first one is you don't have the skills.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.040
So, you're a newly appointed manager and you
haven't been trained on how to delegate, how

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.900
to do feedback reviews.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.090
The second thing is you just don't have the
resources.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.320
So, you have the skill, but you don't have
the money or time.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.470
For example, with people, to help you deliver
it.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:48.020
But most importantly is the mindset, the values,
the beliefs to really deliver on that.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.220
That's the only three things.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:56.250
Like with sports, the reason why I love the
last set so much is you can have people with

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:02.340
the same experience, same age, background
experience, same skill set, same resources,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.890
radically different results because different
values, mindsets, and beliefs.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:12.110
And this is one of the things that McKinsey
is really teaching a lot on now is how leaders

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:18.150
can mathematically identify and calibrate
their beliefs and mindsets and work out what

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.320
are the brakes and what are the accelerators
to performance.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.539
[pause]

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:30.800
Meditate an hour a day every day.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.880
Cumulative, not consecutive.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.270
So, to really help you, I want to share with
you some meditation accelerators.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.270
Like, things that you can--.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.690
If you wanted to take this invitation, there
are three really interesting things to do.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.890
Number one is to find a teacher.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.440
Find a teacher.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440
Find a teacher.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.810
Find a teacher.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.340
Everything I write about in my book and on
my tapes and CDs, everything I've learned

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.960
largely has come from a teacher.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.630
You can't learn Judo through a book.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.190
You can't learn singing through a DVD.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:11.110
The most powerful transformative experiences
to really accelerate is finding a teacher.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:16.289
The next big one is to create in offices,
circles of practice.

00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:20.520
I hope you're noticing the circles, Google+.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.920
Yeah.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.150
[Mark Thornton laughs]

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.890
But the key here is, and people are doing
this at the stock exchange in New York and

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.590
I've set up crews of people who do this.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.790
And it's just staff get together.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.790
You can play a tape.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:41.030
You can play a DVD of a guided instruction
or a teacher just sharing a practice with

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.030
you.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.030
Very, very simple.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:48.270
The trick is that there's no such thing as
meditation.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.270
There are many--.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:55.490
One of my teachers said, "There are as many
meditations as there are recipes for food."

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.090
They're just organized along different paths--Mexican
food, Italian food.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:05.299
So, rather than have a group that's on meditation,
find the group that you love that loves doing

00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:06.750
mindfulness.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.150
Set up a circle that loves doing mantras.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.460
Set up a circle that loves to--not tantra.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.169
Don't do a tantra circle.

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:16.530
[audience chuckles] Set up circles that are
involved with breath stuff.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:20.360
Start up circles which are based on focus.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.780
Finding the right practice for you and getting
your pod, your crew of people together is

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.730
really important.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.010
The third one is to really experiment 'cause
there are thousands.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.760
Find the one that most moves your heart.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.660
Find the one that most calls to you, that
most has an impact for you.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:46.080
So, the number one block to people enjoying
practice is they are doing a mantra practice

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.299
and it's the wrong tool for them.

00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:54.890
They're doing a mindfulness practice and they're
bored out of their mind.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.120
It's just the wrong tool.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.990
So, I'm trying to encourage you to think there
are literally thousands of practices that

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.990
you can do.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.710
And I only write about 19 in my book.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.560
But there are lots.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.280
And a teacher can really be able to connect
with you and identify "this is the practice

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280
for you.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280
Try this one."

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:22.740
The fourth one is mastering emotions and triggers.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.740
Now, this is a slightly--.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:32.720
This is a stereotypical view that some people
have of men when it comes to emotions.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:46.710
They tend to think men have five emotions,
largely which are, or, or, winning, sports,

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.450
or Brooklyn Decker.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.750
[laughter]

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.960
Now, clearly that's unfair and it's untrue.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:59.580
But any idea how many emotions there are in
this experience of being human?

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.110
Have a guess how many emotions there are.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.029
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Ninety-three.

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:05.789
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Ninety-three.

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:06.789
[chuckles]

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:09.289
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Ten.

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:11.049
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Ten.

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:13.970
Spoken like a true man.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.309
It's ten, that's it.

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:17.309
Done.

00:32:17.309 --> 00:32:18.309
[laughter]

00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:19.309
There's 400.

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:22.500
Four hundred human emotions and combinations
of emotions.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:28.150
So, in leadership teams, the power of meditation
is you get to be very exquisitely aware of

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:34.289
this inner domain here of feelings and become
more sensitive of how they can serve you and

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:36.390
hinder you.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.470
So, moving from emotional intelligence is
to emotional mastery.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.450
And that means awareness, management, and
particularly being aware of what triggers

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.450
you.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.150
So, if you're in a business meeting and you
find that there are people, maybe people that

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:54.600
are really triggering you, there's ways to
deal with that.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.960
Anyone heard of this guy?

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.940
Since he did the rebel yell.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.130
He was just--Howard Dean--who just couldn't
contain the emotions and it leaked out and

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.130
it really damaged him.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.659
This is Mike Tyson after he's fallen from
1998, his peak.

00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:10.840
He was really--.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
This was him.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:18.140
He was walking into some event and he was
so triggered by something that a distant spectator

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.190
shouted, he went on for about four minutes
just shouting at this guy.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.070
And that's not emotional mastery.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.460
George McEnroe.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:32.510
So you may be wondering, "Well, if there's
400 emotions, and I'm a guy particularly and

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.650
I thought there were only five, how do I start
to master that?"

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.350
And luckily, there is an app for that.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.350
[laughter]

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.940
So, the app is called Awareness.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.669
It lists a hundred emotions and different
moods.

00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:52.370
And I've worked with the creator of this to
come up with different meditation practices

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.880
that are linked to the different couplings
of moods.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.299
It’s very cool, actually.

00:33:57.299 --> 00:34:00.380
At the end of each day or hour or week or
month, you get a pie chart.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:07.160
And it gives you cartography of your emotional
universe--your emotional journey through the

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.089
week or the month.

00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:11.160
This person is clearly enlightened.

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.879
They've got peace, love, and compassion.

00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:16.810
Mine's not like that.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.660
[pause]

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:27.119
So, I wanted to finish really with a story.

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:32.619
And thinking about things like focus and superior
focus, and in meditation, we're fascinated

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:33.790
with intention.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:38.470
We're fascinated with what drives focus.

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:43.360
And the experience has really been on meaning--the
reason why we're here.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:49.890
And I was at Fort Hood and I was teaching
some soldiers down there.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:55.580
And I asked one of the soldiers privately,
I said, "What was it like being in Afghanistan?"

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.420
And he told me this story.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.870
And he said that he was a Staff Sergeant in
charge of a platoon.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.480
He was there in Afghanistan for two years.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.619
He said his base was at the bottom of a valley.

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:14.220
And he said every day there were sniper shots,
but they were very well concealed.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.410
They knew they were safe.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:27.089
However, every platoon leader had to take
their team to man an outpost that was up a

00:35:27.089 --> 00:35:31.770
very, very steep hill that was 70, 80 degrees
steep.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.589
It took four hours to walk from the base camp
to the very, very top of the mountain.

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:40.320
So, he walked his team up there.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.609
And on the third day, one of his soldiers
got too close to the sandbags, to the perimeter

00:35:47.609 --> 00:35:48.609
of the base.

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:50.070
It was right at the top of this mountain.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.820
And a shot rang out.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.180
And the bullet went through the soldier's
wrist, through this side, out his stomach,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.500
and through his other wrist.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:08.680
And I mention that because that was how close
the Taliban was for that amount of power to

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680
reach.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.500
So, I said to this soldier, I said, "So, Staff
Sergeant.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.070
So, what did you do?"

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.340
So, he said he dragged the guy away from the
side, put him into the back where there was

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.340
a medic.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.340
And he said the medic was very, very young.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.840
It was his second week there.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
Very inexperienced.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.359
He was making basically a mess of it.

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:29.660
The guy was in agony.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:36.190
And at that moment, shots rang out from the
entirety of the perimeter.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.740
They were surrounded.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.720
First thing the Taliban did was they took
out the communication towers.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:49.270
So, there was suddenly no way they could communicate
to the base that they needed reinforcements,

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.510
or for help.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:57.830
And even if they could, it was a four hour
walk, hike, to get to them.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.930
So I said to the Staff Sergeant, "So, what
did you do?"

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:08.220
And he said he could hear the explosion, he
could smell the gunpowder, the fire that was

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.220
there.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:13.020
And he said, "I told my men three things."

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.930
And he said there was no use sugar-coating
it.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.690
He could really see the fear in the men's
eyes.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:25.210
And he said, "I told them three things.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.010
First, this looks like it's it.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:37.109
Second, it's been a pleasure serving with
you.

00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:41.410
Third, go out and be your bravest."

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.570
[pause]

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:50.080
And they did.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.970
And for 45 minutes, they fought the Taliban.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:02.480
And there was a French fighter pilot that
was flying low over the position and buzzed

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.840
the position just for fun.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.040
Took fire from the Taliban.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.800
Turned around and dropped some bombs.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.859
And that was it.

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:23.010
The question I leave you with is this Staff
Sergeant wasn't fighting for America, liberty,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:28.089
freedom, any of that stuff.

00:38:28.089 --> 00:38:30.460
It was his team.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:35.910
So, how far will your people follow you?

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:42.140
How far will your followers, your clients,
how far will they follow you?

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.080
What's their commitment?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.900
What's your "why?"

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.140
Why are you in this building?

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.080
What's the big, big reason you are here?

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.320
And the more you are plugged into the deep
reasons for being human, the deep reasons

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:06.130
for being here, the more energy, the more
clarity, the more poise.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.550
Thank you.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.550
[applause]

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:16.990
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Could you possibly
talk a little bit more about your own personal

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:22.020
choices to be in this corporate world to do
what you're doing now?

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.190
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Sure.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.190
Sure.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:29.140
So, it definitely wasn't the money.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.770
To be honest, I had an experience when I was--.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.220
I'm gonna assume we're all friends here and
I'm just talking to my friends rather than

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.220
presenting.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:43.960
So, I had an experience when I was chairing
a meeting of the board of directors at JP

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960
Morgan.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.990
And in that meeting, using some of these practices,
because I was chairing it, I could introduce

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.940
someone and I had some dead time.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:58.150
So, I was doing some of these practices that
you can do with your eyes open, fully aware

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.650
of the room.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:07.380
And I was really shocked because I looked
up and experienced that the room was filled

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.950
with like--.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:17.070
Like, I was aware of like the energy that
made up the room.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.050
So, in some teachings, it's called like, seeing
divine light, being able to see energy everywhere.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:28.619
And I was completely shocked because there
I was at JP Morgan running a meeting and at

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:32.790
the same time, it's like, externally I was
like, "Thanks very much.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.430
Now, we're gonna introduce Mr. Smith.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:40.540
He's gonna talk to us about Luxembourg sea
cabs and it's very incredibly boring."

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.400
And internally, I was like--.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.190
[laughter]

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:55.760
"I'd like to introduce the next speaker who's
even more boring than the first."

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.760
[laughter]

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.000
Please don't make me do that visual gag again.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.670
But that's the moment that I got that no matter
where you are, there is your center.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.650
No matter what you're doing, you carry the
deepest part of who you are everywhere.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.550
And it's accessible at any time.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.930
And the myth that 'cause I have a job or a
big to-do list that that separates me from

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.890
the divine, from source, from energy--it's
just not true.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:32.060
So I felt--to answer your question--very deeply
called that I felt I have to share this message.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.660
I really have to share this message with people.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.040
Because for decades, I'd struggled with it.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.180
Spirituality was the mountaintop.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.839
It was the robes, the beads, the teacher.

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:43.950
It's not true.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.910
It's just not true.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:48.910
My wife jokes that--.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.430
I met my wife after I left JP Morgan.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:55.609
And she said, "I met you after you had money
and power and status."

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:56.609
So, it's true.

00:41:56.609 --> 00:41:57.609
[laughter]

00:41:57.609 --> 00:41:58.609
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Hey, Mark.

00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:00.119
Thanks again for talking to us today.

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:01.800
So, a follow-up question to that.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.820
Is it possible to integrate this type of practice
and exist in this type of context?

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.820
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Oh, totally.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.160
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: So many of us focus
on delivering, right, in the there and then,

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.630
in the future.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.869
Or, we're reviewing performance of the past.

00:42:15.869 --> 00:42:21.760
But are we able to really be present and whole
as what's in the center there in that orb,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.930
in this type of environment in an ongoing
basis?

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:34.480
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: So, I left JP Morgan, but
I'd been doing these practices for a long

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.030
time.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:40.200
So, it wasn't that I left and I had these
spiritual experiences.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.870
I had these spiritual experiences when I was
on the trading room floor.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:52.240
So, the way it works, I think, is that the
more you do these practices, the more you

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.240
access it.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.050
And eventually, something interesting happens.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.990
These qualities start to--.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.270
It's like you're building a pathway, like
a pipeline.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:04.240
And eventually, these qualities start to flow
out.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:12.250
So, it's a balance of being present in the
moment, taking action, dreaming of the future,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.440
envisioning, being present--it's that whole
thing.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.300
But everything comes from the center.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.290
So, it's learning that being centered, taking
action, returning.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.630
And that returning again is very important.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.710
Very important.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:24.780
Thank you.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.010
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: Hi, Mark.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.630
Thanks for coming.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.910
I did read your book.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:36.050
And I thought one of the most compelling parts
was just in the beginning about leading from

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.050
your heart.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.859
I would love if you could just talk a little
bit about that.

00:43:38.859 --> 00:43:40.589
What does that mean?

00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:47.570
How can I think about as someone who may have
not attempted that, how can I start working

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.561
from the heart?

00:43:49.561 --> 00:43:50.561
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Yeah, great.

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:54.410
So, leading from the heart was our way to
try and describe living from the deepest essence

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.750
of who you are.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.770
And there's a really interesting practice
that I wanted to share.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:08.020
And do you have that experience, you can drive
a car and you can talk on a cell phone?

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.020
Yeah?

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.700
You can sit on your laptop, talk on the phone,
tweet, glance--.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.990
I mean, you can do a lot of stuff, right?

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:19.550
So, we all have the skills to have foreground
awareness and background awareness.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:28.130
So, one of the powerful ways to find the core
of your heart is to rest your attention effortlessly

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.589
in the center of your chest.

00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:32.640
And you can do that whilst you talk.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.839
You can do that whilst you're running meetings.

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:39.530
You can do that whilst you're walking in the
same way that you can talk to your mom on

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.600
the phone whilst reading the newspaper.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.180
So, that is a way.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.160
And where energy--.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.440
Attention goes to where energy--.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.420
Attention flows where energy--.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.730
Energy flows where attention goes.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:54.980
What you notice, you magnify.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.640
And what you worship, you become.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:04.599
So, you can move about on this through your
daily life whilst keeping some of your attention

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:07.710
anchored in the center of your heart.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.710
It's like--.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:14.700
The analogy is like if I'm standing on the
circumference there and I'm facing outwards

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.650
and the center is behind me, it's far enough
away where I can reach out and connect to

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.310
the center and still be present.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.950
But always returning to that.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.660
And there's times when, in work, I need to
drop this and be completely--.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.280
That's really important, too, to know when
to let go and to do your work.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.590
Yeah, so it's just a reaching back connecting.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.130
And sometimes, you have to look directly at
the center.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:44.150
And sometimes, eventually, you can actually
stand in the center of your essence and talk

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.150
from there.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:48.430
And then you pop out again and it's that kind
of quixotic dance.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.430
But ultimately, it makes a difference.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:50.430
[pause]

00:45:50.430 --> 00:46:01.110
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: When I saw the
title on this talk, I thought I was going

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.350
to get some techniques.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.000
This was more of a description of strategy
and not technique.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.180
Can you do anything in such sharp bursts of
time?

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:20.820
How do you know that you're making progress?

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.170
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Sure.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.740
Great question.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.310
Thank you.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:32.770
So, the idea is to pick a practice.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:36.020
Do it as frequently as you can.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:40.359
You need to give yourself some time as to
how impactful it is.

00:46:40.359 --> 00:46:43.670
There are some techniques you try and it's
instantly like a sweet kind of nectar.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.520
Like, there's a sense of, "Ah, this is like
returning home again."

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.550
And there's other which are creating actually
more mental confusion and more internal dialogue

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.720
and more sense of frustration.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.230
That's just the wrong technique.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:03.120
So, I'm not an advocate of pick a practice,
try it for three months, go through turmoil,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.410
because my intuitive sense is that your heart
knows what it needs.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.930
And it can recognize a practice that is most
rich for it.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.640
And anything else is too painful.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.810
So, you have to try it.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.350
See how it goes.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.570
Don't bash your head against the wall.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.609
It could just mean the wrong practice.

00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:25.609
Is that helpful?

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:26.609
Thank you.

00:47:26.609 --> 00:47:29.410
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#11: I'm curious as
to your own experience growing and the experience

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:39.030
of your clients, what they find the most challenging
thing in making that transition from life

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:48.950
before and then life moving towards the ability
to be able to be in that moment in its state.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.950
Cumulatively.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:50.950
.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.670
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: What would you most like
to know about that journey?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.609
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#11: What would I
most like to know?

00:47:54.609 --> 00:47:55.750
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Yeah.

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.079
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#11: I guess what
people typically find the most challenging.

00:47:59.079 --> 00:48:04.300
Is it doing the right practice or what have
you seen?

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:12.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: I would say the biggest challenge
is--.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:22.020
The biggest challenge is to experience the
kindness of what it is to be human because

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.170
as soon as you turn within, you're faced with
a whole lot of stuff that many people are

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.410
not familiar with dealing with.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:36.440
I can guarantee you in meditation, you'll
become more aware of parts of you that are

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.880
dark, parts of you that are shadow, parts
of you that are uncomfortable, as well as

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.430
parts that are light and glorious.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:50.570
And the biggest temptation is to close down
and move away from things that are actually

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:55.260
them, but are held in shadow.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:01.560
And people structure their lives not wanting
to look at that stuff, you know?

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.380
It's like, [chuckles] "No, I'm looking there."

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.881
There's a lot of stuff that--.

00:49:04.881 --> 00:49:09.470
And that's where the freedom is--when you
can start to realize that we're human and

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.210
we have light and we have dark.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:17.200
And that moment to moment practice of kindness
with yourself for who you are and for your

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.150
experience.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:24.710
A lot of people think meditation is, "I'm
gonna run to the light and wear white clothes

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.660
and be holy."

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.300
And you're always a bliss junkie for many
years, I think.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.300
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: Mark, so thank
you for coming in.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: My pleasure.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.560
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: And delivering
that message.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.150
So, having brought up in India as a teenager,
I was lucky to have stumbled across what you

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.450
mean with meditation and I agree.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:45.230
So, anchoring, principles, pillars in my life.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:49.750
But in talking to gurus, the dichotomy that
comes up in most people's mind, and I want

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.960
to bring it up to you and see what your answer
is, on the one hand there's a group of high

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.010
achievers, who feel the relentless pressure
on a daily basis.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:02.430
Not enough time in a day to answer all the
emails, get to all the meetings and then chase

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.430
all the goals.

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.740
The skills and resources are available, but
people feel there's not enough time.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.380
There's a stress associated with that.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.213
On the other hand, here is somebody, former
COO of JP Morgan coming in saying, "You have

00:50:13.213 --> 00:50:18.440
to find a teacher, meditate, find your place
of heart and your life will be perfect."

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:25.329
And there's a big gap there that often people
find, "How do I leap across and trust?"

00:50:25.329 --> 00:50:29.119
How would you propose that people close that
gap in their minds?

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:30.260
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Sure.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.400
Thank you, [inaudible].

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:41.640
So, I would say that for me, the context is
important.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:47.099
So, I don't believe the set-up of life that
we don't have time.

00:50:47.099 --> 00:50:48.099
I don't believe in it.

00:50:48.099 --> 00:50:50.790
There's always ways to be skillful with it.

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:56.760
The invitation for practicing an hour a day
cumulatively, whilst not giving up any part

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:02.619
of your agenda at all, that's a huge inspiration.

00:51:02.619 --> 00:51:10.860
I can simply cut down on my dead time--my
over processing--and add it to why which I'm

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.190
creating more aliveness in myself.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.060
So, trainings are really good.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.060
Finding teachers.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.869
If people have interest in finding teachers,
there are some great resources.

00:51:21.869 --> 00:51:29.109
The top three websites in the US, which are
like the magnets for all spiritual teachers

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:33.349
in the US, you can browse through that stuff
and just work out what, where, if there's

00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:34.349
a pull for you.

00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:36.070
There's lots and lots of resources out there.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:41.200
And I'm happy to share that with Rach and
anyone, share those things.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.210
One minute.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:45.910
Is that partly helpful, [inaudible]?

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:55.339
I think that the key thing for me has been
that 

00:51:55.339 --> 00:52:01.950
experience that there are ways where it weaves
artfully into your experience of life.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:07.690
So, it can become part of the fabric of your
everyday experience.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.359
And that's what's really rich for me.

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.780
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Thank you, Mark.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.780
Thanks for coming.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.780
&gt;&gt;Mark Thornton: Thank you.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.060
[applause]
