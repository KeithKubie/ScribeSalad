00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:03.784
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.820
-Hello, my name's
Yukio Lippit and I'm

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.170
the faculty director of the
Arts at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.490
And I'd like to extend a
warm welcome to all of you

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.930
to this very special event,
the opening and celebration

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.050
of our exhibition of the
artist Matika Wilbur, titled

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.040
Seeds of Culture:
Portraits and Stories

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.500
of Native American Women at
Radcliffe's Johnson-Kulukundis

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.840
Family gallery.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.630
Now we have a wonderful
program, which

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.400
includes special
musical performances,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.840
and we'll be hearing from
Matika Wilbur herself.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.210
But first, we would like to
acknowledge the Massachusetts

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.320
Nipmuc and Wampanoag
tribes, whose land we

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
are on this evening.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.580
And begin with the blessing
by Mary Anne Hendricks,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.830
who is Sachem or paramount
chief, of the Natick Nipmuc.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.270
-Hello.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.940
[NON-ENGLISH] Oh, my
dear creator, hear me.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.750
I want to acknowledge the
Radcliffe Institute and Harvard

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.327
University Native
American Program

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:14.160
for the interest they've
shown in attempting

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.140
to end the exploitation
of indigenous persons.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.980
I also want to bless the
many tribes represented here

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.470
tonight, and the first people
on whose land we stand.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.560
Too often we have been
faced with ignorance.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.335
For example, referring
to our regalia

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:34.600
as costumes, used in culturally
inappropriate and derogatory

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.980
term, team names,
and statesmanship

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.310
we no longer exist.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.430
Well to quote one of our
native Nipmuc scholars,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.900
Kristen Wyman she said,
"For hundreds of years,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.625
our people have been
used and exploited

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:52.290
in the colonizer's pursuit
of greed and power.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740
Using our identity
for any means,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.810
without validating our existence
is contradictory in nature,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.950
and only spreads the
seeds of ignorance.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.389
If one truly supports--" I think
I'm a little stiff at this age.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.830
"If one truly supports
bringing our culture to life,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
one will allow that culture
to speak for itself.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.970
Matika Wilbur, Native American
photographer and documentarian,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.840
is doing just that, allowing
culture to speak for itself.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.100
She is spreading the seeds
of truth and knowledge.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.800
Please bless Matika Wilbur
on her journey, and may

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
society learned
from her endeavors."

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.170
-Thank you very much,
Mary Anne Hendricks.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.640
By way of introducing today's
featured artist, Matika

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.700
and performers, I'd like to
note that this exhibition marks

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.730
a culminating moment of two
aspects of the Radcliffe

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.840
Institute.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.820
And the first is our
research theme for the year,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.660
in partnership with HUNAP,
Harvard University Native

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.920
American Program, which is the
study of indigenous peoples

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.420
and will be marked
by our conference

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.960
tomorrow in this very
gym, titled Native Peoples

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.680
Native Politics, which
begins at 9:00 AM.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.070
And actually,
there is a postcard

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.470
of the event on
seats for all of you,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.570
which will also feature
Matika as a participant,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.920
as well as many other
distinguished speakers.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.290
The second aspect is that
this is the culmination

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.040
of a heady first
year in the life

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.130
of our new gallery
at Radcliffe, which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.540
opened only this past October.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.280
And because our arts program in
the academic ventures division

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.780
strives to champion the
arts as really a unique way

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.900
of understanding the world
in forms that are not always

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.230
foregrounded in other
ways of knowing,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.440
through particular
forms of experimentation

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.550
and innovation, the senses,
memory, intimate experience

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.590
and empathy.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.460
We feel that we found
the ideal artist

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.960
with whom to work in Matika.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.640
Matika Wilbur is a critically
acclaimed photographer, writer,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.760
and social documentarian.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.370
She's a member of the
Swinomish and Tulalip tribes

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.010
of the state of
Washington, where

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.092
she was raised in a family
of commercial fisherman.

00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:27.050
I'd like to extend a warm
welcome to her mother

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.890
Nancy, and nephew Treyton who
are with us in the audience

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.430
today.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.328
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.690
Matika went on to
study photography

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.730
at the Brooks
Institute in California

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.300
and the Rocky Mountain School
of Photography in Montana.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.890
Over 10 years ago, she began to
develop a monumental aspiration

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.200
that has led to her work today.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.230
To help develop
a body of imagery

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.210
in cultural representations
of native peoples

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.850
to counteract the relentlessly
insipid one dimensional

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.450
stereotypes circulating
in mainstream media,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.310
historical textbooks,
and the culture industry.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.520
To create, in her own words,
positive indigenous role

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
models, to do justice to
the richness and diversity

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.860
and lived experiences
of Indian country.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.130
In 2012, she sold everything
in her Seattle apartment

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.560
and created Project 562,
which reflects her commitment

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.680
to visit, engage and
photograph all 562

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.050
plus Native American sovereign
territories in the United

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.460
States.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.840
This project has driven her to
travel hundreds of thousands

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.710
of miles, many in
her RV, The Big Girl.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.920
But also by horseback
through the Grand Canyon,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.320
by train, plane, and boat.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.330
By foot across
all 50 states, she

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.880
reflects a remarkable
way of being an artist

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.750
in the contemporary world.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.310
Kickstarter-funded with a large
community of online supporters,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.460
sleeping on sofas,
she is welcomed

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.850
and hosted by strangers who
soon become friends, and share

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.960
the aspirations of the
artist in her project.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.010
The photographs that
Matika takes reflect

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.550
her consummate craftsmanship,
beautiful black and white

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.300
images that selectively
incorporate color,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300
and showcase are subjects
in vital mutualism

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.860
with the lands on which they
live, in which they steward.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.560
But her virtuoso technique
is only one aspect

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.900
of the social and cultural
meaning of the works.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.180
They are one product of
her dynamic engagement

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.790
with native communities,
in which she takes the time

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.790
to understand the stories and
histories of particular tribes,

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.300
each particular tribe, each
individual, and experience

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.280
what shapes entirely the way
the portrait comes to be.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.900
One gets the sense that these
works reflect true partnerships

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.255
between artist and sitter.

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:55.630
The photographs
that you will see

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.000
in the gallery or but a
small but truly remarkable

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.960
sample of her work.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.820
Because Radcliffe is
an institution that

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.140
has historically been dedicated
to the education of women,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.790
we were moved and delighted
when Matika proposed

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.060
to curate a show
for us, focusing

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.000
on Native American women,
the women of Project 562.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.280
What you witness in the
gallery through the selection

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.430
is wide ranging diversity and
richness of the identities

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.920
and experiences, the stories
of Native American women.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.760
You will encounter teachers,
daughters, linguists,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.540
activists, artists, mothers,
PhDs, elders, professionals,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.690
grandmothers, Ivy
League students,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.750
and community organizers.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.820
They are accompanied
by a booklet that

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.180
convey the words and stories
of these individuals,

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.300
and also an audio track that
fills the room with songs,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.920
prayers, and the texture
and timber of the voices

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.360
of these individuals.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.390
Collectively, these
representations

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.640
convey intimate experience,
but also epic tradition.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.220
The entire range of human
emotions is represented.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.170
The sadness and trauma of
genocide, colonization,

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:16.120
but also an abundance of hope,
determination, joy, and humor,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.790
and complexity.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.530
The resourcefulness
and strategies

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.680
by which these women
negotiate identity

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760
and their multiple points
of cultural reference

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.180
in the contemporary world.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.470
These stories are all framed
against very different

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.490
landscapes, the landscapes of
the 562, desert, valley, river,

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.070
ocean, mountains,
coast, snow scape.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.120
Indeed, in the
gallery, Matika's work

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.100
has managed to create
its own cosmology

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.620
of the many different
regions and narratives

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.700
of native communities
everywhere.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.690
All of us who have worked on
the exhibition at the Radcliffe

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.080
Institute, including the
members of the Academic Ventures

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.230
division, our colleagues
in events, communications,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.750
facilities, the Fellows
office, the Dean's office,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.880
as well as our
friends and partners

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.370
and collaborators at HUNAP,
directed by Shelly Lowe,

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.260
would like to convey
heartfelt thanks to Matika,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.020
who had given as tireless
energy, will, artistry

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.640
and enthusiasm to this project.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.300
We'd like to thank our
exhibition advisor, Adrienne

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.970
Keene and members of team 562.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.430
And also we would like
to thank the women

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.540
in the portraits in the
gallery for allowing

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.580
us to play a small role in
helping to tell their stories,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.230
and to reimagine the
richness of Indian country.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.280
Let me briefly describe
how this hour will proceed.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.700
I'd like to introduce next,
our two guest performers

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.560
before asking Matika herself
to come to the podium

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.410
to address this audience.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.330
After this presentation,
we will invite all of you

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.260
across the yard to the gallery.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.930
We look forward to welcoming
you for a reception accompanying

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.570
the opening.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.630
Now, our first performer
is Leah Shenandoah,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.760
who is a Oneida Wolf clan member
of the Iroquois Confederacy.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.060
She comes from a lineage
of distinguished artists

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.020
and musicians, and her work
with her mother, Grammy Award

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.420
winning Joanne Shenandoah, has
gained international acclaim.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.200
She has won numerous
awards, including

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.180
debut artist of the year in 2014
by the Native American Music

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.110
Awards, and best
alternative recording.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.870
She's performed
all over the world,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.270
including at the
Vatican, the White House,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.000
and before His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.566
We are privileged
to be next in line

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:36.690
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.520
Please join me in
welcoming Leah Shenandoah.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.230
-So, I'm Leah Shenandoah.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.430
My native name is Kaha whi'tha,
which means she carries along.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.340
And I will sing the song
we sang at the Vatican,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.030
and in front of His
Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.160
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.620
So the next one
I'm going to sing

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.040
is not an album or
anything, so bear with me.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.676
It's called Frankenhearted.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:52.325
[SINGING] Early morning bird
song exalting sunrise, sunrise.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:06.828
Heartbeat pounding, my little
breath filled with wonder,

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:13.516
do you lie awake too?

00:13:13.516 --> 00:13:24.966
Do on your cheek, heavens and
hell, tucked beneath your feet?

00:13:24.966 --> 00:13:33.110
I loved you once,
I can't try again.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:41.010
But I am happy,
yeah, for resting,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.040
I am reborn every morning.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:57.064
Lovers embrace, a
ghostly remembrance.

00:13:57.064 --> 00:14:06.760
Not even a trace,
my fiery ache leaves

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:15.450
me frakenhearted, but
stronger than before.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:23.876
So I bless your sorrows, empty
promises, and better tomorrows.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:35.850
I loved you once
as the raven cries

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:47.670
and interruption
of my beauty sleep.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.170
That one's not recorded.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.050
The third one is off
my Nammy winning album,

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.790
which is called
Weight of the World.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.390
This is about my
progression, finding self

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.030
love, which I think is one
of the most difficult things

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.380
to do in this day and age.

00:15:14.362 --> 00:15:23.360
[SINGING] Weight of the
world, put a curve in my neck.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.105
I shuddered from
years of disrespect.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:42.192
Recently, I discovered
my true self,

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:48.618
hidden behind years of neglect.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:06.350
I am my higher self.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.610
I am full of sunsets.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.940
I am my higher self.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.890
I am full of sunsets.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:27.020
Light shine bright,
beautiful, and correct.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.636
My feet, no they don't waver.

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:47.370
My path is in step.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:58.936
Dancing in the moonlight,
my energy connects all.

00:17:09.006 --> 00:17:11.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.069
Now I go.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:22.260
I have to say happy
birthday Matika.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.410
I had to do it.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.630
You're the best.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.331
Thank you so much for having me.

00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:28.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:28.977 --> 00:17:31.610
-Thank you very much, Leah.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.960
Our next performer, Laura
Ortman is White Mountain Apache,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.760
and is a Brooklyn based
composer, musician,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.020
and visual artist.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.410
Based on her expertise in a wide
range of musical instruments,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.260
but most notably, violin,
electric guitar, and vocals,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.130
she's formed a number
of musical groups

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.020
that are performed around
the world, including

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.830

This year, she'll release
her third solo album, My Soul

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.450
Remainer.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.900
She will perform
original songs that

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.400
are inspired by
Matika's show, and she

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.080
says, "The presence of everyone
who has come to see it,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.760
all of you, all of us."

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.190
Please join me in
welcoming Laura Ortman

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:42.378
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:30.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:51.780
-Thank you.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.930
As made both implicit
and explicit,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.960
there are two performers,
somehow by fortuitous aligning

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.890
of the stars, the opening
for this exhibition

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.120
has coincided with the
featured artist's birthday.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.700
So without futher-- this
is a celebratory occasion,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.917
in many sense.

00:28:06.917 --> 00:28:08.500
So without further
ado, please join me

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.750
in welcoming to the
stage Matika Wilbur.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:24.034 --> 00:28:26.494
-Wow!

00:28:26.494 --> 00:28:28.340
Oh, my gosh, wow.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.903
How wonderful that
all of you are here.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.140
Thank you for being here.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:42.700
Let me say-- wow, Leah
and Laura, thank you.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.880
[NON-ENGLISH] Wow.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.860
And hello, friends
and relatives.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.210
My name is Matika Wilbur.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.390
I'm from the Swinomish
and Tulalip tribe.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.590
And my mom is Nancy Wilbur.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.180
My maternal grandmother,
Laura Wilbur.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.040
My father, Kenny Joseph.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.700
My paternal grandmother,
Loretta James.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.456
Gosh, it is just such a
pleasure to be here with each

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:10.580
and every one of you today.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.200
And I just really
want to thank you

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.510
so much for taking the
time out of your busy lives

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.650
to come here tonight, it
really means so much to me.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.200
So, from my heart
to yours, thank you.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.830
I'd like to offer a big
warm honey thank you

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.810
to the elders here
with us this evening,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.840
and to the Massachusetts
Wampanoag and Nitmuc people.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.210
[NON-ENGLISH] Thank you for
allowing us to be within

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.790
your indigenous territory.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.700
And let me preface
that also by saying

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.230
I appreciate your wisdom
and your knowledge,

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.480
my sweet elders.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.775
And I appreciate you letting
me share with you tonight.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.690
I'd like to share messages
that have been entrusted

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.560
to me on the road,
and some of the hard

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.785
earned discoveries
from the road.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.990
So for the past
three years, I've

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.160
been on this adventurous
sojourn into Indian country.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.425
I set off with the intention to
photograph every one of tribes

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:32.520
in the United States, 562
federally recognized tribes

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.280
at its inception.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.290
Why?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.390
To change the way we
see native America.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:48.690
In that time, I've realized
that the best way to see,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.890
is first to listen.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.620
And what have I
listened to mostly

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.290
for the last several years?

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.630
Indigenous stories of
every imaginable variety.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.390
The stories from Turtle Island.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:11.110
And I want to tell you the
story of Turtle Island,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.030
it's one of my favorites.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.710
And it goes a little
something like this.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.370
And it should be
said that this is

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.280
shared by so many communities
across Turtle Island.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.600
So, you might have heard
a different version

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.530
of this story, and if you want
to argue about it afterwards,

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.500
I'm down with that.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.150
So long, long ago,
when the world was new

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.520
and there was no
land, only water,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.390
powerful beings lived in a
place called the sky world.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.390
One day, a curious,
young, expecting woman

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.270
dug a hole at the base
of the tree of life,

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:55.460
until she could see through
to the other side below.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.910
And you know, she's curious.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.050
She can't help but
peek through the hole.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:04.650
And suddenly, she
starts to slip.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.040
And she starts reaching
and grabbing for everything

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.260
that she can find, and she
gets herself some dirt,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:13.250
and she grabs a few seeds, and
she begins to fall, and fall,

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.290
and tumble into the vastness.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.920
She's spinning and
turning and floating

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.710
through the expanse, past the
moon, towards the blue dot.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.910
And all of the animals
below, the winged beings

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.830
and sea creatures,
they see her falling.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:35.220
And they say the to each
other, if we don't help her,

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.380
she's going to
make a huge splash,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.440
and that is going
to ruin our day.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.010
And so, they decide to save her.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:51.260
So the birds, they fly up
above, and they catch her,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.300
and they soften her fall.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.710
And they place her on the
back of a giant turtle.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.730
Sky Woman gives
birth to two babies,

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:07.720
and from those seeds,
earth and babies,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.430
the world is formed
and dance into being

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.592
and became the Turtle Island
that we walk upon right now.

00:33:19.896 --> 00:33:21.836
I have another story for you.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:28.870
A long time ago, there
was only darkness.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.060
A man, god created,
the heaven and earth.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.310
And the earth was
without form, and void,

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.640
and darkness was upon
the face of deep.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.960
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.820
and God said, "Let there be
light," and there was light.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.980
God created night and
day, the sun and the moon,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.730
and all the creatures
of the world.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:34:00.730
And finally, he creates human,
man first, and then a woman.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.250
Adam and Eve.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.470
And he places
everything and everyone

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.970
into one garden,
a perfect world,

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.409
where there's no sickness,
no death, no hate, no hunger.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:17.540
There's only one rule, and
you know the rest of story.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.449
One of my favorite
authors, Thomas King,

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.980
he wrote a book called
The Truth about Stories:

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.750
A Native Narrative.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.080
He starts with the big
picture, a comparison

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.940
of this indigenous
creation story,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.280
like the one I just told
you, in the book of Genesis

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.010
of Judeo Christian traditions.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:40.429
The story of Sky Woman
introduces the talking animals

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.760
almost straight away,
which is, as King

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.449
says, a bit of a problem.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.929
The chatty fish and
friendly rabbits

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.710
of indigenous literature allow
people to label [? ablet ?]

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:59.700
as simplistic, and indigenous
societies as primitive.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.360
But as King shows,
the talking animals

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.520
are actually quite
sophisticated.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.380
They speak of a
world where balance

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.050
is the norm, where the
world is shared, where chaos

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.020
is turned into an organization.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.710
Compare that with Judeo
Christian worldviews, where

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.680
in Genesis, hierarchy,
individualism, and organization

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.810
degenerate into chaos,
accompanied by aggression,

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.931
an enemy.

00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:36.030
The Eden story is why
Western society favors order,

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.960
rationality, and
material constructs,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.910
along with systems of
judgment, superiority, and male

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.780
domination.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.720
The primary role of
traditional indigenous story,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.000
on the other hand, was
creating and fostering

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.430
equality between
all living things.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.990
At the heart of Sky
Woman's creation

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.840
story is the idea of
universal equality,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.450
and importance of the
female essence and instinct,

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.940
stewardship, and knowledge.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.580
It cherishes and
cultivates equality

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.800
between the males
and the females,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.640
and especially the roles,
and all of creation.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.050
As it happens, so
many of the stories

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.690
I've been given
in my journey also

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:31.330
originate from and
relate to native women.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.320
I understand that
these stories are

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.810
fundamental to how we see
and understand the world

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.530
and ourselves.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:46.520
As King says, the truth about
stories is that's all we are.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.810
I have to tell you
though, the stories

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.860
that I've been hearing
from native women

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.915
all over the country
have lain heavily.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.560
When I sit down to listen to our
people, especially our women,

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.370
they erupt with their
innermost stories.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.940
For some reason,
they want me to know.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.810
Maybe it's because
they understood

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.080
that you and I would be sitting
here together in this room

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.320
and I'd be sharing
stories with you,

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.440
and that maybe these
stories would someday

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.040
save somebody's life.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.270
Or maybe, it is just because
desperately, somewhere,

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.920
we all yearn to be justified
by the telling of our truths.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.550
And the stories that
I've heard are the kind

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.570
that are hard to repeat.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:45.160
Grandmas tell me about what
happened to them in IHS

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.120
clinics, of how they've gone
in to have their first baby,

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.770
and were never able to
conceive again, only

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.040
to find out years later
that they'd been sterilized

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.710
without their consent.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.690
Victims of a de facto
government, one child policy.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.440
Married women tell me about
their abusive husbands,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.920
of the violence, and
loneliness, and despair,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.490
and their fear of leaving.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:21.060
One lady told me about how
she was raped in the army,

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.800
then was demoted
when she saw justice.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.740
Upon returning home with a
mixed race child born of rape,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:35.190
she was made to feel like an
outcast in her own community.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.950
Women talk about there
alarm about tribal children

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.650
committing suicide,
as many already have.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.620
We talk about and sheds
tears for our elders

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.430
that are passing away, and
with their passing is also

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.470
the death of our
indigenous languages.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.210
Aunties talk about the
plants that are dying,

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.380
the water not returning, and
creatures around them at risk.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.130
Women tell me how
difficult it is

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:03.700
to choose a mate when
racist policies determine

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.090
their future
children's opportunity

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.820
for tribal citizenship.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.340
And women speak with me about
the difficulty of fitting

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.150
into academic environments,
when the faces, books,

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.060
and spaces around them
do not include them.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.880
Teachers express the ways
that teaching to the test

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.720
inhibits their ability
to teach the truths

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.530
about native America.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.740
Single mothers
share their struggle

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.720
to find money to make rent.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.580
It's a lot.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.090
They tell me stories
about race, and caste,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.440
and how their bodies are
used to perpetuate both.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.030
High caste women are
sexually restricted,

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:52.740
while women at the bottom
are sexually exploited.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.830
And while I wanted
to come here tonight

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.360
and share desperately with you,
stories of beauty and light

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.010
and love and nothing but
chuckle and happiness and joy,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.665
because after all,
it's my birthday

00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:04.915
and we're trying to celebrate.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.218
I felt like I had to be a
little real with you tonight.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.300
I have to tell you that
these experiences articulate

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.590
our current
socioeconomic situation.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.200
Native American women are the
most victimized in the country.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.880
Three out of four
have experienced

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.170
sexual assault or domestic
abuse in their lifetimes.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:41.500
For most native women, it is not
the question of if, but when.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.840
Across the border
in Canada, there

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.630
are an estimated 1,181
stolen sisters, women

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:55.470
from age 2 to 78,
disappeared and never found.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.370
Missing, and likely murdered.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:03.100
There's no question that we
are in a very critical time,

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.120
and a longstanding epidemic
of abuse and misuse

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.500
towards our native
women and children.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.450
And these hard and
real stories are

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.510
connected to the compelling
native female narrative,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.520
from Sky Woman
forward, and deserve

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.070
to be told as part of
the collective voice

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.730
of Indian women.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.880
But who will tell them?

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.810
And how shall they be told?

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:34.380
In our exhibition,
Seeds of Culture:

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.850
The Portraits and Stories
of Native American Women,

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:43.190
native women are here to
tell you their own stories.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.560
Native women
suffering and loss are

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.370
part of the indigenous
reality that exists,

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.060
that must be respected.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.780
It must be of concern to us all.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.490
I though have found, also
in our women's stories,

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:04.100
a treasure trove of knowledge,
strength, and vision.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.230
You will meet, in
this exhibition, women

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:10.690
that endure the crisis and
transform the narrative, women

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:14.430
who prosper, who
become self actualized,

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.460
and fight for our nationhood.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.580
Who carry our culture forward,
save our languages, seeds,

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.440
histories, and lives, while
birthing our next leaders

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.290
and putting to rest the
previous generation.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:35.210
Women fully understanding the
complexities and power of story

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.920
as social shaping and crucial
to them and individual.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.530
Women like this.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.540
This is my girl [? Desi. ?]
She's great, you'd lover her.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.540
She fierce.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.270
She has that chuckle about
her that you just love.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.770
She's infectious with
light and love and energy.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.170
When you are around her, you
feel a little bit taller.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.270
It's true.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.850
And [? Desi ?] is a scholar.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.190
She's currently
enrolled in a dual PhD

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.410
program with the
University of Arizona

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:08.650
and the University of
Waikato in New Zealand.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:14.100
And after earning bachelor's and
master's degrees from Stanford,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.850
she grew up on the northern
Cheyenne reservation.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.070
She returned there after
her undergraduate studies,

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:24.550
and her academic path is shaped
and formed, and for her people.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:29.660
She says, they call us
the fighting Cheyenne,

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.030
because we fought for everything
that we have here today.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.470
I've grown up knowing
that we are here

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:40.740
because 300 of our people
made it back from Oklahoma.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.160
They escaped in the
middle of winter

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.110
after being forced into
governmental Indian territory.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.300
They were dying of
famine and disease,

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.100
and so to of our chiefs,
Dull Knife and Little Wolf,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.590
decided that they were going
to make a run for freedom.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:03.360
And if they died along
the way, at least

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.740
they died trying to get home.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.670
So this really amazing tale of
survival of what a people would

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.520
do to be within their homeland.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.510
Only 300 made it.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.510
They were chased by the
cavalry the entire time,

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.570
in the middle of winter
for thousands of miles.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:27.630
And for me, that's not
history, that's my reality.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.970
That's a reality that our
people still live with.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.320
It's not something that's
written down in history books,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.850
it shapes your entire
life knowing every day

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.250
that your ancestors
died for you to be here.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.460
And to me, that really
tells the strength

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.450
of the Cheyenne people.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.460
One of the greatest truths
I've been given in my travels

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.640
is that Native American
lands is essential to

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.330
our Native American identity.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.890
Where are the people of
the blue green water?

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.010
The people of the
tall pine trees?

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.910
The people that live within
the sacred mountains?

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.720
The people of the flowing tide?

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.200
But what happens when our
relationship with the land

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.740
is dramatically changed?

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.060
And although we
haven't relocated,

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.830
we feel displaced, because the
face of Mother Earth around us

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.760
has changed so dramatically.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.430
Take for example what's
happening in Navajo Nation.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.290
This is Dana Eldridge.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.750
She's pictured during the
[NON-ENGLISH] meaning,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.090
our journey for existence.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.590
I know there's some
Navajos in here,

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:48.582
so I look at them like I
know I didn't say that right.

00:45:48.582 --> 00:45:49.564
I'm sorry.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.230
How many Navajos do we got here?

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.980
Come on.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.080
Yeah, I knew it.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.210
I'm just saying, Everywhere
I go in Indian country,

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.640
I run into lots of Navajos.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.490
That's a good thing.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.800
We like you here.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.260
We're happy to be with you.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.020
Welcome.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.426
Please bring mutton.

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:16.370
Dana is in the
middle, in the midst.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.900
When I took this
photo, we'd already

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.050
walked 40 miles that day.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:25.070
They were walking 1,200 miles
on a pilgrimage across Navajo

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.730
Nations to all four
sacred mountains

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:31.080
to encourage the indigenous
uprising against fracking

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.480
and extraction from
the Mother Earth,

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.370
while returning to the sacred.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.460
Americans recognize the
dangers and toxicity

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.290
of fracking in extracting
resources from Mother Earth.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.030
Navajo people, such
as Dana, however,

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.481
feel the devastating
impacts firsthand.

00:46:52.481 --> 00:46:55.910
I have to tell you, when
we were out walking,

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.690
there had been an
oil spill, and there

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:03.970
was people in full hazmat suits
cleaning up the oil spill not

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.280
even 10 yards away, where
little Indian babies were

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.540
playing on the playground.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.830
It was so bad that
as we were walking,

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.820
we had to wear scarves
around our faces.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:22.530
And yet, here are these children
playing in this environment.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.320
If that was
happening right here,

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.930
or in downtown
Los Angeles, there

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.115
would be a major uprising.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.070
And when I talked to
Dana, she explained

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.390
that 42% of Navajo
Nation is unemployed.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.960
And the extractive
oil industries

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.920
promised jobs and other
financial incentives,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.590
leaving people
with little choice

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:52.680
but to sign the
exploitative leases.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.990
So here's the ladies.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.300
They say they walk to honor the
resiliency of our ancestors,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.970
who 150 years ago, were
forced to march hundreds

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:05.640
of miles in the dead of winter
on a genocidal death march.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.180
They sacrificed and
suffered so much,

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.240
so that we could live within
these four sacred mountains.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.760
And so we walk to honor
and remember them.

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:18.950
I think in what I've
found is that the way

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:23.690
that our land, the way
that we treat our land,

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:28.430
is directly related to the
way that we treat our women.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.280
If we are willing to
penetrate the Earth

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.760
for her natural resources, I'm
afraid of the consequences.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.782
Our women will also
feel its effects.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.320
Oops.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.460
Here we have a photo
of Miss Jenny Parker,

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.510
and her granddaughter
[? Charlease. ?]

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:57.770
And she's also from the
northern Cheyenne tribe.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.950
And for 25 years,
she was a teacher

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:03.610
in the private Catholic
school on their reservation.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.330
Until one day, when she
was teaching at the school,

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:12.330
and police came in uniform
and asked her to come

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.130
identify a body.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.890
It was her daughter's.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.815
She'd been assaulted,
sexually assaulted, and left.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.760
And after that, Jenny
was just-- she just

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.650
said she was just kind
of a broken heart.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.680
She had a heart attack.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:40.400
She said, she just didn't think
she would be able to go on.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:45.390
And then her granddaughter came
to her, and she said grandma,

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.705
I'm going to take care of you.

00:49:46.705 --> 00:49:49.430
I'm going to move in with you.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:54.140
And little by little,
they would walk

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.440
to the end of the
living room, and then

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.990
to the end of the
driveway, and then

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.650
to the end of the cul de sac.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.830
And slowly, little by
little, she began healing.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.300
And she says it's the
love, it's the love

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.180
between our grandchildren and
our families that heal us.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:26.080
This is Deborah Parker
and her daughter, Carla.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.310
Yeah.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.910
And Deborah's from my
tribe, the Tulalip tribe.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.106
She's awesome.

00:50:35.106 --> 00:50:36.230
I don't know how to say it.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.280
I mean, when i was teaching in
a tribal school for five years,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.160
every Friday Deb came
and played with the kids.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.170
And that kind of
leadership to me,

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:45.881
just-- she didn't
even have to talk

00:50:45.881 --> 00:50:47.380
about the kind of
leadership it was,

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.550
she showed up all the time.

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.350
And she's a major
advocate, and has

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.444
advocated on behalf
of native women

00:50:55.444 --> 00:50:57.860
during the fight to reauthorize
the Violence Against Women

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.035
Act, which was
held up in Congress

00:51:00.035 --> 00:51:02.410
due to specific provisions
that would protect

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.660
native women and
tribal sovereignty.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:09.440
She says of her work
on VOWA, "As a survivor

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.240
of domestic violence, I
knew that I would someday

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.370
be able to help another person.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.960
I didn't really understand
the magnitude of the work

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.640
that I would be doing once
I became the vice chairwoman

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.680
of the Tulalip tribes.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.070
I don't think anyone
could have seen it coming,

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.310
but I think my spirit new.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:30.850
Because that flight to D.C. was
one of the most unique flights.

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:36.060
I was very quiet, and I knew
something was coming forward.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.480
And when you are asked
to protect someone,

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.330
when you are asked
to protect a nation,

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:46.890
it's just what you have to do.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.260
You armor up, you warrior
up, and you protect the women

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.050
in your nation.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.740
It's a great honor to
do so, and all I can do

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.030
is pray that I'm
able to speak justice

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.910
toward the missing in
murdered indigenous women.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.990
Every person deserves
to receive justice."

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.030
And you know something
incredible has recently

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:10.410
happened?

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.970
Deborah has advocated for
our tribal court system

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:16.480
to switch over to a
restorative justice system.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.140
We will no longer be
imprisoning our people,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.240
we will only be working
towards rehabbing our people.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.240
And it's because
of women like this

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.595
that we're able to see
major change in communities.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.770
How are you guys doing?

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:34.306
You doing all
right, you with me?

00:52:34.306 --> 00:52:37.590
Damn, I know this is heavy.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:38.860
It was hard for me, too.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.732
Take a deep breath.

00:52:40.732 --> 00:52:42.120
You can laugh if you want.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.036
I'm just kidding, don't
laugh, it's not funny.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:48.470
This is Doctor Mary
Evelyn Belgarde.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.740
She's from the Pueblo of
Isleta in Okay Owinge.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.900
She's a retired professor
of Indian education

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.850
from the University
of New Mexico.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:57.900
She's collaborated
and establishing

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.490
several charters schools
focused on indigenous education.

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.340
She has raised funds to support
thousands of native students.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.730
She is very passionate
about training

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.030
culturally competent
teachers to work

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.310
within indigenous communities.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:15.000
She's well versed in the
history of boarding schools

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.880
and governmentally engineered
systems of education

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.120
and assimilation.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.690
And during our
conversation, she asked

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:29.810
when are we going to stop
asking our children to choose

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:34.820
between cultural education
and Western education?

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.230
I think we're ready to stop
the assimilation process.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.844
The time to change is right now.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:49.555
This is Miss Helen.

00:53:52.752 --> 00:53:54.210
I've never talked
about Miss Helen,

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.380
I just took this
photo three days ago.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.340
And she's not in the show, but
I was so moved by my experience

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.830
when I met her, I had
to share it with you.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:11.880
Miss Helen is 87 years old,
and miss Helen is blind

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.120
and she's only able to
hear out of one ear.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.860
And I just came from
Nevada, I was visiting

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.100
all of the Piaute tribes.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.946
And they all said to me, Matika,
you have to go meet Miss Helen.

00:54:23.946 --> 00:54:27.470
And it's way out in the
desert, it's like four hours,

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:32.620
way out there, nothing but res.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.220
I'm like, all right I'll go.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.900
I didn't know why
I was going, I just

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.800
knew I was going
to meet Miss Helen.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.920
And I show up there,
and I'm greeted

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:47.099
by Bird Man-- that's his name,
Bird Man-- and Miss Patty.

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:49.640
And they're the kind of folks
that greet you in the driveway.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.140
They come out and they wave and
they show you where to park,

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.990
and they immediately
feed you, and then

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.240
they start telling
me their story.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.940
Bird and Patty met
on this spirit walk,

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:05.836
and they fell in love, and then
Miss Patty contracted cancer,

00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:07.210
and decided that
she wasn't going

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.810
to pursue Western
methodology of treatment,

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.750
and decided that she
needed to move home.

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:17.640
And when they got
home, there's only

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.220
in Lovelock Paiute there's
only 300 tribal members.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.980
There's about 30 homes
there, and miss Helen

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.740
is the last Piaute language
speaker of their community.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.320
And they brought me
over to meet her,

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.819
and they said-- so I sat
down with her and I said,

00:55:35.819 --> 00:55:37.485
Miss Helen, I want
to take your picture.

00:55:37.485 --> 00:55:39.318
She goes, ah, what do
you want to take-- you

00:55:39.318 --> 00:55:40.570
don't want to take my picture.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.286
I don't even look good.

00:55:42.286 --> 00:55:46.180
Find some young, cute girl.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.920
And I said, well,
Miss Helen, I've

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.100
been sent by all the
Piatues to meet you,

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:56.320
because I understand that you're
the last language speaker.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.550
And miss Helen started crying.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:08.050
And she's like, it's true,
I am the last person here

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.310
I have left to talk to.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.350
And then, Bird and Patty
brought over these little kids,

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.850
like these seven
and eight-year-olds

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:19.930
who they had been teaching
songs to sing to Miss Helen.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:23.240
And man, I gotta tell you--
I was driving away from them

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.220
my way to come here.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.689
And I just had to
pull over and cry

00:56:26.689 --> 00:56:27.980
for a little bit in the desert.

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.130
Imagine losing an
entire language.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.220
That's where we're at right now.

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.299
That's happening all
over Indian country.

00:56:45.299 --> 00:56:46.840
And that's why it's
a great privilege

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.200
to be here with you smart kids
and you smart folks tonight,

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.970
because we're the
type of folks that

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:55.330
can do something about that.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:58.970
And that's powerful and
profound, and moving.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.759
And that's why I
feel honored to get

00:57:01.759 --> 00:57:03.550
to take pictures of
people like Miss Helen,

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:05.180
and share their story with you.

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.010
This is Miss Jo Re
[? Lefrends, ?] and

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.780
she's a student at Dartmouth.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.255
And I took this
photo at Crow Fair.

00:57:17.255 --> 00:57:18.820
Any of y'all been to Crow Fair?

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.880
I know you've been
to Crow Fair, Frank.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.740
You know, Crow Fair is like
this rodeo and this pow-wow,

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.220
and there's like a
thousand teepees set up,

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.970
and I'd never stayed
in a teepee before.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:34.820
Like I'm from Longhouse people,
we don't stay in teepees.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.630
And I went out to Crow
Fair, and I'd never even

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:40.609
like-- I hadn't ever
rode a horse like this

00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:41.900
and been in this kind of place.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.960
Anyway, the point
is, when I met Jo Re,

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.750
I was amazed by her
strong commitment

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:52.560
to her culture to going home
every year to be a part of Crow

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.680
Fair, and to also
at the same time,

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.830
be this powerhouse student,
wavering through the experience

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:05.190
of being a young indigenous
person in a place that

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:08.900
doesn't mirror herself.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:13.660
And I think it's worth
seeing in a place like this.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.730
It might be time for us to
create fostering and nurturing

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.090
environments for our
Indian students to succeed.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:24.080
This is what we know
50% of native students

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.070
drop out of high school.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.930
10%, 5%?

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.380
5% go on to college.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.220
10% of those students
graduate from college.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.940
That's a major achievement gap.

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.642
So when we meet young
ladies like Miss Jo Re,

00:58:41.642 --> 00:58:45.460
we have to acknowledge
how profound it

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:50.150
is that she is there, and thank
her for her incredible courage.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.116
I'm almost done, Yukio.

00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:58.030
I'm just kidding.

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.081
You guys still with me?

00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:02.580
Yeah?

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.560
OK, good.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:10.260
This is Miss Rowan White,
and she's a seed keeper.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.160
Isn't that amazing?

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.450
She taught me one
of the greatest

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.350
lessons I've learned to date.

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.970
Honestly, I didn't
even take this picture.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:23.490
This is another photographer
that took this picture.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:24.490
Mr. Kristine.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:28.480
And I met Rowan at
the Seed Conference,

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.220
and she was handing out all of
these indigenous seeds that she

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.000
had gathered and collected
from all over the country,

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.750
encouraging our native sisters
to return to the ancestral

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:42.710
position of holding seeds.

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:49.280
She tole me something
that totally blew my mind.

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:54.900
She said, you know what happens
Matika, when we grow food?

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.560
I really, like, I fish.

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:06.800
She says, when you plant
corn, and you go out

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.780
and you talk to that corn
every day, and you sing to it,

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:13.020
and you pollinate
it, and you water it,

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.650
you develop this
incredible relationship.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.510
And then you're able to
feed it to your babies.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.310
And what happens
when you harvest

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:25.650
it is you realize that
from that one seed

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:31.250
you planted, what you get
is 1,000 seeds in return.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.100
We realize that the
earth is plentiful,

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.720
and there is always
enough to share.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.410
There is always
enough to give away.

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:46.600
And when we participate in
the Western capitalist system,

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.350
we learn that
scarcity is the truth.

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:54.060
We learn that we
all need our own.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.110
We need own house,
we need your own car,

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:57.430
we need our own families.

01:01:03.346 --> 01:01:04.940
The earth is abundant.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:13.040
And she told me, she said--
I'm going to read to you some

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.180
of her words.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.380
She said, "I've been asked to
be a vessel for their stories.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:20.920
I'm a Mohawk woman, who comes
from a long line of people

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.720
who have tended
to soil and seeds

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.300
with reverence and devotion.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.900
And it is through
these relationships

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.690
with plants and seeds
that I'm finding my way

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:34.480
home to a deeper understanding
of the magic of being human.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.260
It is my hope that through
our educational offerings

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.460
that the seeds of hope can come
alive in the hearts and minds

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.890
of people all over this earth.

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:51.180
The message of the seeds is the
embodiment of hope and healing.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:57.120
They are saying, we are still
here, we are still vibrant,

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:15.350
we are interconnected, we
helped nourish each other."

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.220
I just think that's profound.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.470
I don't mean to awkwardly
pause for you, and for you

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.880
all not to know what to do.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.230
But to me, that's
incredibly powerful,

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:27.060
and it moves me every
time I think about it.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.410
In pre-European matrilineal
land based native America,

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.370
this was self evident.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:36.940
Women then were responsible
for managing food preparation

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.195
and distribution, along with
developing all children.

01:02:39.195 --> 01:02:41.740
And with such,
critical roles were

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.370
naturally prized and respected.

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:45.640
And in their remarkable
knowledge and cultivation

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.240
of the earth, native
women realized

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.890
a compelling interior truth,
that the created world was

01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:56.150
abundant, based on their
experience of the land's

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.990
plentiful potential
generosity and altruism

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:01.620
should be core human values.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.870
Women advocated this truth
in their prominent standing

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:10.750
in the order of tribes, and set
an overwhelmingly humane tone,

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.220
and so much else.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.670
In our tribes,
there was no thought

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.910
of women being less or
subject to mistreatment

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.500
because they were female.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.040
It was with the
arrival of whites,

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.260
an alien model of resource
taking and control

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:30.360
of intentional profit
oriented scarcity took hold.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.180
And along with other
unfathomable cultural

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.740
destruction, women's land based
practices, values, and status

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.150
were lost.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.310
Native Americans entered
a horrifying systemic

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:47.000
displacement of estrangement
from the natural giving world.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.870
King explains that stories
are wondrous things,

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.860
and they are dangerous.

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.220
It leaves us with the hope that
if we create better stories

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.540
and stopped believing
in dangerous stories,

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.170
we can create a better world.

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:09.290
Because the truth about stories
is that we get the world

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:11.030
we imagine.

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:15.910
And in that sense, we
get the world we deserve.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.390
So thank you so much, my
friends and relatives,

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.370
for listening, as I
share about my encounters

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.340
with our mothers, our
sisters, our grandmothers,

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.440
our indigenous women.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.270
Native female advocates
for tribal women

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:34.200
well understand and
emphasize that our plight

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.285
is a longstanding consequence
of the destruction

01:04:37.285 --> 01:04:42.470
and disruption of our
inherently matrilineal cultures.

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:46.560
Our indigenous stories,
knowledge systems, and values,

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.920
deserve appropriate
representation

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.640
in cultivation in places such
as Radcliffe and Harvard.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.460
Our women deserve the right
to express those stories,

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.340
their individualism,
and their bodies,

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.990
free of social fictions and the
dysfunction long imposed on us.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:12.950
And for all of us in
our shared heritage,

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:17.840
there is a rich transference
of power and possibility

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.110
when we decide to
accept and learn

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:25.560
of the indigenous narrative
and identity of this land.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.790
So [NON-ENGLISH]
thank you so much.

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:35.700
And before I end, I'd like
to do something that is super

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.960
traditional to where I'm from.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.600
And I hope you'll
allow me that moment.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.380
I'd like to ask-- The gallery
you're about to go into,

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.650
it was a labor of love.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.010
And it took a lot of people
to put that labor of love

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:53.970
together.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:58.340
And so, I'd like to thank those
people in the traditional way

01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.980
of where I come
from, so I'd like

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:03.590
to ask Mr. Yukio, if you could
come on stage for a moment.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:10.790
OK, come stand here, Yukio.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.290
Now, where I'm from,
when somebody honors us,

01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:22.090
we wrap them in this way.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:25.210
And so, I say to you, Yukio,
thank you for all of your help,

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:28.200
and for putting up
with my crazy schedule,

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.150
and my phone calls
from the Grand Canyon.

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:34.110
[NON-ENGLISH]

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.030
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.570
Mrs. Cohen, would you join
us for a moment, please?

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.070
Now, where I come from, when we
go, from [? on a potlatch, ?]

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:08.370
and we go to the canoe
journey, and when

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.740
we go to a new place,
the first thing we do

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.160
is we thank the leaders
for them inviting us

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.390
and for them allowing us to be
on their indigenous territory.

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.740
And so, I thought, who is
the chief of Radcliffe?

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:28.510
And my mom said, Matika,
you have to thank the chief.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:29.580
And we were like, hmm.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.056
And so we decided that
that chief was you.

01:07:32.056 --> 01:07:34.228
So thank you so much.

01:07:34.228 --> 01:07:40.027
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:40.027 --> 01:07:41.110
That's a Louie Gong y'all.

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.380
That's kind of a big deal.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.340
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.400
You're dealing with Indians
y'all, we're long winded.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.518
So, Miss Adrienne Keene.

01:07:53.518 --> 01:07:55.893
Dr. Adrienne Keene, everybody.

01:07:55.893 --> 01:08:01.190
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:03.520
When you go into the
gallery this evening,

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.320
what you will have
accompanying the images is

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.630
a collection of stories, some
of them I read to you tonight.

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:13.500
And the truth is, I'm a
photographer, I'm not a writer,

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.610
and Miss King is an
incredible writer.

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:20.370
And so she graciously helped
me write these stories

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:24.590
with her beautiful, inspiring
mind and intelligence,

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:29.399
and also put up with me,
trying to navigate places

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.120
like Harvard.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.990
And for that, I feel incredibly
honored for her friendship,

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:41.450
and for her steadfast
dedication to Indian country.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:45.089
She just became a
professor at Brown?

01:08:45.089 --> 01:08:47.213
A professor, at Brown, in Ivy.

01:08:47.213 --> 01:08:48.626
Yay, Adrienne!

01:08:48.626 --> 01:08:51.452
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.620
I'm going to give her this
shawl that my mama gave to me

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.101
a few years ago on my birthday.

01:08:58.101 --> 01:08:59.309
I thought it was appropriate.

01:09:06.455 --> 01:09:10.856
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:14.270
OK.

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:21.430
I'm sorry, but
we're not done yet.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:26.420
Miss Becky, Meg, Paul, and Mark.

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.134
Could you please join us?

01:09:29.134 --> 01:09:32.062
Mr. Mark Hunter.

01:09:32.062 --> 01:09:33.038
No, Mark.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.170
For Miss Becky, we
have brought from her

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:49.979
from our traditional territory,
a weaving of the baskets.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:53.300
Some say it's used-- we
put it-- when I was young,

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.920
they told me we wear this
basket around our neck,

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.540
and it tells us whether
we're single or not.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.650
If the basket lain empty,
you're looking for a husband.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:07.815
So I would suggest that
you fill this basket.

01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:09.763
Thank you so much.

01:10:09.763 --> 01:10:13.172
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:21.380
This was recently gifted
to me by the people

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.530
from the Lovelock Paiute tribe.

01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:26.910
They told me to
think of the children

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:31.240
when I wore this necklace, and
they asked me and thanked me

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.440
for my work that we're doing
to advocate for children.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.450
And so I pass it to
you, in that spirit

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.750
and I thank you for you work.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:42.145
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:53.810
Hold on.

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.830
I'm sorry, y'all.

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.660
I know, where did it go?

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.330
Here it is.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.820
For you, Ms. Meg, I
brought you some bling.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.490
She's the gallery
director, curator, manager.

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:10.660
She was the one that was
willing to text message me,

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.060
and she's the one that
helped me hang everything.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.242
And you see, it
takes a whole tribe

01:11:15.242 --> 01:11:16.700
to make something
like this happen,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.254
and so I think her in that way.

01:11:19.254 --> 01:11:22.600
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.230
Everybody, this is
my Uncle Mark Hunter.

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:31.620
Say hello, Uncle Mark Hunter.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.360
He was going to kill me
later for doing this,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.460
but I have to tell you
that he's my guiding

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:41.550
force and my strength.

01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:44.100
And he will call me in
the middle of the night

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.520
as I'm driving down
long roads, and he'll

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.430
negotiate my contract
because he's an attorney,

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:51.650
and he will help me.

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:54.710
And he helps me write,
and he sings me songs when

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.050
I can no longer drive anymore.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:00.360
And I adopted at
him with fry bread

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.270
when I was just a wee child.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:05.510
And I think it was probably
the smartest thing I ever did.

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:09.230
So, my mom had this
medallion beaded for him,

01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:12.280
for Project 562,
and so we thank you,

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.732
oh Brown, for everything
you do for us.

01:12:14.732 --> 01:12:19.196
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:44.290
Yes, of course, and so--
I know that you're all

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:46.130
anxious to see the
work, and to stand up,

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:47.770
so I just want to
thank you one more

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:49.730
time for all of you coming out.

01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.130
It's a real pleasure
and honor for me,

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:55.630
and I really want you to know
that I feel super blessed

01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:57.740
by your presence this evening.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.970
And I hope that you've
learned something in the way

01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:03.060
that I've shared, and I hope
it's been useful for you.

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.790
And I'm very moved to
be here with you, so

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:09.590
thank you so much for coming.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.090
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:14.740
