00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:03.598
- Let's tackle some exercise
with picture graphs,

00:00:03.598 --> 00:00:05.049
and once again, I'm using the Khan Academy

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.558
exercise to do this.

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:09.995
It says, which towns had fewer sunny days

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:13.350
than Sparkle City in June?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.098
All right, so, if we look at
the picture graph down here,

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:22.771
each picture of a sun
represents six sunny days.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.755
We want to say which towns had fewer ...

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:26.941
what did they say?

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.189
Fewer sunny days in Sparkle City in June.

00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:33.365
Sparkle City is this one right over here.

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.751
Sparkle City had, let's see,

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:37.771
we have one, two, three, four, five

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.909
pictures of a sun.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:40.941
Each of those represents six sunny days.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.949
Five times six ...

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.824
Sparkle City had 30 sunny days in June.

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:50.564
Which of these had fewer
than 30 sunny days?

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:53.548
Well, you can just look at
the picture graph itself,

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:57.065
and all of Sunville, Shinny
Town, and Star Village,

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:59.035
they don't have as many of
these pictures of the sun.

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:01.170
They all had fewer sunny days.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.413
We actually don't even have to calculate

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:04.572
how many sunny days
each of these represent.

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.812
Although, if you cared, this
would be four times six,

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:07.973
this would be 24.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.295
This would be two times six or 12.

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:13.917
This would be three times
six or 18 sunny days in June.

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:17.051
All three of them, Sunville,
Shinny Town, and Star Village.

00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:19.477
Sunville, Shinny Town, and Star Village

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:22.995
all had fewer sunny days
than Sparkle City in June.

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:24.016
Let's keep going.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.709
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:28.834
The graph shows how
many mice a farmer found

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.794
in here field each day for five days.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.574
Which day did the farmer
find the same amount of mice

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:38.453
as on Wednesday and Thursday combined?

00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:40.055
All right, let's look at this.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:41.994
Each picture of a mouse

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:43.793
represents two mice.

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.272
See, on Wednesday and Thursday combined,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.770
there's two ways to think about his.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.418
On Wednesday and Thursday combined,

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:50.753
I have one picture of a mouse,

00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:52.471
and then two more pictures of mice.

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:55.004
That's a total of three pictures of mice.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.575
What other day do I have
three pictures of mice?

00:01:57.744 --> 00:02:00.116
Well, Tuesday I have
three pictures of mice.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.415
I could just pick Tuesday.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.017
Another way to think it is

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:08.173
on Wednesday, the actual number
of mice that were observed,

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:10.158
one picture means two mice.

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:11.887
Two mice on Wednesday,

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:13.768
four mice on Thursday,

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:16.218
because I have two pictures
each of them represent two mice.

00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:19.491
Two on Wednesday, four on Thursday,

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.884
so six total.

00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:24.286
You see on Tuesday we have
six mice were observed.

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:26.410
Once again, each of these
pictures represent two.

00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:28.755
Two, four, six.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.857
There you go.

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:33.618
All right, let's keep going.

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:37.555
Funland had blank
millimeters less rainfall

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:40.144
than Happyville in August.

00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.675
This right over here,

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:46.587
this is Funland, this is Happyville,

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:51.263
and each little raindrop picture
represents six millimeters.

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:53.843
Funville has two raindrop pictures,

00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:56.478
Happyville has four raindrops pictures.

00:02:56.478 --> 00:03:00.367
Funland had two less raindrop pictures.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.573
I had two less of these raindrops.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.855
Two less raindrops would be
two times six, it would be 12.

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.477
12 millimeters less
rainfall than Happyville.

00:03:11.477 --> 00:03:13.264
Another way you could
have thought about it

00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:16.689
Funland had 12 millimeters
of rainfall in August.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.069
Each of these six then 12.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.950
Each of these represent six millimeters.

00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:26.457
Happyville had six,
12, 18, 24 millimeters.

00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.186
12 millimeters verses 24 millimeters.

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:32.891
Well, Funland's going to
have 12 millimeters less.

00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.891
12 millimeters is 12
less than 24 millimeters.
