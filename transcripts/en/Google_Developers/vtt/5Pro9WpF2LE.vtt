MATTHEW CHIC: Hi,
my name is Matt.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm the Chief Commercial
Officer for FlatClub.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.490
We're a marketplace for booking
medium-term accommodation.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.820
And I'm going to tell
you how non-developers

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.840
can test beta product
features with Google Apps.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.020
So in our example,
we run a marketplace

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.630
for accommodation for
medium-term stays.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.960
And we found that a
common situation was

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.790
that our suppliers--
and, especially,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.740
our new potential
suppliers-- wanted

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.690
to know what type of guest
demand we were seeing,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.520
and what we had coming in.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.050
And on the flip side
of it, our guests

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.240
just wanted to ask us
for what was available,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.840
or what could be available.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.726
So, basically, they
didn't have any time,

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:49.350
and they wanted us
to just provide them

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.610
with a list of options
for accommodations

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.880
that they can book.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.590
So we wanted to see if we
can better match the two,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.090
instead of in a
typical marketplace,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.519
where you search
through listings

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.970
and look for something to book.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.010
And we thought we could
accomplish the two goals, which

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.190
was proving to the suppliers
that we had a lot of demand

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.200
coming in, and, then, meet the
goal for their guests, which

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.450
was that they just wanted
to get options sent to them.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.825
They didn't want
to take the time

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:20.730
to actually look for something.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.940
So our method for
testing this out

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.710
was to do everything via very
basic forms, spreadsheets,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.514
and email.

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:36.180
We had already been
collecting the guest searches

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.310
and that criteria.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.090
We needed budget to
actually facilitate

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.960
a supplier making an offer.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.370
So we set up a basic form.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.500
Asked the guests
that were incoming to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.570
just instead of searching,
to fill out the form,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.900
say what they were looking
for, their ideal budget.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.090
We set up the form so that
it automatically populated

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.730
a sheet.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.560
And when we had enough
requests to look pretty good

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.969
for the suppliers, we
sent out-- just copied

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.010
and pasted the table, put
it right into an email,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.440
and sent it to our group.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.932
And we did this to an initial
batch of about 200 suppliers,

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:16.390
and got the highest
engagement rate

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.810
we had ever had on
anything that we

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.101
had done so far in the product.

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:23.650
The call to action
in the email was just

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.320
to reply with the
bid and your offer,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.130
and a link to the
property that you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.580
wanted to send them, which
was quickly unmanageable.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.160
So we did iteration two
of the Cloud App system.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.400
So we did another form, just
where the suppliers could see

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.871
all of the requests ID'ed on a
sheet that they themselves were

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.120
looking at right in the Cloud.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.779
And then they went to the
form, and put in the ID,

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.320
and then put in the
same information.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.140
So that facilitated our process
of backing the other way.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.097
The offers came into a sheet.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:00.430
We sent it out to the guests,
and then brought them back

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.751
into the website by opening
up a communication thread.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:11.182
And it was probably we did this
over about two weeks of really

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:13.390
getting the language that
we wanted to use correctly,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.929
the information that we
needed to collect correctly,

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.470
the format of the
information that we

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.080
needed to present correct.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.610
And then we started to
build a beta product.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.850
And the progression from
doing that system interacting

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.550
with our suppliers, to the
first, second, and third,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.470
and now present
iterations of the product

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.410
was something that
everyone really

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.750
liked and were
very impressed by.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.560
So there's a couple benefits
for non-developers to use

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.430
out-of-the-box Cloud tools
to test beta products.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.880
The first one is that they are
very easy for your customers

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.730
to understand.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.610
So if you are testing a product
concept or a new process

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.254
that you want to do with your
existing user base, using

00:03:58.254 --> 00:03:59.670
things like
spreadsheets and forms

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.050
and just communication on
email, anyone on your team

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.990
can execute the project.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.110
Your customers can understand
what's going on very easily.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.870
They can feed back
to you immediately.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.480
And then when it
comes time to build,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.510
your non-development team can
have a much more productive

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.170
conversation with
your development team.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.980
And at the end of really
doing some testing,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.940
the non-development
team has come up

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.020
with a system and a
series of processes

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.864
that can be directly
translated into the product.

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:30.280
The other benefit
is that when you

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.400
start on that level
with your customers,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.530
they're going to be very
impressed as you move up

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.571
the product development
cycle, and then give them

00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:40.480
something that
looks a lot better.
