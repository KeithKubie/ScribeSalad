00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.720
Perform a sequence of
transformations to try to map

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.980
the movable figure-- that's
this figure right over here--

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.590
onto C-O-R-A-L or CORAL.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.882
So C-O-R-A-L is this
polygon right over here.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:16.090
And then we have to figure
out, are these two figures

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.120
congruent?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.570
So they're congruent if,
through some combination

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.670
of translations,
rotations, and reflections,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.690
I can make this figure sit right
on top of figure C-O-R-A-L.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.510
So let's use this tool
right over here to do that--

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.621
to do some translations,
rotations, and reflections.

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.120
And so the first
thing I want to do,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.370
let me translate it so they
get close to each other.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.250
And let me see if I can
get one point in common.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.675
So just like that,
I've been able to get

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:44.550
this point in common.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.800
And it seems like, if these
are going to be congruent,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.874
that those would
correspond to each other.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:50.540
And now it looks
pretty clear that these

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.180
are reflections of each other.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.450
So let me reflect them.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.370
So it looks like if I were
to put my point right there

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.312
and if I go right
in between, it looks

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:06.270
like if I reflect right
along that, actually, I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.150
might end up being done.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.460
And I am done.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
So just with that little
translation followed

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.430
by reflection, I was
able to make these two

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.450
figures sit on
top of each other.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.960
So these are
definitely congruent.
