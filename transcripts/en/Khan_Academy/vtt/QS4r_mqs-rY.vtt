00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.280
Welcome to the second part
of the presentation on

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.770
basic trigonometry.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.580
In the last 10 minutes, I had
trouble getting in a lot of

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.280
examples, so I want to do a
couple more with you guys.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.780
OK.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.000
So, let me start over just
because this got messy.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.740
And we're just going to do what
we did in the last time around.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.310
So let me just draw
another right triangle.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.845
And make sure it's not
going to be too big.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.860
Here's my right triangle.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.270
And let me just throw
out some random sides.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.660
Let me say that this is 6.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.960
Let's make this side 5.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.730
And then, if this is a right
triangle, Pythagorean Theorem

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.890
tells us that this would be
the square root of what?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:55.420
36 plus 25 is equal to
the square root of 61.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.600
I think that's right.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.270
I've gotten feedback on some of
my other videos that I tend to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.840
get this type of
addition wrong.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.390
I malfunction sometimes.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.950
But anyway.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.230
So this side is the square
root of 61, and that's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.830
the hypotenuse.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.450
So let's get started
with some problems.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.720
If I were to give you--
if I were to ask you.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.300
Well, let's see.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.560
Let's call this angle theta.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.070
And I want to know what
is the tangent of theta?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.390
And we'll shorten that as
tangent of-- tan of theta.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.080
What is the tangent of
this angle right here?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.580
Well, you probably already
forgot what the definition

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.160
of tangent is.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.560
So I will repeat it.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.580
In fact, I will write
up in this corner.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.700
Soh cah toa.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.610
So I think now your brain might
be refreshed and you'll

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.760
remember that toa is the
mnemonic for tangent.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.000
And it says that tangent
is equal to the opposite

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600
over the adjacent.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.660
So the tangent of theta is
equal to the opposite side--

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.900
well, that's this side, that's
the side of length 5--

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.160
over the adjacent side.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.350
That's this side.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.010
The side of length 6.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.110
That's pretty easy, huh?

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.910
The tangent of theta is 5/6.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.410
And we'll just do
a couple more.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.860
All right?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.550
We'll just go through all of
the trig functions, or at least

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.300
the basic trig functions.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.250
What is the sine of theta?

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.780
Well, let's go back
to our mnemonic.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.480
Soh cah toa.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180
This is one of the few things
in mathematics that you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.630
should probably memorize.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.680
It's kind of a
funny word anyway.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.710
And soh-- to find sine.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.090
It tells us that sine is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840
Well, the opposite side,
once again, is 5.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.420
And what's the hypotenuse?

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970
Well, the hypotenuse, we
just figured out, was

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.145
the square root of 61.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.170
And a lot of people don't like
irrational denominators.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.150
So we can rationalize
the denominator.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.390
And we do that by multiplying
the numerator and the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.280
denominator by the
square root of 61.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.570
So if we say that this is equal
to 5 over the square root of 61

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.080
times the square root of
61, over the square

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.720
root of 61, right?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.600
We're just multiplying it by 1.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.940
Because this is the same
thing top and bottom.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.440
This equals 5 square roots of
61 over-- what's the square

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.350
root of 61 times the
square root of 61?

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.140
Oh yeah, it's 61.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.110
So the sine of theta is 5
square roots of 61 over 61.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.610
And then finally, let me
make some space here.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.915
Let me erase some stuff.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.420
Let me erase this
one right here.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.930
And you're probably still
wondering, OK, I kind

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.090
of get this whole sine,
tangent, cosine thing.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.430
What is it useful for?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.140
And all I can tell you right
now is, get to know how to use

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.500
these, soh cah toa, and in the
next presentation and onwards,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.410
we're going to show you that
trigonometry is actually

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.220
probably one of the most
obviously useful

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.660
things in math.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.900
You can figure out
all sorts of things.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.930
How far planets are, how
tall buildings are.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.130
I mean, there's tons of
things you could figure

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.010
out with trigonometry.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.260
And then later, we'll study
sine waves and cosine

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.460
waves, and all that.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.650
You'll learn that it actually
describes almost everything.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.990
But anyway.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.440
Going back to the problem.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.850
All we have left now is cosine.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.200
Oh, look how big that is.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.770
Cosine of theta equals-- we'll
go back to our mnemonic.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.840
Soh cah toa.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.820
Well, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.300
So once again, what's
the adjacent side?

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.530
Well, this is the angle we're
finding the cosine of, so the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.480
adjacent side is right here.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.100
So length 6.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.200
So it equals the adjacent
side, which is 6, right?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.300
And we figured out what
the hypotenuse was.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.200
That's this side.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.940
And its length,
square root of 61.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.130
And if we rationalize this
denominator, we get 6 square

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.320
roots of 61 over 61.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.110
It's kind of messy numbers.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.730
But I think now you get the
hang of figuring out-- if you

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.390
know the sides of a triangle--
figuring out what the sine, the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.380
cosine, or the tangent of any
given angle in that

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.290
right triangle is.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.890
And obviously, you can't figure
it out for this angle, because

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.010
for this angle the opposite
and the hypotenuse are

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.400
actually the same number.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.420
So actually-- never mind.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.950
You actually can figure it out.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.350
But it actually gives
something-- an

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.180
interesting number.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.830
So with that said, I will
finish this presentation.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.560
And in the next presentation, I
will show you how-- if we know

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.620
what the sine, or the cosine,
or the tangent of an angle is,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.860
and we know one of the sides--
how we can figure out

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.500
the other sides.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.020
See you in the next
presentation.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.320
Bye.
