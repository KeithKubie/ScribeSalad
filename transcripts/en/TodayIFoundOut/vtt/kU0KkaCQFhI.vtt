00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.980
While people have been sending messages back
and forth to arrange marriages sight-unseen

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.480
throughout history, the slightly more modern
concept of mail-order brides is generally

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.399
considered to have originated during the days
of the American Frontier- a region that, for

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.820
a time, was decidedly lacking in members of
the female persuasion.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.750
At the same time, the east coast of the U.S.
had something of a surplus of single ladies,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.460
especially following the Civil War.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.110
Thus, farmers, miners and ranchers frustrated
with the lack of women they didn’t have

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.560
to pay, but could rather woo with their abilities
with a spittoon and then start a family with,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.760
instead eventually took to placing ads in
newspapers across the country looking for

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
love.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.490
Single ladies on the other side, often motivated
by getting out of their present situation

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.000
and finding a devoted man, in turn likewise
took to placing ads for prospective husbands.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
Much like online dating today when matches
were found, the pair would invariably exchange

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.250
saucy letters and at a certain point even
photographs to see if they were suited for

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
one another.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.500
Also like today, this form of match making
came with a huge social stigma with it generally

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.360
considered that the men were just out to get
sex and exploit women, while the women were

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.450
out for financial gain of some sort, or in
more modern times just out for a green card.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.330
However, with exceptions, the reality for
the most part seems to indicate that, then

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.370
as now, the majority’s motives were not
nearly so sinister or selfish.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.090
As law professor and author of Buying a Bride:
An Engaging History of Mail-Order Matches,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.470
Marcia Zug, states when she started researching
the book, “I expected to find that… mail-order

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.720
marriages are fundamentally harmful and that
these problems are long-standing.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.800
I was surprised that this is not what I found.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.090
Despite significant risks, mail-order marriages
are typically beneficial and even liberating

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.090
for women.”

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.450
On that note, the ultimate goal for many men
in the days of yore was simply to find a companion

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.140
in life and someone to start and raise a family
with- pretty much like the motivations of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.420
more traditionally established relationships.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.819
Indeed, many of ads from men looking for brides
reflect this quite explicitly.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.840
For example, consider this one from one lonely,
and quite frank, 19th century man:

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.250
I inclose my photograf with My Full Description.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.250
It shows the features as nachel as can bee
only it is to Dark; I am very lite Complexion,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.200
Gray eyes, Orbon hair, 6 foot high, waight
190 lbs, inclined to be hump shouldered; A

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.090
Muskler Man and a widower 28 years old with
A Commen Schol Equations, but have Got Anof

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.500
to Atten to Enny Business, I am strictly Morrel.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.080
Don’t use tobacco nor whiskey…

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.460
I hav Only One Thing to Offer, And it is Neither
Lands Nar Gold.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.580
But a Strong Arm and a True Hart and will
lay Down My Life for the Rite Girl and Be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.870
Happy, for I am tired of living Alone.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.270
The girl that Steels my Hart and takes my
name for the Remainder of My Lif I will make

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.960
Happy, for I am hunting a Girl that I can
idolise and Make a Angel of.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.840
Of course, others just wanted a more traditional
arrangement for the day- love and emotional

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.180
companionship not really considered at all.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.000
Case in point, an Arkansas man who wrote in
1855:

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.470
Any Gal that’s got a bed, a coffee pot,
and a skillit; knows how to cut out britches,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.100
can make a huntin’ shirt, and knows how
to take care of children, can have my services

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.080
until death parts both of us.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.430
However, given a study concerning mail order
brides, conducted in 1890 by criminologist

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.990
Arthur MacDonald, this latter type of ad is
unlikely to have swayed the typical woman

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.500
looking to engage in such a mail-order relationship.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.630
He noted, much to his consternation, that
a large percentage of the women placing and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.959
responding to these ads were primarily looking
for a much more liberal and equal relationship

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.990
than they could get with their local stock
of men.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.180
As one woman he interviewed about her motivations
in taking part in such an arrangement noted,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.790
“I am very independent, and I have views
of my own which some people do not approve

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.790
of.”

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.680
Yet another stated, “I am tired of the society
act, and fancy I’d like just a tiny bit

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.000
of bohemianism.”

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.520
Also of note when reading these ads is that
the women are unusually forthcoming given

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.240
the time period they were written in, prompting
the aforementioned law professor Zug to surmise

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.500
that such ads were quite liberating for women
of the era as they allowed them “to take

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.150
a more active role in the courtship process”.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.039
For example, consider this very frank ad written
by a Missouri woman from 1910:

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.389
Attractive woman, not a day over thirty, would
be pleased to correspond with eligible man.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.770
Not absolutely necessary that he should be
young.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.240
Would prefer one with property, but one with
a good paying position would be satisfactory.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.150
The young lady is of medium height, has brown
hair and gray eyes, not fat, although, most

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.389
decidedly, she is not skinny.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.810
Her friends say she is a fine looking woman.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.020
Object matrimony.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.409
Reason for this advertisement, the young woman
lives in a little dinky town, where the best

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.800
catches are the boys behind the counters in
the dry goods and clothing stores, and every

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.490
one of them is spoken for by the time he is
out of his short pants.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.240
Or how about this excerpt from an ad placed
by a group of women from Calgary in 1916:

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.919
We have looked over the eligibles here, but
find most of them standing in front of the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.060
bar or out autoing with somebody’s else
wife.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.800
We don’t call them men.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.610
What we want is a real man with real brains
and real honor; a man who would like a good,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.069
clean wife and a good clean home and honor
them both…

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.039
Now, if some good bachelor with plenty of
backbone, brains and brawn; who keeps himself

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.759
scrubbed and brushes his teeth; who pays enough
attention to his fingernails to keep them

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.580
from going into mourning for past decency,
wants a home and a homey wife, and thinks

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.599
he can stand a little scolding once in a while
to give spice to life, we shall be mighty

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.969
glad to hear from him and all about him.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.580
Also yes, you read that last part right- this
ad was indeed written by a group of area women

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.129
looking for a potential male suitor.

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.550
Even a century ago, men looking for love had
to deal with ads about hot single women in

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.889
their area apparently.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.520
Not only that, but also similar to the modern
world of online dating, we even uncovered

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.279
a few 19th century news stories of men posing
as young women, fake profiles, pictures and

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.919
all, in such mail order bride ads.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.909
From the few stories we found, it would appear
the motive was primarily to make a fool out

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.749
of men who responded to the ads.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:14.999
In one case reported in the New York Times
in 1876, supposedly multiple men were involved

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:20.229
and even invited a prospective husband to
meet, at which point they doused him in sulfur

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.809
flour, paraffin oil, and pelted him with rotten
eggs as he ran away.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:29.729
Moving on to the modern day, the process for
finding a bride is a little more streamlined

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:35.809
with there existing nearly 3,000 mail order
bride agencies worldwide, around 500 of which

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:37.580
operate in the United States.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.469
For the most part, these agencies are functionally
similar to a more traditional dating service

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.430
with the goal being simply to facilitate meetings
between compatible people- just those who

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.800
sign up here are more explicitly looking for
marriage.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.710
Another major difference, at least in the
United States, is that such mail order bride

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.029
services must adhere to the terms of the The
International Marriage Broker Regulation Act

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.819
of 2005.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.639
In a nutshell, this requires the agencies
in question to perform extremely extensive

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.900
background checks on prospective male clients.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.879
Said background check will generally be used
to ensure the person has a clean record, and

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:18.720
will also be used to discern exact details
of one’s personal finances and marital status.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.669
This information is then fully disclosed to
women who are interested in a particular prospect

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.050
to help them make an informed decision.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.909
It is also required by law in the U.S. that
the agencies insure that no man on the service

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:36.259
can contact a given woman unless she gives
explicit consent for said individual to be

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:37.259
able to do so.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:42.619
In a nutshell the intention here is to protect
women from being taken advantage of or misled,

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:47.479
which naturally is a risk when brought to
a country that is wholly foreign to them,

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.189
often with little way to get back.

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:53.110
On this note, Zug notes, “The idea that
men are buying women and that the women have

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.189
no say, no free will, basically that they’re
trafficked [is not true] … mail-order brides

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.610
are very much, in most cases, in control.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.099
It doesn’t mean that it always works out.

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.940
But they know what they’re doing in the
sense that they believe that this is going

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.009
to be something that offers them an opportunity
to improve their lives.”

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:14.889
Of course, often in such modern potential
matches there exists a language barrier that

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.879
hinders progress in initial meetups.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:21.139
As such, most mail-order bride services offer
translation services, allowing clients and

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:25.879
prospective partners to communicate more effectively-
a service it should be noted most agencies

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:30.559
charge handsomely for, along with many other
fees leading to frequent accusations being

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:34.909
levelled against some agencies that they’re
just preying on emotionally vulnerable men

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.110
and attempting to milk them for all their
worth, with little care as to whether they

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.880
actually ever find a match.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.510
In fact, the longer it takes to find a match,
the lonelier they potentially get and the

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.399
more the company can make off them.

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.260
As one individual whose made something of
a career in trying to help men and women who

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.750
sincerely want healthy relationships find
each other, Mark Edward Davis, once put it:

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.800
“The online dating scene, their business
model, is designed to keep you on the website,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.410
feeding the meter, not finding a wife.”

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.960
Another popular service offered by some, but
not all, mail-order bride agencies is international

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.980
trips to meet prospective partners in person
at events not unlike singles mixers.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.850
Said events allow clients to meet in person
to see if there’s a spark, with translation

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.199
services often being on hand to facilitate
communication.

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:17.860
As you can imagine these trips aren’t cheap
and as such, limit the dating pool to reasonably

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.310
wealthy individuals.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.550
This all brings us around to the meat of the
issue- cost.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.690
Although mail-order bride agencies are hesitant
to reveal the amount of money they earn per

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.870
male client, it has been estimated that, even
beyond considering the normal costs associated

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.470
with the immigration process when marrying
someone from another country and attempting

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.190
to get them citizenship, most clients will
have spent between $6000 to $10,000 when all

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.550
is said and done.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.040
Because of the amounts here, this generally
sees the users of such services being older

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.709
men who are either independently wealthy of
have a large amount of money saved.

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:54.589
Again looking at more modern times, reasons
for using a mail-order bride service vary,

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:58.970
though most queried men report that they simply
became disenchanted with dating people in

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.220
their own area for various reasons, sometimes
just lack of any options, and other times

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.300
just lack of options that the person likes.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.060
As one gentlemen aptly put it, “after my
divorce I noticed that the dating pool was

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.290
very shallow, and wide.”

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.769
As previously alluded to, women who sign up
today report signing up for vaguely similar,

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:20.769
though slightly more varied reasons- mostly
centered around that they simply want a better

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:24.960
life for themselves in a better environment,
more freedom than they have back home, and

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.090
a stable and loving partner- a sentiment it’s
hard to disagree with since that’s more

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.720
or less what most people want from a relationship.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.630
On this note, as in the days of the wild west,
a curious trend noticed by experts who’ve

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.360
interviewed both men and women involved in
the mail-order bride industry is that: “The

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.339
mail-order bride business as it now operates
may be in the perverse position of attempting

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:49.370
to match independent, nontraditional women
with very traditional Western men.”

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.190
Or to put it another way, the mail-order bride
industry is in the hilarious position of trying

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.730
to match men with ultra conservative views
of marriage with confident, often very liberally

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.730
minded women.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.080
For example, as one man looking for love abroad
via a mail-order bride service stated, he

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.360
felt that his local women were, to quote,
“too interested in what I was worth.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.610
With women’s liberation in the USA, I had
them calling me, coming to my house.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.240
Before, the man called the woman when he wanted
to date her; the woman was not the initiator.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.120
Now is so different from what I grew up with,
so I thought that the best thing to do was

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.120
to meet someone that can’t just come to
my house.”

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.350
On this note in a study looking at why American
men who use these services so strongly go

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.690
for Latina women, it was found that the men
in question tended to be looking for women

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.670
who adhered more to the stereotypical classic
mold of a wife- dedicated to home and children

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.399
while letting the man take the lead in more
traditionally manly roles.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.519
As one such man stated, “The husband and
wife are equal partners in the family structure,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.759
though not the same.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:46.550
Men and women are different in physical and
mental abilities.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.470
I feel that the wife has her place in the
family structure, such as giving more care

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.879
to children, the house, and things of that
nature.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.639
The husband should take care of income and
things of that nature.”

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:00.650
On the other end, the Latina women generally
considered even these American men to be suitable

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.820
because they found them to be, to quote the
author of said study, “more faithful, less

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.290
jealous, and less chauvinistic than” their
local men.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.709
Or as one Colombian woman who ultimately married
an American man stated, “I met men in Colombia,

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:14.810
I was married, I had my experience.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.920
I decided to look for something different,
try men from another culture that might be

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.959
better than ours.

00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:24.019
American men are more serious; [they] worry
and respect their wife.”

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:28.540
On this note, in an attempt to explain this
seeming paradox, the aforementioned Marcia

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.269
Zug surmised in an interview with The Guardian
“that it’s all about perspective”, noting

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:37.569
that “for many of these women an unliberated
American man seems like a feminist” when

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:40.690
compared to the dating pool in their respective
countries of origin.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.689
Then again, it doesn’t seem like this is
all that big a deal considering what little

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:49.009
data we have access to suggests that the divorce
rates for marriages brokered by mail-order

00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:53.019
bride agencies are in the ballpark of the
rates for the average U.S marriage, though

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.170
of course the potential for deportation until
some level of citizenship or residency is

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:02.250
established perhaps provides extra motivation
to stay together, where someone found locally

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.569
might have just left a given bad situation.

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:07.899
On the male side of things, given the large
percentage of men with very traditional values

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:12.120
and views on marriage participating, they
likewise might be slightly more motivated

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.589
to stay together even in a bad situation,
both because of these views and also potentially

00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:20.250
knowing the possible consequences to the woman
should they divorce her.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.410
In any event, to sum up the answer to the
question posed- yes, you can indeed go online

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.630
and find a bride through so-called mail-order
bride agencies, and remarkably people’s

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.870
motivations both in the days of the wild west
and today in entering into such arrangements

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:45.600
seem pretty much to be the same, and not really
that different than the motivations most everyone

00:13:45.600 --> 00:14:18.249
has when wanting to find a companion in life.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:39.959
And 
for

00:14:39.959 --> 00:15:00.310
the curious, it turns out there are also mail
order husband websites out there, but as you

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:14.410
might expect, they aren’t nearly as popular
as

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.850
their lady-filled counterparts.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:38.970
Also 
for those curious- yes the author and editor

00:15:38.970 --> 00:16:04.999
of this piece’s suggested ads

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:20.839
were a complete mess after researching this
topic, even prompting the editor’s wife

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:31.499
to ask some pretty poignant questions when
later observing said ads that were coming

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:36.259
up on his computer…

00:16:36.259 --> 00:17:00.130
We’d also now like to apologize for the
ads you’re no doubt now getting thanks to

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:30.700
reading this piece.
