00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.300
[background noises]

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.734
[music playing]

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:08.100
[printer printing]

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.467
[music playing]

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.533
Some people gave a
tip to Public Citizen,

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.266
a Washington D.C.-based
non-profit organization,

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.000
about what appeared
to be some shady

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
water deals going on in
Central Valley of California.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.300
The first thing I
did was I looked

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.367
up the Kern Water Bank online.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.633
Google was in its early years--

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.400
more or less, 2003.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800
Well, it turns out it's
largely controlled by something

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.567
called "Roll International."

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.266
And when I called
their headquarters

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.967
and asked to speak to a
public relations person,

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:39.300
they said they didn't have one.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.333
And I said, "Well, to
whom should I address

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.800
any research questions?"

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.600
They said, "We don't give
information to the public.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.667
We suggest you don't
research us," and hung up.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:51.367
So I drive down to
Bakersfield and then followed

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.467
the directions out
to the address,

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:56.500
and I'm a little bit confused
because the sign outside says

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.333
"Paramount Farming Company"--

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.734
not "Kern Water Bank Authority."

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:04.033
Walk in the front door and
ask a receptionist, "Is--

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.767
the Kern Water Bank, do you
know where that office is?"

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.033
"Oh, yeah.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:08.800
They're just down
the hall," they said.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.300
It's like, "OK."

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.967
The Kern Water Bank is this
supposedly public entity,

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:16.400
and the members are a number
of different water districts--

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.200
water agencies, water
storage districts, and also

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.333
a private company
called "Westside

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.200
Mutual Water Company, LLC."

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.533
And I remember asking,
"Who are they?"

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.133
"Well, they're landowners."

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.433
"Well, what land do they own?"

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.533
"Well, they represent
their own land."

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.333
They didn't want to
mention the name "Paramount

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.033
Farming," which was
notable considering

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:38.333
where we were sitting--

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.533
which was inside
Paramount's office building.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.233
It seemed as if this is a
case of extremely valuable

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.200
public property, an essential
element of the state

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.767
public water system,
which had essentially

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:58.533
been given to a very
wealthy private company--

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:03.100
but really just one landowner,
one corporate farmer.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100
