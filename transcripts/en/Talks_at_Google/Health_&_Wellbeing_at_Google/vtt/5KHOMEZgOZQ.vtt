[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:08.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.142
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Well, thank
you very much for inviting me.

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:13.100
I've been hearing about
some of the other talks

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.210
that you've had.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.390
And I think they probably
all sound very much more

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.920
interesting than public health.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.990
It can seem to be a
bit of a dry topic,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.640
but it's also a
very broad topic.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.090
And so I thought I'd
start by asking you,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.270
what comes to your mind when
somebody says "public health?"

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.028
What sort of things
do you think of?

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:40.270
AUDIENCE: Flu injections.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.690
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE:
Flu injections?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.190
Yes.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.700
Yeah?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.150
AUDIENCE: Spread of
dangerous diseases--

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.110
spread of communicable disease.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.030
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Yes,
infectious diseases,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.055
communicable diseases.

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.852
AUDIENCE: Education on the
importance of exercise.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.310
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Education
on the importance of exercise.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.630
Well, this is a very
well-informed audience.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.450
These are all public
health topics.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.319
And just to give you an idea
of the breadth of the area,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.780
this is a diagram, which
was done some years ago

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.550
by some public health academics.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.950
It's called the Rainbow Diagram.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.800
They're talking about the
determinants of health.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.240
And these are all the
things which affect health--

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.060
lifestyle factors, social
and community networks,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.990
general socioeconomic
environmental conditions,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.210
with all sorts of
subsets under that.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.950
So all of those potentially
come under the topic

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.630
of public health.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.620
So just to try and segment
it a little bit more,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.820
it could be services,
systems, institutions.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.300
So it could be in
local government.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.610
It could be in the
National Health Service.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.950
It could be in a health
education agency,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.460
advising you about what
you should be doing.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.550
It could be a public
health profession.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.640
Back in history, it was the
medical officer of health.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.440
Nowadays, it might
be the director

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.060
of public health locally, or
it might be, in this country,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.780
the Chief Medical Officer.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.160
Some of you will have heard
of Dame Sally Davies who

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.660
is often in the media.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.150
Well, she's our Chief Medical
Officer in this country.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.890
She's the public health
supremo In the United States,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.689
it would be the Surgeon General.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.730
Then another way of thinking
about public health,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.750
it can be a form of
knowledge, a way of thinking.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.470
And so it could be
focused on a topic,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.280
like nowadays,
obesity or smoking.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.660
Or it can be broader, thinking
about individual behavior

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.820
and the individual's
responsibility

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.410
for their own health.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860
Or even broader still,
thinking about inequality

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.880
in society and how to deal with
that and the effects of that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.930
on health.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.290
Or it can be thinking about
things like the environment

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.660
and housing.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.070
So very many topics come
under public health.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.760
And the point that I wanted to
make today, being a historian,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.220
is that time also affects public
health, because public health

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.700
has not always been the same.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.840
The things that have been
focused on within public health

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.490
have changed over time.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.370
And that's what I
want to primarily

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.390
talk about today, because
it is a very huge topic.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.950
And so I'm going to look at the
development of public health

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.570
in the past, how
we've got to where

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.630
we are in the
present day, and I'm

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.240
going to very briefly look at
the past from the 19th century

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.740
onwards.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.210
But I'm going to focus
on four stages, really

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.810
since the Second World War--

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.620
the rise of a variant
of public health

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.960
called social and
community medicine.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.800
Then in the '70s, the rise
of lifestyle-- the focus

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.740
on lifestyle and
also on evidence,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.050
one way and the other,
in public health.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.360
Then on different versions
of public health-- health

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.880
promotion, new public
health, primary health care.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.320
And then finally, I'll
finish up by looking

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.800
at some of the recent
changes and directions

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.880
and where we might be going.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.050
Well, going back to the 19th
century and up until the 1940s,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.200
just very briefly to sketch
in how public health changed

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.000
in those years, if
we'd been talking

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.700
about public health
in the 19th century,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.150
we would have been talking
about housing, the environment,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.800
and in particular,
about sanitation.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.830
Public health meant
drains, because for much

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.100
of the 19th century, sanitation
drains were really absent.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.490
You will have read or heard
about the conditions as they

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.670
applied in large cities--
cities like London,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.070
the new industrial
cities like Manchester--

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.940
which were built
without much by way

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.080
of the provision of
public facilities,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.870
so houses that had no
sanitation whatsoever.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.230
So the key focus of public
health in the 19th century

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.600
was getting sanitary provision.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.820
It was an
environmental movement.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.450
But then by the end of the
19th century, change came.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.330
There was the Bacteriological
Revolution-- the discovery

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.180
that specific agents
caused disease.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.690
And so disease could
be dealt with not

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.890
by changing the environment, but
by dealing with the individual

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.880
who was diseased.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.710
So lots of treatments came
in for different diseases--

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.100
for cholera, for
typhoid, and so on.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.390
Then in the early 20th century,
public health changed again.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.510
There was a big focus at that
time on the hereditary nature

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.440
of diseases.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.520
People were thinking about
disease as being inherited.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.640
And they were focusing
on topics like alcohol.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.350
Alcoholism was seen
as something that

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.620
was inherited from one
generation to the next.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.450
They were focusing on
sexually transmitted disease,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.980
which was also
seen as transmitted

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.940
through the generations.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.400
And so the focus
of public health

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.690
came to be on women
as mothers and what

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.330
was called, in the
terminology of the time,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.340
the future of the race.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.730
That seems to be a very
rather eugenic sort

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.560
of terminology nowadays.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.560
But that was the language
at the turn of the 19th,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.750
the early 20th century.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.300
And then finally, in
the interval years--

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.790
the 1920s and the 1930s--

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.030
public health really
expanded its remit.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.310
And the public
health practitioners,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.920
the medical officer
of health would

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.510
be running not just preventive
services and health education

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.200
services, but also
running hospitals

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.350
and running health
services more generally.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.650
They took over running
health services,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.960
in particular in London.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.180
The London County Council
was very well-known

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.800
for its public health services.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.180
So I want to focus on
what happened next.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.740
And what happened next was a
big change for public health.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.260
And it developed
a new terminology.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.860
It became called social
medicine or community medicine.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.610
Now why was this?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.870
It was because new challenges
developed for public health

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.200
after the Second World War.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.350
It had confidently
been expected when

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.870
people were talking about the
need for a national health

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.990
service that that national
health service would

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.140
be focused on public health.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.160
It was intended
to be, originally,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.270
a local
government-focused service

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.000
run by public health
practitioners--

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160
the medical officer of health.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.020
Well, that didn't happen.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.270
We had the service that we've
got today in this country--

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.850
the National Health Service--

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.300
which is a much more
centralized service

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.640
not founded on public health.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.720
And so there was a need for
a new role for public health.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.230
And that caused a certain
amount of concern.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.950
Now another reason why there
was a new role for public health

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.309
was that the whole pattern
of disease, morbidity,

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.539
and mortality in the
population was changing.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.060
So just have a look
at this graph here.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.270
And you can see some of the
changes that were taking place.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.920
This is a graph from
1917 onwards up to 2007.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.480
So it's a 90-year period.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.280
But I think you can see
broadly the changes that

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.390
are taking place.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.370
The green line at the bottom,
which is infectious disease,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.290
is declining very rapidly.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.570
Just before and after the Second
World War and into the 1950s,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.290
it's almost gone
nowhere, really,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.260
from being quite important.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.490
And the other diseases--
cancer, which is the dotted,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.810
black line--

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:35.560
and circulatory diseases also
becoming proportionately more

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.910
important.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.470
So this was the change
which was happening just

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.360
before and after the
Second World War.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.730
It was what was called the
epidemiological transition,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.640
which was basically, the
old infectious diseases

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.160
were in decline.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.690
The role of public
health had been

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.300
to deal with some
of those diseases.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.390
And what was becoming much
more important were the chronic

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.530
diseases-- the sort of diseases
that we think about nowadays--

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.540
cancer, heart
disease, and so on.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.840
And across Europe-- and in
particular, in this country--

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.820
there had been
this establishment

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.540
after the war of
new health systems,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.110
but systems which were very
much focused on hospitals

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.100
and focused on sickness.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.490
People always said about
the National Health Service,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.270
it was a sickness service
rather than a health service.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.400
And public health, which had
been much more than that--

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.380
it had been about
preventing sickness,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.930
as well as dealing with it--

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.650
seemed to have lost its role.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.710
And so people started
to talk about what role

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.240
it could have in the future.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.020
And one of those roles,
which still, I think, echoes

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.480
down to the present
today, was something

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.800
called social medicine.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.340
And this was a very broad vision
amongst some public health

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.870
practitioners just before and
after the Second World War.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.800
This is a quote here from
one of the main practitioners

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.590
of social medicine-- a
man called John Ryle--

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.160
who was professor of social
science at Oxford University

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.210
in the 1940s.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.440
And he said social medicine
was the "whole economic,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.770
nutritional,
occupational, educational,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:25.570
and psychological opportunity
or experience of the individual

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.410
or the community."

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.070
So you can see that's
a very broad vision.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.740
It's not just talking
about people's

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.530
economic circumstances,
but it's talking

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.940
about their mental health, too.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.100
It's talking about psychology.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.470
And it's not just talking
about the individual.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.960
It's talking about the
individual in relation

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.480
to the community
where they live.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.180
Very broad vision indeed--

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.070
so it was very much health
seen as a positive condition

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.170
and also an attempt
to try and bring

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:02.480
greater academic credibility
to public health as well.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.080
So that was one vision
which people hoped,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.700
in the public
health field, might

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.570
form the basis of the
way health was conceived

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.570
and the way health
services were oriented

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.910
in the post-war period.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.880
But what happened
instead was something

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.160
which was a slightly more
limited vision-- something

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.950
called community medicine.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.830
And one of the
key proponents was

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.910
a man called Jerry Morris,
who was one of my colleagues

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.190
at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.520
He lived until the age of 99.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.850
And he was still coming into
work two or three days a week.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.800
So he only died about
six or seven years ago.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.010
But Jerry was one of
the key proponents

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.740
of community medicine.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.890
He wrote in the
late 1950s a book

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.970
called "Uses of
Epidemiology," which talked

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.400
about public health doctors--

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.670
and they all were
doctors at this stage--

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.210
moving into the
National Health Service

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.870
as consultant
community physicians.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.350
And in the Health Service, they
would undertake something which

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.410
he called community diagnosis.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.460
So they would be the people who
looked to the population, who

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.830
worked out what the
needs of that population

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.660
were, in terms of sickness and
prevention and healthy living,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.320
and they would help formulate
the way in which health

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.620
services were
structured and provided.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.990
And the key discipline
in all of that

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.790
was going to be risk factor--

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.510
epidemiology.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.870
So this variant of epidemiology
was the new science

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.350
of this new style
of public health.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.960
So that's, in effect, what
happened to public health

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.190
in this country.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.830
It moved into the
National Health Service.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.260
And only recently, as
we'll hear later on,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.240
has it come out of the
National Health Service.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.450
And this was all part
of a changing focus

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.660
within public health
towards lifestyle

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:16.780
and also towards using evidence
in a consistent sort of way.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.800
So the move was away
from infectious disease--

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.820
something causing a mass
pandemic or epidemic--

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.850
towards individual behavior
and lifestyle choices

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.430
as the cause of ill health.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.210
And the key research,
which I think set the tone

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.970
for all of that,
was the research

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.600
about the relationship between
smoking and lung cancer,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.230
which was done by
an epidemiologist

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.120
and a statistician, Richard Doll
and Sir Austin Bradford Hill.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.050
Both of them, just by chance,
working at my own institution--

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.390
London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.140
But I did know Richard
Doll, because he also

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.970
lived a very long time.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.300
I didn't know Bradford Hill.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.890
But they did this research in
the late 1940s, early 1950s.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.110
And originally,
interestingly, they

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.360
hadn't thought that
smoking was the cause

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.282
of the rise in lung cancer.

00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:19.990
They thought it might
have been something

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.750
to do with the
roads being tarred

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.960
and the fumes that were
given off by that happening.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.660
So they were quite
surprised when

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.640
they discovered
that there seemed

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.400
to be an association
between smoking

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.570
and the rise in lung cancer.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.900
And this was carried forward
by a very important report,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:46.020
which was published by the Royal
College of Physicians in 1962--

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.440
picture up there,
Smoking and Health.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.960
And again, that
committee which produced

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.870
this report of the Royal
College of Physicians

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.800
had originally been a committee
on smoking and air pollution.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.490
But they decided that smoking
was a much easier issue

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.900
to deal with than air pollution.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.740
And so they decided to focus
their report on smoking.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.710
And of course, air pollution
has now come back to haunt us.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.970
So epidemiology lay
behind all of this--

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.810
the element of risk
in populations.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.474
But what also developed--

00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:22.890
and I'll be showing
you an example

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.110
of this in a little while--

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.870
was a completely different
style of public health

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.420
using mass media campaigns
to try and change behaviors,

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.920
speaking to the
whole population,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.900
and trying to make
the population change

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.140
their lifestyle and
change their behavior.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.930
Well, another offshoot
of this change

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.170
in public health in
the post-war period

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.830
was a focus on health
services research

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.850
and the role of evidence.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.050
And this was another offshoot
from social medicine.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.320
Some of the social
medicine pioneers

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.630
moved off in a
different direction,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.260
trying to make health services
more effective and more

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.339
efficient.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.790
And a key person
in that area was

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.770
a man called Archie Cochrane.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.890
Some of you may have heard of
something called the Cochrane

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.950
Collaboration,
which still is very

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.310
active in the public health
and the health field.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.390
Archie Cochrane was a
social medicine advocate

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.750
who undertook random--
he was a prisoner of war

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.610
during the Second World War.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.490
He was in Japanese
prisoner of war camp.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.570
And he occupied himself by doing
randomized controlled trials

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.910
of diet amongst the prisoners
in his prisoner of war camp.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.280
And after the war, he
was a great proponent

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.970
of using evidence in
a more effective way

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.540
to try and get the right
outcomes in health.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.090
And he gave a very
famous lecture--

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.660
the "Rock Carling Lecture"--
in the early 1970s.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.020
And this led to a book
which is still cited today,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.180
"Effectiveness and Efficiency--

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.610
Random Reflections
on Health Services,"

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.440
which was trying to move
away from individual clinical

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.680
impressions as the basis
for treatment and the basis

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.090
for action in health
towards a much greater use

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.450
of a considered evidence.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.140
And of course, the gold
standard of that evidence

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.700
was the randomized
controlled trial,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.200
which is still very much
central to public health

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.500
and health services
more generally.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.310
But meanwhile, public health
was adopting this new style

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.030
of mass media campaign.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:49.290
And I'm just showing this as
an example of a campaign which

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.840
was run in the early 1970s by
a new agency called the Health

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.340
Education Council.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.980
Now I don't know if
you've got ideas of what

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.320
might be different about this.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.270
I've given you a
little clue earlier on.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.850
Some things are rather different
about this sort of campaign.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.450
But some things are
similar to things

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.690
in the past of public health.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.760
Can you think of anything
that's different here?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.925
I know this is hard, because
you're not history students.

00:19:25.192 --> 00:19:26.680
AUDIENCE: Very graphic.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.650
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: It's
very graphic, yeah.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.242
It's using shock, isn't it?

00:19:32.242 --> 00:19:33.450
Maybe you're not shocked now.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.500
We're used to nudity.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.450
But certainly in
the early 1970s,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.440
I think this was unusual
for a health campaign.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.800
So it's using shock to
attract your attention,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.896
to try and change your behavior.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:51.241
AUDIENCE: Nowadays, we
wouldn't put so many words

00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:52.189
on the poster.

00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:53.230
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Sorry?

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.078
AUDIENCE: Nowadays, we
wouldn't put so many words

00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:55.540
on the poster.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.831
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: That's true.

00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:57.490
Yeah.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.830
But then it was quite
limited in terms of words.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.120
AUDIENCE: It's very
accusative as well.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.980
I feel nowadays, it
would be more soft

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.240
and advisory, rather than
straight-on aggressive.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.240
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Yeah.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.800
It's pointing the finger
and saying, you're to blame.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.370
Isn't it?

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:15.950
Yeah.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.360
Yeah, it's true.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.995
Yeah?

00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:25.300
AUDIENCE: The text is less
legible in the essential parts.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.902
Today's cigarette packets
have big, big, red letters--

00:20:28.902 --> 00:20:29.860
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Yes.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.850
Yeah, that's true.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.430
AUDIENCE: It doesn't highlight
the "smoking kills" part.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.900
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE:
No, that's true.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.400
Well, it's a different subject
for a public health poster.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.350
Before the war,
it might have been

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:49.870
things like, well, cleanliness
or preventing infection

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.990
or something like that.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.310
So having a smoking-focused ad--

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.590
I know nowadays this
is nothing new--

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.460
but in the 1970s, it was
quite new to have this sort

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.860
of campaign around smoking.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.100
And the Health Education Council
was spending a huge amount

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.900
of money in the '70s
just on smoking and using

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.790
the mass media.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.010
The other interesting
thing about--

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.950
well, many interesting
things about this ad--

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.890
but it was produced for the
Health Education Council

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.070
by an agency,
Saatchi and Saatchi,

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.780
who obviously went on to
greater things after this.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.060
But Saatchi and Saatchi
first made their name

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.220
in the health education field.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.670
And they're bringing those
advertising techniques--

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.920
American advertising
techniques, really--

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.870
and the art of persuasion
into the public health field.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:49.150
But interestingly-- and I don't
expect you to pick up on this--

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.165
they are using a very
old-fashioned topic,

00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:56.440
aren't they, because
they're using women

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.110
as the ones who are
at fault, and they're

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.270
using women as mothers.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.220
So women are the people
who are producing

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.280
babies who are going to be
affected by their smoking.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.110
So women are being blamed.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.540
Now I have to say, this
is a very common theme

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.970
within public health.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.880
And it certainly
goes back to the turn

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.650
of the 19th, 20th century when
we had that theme of women

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.880
as mothers.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.700
So there are some
new things here,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.510
but also, there are some
very old things, too.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.350
And that has continued, I think.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.080
But public health also
continued to redefine itself.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.850
And I want to talk about just
three other definitions--

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.100
health promotion,
new public health,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.380
and primary health care.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:53.860
And this came out of a period
in the 1970s, 1980s of an attack

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.460
on mainstream medicine.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.160
I mentioned that after
the Second World War,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.470
there was a great focus
on health services,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.270
on high tech medicine.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.730
Public health seemed
to have lost its role.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.170
Well, by the time of the 1970s,
that enthusiasm for high tech

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:16.550
medicine had gone, and it had
gone for a number of reasons,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.050
I think.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.060
Firstly, because
of the rising costs

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.340
of health care after the oil
crisis in the early 1970s.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.650
And people began to
think, do we really

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:32.380
need all these expensive
centralized health services?

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.350
Should we be trying
to think of lower cost

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.650
ways of preventing ill
health in the population

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.410
rather than dealing
with poor health

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.960
when it gets to a
crisis situation?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.790
So that was one strand.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.110
But the other strand was a
critique of medicine itself,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.200
saying, did it
actually do any good?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.730
And this is something that all
sorts of disciplines joined in.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.740
The sociologists
were there and also,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.650
the social medicine people.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.680
A key leader in this was a
man called Thomas McEwen,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.980
who was professor of social
medicine at Birmingham

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.950
University.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.330
And he wrote this book,
which I've got up here,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.350
"The Role of Medicine--

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.040
Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis?"

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.170
and basically argued
that official medicine--

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.260
orthodox medicine, high
tech interventions--

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.420
did much less good than
improving the general health

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.130
of the population.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.880
And so this was obviously
leading right into a renewed

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.040
role for public health.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.820
And three variants of public
health came on the agenda

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.210
in the '70s, '80s, '90s.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.020
The first was
primary health care,

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.430
which was given its
seal of approval

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.300
through the declaration
of Alma Ata in 1978,

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.300
which was a desire to
move out of the hospital

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.810
into the provision of primary
health care services--

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.390
services at the community level.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.110
And then that got mired
into debates between,

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.340
was it best to have horizontal
primary health care, which

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:20.080
was basically a broad vision
of health services and systems,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.850
or was it better to have
vertical primary health

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.600
care, which would be
primary health care

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.146
focused on a few conditions?

00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:30.520
And that was something which
obviously appealed much more

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.960
to international donors who
became important in this area.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.890
Then there was a variant
called health promotion.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.510
And that came through a number
of documents-- the WHO's

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.180
"Health for All" and
also, the "Ottawa Charter

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.970
for Health Promotion"
in the 1980s.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:54.320
And I think that's a point to
make about this initiative.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.560
There was a very strong Canadian
influence in health promotion.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.160
And I've got off on the slide
there a report which came from

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.840
the Canadian Minister of Health,
Marc Lalonde, in the '70s--

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.930
"A New Perspective on the
Health of Canadians"--

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:15.060
which was very much focused on a
whole person, whole environment

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.210
and community
approach to health.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.830
And then there was
something called

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.430
new public health, which was
a kind of medical version

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.040
of health promotion.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.280
And that attracted a
certain amount of criticism,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.650
because people felt that
public health should

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.010
be a multi-disciplinary
initiative.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.680
And so there was a
push internationally,

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.020
but in particular,
in this country,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.731
to try and get something called
multi-disciplinary public

00:26:42.731 --> 00:26:43.230
health.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.650
So nowadays, if you want
to undertake public health

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:52.440
as a career, you don't have to
be medically qualified anymore.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.590
So they were quite successful
in that initiative.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.480
Well, what's happened recently?

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.340
Let's finish off by
talking about some

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.232
of the things which
are now on the agenda.

00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:10.440
Well, one of the interesting
things that's happened--

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.800
and it's very much visible.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.730
There's stuff in the
papers today about the EU

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.590
is going to prosecute I think
the British government, number

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:29.760
of cities across Europe,
well exceeding the EU's air

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.840
pollution levels.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.020
And London, I think,
exceeded them in the--

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.630
limits for the whole year,
exceeded in the first five

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.890
days of the new year of 2017.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.990
So the environment,
which has really

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.320
been out of public
health for a while--

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.900
it's been very much
lifestyle and behavior--

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:57.770
has come back into public
health with a bang.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.660
And that's happened in a
number of different ways.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.390
There was the
issue of acid rain.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.940
Everyone was talking about
acid rain for a while.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.010
Then there was concern about
nuclear fall-out-- fall-out

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.580
from nuclear tests.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.180
Then, of course, climate
change has come on the agenda.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.040
And now people are
talking very much

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.780
about cities and air pollution.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.630
And even the behavioral
public health issues

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.420
have now got their
environmental emphasis

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.070
and think of smoking and passive
smoking and the way in which

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.800
we've now got
controls on smoking

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.290
in public, smoking
in restaurants,

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.880
and even, I think,
smoking in cars now,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.970
although I'm not sure
that that gets enforced--

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.470
smoking in cars when you've
got a child with you.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.900
So air pollution, which
I think people thought

00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:01.860
had been dealt with by the
Clean Air Act in the 1950s,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:07.155
has come back onto the agenda in
a big way in the 21st century.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.440
And I think other things have
come back onto the agenda, too.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.490
Everyone confidently expected
that infectious disease

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.750
had gone away.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.760
But from the 1980s
onwards, I think

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.340
it's been very obvious that
infectious disease hasn't

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.280
gone away.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.660
We still have HIV/AIDS.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.980
Then there was BSE.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.290
There was SARS, flu of various
types-- swine flu, avian flu--

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:39.600
and then more recently,
Ebola and Zika.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.050
And I think those last
two draw our attention

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:48.630
to something that's very obvious
in present-day public health--

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.850
that it's very much of a
global health enterprise.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.910
Obviously, people still
operate at the national level.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.750
But there's a whole global
arena of public health there

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.210
which is increasingly important.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.690
And there have been attempts
to try and achieve things

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.250
at a global level.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.190
You may have read about
the Millennium Development

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:17.130
Goals which were promulgated
at the time of the millennium

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:22.380
in 2000, and they just
came to an end in 2015.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.800
And some of those
goals were achieved.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.690
I think the one on
malaria was achieved.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.984
But other ones weren't.

00:30:28.984 --> 00:30:30.650
And so people in the
public health field

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.860
are always optimistic.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.540
They're not discouraged.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.630
And so now we've got
a new set of goals--

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.050
the Sustainable
Development Goals--

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.480
and a further period during
which some of those goals

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.950
may be achieved.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.910
And one of the
concomitance of those goals

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.720
and that global set-up is
the very important role

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.640
played by international
donors and donor agencies

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.900
and organizations in
the global health field.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.390
Now historically, that was
the case with the Rockefeller

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.650
Foundation.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.930
But now Rockefeller
has been joined

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.560
by a whole host of
other organizations

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.060
like Gates, Gavi Initiative,
the PEPFAR, and so on.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.690
So these are very
important players

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.030
in the global
public health field.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:27.120
Another trend to bear in
mind is an increased role

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.870
for the pharmaceutical industry
in public health and medication

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.570
as a form of public
health intervention.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.990
I said that public health
was a kind of reaction

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.720
against sickness services.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.610
But in a sense,
the sickness idea

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.930
has come back into
public health.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.520
It was there in terms of
interventions like vaccination

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.050
to prevent disease.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.050
But now we have
medication as prevention

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.430
in a whole host of areas.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.900
For example, think of statins
to prevent heart disease,

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.500
or think of methadone to
deal with drug addiction,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.140
or nicotine to deal
with tobacco smoking.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.650
And now, of course,
we've got PrEP,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.550
which has been controversial,
to prevent HIV/AIDS.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.720
So medication as prevention
is a whole new area

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.999
within public health.

00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:21.540
And finally, of
course, public health

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.490
doesn't stay in
the same location.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.220
In this country
recently, it's moved out

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.814
of the National Health Service
and back into local government.

00:32:30.814 --> 00:32:32.730
And a lot of people in
the public health field

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.850
saw that as public
health coming home.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.220
And they looked back to the
history of public health

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.140
and thought that
this was going to be

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.180
a golden age for public health.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.630
Well, with all the cuts that are
going on in local government,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.790
that hasn't quite
proved to be the case.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.190
So I'll just finish
with a few thoughts.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.960
I think we can finish
by saying, well,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.370
what really is public health?

00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:01.080
It's still a very broad arena.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.520
And it's one that
does, as I said

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.970
at the beginning, change over
time, in terms of its focus.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.900
We can ask, is it shaped
by the challenges it faces,

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:15.960
or is it shaped by the needs
of the professions that operate

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.880
within the public health field?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.800
What exactly does it cover?

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.830
Some people have argued
that public health likes

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.920
technical fixes
and single issues,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.840
because they're
easier to deal with.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.400
And the Gates
Foundation, for example,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.560
has been criticized for focusing
on vaccination immunization,

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.450
rather than broader programs
dealing with social inequality.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.970
And that leads onto,
where should public health

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.110
focus its efforts?

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.360
Should it focus on
health services,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.530
or should it focus on the
community at large and activity

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.930
and action within the community?

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.900
And finally-- and I think this
is probably very much the case

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.490
now--

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.630
is there a convergence
between issues

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.060
at the national, international,
and the global level?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.310
Because many of those issues--

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.630
for example, chronic disease,
non-communicable disease,

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.550
antibiotic resistance, climate
change, and air pollution--

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.290
are not just issues for this
country or other countries,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.590
but they are issues
which are being taken up

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.920
on the global stage, and
they affect people globally.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.380
We were just in China before
Christmas in Beijing, Shanghai,

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.520
and other cities.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.949
And the one thing
that struck us there

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.350
was how polluted the air was.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:40.170
So air pollution, I think, is
very much of a global issue.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.150
So I'll finish at that point.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.870
As a historian, I cannot
predict the future.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.670
So I have a cop-out there.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.380
But I think
undoubtedly one thing

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.630
you can say about public
health is that it will

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.980
continue to change over time.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.520
And the global impetus
behind public health, I think

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.940
will continue to become
increasingly important.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.340
Anyway, thanks very much.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.664
And I'm pleased to take
questions if you've got them.

00:35:08.664 --> 00:35:11.149
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:14.072 --> 00:35:15.280
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.530
We do have time for questions.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.900
So please.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.439
AUDIENCE: You touched on mental
health with the Ryle quote.

00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:22.980
Could you maybe say
a little bit more

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.461
about where approaches
to mental health fit in?

00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:26.460
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Yeah.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.230
It's interesting mental
health figured so strongly

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.960
at that stage in the
1940s and the 1950s.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.880
And looking at some of the
surveys which people did

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.820
from the School of
Hygiene in the 1950s,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:47.940
mental health was very much a
key area within public health.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.350
And I think it became
less prominent.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.770
I suppose with the focus
on lifestyle and behavior,

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.930
public health moved in
different directions,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.100
and only recently has mental
health started to come back

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.040
into the public health agenda.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.490
In this country, still,
I think it's not really

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.630
defined as a public health
issue, not quite so centrally.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.830
But certainly some
of my colleagues--

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.960
particularly one person, Vikram
Patel, who works in India--

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.930
is very much taking
up mental health

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.280
as a public health issue.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.090
So I think it's coming back from
the global level, rather than

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.085
perhaps the national level.

00:36:29.085 --> 00:36:29.793
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:37.210
AUDIENCE: What can we
learn from the past,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:41.140
in terms of educating the
public about the importance

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.890
of vaccines, because there
is an anti-vaccine narrative

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.720
that some people are
trying to run with?

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.303
And then perhaps
parallel to that, you

00:36:48.303 --> 00:36:51.130
see people questioning
whether we should put fluoride

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:51.730
in the water.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.405
Or today, the BMJ,
vitamin D meta-study

00:36:54.405 --> 00:36:56.530
came out showing we should
all be taking vitamin D,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.360
whereas in the US they add that
to milk and bread quite often.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.220
So as a historian,
how would you perhaps

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.337
look at what we've tackled
issues like that in the past?

00:37:07.337 --> 00:37:08.920
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE:
Well, first of all,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.760
I think the broad issue
is the nanny state idea,

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:19.600
isn't it-- that is public health
advocating a nanny state where

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.229
everything is being
dealt with by the state?

00:37:25.229 --> 00:37:27.520
And certainly, there's been
opposition to public health

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.655
initiatives on that basis.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.860
And there's a constant
tension there,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.140
I think, between the
rights of the individual

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.130
and the rights of the population
at large, which is very much

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.050
encompassed by
vaccination, isn't it,

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:49.960
where you're developing herd
immunity by having larger

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.770
numbers of people vaccinated.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:58.360
So I think that's an ongoing
debate within public health

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.060
and within the community
more generally.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.530
I think to some extent that's
not as strong as it was.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.520
There used to be very strong
opposition to public health

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.120
as being busybody do-gooders
who wanted everyone

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.570
to behave and live in
the same sort of way.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.790
But as public health has
broadened out recently

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.710
and then started to
encompass, again,

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.020
areas like air pollution
and global issues,

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.370
I think maybe that debate
has become less fraught

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.050
than it was.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.250
In terms of vaccination,
I think there

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:36.250
is some interesting history to
bring into that, because there

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.300
was a very strong
anti-vaccination movement

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.440
in the 19th century, people
very opposed to vaccination.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.390
And this was a popular movement.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.020
It was a working class
movement, because vaccination

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.260
was seen as something which
people who were better off

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.790
could get out of.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.010
It was seen as an
unsafe procedure that

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.110
often lead to side effects.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.690
And there were also
cultural beliefs

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.680
about where vaccination
was coming from,

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:13.030
what it was doing to the body,
and so on, which were not

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.300
understood really at the time.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.840
And I think often, sometimes
the anti-vaccination impetus

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.680
at the moment needs to
be understood, in a way,

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.600
rather than just condemned.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.450
And very often in the
public health field,

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.020
I think people have tended to
argue that these people are

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.380
being duped, or it's false
science, or something

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.780
like that, whereas I
think there are probably

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.370
deeper cultural motives
and ideas which could

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.030
be teased out a little bit.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.450
And that's something which has
also come up in the response

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.560
to the Ebola virus and in
Africa where people said,

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.250
if we'd understood a little bit
more about the cultural beliefs

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.420
from disease and so on, we
might have dealt with Ebola more

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.370
effectively initially.

00:40:12.377 --> 00:40:13.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.020
I know you said
you're a historian.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.680
But what role do you
see for technology

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.470
in public health going forward?

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.250
Can you see any ideas where
technology can play a role?

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.250
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Yeah.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.270
I think it's an
interesting area.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.180
It depends how you
define technology.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.900
There's the technology
of pills and medicines

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.240
and so on, which is very
much part of public health.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.280
But there's also the
technology of self-monitoring

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:46.160
and monitoring your
steps and your heart

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.460
beat and your blood
pressure and so on.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.210
And that has been discussed
very much in the public health

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.940
field, not just in
terms of the way

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.050
those technologies operate,
but also differential access

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.280
to technology.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.240
So are you going to be getting
levels of the population

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.580
who are constantly
self-monitoring and able to do

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.910
that and then other
populations or other parts

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.420
of the population have no access
to that sort of technology

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.290
or have no cultural desire
to access that technology.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.400
So yeah, I think
there certainly is

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.574
a lot of debate about the role
of technology in public health.

00:41:34.244 --> 00:41:36.160
AUDIENCE: It might be
slightly off your field.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.470
But is the funding
crisis in the NHS new,

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.305
or have we had things
like that in the past?

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.180
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Well, it's
not entirely off my field.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.570
One of the interesting
things about the changes

00:41:55.570 --> 00:42:00.010
I talked about between
public health expected

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.990
to run a national
health service and then

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:06.310
not running a national health
service was that nobody really

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.280
costed out what the National
Health Service was going

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.700
to cost, because all the debates
before the Second World War

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.537
and during the Second
World War had made

00:42:17.537 --> 00:42:19.870
the assumption that public
health was going to be funded

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:25.960
out of local rates or taxation
with a minimal input from--

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.150
well, not such a
big input, anyway--

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.160
from central government.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.210
So that was one thing.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:36.310
There was never any real costing
of what a national health

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.350
service would cost.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:41.839
And I think the other point
was that people expected

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:43.630
that the National Health
Service would deal

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.150
with ill health
in the population

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.360
and that costs would go
down after a few years.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.740
And they were really surprised
when costs actually went up.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.420
So it wasn't until probably
nearly 10 years after the NHS

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.980
was established that
a committee was set up

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.150
called the Guillebaud
Committee, looking

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:08.920
at the costs of the
National Health Service.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.950
And this has, more or less, been
an ongoing issue ever since.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:18.280
Certainly it came to a crisis
point in the early 1970s

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.140
with the oil crisis, which
created a different situation

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.200
across the Western economies.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.600
And so rationing
health services,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.190
the cost of health services were
very much on the agenda then.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.550
And really, they've
been on the agenda ever

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.590
since, because I think
as long as you've

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.460
got a centrally
tax-funded service,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.041
costs are going to be a
political and a central policy

00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:46.540
issue.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.081
If you go to other
countries, they're

00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:50.380
not talking about
their health services

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.990
in quite the same way
that we talk about ours,

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.140
because it is such a
political policy issue.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.470
AUDIENCE: What do you
think of the legalization

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:07.470
of controlled substances,
particularly marijuana?

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.840
There was a big debate in
the US on that recently.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.240
Does that go against the
direction of public health,

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.740
or does that make it easier
to change people's behavior

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.520
or something?

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.180
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Oh,
that's a big topic.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.870
Well, interestingly,
drugs and alcohol

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:29.500
were really outside the public
health area for a long while--

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.570
alcohol, because
it was so affected

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.040
by the temperance movement.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.400
So alcohol was a temperance
topic for a long while

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.670
rather than a
public health topic.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:44.530
And drugs-- and alcohol,
too, in some respects--

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.430
was seen as within the mental
health psychiatric area

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.010
rather than being a
public health topic.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.950
But that came out
of that area a bit

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.960
and moved into public
health in the 1980s

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:00.040
when I think HIV/AIDS
and injecting drug use

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.520
made it much more of
a public health topic.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.400
And then onto the
agenda at that stage

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.860
came something which we
still talk about called harm

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.910
reduction so that instead
of having a war on drugs,

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:18.160
you should have a preventive
attitude towards drugs

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.840
to try and prevent harmful use,
but not necessarily to prevent

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.490
all use whatsoever.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:29.890
So that, broadly speaking, has
been the policy aim certainly

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:34.300
in this country, I think
less so in the United States,

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.260
and obviously even less so
in countries like Russia

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.510
which don't have harm
reduction at all,

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.180
in relation to drug use.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:49.420
So a few years
ago, we would have

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.060
said that issues of
legalization are very far

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.780
from practical possibility.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.660
But what's happened in
the States has rather

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:04.180
tended to disprove that, hasn't
it, where the local state

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.950
governments, the referenda
have been producing majorities

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:12.520
in favor of the
availability of cannabis,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.520
either for medical purposes
or for more general use.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.210
And that's a very
interesting situation.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.870
How it will develop under
the current presidency,

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:27.500
I don't know.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:35.510
It has been argued that
America, historically,

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.640
has been the key global power
arguing for a war on drugs.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.680
It's been the leading proponent
of that war on drugs approach

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.780
across the globe.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.970
And yet, within
its own boundaries,

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.360
it's actually contravening the
international drug conventions.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.070
And that's been a very
interesting situation,

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:00.800
which Obama didn't
tangle with really.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.210
But it will be interesting to
see what happens under Trump.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.058
I'm afraid I have no inside
knowledge on that point.

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.432
[LAUGHS]

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.440
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.000
So you have worked a lot
with policymakers, I think.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.140
Can you say something
about how it

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.880
is different to do
the actual signs

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.200
and to derive
policies from that?

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.200
VIRGINIA BERRIDGE: Well,
there's been a big move

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.710
amongst historians
in the last 10,

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:36.867
15 years, I guess, to have
more impact on policy.

00:47:36.867 --> 00:47:38.950
Now historians used to be,
they couldn't care less

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:40.450
about policy.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.810
They just wanted to do their
own thing basically-- expand

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.090
the boundaries of knowledge.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.580
But recently, I
think there's been

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.960
a greater move towards that.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.470
A lot of discussion in
the historical field

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.040
about how you go about that.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.426
And different modes
have been tried.

00:48:01.426 --> 00:48:02.800
Some of my colleagues
are working

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.510
with different
government departments.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:11.940
And they advise civil
servants in those departments.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.970
Tony Blair, when he
was the prime minister,

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.840
used to get little discussion
groups together at number 10.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.770
And in some of those
discussion groups,

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.490
there would be historians.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:27.510
Well, obviously didn't
always take their advice.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.494
And I think recently--

00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:30.660
I was just talking to
somebody about this yesterday,

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.950
actually--

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.230
those sorts of
discussions go on.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:38.430
There are connections
and lectures

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:44.190
by historians at number 10
right up to the present day.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.470
But it is quite a
difficult relationship,

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.050
because policymakers
and politicians

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.540
are very much of the moment.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.670
They don't have
that long-term view.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.890
And in a sense, they disregard
the long-term view, really,

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.580
because they have to take
decisions here and now.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.710
I shouldn't think the
long-term history of Europe

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:11.010
and the European
history, more generally,

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.830
is having much influence
on the Brexit negotiations.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.050
But I may be wrong.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.700
So I think historians
have to be careful

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.280
about their relationships
with policy, because it's

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.940
easy to have one's work
taken and used in a way which

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.850
one didn't necessarily intend.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.864
But that's part of the nature
of policymaking, I think.

00:49:32.864 --> 00:49:34.530
You have to be there
at the right moment

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.510
with the right message
at the right time.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:42.580
And so it can be a
difficult relationship.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.740
SPEAKER: Time for
one more question.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.730
No question left?

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:50.600
Then please join me in thanking
Professor Virginia Berridge.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.350
[APPLAUSE]
