00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:04.458
- So let's say that we have some glucose,

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:07.477
the sugar in your blood
that allows you to think,

00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:09.077
and do things, and watch this video,

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.210
and allows me to make this video.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.210
And so, one molecule of
glucose has six carbons in it,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.010
it has 12 hydrogens in it,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.176
and it has six oxygens in it.

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:26.411
Now what I'm curious about is by mass,

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.361
what percentage of a
glucose molecule is carbon,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.777
what percentage is hydrogen,
and what percentage is oxygen?

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:34.827
And to do that, I'm gonna
first take a stab at it

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:35.945
where I'm just gonna use kind of

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.060
the round numbers, the approximations.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.394
Now we've already talked
about atomic weight,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.611
and atomic mass, and how we define it by

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:45.226
the carbon 12 isotope, and how a neutron

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:47.594
isn't exactly one atomic mass unit,

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:50.995
or a proton isn't exactly
one atomic mass unit,

00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:52.195
but for a lot of purposes,

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.970
that's a very close approximation.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.876
So, let me write this down.

00:00:57.876 --> 00:00:59.894
So for the sake of this one,
this is going to be kind of

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:01.528
an overview, kind of get the idea,

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.594
and then we'll do other examples

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:04.778
where we get more precise, where we use

00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:07.077
the actual atomic weights,
which is going to be

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:08.744
more indicative of the elements

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:11.544
as you will find them in
earth, or the molecules, even,

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.528
as you would find them on earth.

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.737
So we're just going to assume,

00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:19.426
which isn't a bad assumption,

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:24.383
that one proton,

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:28.464
or one neutron,

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:31.995
is approximately equal
to one atomic mass unit,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.411
and I've sometimes used the notation amu,

00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.893
that's what I remember using,

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:39.528
but it's actually the more modern notation

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.960
for the unit is just the u.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.976
Sometimes an atomic
mass unit is referred to

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:46.120
as a Dalton, so you'll see that.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.009
That's still referring
to atomic mass unit,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.846
or you could use kind of the older prefix,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.976
I guess you could say, or units amu,

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:56.578
but this is the modern atomic mass unit

00:01:56.578 --> 00:01:58.793
that I'm talking about, not
like one of the older ones,

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:00.829
that are defined based
on oxygen or hydrogen.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.302
This is the atomic mass
unit where carbon 12,

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:05.435
the carbon 12 isotope is exactly

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.563
12 atomic mass units,

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:10.568
but I'll use the more modern notation.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:13.343
So if we assume that,
let's just think about

00:02:13.343 --> 00:02:15.427
what the mass is of each
of the constituents,

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:17.495
so how much of the mass
is made up by carbons,

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:19.862
how much of the mass is
made up by hydrogens,

00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:22.177
and how much is made up by oxygens?

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:25.445
Well, carbon, let's do carbon first.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:29.527
So carbon has, by definition,
it has six protons,

00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:33.077
that's what makes it carbon, six protons

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:36.303
and the most typical
isotope is six neutrons,

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:37.495
and even if you were
going to a periodic table,

00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:38.944
and you were to look up the atomic weight,

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.810
you would find that it's very close to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.745
six plus six, which is 12.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:46.494
If you look up on a periodic
table, you'd get 12.011,

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:50.445
because that is weighting
the various isotopes,

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:53.695
and so, carbon, each
of them has an atomic,

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:56.861
we can assume carbon

00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:59.673
has an atomic mass,

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:01.930
for the sake of this video, as 12,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.762
so six carbons

00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:09.032
are going to have an
atomic mass collectively,

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:11.346
be six together, six times 12

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:13.618
is, six times 12 is

00:03:13.618 --> 00:03:16.878
72 atomic mass units.

00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:18.014
Now let's do the same thing

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:20.090
for the hydrogens and the oxygens.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.270
So, hydrogen is, actually the typical

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.604
isotope of hydrogen we find on earth

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:28.563
is one proton,

00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:31.078
and zero neutrons.

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.270
That's kind of what's neat about hydrogen,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.487
it's kind of a proton with
an electron buzzing around,

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:37.821
and the bulk of the mass
is made up by the proton.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.472
The electron has almost a negligible mass

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:42.554
if you're considering
protons and neutrons.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:44.953
And so for the sake of
our assumptions here,

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:49.222
and this isn't exact, a
hydrogen's atomic mass,

00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:51.255
we could say, is one atomic mass unit.

00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:52.188
Now if you're going on the periodic table,

00:03:52.188 --> 00:03:54.370
you'd see that's pretty close,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.487
1.0079 is the atomic weight of hydrogen.

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.888
Once again, this is based
on the various isotopes

00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:03.173
of hydrogen as found on earth,

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:05.221
and it is based on the idea that

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:07.155
the electron does contribute a little bit,

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:11.638
and a proton by itself is not
exactly one atomic mass unit.

00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:13.685
The atomic mass unit is now defined

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.971
that carbon 12 isotope is
exactly 12 atomic mass units,

00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.639
but this is not the definition,

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.971
but this is a useful
way to think about it.

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.235
So if each of the hydrogens is
roughly one atomic mass unit,

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:28.496
that means that 12 of the hydrogens

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:33.394
are going to be 12 atomic mass units.

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:36.212
And now let's do the same
thing with the oxygen.

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.036
Oxygen has...

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:41.377
Actually, let me write it over.

00:04:41.377 --> 00:04:44.136
So oxygen has,

00:04:44.136 --> 00:04:46.603
by definition, eight protons,

00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:50.628
and the most typical, most
of the oxygen on earth,

00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:53.078
also has eight neutrons,

00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:55.173
although there are other isotopes.

00:04:55.173 --> 00:04:59.827
There are eight neutrons,
and so oxygen has

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:01.843
an atomic weight, if we assume this way,

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.418
of 16 atomic mass units.

00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:05.343
We'll see that's not exactly right.

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.144
If you look at a periodic table,

00:05:07.144 --> 00:05:10.294
the atomic weight is 15.999,

00:05:10.294 --> 00:05:11.744
and we could be more precise and do that,

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:15.461
but this is at least a rough
way of getting it quickly,

00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.093
or of kind of getting a rough estimate,

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:18.963
and it's really not that rough.

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:21.961
Oxygen's atomic mass, we could say is 16,

00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:25.273
and so six oxygens

00:05:25.273 --> 00:05:27.986
are going to be 16 times six,

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:32.270
which is 96 atomic mass units.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.676
And so, what's the mass
of a molecule of glucose?

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:38.426
Well, if we assume these
numbers right over here,

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:41.093
it's gonna be 72 plus 12 plus 96.

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:43.526
I'm just adding the mass
of the constituents,

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:45.510
and that's going to be, what is that,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.125
84 plus 96, which is 180,

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:54.153
so this right over here
is 180 atomic mass units,

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.711
or 180 Daltons.

00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:57.927
Now let's try to answer our question.

00:05:57.927 --> 00:06:01.077
What percentage of this 180 is carbon?

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:04.176
Well, 72 out of the 180 is carbon.

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:05.746
So let's write that down.

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:09.745
So, 72 of the 180 is carbon,

00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.027
72 of the 180,

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:14.893
which is equal to what?

00:06:14.893 --> 00:06:16.593
I have my calculator here.

00:06:16.593 --> 00:06:20.386
Let's see, 72 divided by

00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:24.657
180 gets us 0.4,

00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:26.571
which is 40 percent,

00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.332
so this is 40 percent.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.327
40 percent of a glucose molecule's mass

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.061
is made up by carbon, based on

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:37.412
the assumptions that we've done so far.

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:38.961
Now what about hydrogen?

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:40.961
Well, we could do the exact same idea.

00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:44.594
12 180ths, which is equal to,

00:06:44.594 --> 00:06:48.554
get my calculator out, so 12

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:52.028
divided by 180

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:55.745
gets us 0.066, and it just keeps

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:58.697
repeating on and on
forever, so it's roughly,

00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:01.730
this is equivalent to 6.7 percent.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.884
So this right over here, I'll just say

00:07:03.884 --> 00:07:07.919
it's approximately

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.633
6.7 percent,

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:13.394
and then the remainder, as a percentage,

00:07:13.394 --> 00:07:16.078
should be oxygen, but
let's just verify that.

00:07:16.078 --> 00:07:19.422
So the oxygen is going to be 96,

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:21.365
the same color,

00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:23.122
the oxygen is going to be 96

00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:26.004
of the 180 atomic mass units,

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:30.013
and so, that is going to be 96

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:33.716
divided by

00:07:33.716 --> 00:07:35.728
180

00:07:35.728 --> 00:07:38.946
gets us

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:41.532
0.533333,

00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:45.383
which is roughly 53.3 percent,

00:07:45.383 --> 00:07:47.211
so, approximately

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:50.950
53.3 percent.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.811
And so, once again, I
did not use the precise

00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:55.083
atomic weights in the
periodic table below,

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.088
where this over here would have been

00:07:58.088 --> 00:08:00.895
12.011,

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:04.795
this over here would have been 1.0079,

00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:08.577
this over here would have been 15.999,

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:10.522
but these numbers are awfully close,

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:12.244
and it's much easier
to do the math with it,

00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:14.370
and if we use these numbers instead,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.961
we get a pretty good
estimate of what percentage,

00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:19.295
and it's a very good estimate,

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.426
of what percentage of
this molecule by mass

00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:25.044
is carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen.

00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:27.661
And you see, even though
there are the same number

00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:31.161
of oxygens and carbons,
there's a larger percentage

00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:34.710
by mass, because each
oxygen has a larger mass.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.215
More than half of the mass

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:39.858
of a glucose molecule is oxygen.

00:08:39.858 --> 00:08:41.811
And then in second place comes the carbon,

00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:44.560
and then hydrogen, there's
a ton, well not a ton,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.044
there's 12 hydrogen, there's twice as many

00:08:46.044 --> 00:08:47.760
as there are carbons or oxygens,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.585
but because hydrogen has
so much smaller of a mass,

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.461
that it represents a
much smaller percentage

00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:57.370
of the total mass of the molecule.
