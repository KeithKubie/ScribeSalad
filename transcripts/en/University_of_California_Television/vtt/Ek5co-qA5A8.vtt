00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.810
- [Announcer] This program is presented by

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.240
University of California Television.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.524
(light upbeat music)

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.210
- Well good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.620
For those who don't know
me, I'm Fiona Doyle,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
and I am the Dean of
the Graduate Division.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.460
It's my great pleasure to welcome you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.410
to the second lecture of the HarvEst

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.853
Distinguished Women Lecture Series.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.140
For those who don't know,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.070
the Graduate Division
has a proud tradition

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.260
of managing the Berkeley
Graduate lectures.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.330
We now have eight lectureships,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.820
each with a distinct endowment history.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.900
These unique lectureship programs

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.740
have brought distinguished
visitors to Berkeley since,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.780
believe it or not, 1904,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.893
so this is a long standing traditions,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.950
to speak on a wide range of topics,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.360
ranging from philosophy, to sciences,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.540
with an awful lot in between.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.410
We've hosted dignitaries, Nobel laureates,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.320
and many hundreds of
globally renowned thinkers

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.570
whose ideas have a world
changing influence.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.210
The HarvEst lectures
are the newest addition

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.130
to this stellar collection,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.490
and I'm convinced that they will have

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.713
a similar impact to some of the others.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.140
The HarvEst Distinguished
Women Lecture Series

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.010
features women from a broad range

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.260
of disciplines and cultures.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.560
It offers a forum to
foster thoughtful dialogue,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.670
and an opportunity to be inspired

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.820
by outstanding and
accomplished women leaders.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.170
Today's lecturer, as you will hear,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.590
certainly fits this mold.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.180
Professor Laura Tyson is remarkable

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.030
for her accomplishments and impact,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.793
not just in academia, but
also in public service.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.470
The inaugural lecture
in the HarvEst Series

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.470
was presented by Harriet
Fulbright in October of 2013.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.460
And like our event today,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.740
was convened here at International House.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.900
This is the perfect setting for dialogue

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.170
centered on shaping a world
of greater understanding,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.023
and where diversity of
perspective is welcome.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.100
But also, International House is a place

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.700
where individuals are
encouraged to dream big

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.533
and see that they can
truly change the world.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.500
The HarvEst name originates from combining

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.921
the first names of our
lecture benefactors.

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:11.550
UC Berkeley alumni couple,
Harvey Lee, of '88,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.460
and Esther Ma, '87, both of Hong Kong.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.380
I'm delighted to say
that Esther and Harvey

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.220
are here today with us,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.370
along with several of
their family members.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.770
So if you get a chance,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.623
do give them a warm
welcome back to Berkeley.

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:30.738
(applause)

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.420
It's now my pleasure to invite Esther

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.420
to the lectern for a few minutes

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.330
to talk about her vision

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.890
in establishing this lecture series,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
and then I'll come and
introduce the lecturer.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.503
Esther.

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:53.653
(applause)

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.113
Welcome.

00:03:59.113 --> 00:03:59.946
- Thanks.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.920
Thank you, Dean Doyle.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.500
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.690
students and faculty.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.780
Well, happy belated Valentine's Day,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.186
and Happy pre-Chinese New Year of the Ram.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.570
(speaks Chinese)

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.580
So this is how the HarvEst story goes.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.580
In 1985, on a sunny
day by the Sather Gate,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.593
two Berkeley freshmen from
Hong Kong met by fate.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.000
Harvey and Esther, or
when the names combine,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.960
better known as HarvEst,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.243
were passionate about studying economics.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.030
Harvey took Econ 1 from
Professor Laura Tyson,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.163
while Esther got Professor Freeman.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.930
And before you knew it,
the HarvEst seed was sown

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.263
and started to blossom in Wheeler Hall.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So today, 30 years later,
HarvEst returns to Cal,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.070
with their little HarvEst, Kisha and Tika,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.490
to celebrate the 1985 vintage.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.533
But more importantly, to pay
tribute to their Alma Mater.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.750
So Harvey and I are really
honored to be here today

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.630
to host the second series

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.403
of the HarvEst Distinguished
Women Leader Lecture Series.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.090
We are very honored that our guest speaker

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.690
is Professor Laura Tyson,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.440
who actually was Harvey's
first economics professor,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.920
and she was the one who inspired Harvey

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.030
to major in economics,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.223
who in turn inspired me to follow suit.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.620
There's a saying that
women hold up half the sky.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.500
Well, being a full-time mom,
and being a full-time owner

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.310
of my own public relations company,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.310
I must say that most of
the time I have to hold up

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.880
more than half of a company,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.190
and more than half of the family.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.400
And you know, men are normally considered

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.900
as the bread winners of the family,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.720
while women are the pillars of the family,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.830
having to take care of
so many household chores,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.390
kid's education, financial
planning, logistics management,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.420
signing checks, and entertaining guests.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.220
So how do we do it all, right?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.570
It really takes someone with good

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.360
time management and multitasking skills.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.430
And I will say, women are
actually quite fortunate

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.670
to be born with the talent of

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.090
good time management and prioritization,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.850
especially for super achievers
like Professor Tyson,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.080
who also writes books,
who also does research,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.050
who also gives speeches, like today,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.480
and who also advises the
President of the United States.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.150
She indeed is a role model.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.690
Speaking of role model,

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.460
over the years that I've been involved

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.510
with a lot of women related
business organizations,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.460
and charity organizations,
I've been telling all my 25

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.060
mentees that it's very important to find

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.930
a good role model or a mentor for life.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.310
Someone who can share with you

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.250
their experiences and their insights.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.920
Someone who can inspire
women to empower themselves.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.760
And I think it's very
important that these days,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.790
we as women, have to empower ourselves,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.270
and then have to nurture
our leadership skills

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.320
to give back to the community.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.350
And this is indeed the inspiration

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.260
behind our endowment of
HarvEst Distinguished

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.270
Women Leader Lecture Series,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.850
and as Dean Doyle mentioned earlier,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.950
the series was launched
back in October of 2013,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.810
and we were very honored to
have Mrs. Harriet Fulbright

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.600
as our inaugural speaker,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.880
who delivered an enlightening speech

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.420
on international education.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.660
And I think you know through
prominent speakers sharing,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.490
we hope that this lecture
series will be able to elevate

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.470
the status of women from a socioeconomic,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.170
professional, and personal aspect,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.570
just to let women live up to

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.400
my favorite four Ps framework,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.500
which is P for passion.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.120
I think it's very important for someone,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.720
for yourself to find your passion.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.940
To really find what you love doing,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.180
and then to live your
dreams to the fullest.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.950
The second P is for positivity.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.140
This word I use a lot to
teach my kids, Kisha and Tika.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.130
I say, always think positive.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.040
Don't think negative.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.270
Always think of a glass being
half full and not half empty.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.210
Because positivity breeds happiness,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.980
it breeds self-confidence,
it breeds success.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.960
And the third P is for perseverance.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.790
Don't let anything come in
the way to achieve your goal.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.540
It's all about will power,
all about discipline.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.110
And I always, you know
my favorite case study

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.080
is to share my own
experience in overcoming

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.220
three miscarriages within four years.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.420
But I told myself, at
least I'm conceivable.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.450
I know one day I'm gonna be a mother.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.740
So now I have two beautiful daughters.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.340
And the fourth P is for philanthropy.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.120
Philanthropy meaning giving
back to the community,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.040
giving back to your Alma Mater,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.360
because there are so many unfortunate

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.240
and underprivileged people out there

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.900
who need our help.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.010
So Harvey and I are really excited today

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.770
that we're going to learn
about the fifth P, politics.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.603
(light laughter)

00:09:46.603 --> 00:09:49.710
How politics, or policy making,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.710
will empower women in the
workplace, and in the family,

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.520
and in turn add value to the economy.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.853
Let us welcome Professor Laura Tyson.

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:01.850
(applause)

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.470
Our honorable guest speaker
who will be speaking

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.500
on Women's Work in the World Economy

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.732
from a Political and Personal Perspective.

00:10:12.732 --> 00:10:13.565
(applause)

00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:14.528
Thank you.

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:16.778
(applause)

00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:20.765
(whispering)

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:33.060
- Thank you, Esther, you and Harvey

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.162
are truly inspirational in your vision for

00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:38.823
endowing this lecture series.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.120
Without further ado,
it's my great pleasure

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.740
to introduce my colleague,
Professor Laura Tyson.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.740
You have biographical
notes, and Laura said,

00:10:52.747 --> 00:10:55.087
"Please don't spend too
long introducing me."

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.975
She says, "Basically, I've
been here a very long time."

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:03.050
(laughs)

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.503
Professor Tyson joined the
Berkeley faculty in 1977.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.300
She's been on the faculty,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.680
at the Haas School of Business since 1990,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.210
and she was the dean

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.057
of the School of Business from 1998-2001.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.500
In addition, as Esther mentioned,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.860
she has advised Presidents
of the United States.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.380
She's the former chair
of the US President's

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.400
Council of Economic Advisor,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.000
and former director of the
National Economic Council

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
under the Clinton administration.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.940
She was the first woman to
hold both of these roles.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.600
And more recently, she served
on President Barack Obama's

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.470
Economic Recovery Advisory Board,

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.192
so we can thank Laura for
the improving global economy.

00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:51.490
(light laughter)

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.120
Without further ado, I'm
gonna welcome to the stage,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.757
my colleague, and ask you to do similarly.

00:11:57.757 --> 00:12:00.007
(applause)

00:12:03.064 --> 00:12:04.731
- I appreciate that.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.010
Well good afternoon everyone.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.477
It's really, it's a honor to be here.

00:12:14.477 --> 00:12:17.280
The University of
California Berkeley has been

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.950
a major part of my life
for a very long time.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.850
It's actually very inspiring
to actually meet students

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.840
who I once taught many years ago.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.390
I was asked when I was in
Washington the first time,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.430
with President Clinton, I had a knack

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.240
for making economics fairly simple.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.927
So people would say to me constantly,

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:42.047
"Where did you get the training

00:12:42.047 --> 00:12:44.610
"to make economics fairly simple?"

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.520
And I said, well, a lecture hall

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.640
of 800 freshmen and
sophomores who you had to

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.860
keep awake, and keep engaged.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.240
And that was my best training.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.830
So the university has been
extremely important to me,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.870
and I'm very, very thankful to welcome

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.390
Esther and Harvey back,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.000
and to realize that I'm connected to them

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.603
in that very personally important way.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.700
I'm gonna talk about Women's Work

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.530
in the World Economy tonight.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.290
I will focus on the policy aspects,

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.950
but also focus on the economic argument.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.290
And I want to start this by saying that

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.270
I myself have not spent most of my life

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.410
studying women in the global economy.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.610
I got to this issue personally,

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.860
and I got fascinated by
it, maybe I developed

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.183
a little passion for
it, relatively recently.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
The first thing I had passion for

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.230
as a student was economics.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.850
And when I studied economics,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.630
I went to Smith College,
and I did not realize,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.060
because I was at an all women's school,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.110
that economics was a male discipline.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.050
So I liked economics.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.210
Most of my professors were actually,

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.240
at that point, male professors,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.570
but I thought the
discipline was fantastic.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.550
And I tend therefore to think about

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.680
problems that interest
me are economic problems.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.870
I went to MIT, and at MIT I studied

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.770
International Economic Development,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.180
in comparative political economy,

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.990
how do societies organize themselves

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.540
to be competitive, to be prosperous,

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.404
to promote rapid growth
in output per person,

00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:30.410
to have great productivity,
what do societies do?

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.990
So one of the things that
I discovered increasingly

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.630
was that, how societies treat women,

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.010
their gender, what I'm gonna
call all my gender parity,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.810
the extent to which men and
women are treated equally

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.150
in a variety of areas.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.050
That gender parity actually
does have an effect

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.620
on an economy's economic performance.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.760
And it's an effect which
actually in the past 20 years

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.460
has really been demonstrated
in study after study.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.080
So whereas we might've
thought that before,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.360
we might've just had an
intuition that was true,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.760
we have a very dramatic
amount of evidence now

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.080
coming from economists,
coming from psychologists,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.640
coming from political scientists,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.170
coming from countries all over the world,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.800
that countries that have
greater degrees of gender parity

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.600
also have a superior economic performance

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.780
in a variety of ways.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.953
So I'm gonna talk about that tonight.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.240
I got first interested in this question

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.480
because I was, as I said,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.130
I was always interested in economics,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.920
always interested in how societies perform

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.053
comparatively, competitively.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.330
But I was the dean of two
business schools also.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.240
The business school here,
right across the street.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.350
A great business school, fantastic,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.040
London Business School also
a wonderful business school.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.670
One if more international
in makeup than the other,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.060
but they're actually at
the top of their game.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.130
And what I discovered,
and I should've known this

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.630
but I discovered it,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.920
was that business schools
were one of the few

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.920
higher education areas
where women were not yet

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.170
at the 50% or parity level
in terms of enrollment.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.980
Women weren't going to business school

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.050
to the same extent as men were.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.190
If they went to business school,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.000
they were not staying in business school.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.560
If they graduated from business school,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.680
they were not staying in business.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.260
So this was like, I noticed this.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.710
And I tried to begin to understand,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.980
since I was a female dean
of two business schools,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.980
what business schools might
do to encourage more women.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.300
In the process of thinking about that,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.590
there were others around
the world thinking about

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.520
how to, they were looking at
this business case for women,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.030
the economic case for women,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.340
the economic case for gender parity,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.900
I was approached by something called

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.160
the World Economic Forum.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.560
So the World Economic
Forum is a non-profit,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.630
it's very influential,
it grew out of actually

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.560
an academic institution in
Switzerland 45 years ago.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.410
It has become very
influential around the world.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.240
It brings together great
leaders from around the world,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.710
both business and political leaders,

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.320
to talk about pressing economic issues,

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.300
and to think about what are the factors

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.920
that lead to an economy's success.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.150
So the World Economic Forum approached me

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.530
while I was thinking about

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.900
why aren't there more
women in business schools,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.900
and said, "We want to put
together a rigorous analysis of

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:39.347
"how countries are doing on gender parity

00:17:39.347 --> 00:17:41.227
"in a number of dimensions.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:45.677
"And then we want to see
how a country's performance

00:17:45.677 --> 00:17:49.040
"on gender parity affects
its economic performance."

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.910
That was their mission.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.610
And they asked if I would
be interested in doing this,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.730
and I said, absolutely.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.020
Because I had been thinking about it.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.020
So we got some very
good help at the Forum.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.830
We got a couple of really
good data economists.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.010
I'm more of an economist who sort of does

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.730
case studies, and country studies,

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.400
so we've got some very good,
rigorous data economists.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.420
And we put together a report which has

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.420
come to be called the
Global Gender Gap Report.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.700
Now before I start with the numbers,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.920
I wanna tell just a personal anecdote

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.370
about my first engagement
with the World Economic Forum,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.370
'cause it predated when they
came to me in 2003 and '04

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.230
and said, "Will you work on this issue?".

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.720
I had gone to the World Economic Forum

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.450
as a member of the US government

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.640
working for Bill Clinton,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.713
and my spouse had come along.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.193
And this was the mid 1990s.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.770
So at that point there were very few men

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.544
who were spouses at the
World Economic Forum.

00:19:03.544 --> 00:19:04.377
(light audience laughter)

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.370
There were a whole bunch of women

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.560
who were spouses at the
World Economic Forum,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.540
and very few men.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.830
So we arrived, my husband and I,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.993
and he was offered a flowered bag,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.457
and I was offered a black briefcase.

00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:20.510
(audience laughter)

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.290
He was offered a sleigh ride through town,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.500
and I was offered a panel to discuss

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.930
global economic activity.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.120
Back in the mid 1990s,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.840
spouses were not invited to go to

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.680
the major sessions of
the World Economic Forum.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.220
By the way, there's at least one person

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.560
in the audience who knows
my husband pretty well,

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.350
and she can guess, he was not pleased.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.870
(audience laughter)

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.470
In fact, he has refused ever to go back

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.150
to the World Economic Forum with me,

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.620
even though I tell him on a regular basis,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.590
look, no sleigh rides, no flowered bags,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.720
you can go to whatever event you want to,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.680
it's all right, dear.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.923
No, no, he's not coming.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.440
So this is just an anecdote
about changing style,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.370
because now the World Economic Forum,

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.080
although in itself has
not reached gender parity,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.040
absolutely not, so 20% of
its participants are women,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.760
but what I will say is
you have some of the

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.880
major women leaders
around the world there.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.960
You have major female CEOs there,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.940
you have whole panels talking about

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.470
what companies can do to
promote greater gender parity,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.350
what countries can do to
promote greater gender parity.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.320
So its gone from a non-issue

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.190
to an absolutely central
issue of the Forum.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.977
And that's because, what
I'm gonna show you now

00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:41.760
are some of the results,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.660
what the evidence shows very clearly

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.170
is that countries that
develop greater gender parity

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.950
over time in a variety of measures,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.040
actually do end up having
superior economic performance,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.160
and we can talk about why.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.053
So let me just tell you
a little bit about this,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.770
what the gender gap is trying to measure.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.260
Now I'm gonna say you can go to the

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.470
World Economic Forum website.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.980
The reports there, it's
become the second most

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.210
important report of the
World Economic Forum

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.210
all around the world,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.270
so people do at least look at it.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.550
It is a very good report,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.460
but it's pretty tedious reading.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.830
You have to go in and
sort of each country,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.820
you look at a whole bunch of measures.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.690
So I'm gonna try to summarize for you

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.080
what the results are.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.080
So we tried to measure gender parity

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.100
on a variety of dimensions that we thought

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.040
were relevant to economic performance.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.020
Obviously education is relevant
to economic performance.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.930
So a country that, if you think about

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.540
the workforce as being half female,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.400
you wanna educate the workforce
literate to illiteracy,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.440
primary, secondary, tertiary,
all the way through,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.200
you want to basically
achieve gender parity

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.510
in educational opportunity,
and educational attainment.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.710
So that was an obvious one.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.600
Health and survival, obvious.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.400
A country's performance
on the health and survival

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.650
of men and women, and
whether there are any

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.560
gender issues there is important.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.800
Economic participation and opportunity.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.270
So this is really, we look
at lots of things here.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.450
We look at what economists call

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.040
labor force participation rates,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.147
to what extent is the female population

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.890
of working age working,
labor force participation.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.030
But we don't just measure that,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.420
we measure pay gaps, gender gaps,

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.330
female, male differences in earnings.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.580
And we measure opportunity gaps,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.590
which we kind of look at
through attainment levels,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.460
and you'll see some of that later.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.853
And then political empowerment,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.710
because policies about the economy,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.400
policies about education,
policies about health

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.820
are going to be affected
by the gender parity,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.480
or lack thereof, in
political representation.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.530
So these are the areas.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.300
We have 142 countries.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.270
We have 14 variables, we rate them.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.110
We now have nine years of data.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.810
So you can sort of compare
countries over time

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.870
in terms of are they improving,

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.690
are they improving on one dimension

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.120
but declining on another.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.240
So this is what we're attempting to study.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.780
And we believe that four of these,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.560
these four areas are the major ones

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.260
for understanding a society's
approach to gender parity,

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.340
and we believe it's very important
for economic performance.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.460
So that's the first thing.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.420
Okay, this is a little
graphic which kind of says

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.690
how the world is doing.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.690
So each country gets measured,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.740
but we also do a weighted
average of all countries

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.800
to sort of say how's the
world on average doing

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.280
in gender parity in education,
gender parity in health,

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.020
in economic opportunity,
and political empowerment.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.720
And we use weighting measures.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.520
And what you can see right
here is that actually

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.880
the world today has made a
tremendous amount of progress

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.160
in eliminating gender disparities

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.500
in health, and in education.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.250
It has eliminated, not eliminated,

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.110
it's reduced disparities in

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.450
economic participation and opportunity,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.040
but there's a lot left to do.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.100
So you might read that as

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.873
the world has eliminated 60% of the gap.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.990
And then in political empowerment,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.740
we have a long way to go.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.550
Around the world,
there's a long way to go.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.880
Now I wanna say something about,

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.900
I wanna warn you about these numbers

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.440
before I show some countries.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.350
Just because a country
is doing pretty well

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.120
in terms of parity, doesn't mean that

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.320
the level of education
or health is that high.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.810
So we have a whole bunch of countries.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.530
Some are very developed.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.180
And they have a high
degree of gender parity.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.860
That means they're getting
high levels of education,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.920
high levels of health,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.350
and not much gender
difference in those areas.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.230
You have some very poor countries

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.000
who actually are doing
pretty well in gender parity,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.840
but they're poor, they're poor.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.800
So their degree of tertiary education

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.550
for both men and women might be low,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.550
or their degree of health
outcomes might be low

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.640
for both men and women.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.127
So I just wanna make sure
that one understands that

00:25:46.127 --> 00:25:49.040
to have a country score,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.220
a country score of one on something

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.600
means complete gender parity.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.433
Okay?

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.830
Very few countries get
that on almost anything,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.510
so now we will go to the next slide.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.623
Who's in the lead?

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.690
This is a graph which just shows averages,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.840
so those little lines are averages.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.960
Not to be, you would not
be surprised that we,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.520
when you look at these
countries, 142 countries,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.770
there's gonna be a regional effect.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.750
So the highest average
gender parity measures

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.240
are in North America, the US and Canada,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.930
however if you go down to
Europe and Central Asia,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.300
Europe has actually, those ones
way on the the right there,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.220
they are basically the
best performers in the lot,

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.960
and I'm gonna talk about them in a minute.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.000
There is a group of
European countries who,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.270
on all dimensions,
outperform everybody else.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.030
And some of you can probably
guess which ones those are.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.390
They're on the right.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.870
If you go down to the Middle
East and North Africa,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.360
you'll see the average is the lowest,

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.673
and you have some very
extreme outliers there.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.600
This shows, and I'll get to
a table, or a slide later,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.060
when you think about reasons
for gender disparities,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.390
clearly one of them is
going to be cultural.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:11.010
And I think you see
both a development level

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.630
and a cultural level showing up

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.360
in some of these regional differences.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.770
Let me just, since countries
like to see where they are,

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.360
one of the fascinating things about

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.270
if you ever create an index of everything,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.630
excuse me, create an index
of anything by country,

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.790
countries start to compete on it.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.790
So actually, this report
has become widely read.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.540
In part because country leaders,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.650
business leaders in a
country, NGOs in a country,

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.760
educational institutions, look
at how the country's doing,

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.980
and then they try to figure out

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.200
what can they do to get better.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.940
So this has the top 20 over here.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.950
You'll see the United States is number 20.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.410
And then it has some of the
other countries over there

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.810
going to the bottom,
Yemen 142, Pakistan 141,

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.070
and Saudi Arabia 130.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.763
And by the way, Saudi Arabia
has improved its gender gap,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.603
it's reduced its gender gap
in the last couple of years.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.820
It's moving in the right direction,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.530
but it's still as a ranking phenomenon,

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.730
one of the least performing countries.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.823
So let's talk a little bit
about who's in the lead.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:29.240
So you'll see those top
five countries there,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.360
they're the Nordic countries.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.460
For some of you in this room,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.850
that would not be a surprise,
you would predict that.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.120
That actually suggests a combination

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.820
of culture and policy
are very important here,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.740
the policy is reflecting the culture.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.740
And so when you have things
like compulsory paternity leave,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.240
not just maternity leave,
but paternity leave,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.150
so you don't have any
scapegoating of men and women,

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.370
both parents have to take leave

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.490
to take care of the children.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.020
When you have highly subsidized childcare

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.880
that lasts a very long time,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.270
when you have support
for part-time workers

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.870
at full-time salaries
so that people have time

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.990
to take care of their children,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.350
for both men and women.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.060
Those are reflections of
a set of social norms,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.840
which actually end up in policy

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.930
that actually does have an
effect on gender parity.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.693
If you go to the US for a minute,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.940
the US, not a bad performer.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.740
This number says we've eliminated

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.770
75% of our aggregate gender gap.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.310
Where the US is weakest is politics.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.150
We do not do well here.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:45.830
We're like, the way we measure politics,

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.940
we've only eliminated 20% of the gap.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.080
I think we're number 60
out of 142 countries.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.810
We have a lot of room to go

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.420
in politics in the United States.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.610
We measure politics here
in parliamentary seats,

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.303
ministerial positions, and head of state.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.680
You might say, now this
is just for those of you

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.720
who think about the challenges

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.210
of doing something like this with data.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:16.210
An ideal thing would be to
include mayors, or city council.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.950
The problem is, you can't
get numbers like that

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.520
for the 142 countries.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.150
You can't get it from
many countries at all,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.730
so if you're trying to
do this comparatively,

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.400
you have to chose data, statistics,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.460
measures that are common across countries.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.530
And that's how we end up with ministers,

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.360
parliamentarians and heads of state.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.480
If we managed to have a head of state

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.520
as a woman in the next few years,

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.800
this would fundamentally
change our position.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.910
But that's, I'm not
saying anything political.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.042
That's a purely statistical
observation, all right.

00:30:50.042 --> 00:30:50.875
(audience laughter)

00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:52.050
Purely statistical.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.500
Dynamics of the gender gaps.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.110
So we've done this for
nine years, any progress?

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.220
Not a whole lot.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.720
There's stuff going on in pol--

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.270
First of all, this shows
very clearly, again,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.230
that the biggest gaps around
the world are in politics.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.430
The most reduced gaps are
in education and health,

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.810
and the economic participation
and opportunities

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.910
are kind of in the middle there.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.070
We have made some progress

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:19.040
around the world in political empowerment.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.180
The progress is pretty slow.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.980
You can barely see, you
can see a little progress

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.300
in the economic participation
and opportunity line.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.700
The last time the report came out,

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.160
my colleagues at the World Economic Forum

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.080
used the rate of progress

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.310
in economic participation and opportunity,

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.640
and concluded if the world continues

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.130
at the progress of the last nine years,

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.880
it'll take 81 years to
close the gender gap

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.090
in economic participation and opportunity.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.473
So I think the world's
gonna be better than that.

00:31:50.473 --> 00:31:52.370
I don't think it's gonna take 81 years,

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.150
but that's what we found out.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.740
So.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.020
Now next.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.853
Okay.

00:31:58.853 --> 00:32:02.010
So now, this is what
the World Economic Forum

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.883
when they started to do this,

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.770
this is a question they were
interested in answering.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.030
Remember, the World Economic Forum

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:16.030
made its reputation by ranking countries

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.943
on their competitiveness
in the global economy.

00:32:18.943 --> 00:32:22.510
It's something called the
Global Competitiveness Index.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.020
And that's how they made their reputation.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.360
When I was back there with
my husband and flowered bags,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.600
that's the index they had.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.520
And they had a whole host
of things they measured

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.470
that they thought might be correlated

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.340
with competitiveness,
national competitiveness.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.653
Things like the rule of law, open trading,

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:49.010
regulation, education.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.390
Gender, not there.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.223
Not there.

00:32:52.223 --> 00:32:54.690
Remember, it was the mid
1990s, gender wasn't there.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.690
So the challenge for us was to say

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.510
would gender parity show up

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.440
as something that we
think it's related to,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.810
global competitiveness,
but does it show up?

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.150
So this suggests that yes, there
is a positive relationship,

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.610
it's statistically significant,

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.670
between how a country performs on its

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.900
global gender gap index, and
its global competitiveness.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.830
So moving towards gender parity

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.670
is associated with a
more competitive outcome.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.430
And so the whole reason
for doing the study

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.940
in the first place,
once we had the numbers

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.820
we could say okay, that seems to be

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.480
a relationship that makes sense.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.350
And then there's another one you can do,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.350
but it's a little bit the same thing.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.750
Global competitiveness is linked to

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:50.360
global GDP per capita, and GDP per capita

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.950
is the economist's favorite
measure of prosperity,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.660
so you measure a country's
prosperity by GDP per capita.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.680
And this says, yes, there
is a relationship between

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.740
the global gender gap
index and GDP per capita.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.050
So those were things that we
had anticipated finding out,

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.280
and we did find them.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.680
So.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.050
Now I'm gonna,

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.570
maybe I shouldn't put this one up yet.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.670
There's a lot more that I now wanna say,

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.230
moving from the World
Economic Forum itself

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.750
to actually other work that's been done

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:27.100
during this whole period, on women,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.600
gender parity, and economic performance.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.850
So the World Economic Forum is one study,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.530
one set of measures that
looks at this relationship.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.730
I mentioned at the beginning,

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.920
there's been a lot of
work going on on this,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.350
the International Monetary
Fund is working on it,

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.320
the World Bank is working on it,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.450
development economists have worked on it.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:49.600
And basically what they are working on,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.000
is how does a greater gender parity

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.430
affect economic performance, and why?

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:59.120
How does it affect it, and why?

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.200
Now to some extent, this is intuitive,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.810
it's absolutely intuitive.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.810
If half of the global
labor force was women,

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.440
and if women are becoming
as educated as men,

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.130
and we saw that in
terms of the gender gaps

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:20.240
in education really
disappearing around the world,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.940
then clearly, if you
believe that human talent

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.210
has an effect on economic performance,

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.920
then what you want to do is say that

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.260
greater gender parity
and economic opportunity

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.200
and participation will mean
greater mobilization of talent,

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.200
and that will lead to
superior economic performance.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.540
It's a very simple intuitive relationship.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.690
And I think that's really what

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.640
a lot of the research is now focused on.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.883
Now if you think about it that way,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.230
how does one look at measurements

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.150
of mobilizing gender talent.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.240
One simple way is what I mentioned before,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.163
labor force participation rates.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.470
The International Monetary Fund

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.130
is headed by a very outstanding
woman, Christine Lagarde,

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.630
and when she goes around the
world talking to countries

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:24.480
and giving them advice
about how to promote

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.510
their future economic prosperity,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.920
this is one of the
statistics she focuses on.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.290
Labor force participation rate for women,

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.860
and if you can get that
labor force participation

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.880
rate for women up to
closer to that for men,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.760
there will be faster economic growth.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.500
So the OECD, for example,

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.800
has estimated that if
there was gender parity

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.580
in labor force participation rates between

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.040
men and women in the developed economies,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.720
that would lead to an
increase by about 12%

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.903
of GDP per capita over a 20 year basis.

00:37:02.903 --> 00:37:04.870
That's a big number.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.130
You know, people sit
around all around the world

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.070
trying to figure out what to do

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.720
to promote economic growth,

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.330
that number is a big number.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.040
So if you can figure out a way

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.860
to mobilize women into the workforce,

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.030
that is gonna be a big movement towards

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.460
superior economic performance.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.590
But it's not just mobilizing
women in the workforce.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.610
The other things you
have to worry about are

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.950
around the world, in the US,

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.150
in every country to some extent,

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.340
even in the Nordic countries,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.000
women tend to be over represented

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.130
in relatively low productivity,

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.500
part-time, low pay, with
low advancement opportunity

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.850
sectors of the economy.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.580
They're over represented there,

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.010
and they're under represented in high pay,

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.600
high productivity, high
opportunity sectors.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.130
So if you actually are interested

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:59.780
in mobilizing female talent,

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.870
it's not just getting them to participate

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.960
in the workforce as much as men,

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.790
but to have them have the opportunities

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.510
in these high productivity,
high performance,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.220
high pay, high opportunity careers.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.050
So looking at that suggests one looks at

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.980
not just the labor force
participation rates,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.200
but the wage gaps, or the wage rates,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.193
or the productivity differences.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.070
And what you see there is just
like all around the world,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.370
the labor force
participation rates of women

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.383
tend to be lower than men.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.350
There is a persistent wage gap.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.890
Now the wage gap varies by country.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.480
It varies by sector.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.770
But you would still say
that it's persistent,

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:52.410
it's measurable, and it's significant.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.850
It's not a trivial number.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.470
And part of that gap of course,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.950
is that women are caught more

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.620
in these low productivity, low pay jobs.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.710
But even if you hold constant sector,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.360
even if you hold constant jobs,

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.990
then you still see the wage gap.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.000
So for example, in the US, female earnings

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.130
remain lower than men's
for similar skill levels

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.190
in nearly all occupations.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.850
That's in the US.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.370
Including occupations that
are predominantly held by men,

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.830
and occupations that are
predominantly held by women.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:31.300
Even in occupations
predominantly held by women,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.970
there is a wage gap.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.950
And that's for women of
same educational levels.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.880
So that's important.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.320
Another thing that's important,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.900
certainly relevant to
this audience I would say,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.370
is the wage gap tends to start small

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.810
for young women entering the labor force,

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.230
certainly in developed countries.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.380
That would be true in the US.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.760
Small wage gap at the beginning

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.150
gets bigger over time.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.730
Increases with child birth.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.360
But here's a surprise,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.710
is larger among top earners

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.810
and those with high levels
of educational attainment.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.933
It gets larger.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.380
And that, of course, is partly because

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.780
of what has been commonly
called opting out,

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.780
or motherhood, or taking care
of family responsibilities.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.040
You know there was
just, and I urge you all

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.980
to take a look at it,
it's really remarkable.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.030
My son just got married three weeks ago.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.730
Harvard Business School does a big survey

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:39.730
of male and female graduates
over the past 40 years.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.920
So they have some graduates

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.120
who are baby boomers like myself,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.810
they have some millennials,
who are just 30 years old.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.450
They asked the men and the women

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.510
what they expected in terms of

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.300
did they think their
career would be equally

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.050
as important as their
partners, or less important,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.850
and did they think
childcare responsibilities

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.343
would be equally shared,
or unequally shared.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.410
Women thought they were equally important,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.380
and responsibilities
would be equally shared.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.665
Men did not.

00:41:18.665 --> 00:41:19.498
(audient laughter)

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:23.950
These are expectations of Harvard
Business School graduates.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.790
Right, so this is now, this is today.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.660
This is right now.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.420
So you think about how the pressures on,

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.520
when you see these numbers,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.950
okay, the wage gap starts out not there,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:40.510
and then develops over time,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.340
and it develops over time with children,

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.620
and people opting out, and
all the responsibilities

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.738
that Esther said you have to juggle,

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:50.500
you still have to juggle.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.740
And societies that have made it easier,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.430
that's the Nordic countries,

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.650
tend to have over time,
better performance here

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.200
because they're taking some of
these family balancing issues

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.090
and they are working to make them easier.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.740
So it's just an important point

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.740
about the opting out
pressures of family on women,

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.020
and the fact that the OECD says

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.530
their estimate is the wage penalty,

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.863
terrible thing to say, per child,

00:42:25.863 --> 00:42:27.830
7% of your earnings.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:28.663
Okay.

00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:30.810
This is among developed countries.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.793
So this is some of the issues.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.570
Now, I wanna go from that however,

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.980
to make two important observations.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.980
Number one, the opting out
phenomenon is real, and costly,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.740
but it does not say, in any way,

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.670
that women are less ambitious than men.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.840
So again, in developed countries
there are lots of surveys,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.312
including the Harvard survey
that I just talked about,

00:42:58.312 --> 00:43:01.960
aspirationally speaking,
women want the same thing.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.240
They want the same thing on average.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.980
It's just harder for them to achieve.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.690
So this is not about
aspiration and ambition,

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.493
this is about how complicated
it is to achieve that.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.280
And the next thing is to say that

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.550
it's hard to achieve it not just because

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.740
many women are balancing work life,

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.080
it's hard to achieve it
because our workplaces

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.680
aren't really organized very well

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.340
to take, to promote gender parity.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.050
And so for that I'll use
this pipeline number.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:41.050
Okay, so this comes from McKinsey,

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.190
and there are two
different sort of surveys

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.710
that lead to the same result here.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.240
One is a survey of pipeline of women

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.880
in Fortune 500 companies,

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.730
another one is a set of surveys they did

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.430
with their own participants.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.910
You can see here that in the US,

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.260
and this can be true in the
developed countries as well,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.510
most of the developed countries as well,

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.290
women are at entry
level professions doing,

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:07.810
companies are coming
around to business schools

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.910
around the world, and
they are absolutely intent

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.270
on recruiting at parity.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.930
50%, 50%.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.680
In this survey, actually the women were

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.230
outperforming men a little bit.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.220
But then you can see the fall off.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.150
The fall off to middle management,

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.160
then the fall off to senior management,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.570
then the fall off to executive committee,

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.970
then the fall off to top position.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.610
So by the time you get
to the top position,

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.400
I think the current number
for the US Fortune 500

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.770
is 5%, but we're not talking
about a major difference.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.790
So now we have a variety,

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:47.790
we have a large number of
experts around the world

00:44:48.023 --> 00:44:50.390
who are doing a variety of techniques

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.130
to figure out why this happens.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.030
Why does this happen?

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.430
Some of this is opting out,

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.880
but it's not all opting
out, it's absolutely not.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.820
There is a lot of evidence that women

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.900
are not giving line opportunities

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.440
to the same extent as men are.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.090
That they don't go in and negotiate

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.370
for a line opportunity to the
same extent that a man does,

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.220
that the performance
indicators that are used

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.770
in the workplace are not picking up

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.360
women's performance as well as men.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.660
Again, I'll just point
out that there have been

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.300
some really interesting
articles you can take a look at,

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.830
a series that Sheryl Sandberg
is doing with Adam Grant,

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.830
who's a very well known
organizational behavior economist,

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:37.570
and they're in the New York Times,

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.000
and they're doing a series,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.630
and one of the things you
can see are things like

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.940
on average evaluations of
women in the workplaces

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.410
tend to be more critical.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.950
There was a killer article
just a couple weeks ago

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.680
in something called the
Upshot in the New York Times

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.020
where they actually, I don't
know if you saw this, Fiona,

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.330
but they actually looked at rankings

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.820
of male and female professors

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.583
by students around the country,

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.010
and both male and female students

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.750
were much tougher on the women.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.160
Much tougher on the women

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.810
in terms of using words
that were much more

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.340
sort of, the bossy word,

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.540
the aggressive word, the insensitive word.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.370
Not the leadership word,
not the kind of talent word,

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:30.110
not the, so there are all
kinds of evaluation issues

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.520
that I think are real.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.163
And that shows up in the pipeline as well.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.080
Another pipeline measure
for you is Credits Suisse

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.730
just did a really interesting study,

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.360
and they said, "We have another problem."

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.310
Women get in the pipeline,

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.370
but they get in the pipeline in terms of

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.500
shared services, things
where team spirit matters.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.230
Things with a common service
like human resources,

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.830
or investor relations.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.610
They get much less into the CFO,

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.220
and then operations, no, that's not where

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.180
they get the promotion opportunities,

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.780
and then of course, the operations

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.670
tend to lead oftentimes to CEO positions,

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.570
so they're not in that.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.090
So I think we have a
whole lot of work to do

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.560
in developed countries, in companies,

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.600
and in policy, to think
about what we can do

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.050
to improve the flow
through in the pipeline.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.920
Because after all, if
women are getting educated

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.430
to this very high level,

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.320
and we're losing them in the pipeline,

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.990
and some of that can be improved by better

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:37.990
workplace training, better
workplace evaluation of talent,

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.790
then we should do that.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.580
That's better for the company,

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.410
it's better for the individual,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.310
it's better for the country.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:49.440
So that's something
that I think has become

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.930
a big focus of research now in many,

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:57.900
many business schools, including at Haas.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.980
So companies.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.100
There's growing evidence that

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.410
the business case for promoting women

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:09.330
is actually very strong.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:14.330
So what we have is a
more diverse leadership

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.440
of a company means the
company better reflects

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.590
the profiles of employees and customers.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:25.080
It has, there's a lot of
evidence that more diverse teams

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.930
lead to better decisions,

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.820
so diversity in teams,
both gender diversity

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.400
and other kinds of diversity
leads to better decisions.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.680
Companies that are ranked on indicators

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.600
of organizational health, like
how well do people get along,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.600
open communications, trust,

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.750
more where there's greater diversity,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.820
or greater parity in leadership,

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.600
those companies get ranked

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.400
as having higher organizational health.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.420
And then what Credit Suisse has reported,

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.040
and others have found the same thing,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.290
is companies that have more gender parity

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.930
in their pipeline all
the way through the top,

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.490
tend to have better financial performance.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.880
So let me summarize
where we are right now.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.880
There's a very strong
country level economic case

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.320
that moving towards greater gender parity,

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:25.720
achieving gender equality
in health, education,

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.750
economic engagement and
political empowerment

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:34.050
have beneficial effects on
national economic performance.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.350
There is a very strong literature,

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:41.210
and it's become very compelling to read,

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.679
that that is also true at
the level of companies.

00:49:44.679 --> 00:49:47.230
And the biggest global
companies in the world now

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.530
recognize this and are
trying to figure out

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:56.530
how to mobilize more female talent.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.200
So the country level data suggests

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.400
it's gonna take 81 years to get to parity.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.880
The company level data
says, for the Fortune 500

00:50:07.808 --> 00:50:09.240
we're only 5% of leadership,

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:14.060
we got a lot of space we need to fill up,

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.600
what's going on, what are the barriers?

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.830
What can we work on?

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.370
From a policy point of view,

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.000
or from a company point of view,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.610
or from a university point of view,

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:27.530
what can we work on to
get this moving faster

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.870
to greater gender parity?

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.330
Because we'll all be better off.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:35.330
So this is just a table you can take

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.200
to think about if you're
interested in this,

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.700
and I tried to put together some issues

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.790
that were both at the
level of the individual.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.720
Things we can do at the
level of the individual,

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.130
things we need to address
at the level of culture,

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.040
things that companies
or universities can do

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.963
at the level of the workplace,

00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:01.030
and what policy makers can do to try to

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.610
get us to make progress faster.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.070
We still need to make progress,

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:06.480
there are benefits to progress,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.510
we're not going fast enough, okay.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.090
So I'm not gonna go through all these

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:12.040
'cause then we'd be here for five hours.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.070
I'm just gonna pick out
a couple of the ones

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.360
that I think are really interesting here.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.750
Educational choices.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:23.420
So this is the level of the student

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.110
and what they choose to study.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.343
So this is an educational institution.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.940
Walter Isaacson wrote that
wonderful book about innovation.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:37.710
He has written a lot about the
role of women in computers.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:40.880
In 1985, 37% of computer science

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.410
undergraduate degrees
were earned by women.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:49.080
In 2010, only 18% of
computer science degrees

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.620
were earned by women,

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.200
and less that 1% of
female college freshmen

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.790
say they plan to major
in computer science.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.770
Less than 1%.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:03.770
Now, the majority, the top
10 most remunerative careers

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.090
are associated with
certain college majors.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.880
One of those is computer science, okay.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.050
If you sort of look at the
other nine of the top 10,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.210
they're in STEM,

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:20.690
they're science, technology,
engineering, and math.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.950
In all 10 of those highly
remunerative majors,

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.460
meaning majors that lead to
highly remunerative positions,

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.713
the majority of majors are men.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.370
Women are the majority of majors

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:35.650
in the 10 least remunerative majors.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.330
10 least ones.

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:41.220
So this is partly a choice,

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.010
and I think what people
are working very hard on

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.280
is where does this choice come from.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.180
Does this have to do with
the fact that for me,

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.750
economics was not a male discipline,

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:51.860
I was fine with economics,

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.220
I didn't have to worry about
all of the stereotyping,

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:58.350
or cultural biases against
doing a male major 'cause

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.370
I was in a female school,
there were no males.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:03.490
So there's a whole set of things going on,

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:07.900
really starting at preschool,
5th grade, 8th grade,

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.260
college, trying to figure
out how to make it,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.360
how to deal with this choice

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.440
when we think that the choice may not be

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.010
maybe structured by some of the

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:24.560
cultural norms like stereotyping.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.358
So I would just leave that as one.

00:53:26.358 --> 00:53:30.160
Individuals need to change
their choices partly,

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.780
if we're going to make progress on this.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.200
Cultural, look, I've already
talked about work life

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.030
balance, priorities, and
I think I will leave that.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.860
The spousal role in
support comes directly from

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.500
the Harvard Business School
study I just mentioned.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.500
By the way, I have not raised with my son

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.080
and daughter-in-law whether
they ever had that discussion,

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.700
and what their expectations are,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.273
so I'm staying out of this.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.400
Workplace.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:59.280
I wanna focus on this because companies

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.530
are focusing on mentorship and training.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.880
They feel that, and I think
Esther mentioned this,

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.840
how important mentors are,

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.840
and if you, part of that
pipeline deterioration

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.610
is that women don't
have access to mentors,

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.160
because there are not that
many women ahead of them

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.400
who can be the mentor or the model.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.990
So they have to rely upon male mentors,

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.220
and maybe male mentors are
not as engaged with them,

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.330
or maybe they feel there's some distance.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:32.140
So mentorship and training
is very important.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.660
Awareness and accountability.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.670
I wanna talk about that
because it came so much

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:40.660
to the forefront last fall.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:45.660
So last fall the relatively
new CEO of Microsoft

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.120
was at an event that was celebratory

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:54.870
of women in computer science.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.750
And he was asked a question
about whether women

00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:02.750
should ask for raises.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.100
He said he thought women
shouldn't ask for raises

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.749
because that was bad karma.

00:55:10.749 --> 00:55:11.730
(audience laughter)

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.790
He actually said that if
women didn't ask for raises,

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:20.750
their talent would be recognized
and they would get a raise.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.130
Okay.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.553
That's a very meritocratic answer.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.790
But it turns out it flies in the face of

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.660
a lot of evidence we have.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.220
We have a lot of evidence,

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.190
and the evidence suggests two things.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.410
Number one.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:37.110
Women on average, this
is not true of all women,

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:38.340
so all of these are averages,

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.690
do not like to negotiate.

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:45.170
Women describe negotiation
as like going to the dentist.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:48.710
Men describe negotiation as
like going to a ballgame.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:49.950
They like it.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:53.760
So the evidence suggests
that equally competent

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.760
men and women will, the
women are much less likely

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.670
to ask for a raise, much less likely.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.340
Because they don't feel good about that.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.300
Now if you are a CEO, you're a company

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.030
and you wanna promote female talent,

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.600
you have to know that.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.370
You have to know that,
and you have to design

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.940
your human resources policies
to deal with that reality.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.590
That is the reality.

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.080
Women are less confident than men,

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.380
and they are less, on average,

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.260
and they are less comfortable
with negotiating for wages.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.490
So you have to know that

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.640
to get awareness and accountability.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.110
Absolutely need to know that.

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:37.210
So there's a whole list of
research that deals with that.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:40.000
And then structure and policy.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.165
I've talked about this in terms of

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:47.165
the countries that are really
moving the furthest here.

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.803
The focus is on shared parental leave,

00:56:50.803 --> 00:56:54.590
childcare assistance, tax policy,

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:56.380
because you don't wanna have a tax policy

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.380
which is differentiated in such a way

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:04.933
that it discourages the second
earner of the family to work.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.190
You certainly need to have
workplace equality laws,

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:11.000
I mean you need to have
the basic institutions

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.270
that are in place.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:13.330
And then the last one,

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.750
organizations designed
for men in manufacturing.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:18.150
This gets to workplace flexibility.

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:22.938
This gets to the issue of most jobs today

00:57:22.938 --> 00:57:27.810
do not require a physical
presence all the time

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.200
on a production line,

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.290
and since flexibility turns out
to be of critical importance

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:37.320
to women, particularly at
certain times in their life,

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.040
organizing the workplace
around flexibility

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.250
is gonna become more and more important.

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:45.090
So now I'm gonna leave you
with my most fun slide,

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.240
but I wanna say with this slide

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:52.240
that this reflects the work
ongoing of a group of scholars

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:56.660
around the country who
are trying to look at

00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.500
relevant differences in gender behavior,

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.140
that are relevant to policy makers.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.630
They're thinking about what can we do

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.720
to promote gender parity,

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.950
or to business leaders who are thinking

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.170
what can we do to promote gender parity.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:13.650
You need to know these
kinds of differences

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:15.390
if you're going to do the right things.

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.313
So these are some of the differences.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.714
Men show up in study after
study to be more confident.

00:58:23.714 --> 00:58:28.000
In study after study
they turn up to be more,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.908
they like competition more.

00:58:29.908 --> 00:58:32.630
They are willing to negotiate more.

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:34.440
Women worry about backlashes,

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.080
they worry about stereotypes,

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.440
they're a little worried about,

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.980
when you see these results
of how the students

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.740
evaluated their professors,

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.620
you're a little worried about stereotypes.

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.140
Okay, you're a little worried about being

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.810
the bossy, unfeeling, domineering woman.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.090
Which if you use the same words for men

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:56.090
would be the leader,
insightful, inspiring male.

00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:00.306
So these are just a whole
variety of differences,

00:59:00.306 --> 00:59:03.180
and I'll leave you, again,

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.800
we can talk about any one of these,

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.630
but the good news here is that

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:10.830
scholars around the country,

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:12.360
and indeed around the world,

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.500
using very sophisticated techniques now,

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.730
are actually confirming, to my mind,

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.710
some things of gender differences which

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:24.380
anecdotally I heard all my life,

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.420
but actually now I can see
that in experimental settings,

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.660
or in large survey
settings with a lot of data

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.243
and a lot of rigor,
they're being documented.

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.810
So now let me conclude here,

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:40.760
because I was asked to make
this a little bit personal,

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.310
with some personal
observations about my own life.

00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:46.840
I started with the fact that

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.650
Berkeley was very important to me.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.950
Academic life is a kind of life

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:58.710
which does allow you to ramp your time up

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.450
and ramp your time down.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:04.430
To opt out a little bit when
your child is really young,

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.530
then to opt back in, figure a year later.

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.620
So there are certain occupations

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.550
which are naturally more
flexible than others,

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:15.210
and university professor, for me,

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.210
I mean I always wanted to
be a university professor,

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:19.570
not because of that,
but it turned out that

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.313
that was really good, that
was really a big plus.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.880
But I do wanna say that

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.090
in thinking about my own life,

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:33.390
first of all, my son
asked me a few years ago,

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:36.367
he said, "Mom, the women I'm dating

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.707
"want you to write a book because

01:00:37.707 --> 01:00:39.260
"they wanna know how you did it."

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.727
And he said, "And I don't
know how you did it.

01:00:41.727 --> 01:00:44.400
"I was your son, but I have no idea."

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.430
I didn't write the book,

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.330
maybe I should've at that point.

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:52.150
But I do think that, besides
having a flexible job,

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.820
which would be part of my answer,

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.840
being an academic at a
prestigious university

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.210
which was flexible with me

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:00.690
was a very important
part of what I could do.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.140
So a workplace designed with flexibility

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.583
in mind is gonna be great.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:11.330
But frankly, I also had a
largely stay at home spouse.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.220
So if you read Sheryl
Sandberg's book Lean In,

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.950
she has two lessons in her book.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.020
One is lean in, negotiate,

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.240
say what you're willing
to do to take that job,

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.700
don't let yourself be overlooked,

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.880
all those things about
negotiating, competition,

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.540
those things are part of leaning in.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.163
She also says marry the right person.

01:01:33.163 --> 01:01:33.996
(audience laughter)

01:01:33.996 --> 01:01:35.870
Now I wanna say, I do think,

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.860
I don't know how you manage
to figure this all out,

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.420
is there like some big
job interview that you do,

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.560
anyway, spouses really do matter

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.530
because of all the things
we talked about earlier.

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:47.460
Partnerships matter.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.420
I think Esther and Harvey's
partnership really matters.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.180
You can see this, one of the things

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.700
that's really interesting is

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.720
if you look at Catalyst,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.920
Catalyst is a very good
source of information

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.580
on gender differences in businesses.

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:07.450
So 75% of men holding
top business positions

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:10.040
in the United States have spouses

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.110
or partners who are not employed.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.060
75%.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.670
Okay, not employed.

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.570
75% of women holding similar positions

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.863
have spouses or partners
who are employed full-time.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.540
Balance, balance, balance.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.100
I had a spouse who was working from home,

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.930
and so that made my life
considerably easier.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.990
And I, in thinking about what lessons

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.970
I would have for people,

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:39.440
the lessons are flexible
career, flexible spouse,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.580
spouse who works at home.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.223
They're not generally applicable, I'd say.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:47.200
However, even in that setting,

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.440
the job I had that was most inflexible

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.420
was working for Bill Clinton.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.700
Any working for any president,

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.630
there's no flexibility in that.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.520
No flexibility.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.970
So that job was a job that I had,

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:04.370
that my husband had, that my son had.

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:05.860
It was our job.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.330
It was a family job.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.450
At the end of four years,

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:13.670
the two other people who
had the job besides me,

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.007
said, "We're done with this job.

01:03:16.007 --> 01:03:17.987
"We're going back to Berkeley.

01:03:17.987 --> 01:03:20.387
"You're welcome to come with us."

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.430
Now, I decided to come with them.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.530
I could've stayed.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.750
I actually had the opportunity

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.870
to get a cabinet level position,

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.270
and I told the president I was going.

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.550
But this is about the
nature of jobs, by the way,

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:37.020
because I wasn't the
only person who did that.

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.410
Bob Reich, who's a professor at Cal,

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.410
and a good friend of mine,

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:43.280
and my husband happens to be
out to dinner with him tonight,

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.170
Bob Reich and his family went through

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:49.390
exactly the same discussion
at exactly the same time.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.640
And Bob and I both left government.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.770
So there are certain careers,

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:57.270
and certain inflexibilities
where you have to

01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:00.030
essentially say, this is a family,

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.510
and families have to balance
over the lifetime of a family

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:08.510
how you deal with spousal
issues of careers.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.210
Last night, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg was being interviewed,

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:15.977
and she said, "You know,
when I was younger,

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.987
"my husband wanted to make
it in this New York law firm

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:20.440
"in five years, in record time."

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.830
She said, "I did everything
so he could do that."

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.747
And she said, "Since then,

01:04:23.747 --> 01:04:25.293
"he's been doing everything for me."

01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:26.630
(laughter)

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.510
That was the balance
they did in their life.

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:32.560
So there are very important
personal parts of this

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.560
that you can't, a workplace
can design a flexible job.

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.200
But some jobs are not gonna be flexible,

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.330
and therefore the flexibility's
gonna have to come

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.780
in the family and the
expectations of the family.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:51.660
So I think that leaning
in is important for women.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.950
Leaning in is important for their spouses.

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.470
Leaning in is also
important for companies,

01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:59.687
that is, companies have to say,

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:03.837
"What can I do to make my workplace

01:05:03.837 --> 01:05:08.800
"a more flexible, gender
parity supporting workplace?"

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.500
Companies have to lean in.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.440
And of course, governments
have to lean in.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.280
And this is where I hope,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.070
the US is not at all a leader here.

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:18.860
Absolutely not a leader here

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.580
compared to other developed countries.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.380
I mean, just think about it this way.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:27.260
In France you get, I think,
a month and a half off

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.140
from work before your child is born,

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.460
two and a half months after,

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.460
and then you get full pay
for working 80% of the time.

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:38.080
That's how they've handled it.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.200
Different societies handle it,

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.920
but they have very
supportive family policies,

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.720
and the US does not.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.350
And as a consequence of that,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.780
one of the things that's happened is

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.610
our labor force participation rates

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.620
are no longer leading the world,

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.850
and our wage gap numbers are
no longer leading the world.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:58.650
That is, we're not showing,

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.150
some people say that what's happened

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:02.150
is we achieved a lot of increasing

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:03.890
gender parity for a while,

01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:05.440
and then we kinda hit a wall,

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.520
we hit a wall around 2000,

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.550
and since that time labor
force participation rates

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.900
for women in the US have been coming down,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.840
and the wage gap has stabilized.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.300
So women were making progress
at closing the wage gap,

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.210
but then it just stopped.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.870
So we need to think about,

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.540
from a policy point of view,

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.670
if we're committed to
greater gender parity,

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:27.860
what to do in the United States.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:31.530
So why don't I leave it
policy, family, companies.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.620
There are great benefits to be had

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.900
from promoting gender parity.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.480
There's lots to be done.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.560
When we do it, we have to understand

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.480
that there are these
underlying differences

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.500
in how people behave,

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.820
and we have to shape our
institutions accordingly.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.974
Thank you.

01:06:45.974 --> 01:06:48.974
(audience applause)

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:01.390
- Thank you very much for a talk that was

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.110
not only inspiring, but also wise.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.110
- Thank you.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.660
- I'd love to dominate the questions,

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.530
but I know there are lots
of people in the audience

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.590
who also have questions.

01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:14.380
Because we're taping this,

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.970
one of the wonderful things we do

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.480
is record these lectures and post them

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.480
so that people can review
them for posterity.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:27.280
I'd ask anybody who was questions

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.120
to come up to the mic here

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.140
so that their questions can be heard.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.963
So, yes please start.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:41.953
- Thank you.

01:07:41.953 --> 01:07:44.670
Laura, your points hit
home on so many levels.

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:47.210
I'm a headhunter, I do executive search

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:50.053
for software start-up
companies in Silicon Valley.

01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:56.370
I have for years been saying
exactly what you said up there,

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.870
that women won't negotiate,

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:00.930
that women won't take
chances, they're risk averse.

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.130
They don't wanna be entrepreneurs,

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.240
they'd rather work for somebody
else, they don't want that.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.330
They won't go out on a limb,
they don't have the confidence.

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:13.330
So what can I do when female after female,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.560
and it takes a long time to find

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.440
a really qualified female executive,

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.700
turns me down for an offer because

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.070
they don't wanna trade
off maybe a little bit

01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:27.590
of cash compensation for
equity in the company,

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.310
or because they feel that they've reached

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:32.730
a point of prominence in a large company

01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:35.597
and think to themselves, "If I leave,

01:08:35.597 --> 01:08:40.070
"I won't feel that status
that I've attained."

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:42.360
- So look, I don't think,

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.940
I think to some extent,

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.950
particularly on these kinds of things,

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:50.950
I think the most you can do
is point out to individuals,

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:52.930
whether they're male or female,

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:56.450
that, though they're making a choice,

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.080
they should understand that that choice

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:04.080
may reflect a broader
set of cultural norms

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.730
that they've absorbed without even

01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:07.080
realizing they've absorbed them.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.920
I mean, you both have to
give people the opportunity

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.590
to say I'm a more risk averse person,

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:17.270
but I think by letting people know,

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:19.550
you know women are more risk averse.

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:21.520
If you're a mentor and you're saying

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.920
women tend to be more risk averse,

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.320
are you sure this is, did you know that?

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.320
Do you feel that maybe
you should take this risk?

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.270
It's a little bit more talking to them

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:35.450
about the evidence, and making
it a little less personal.

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:36.630
But at the end of the day,

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:40.140
I don't think you can,
if that's their decision,

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.880
it is their decision, it
absolutely is their decision.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.990
Then what you can do
for the kind of careers

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.730
you're talking about, is actually work on

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:51.750
why women choose the majors they choose.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:56.750
Or why they, do they not
see role models that,

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.760
if there are not enough
role models out there

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.560
for them to see, then the
risk to them seems higher,

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.460
so they're less likely to do it.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.123
So in a sense you have to say,

01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:12.980
choose the riskier major,
choose the riskier career

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.510
because you could be a model.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.850
And you can't expect to see
a lot of models out there

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.240
because there are not yet.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.980
But I don't know, I tend
in these kinds of things

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.760
when I'm talking to young women

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.500
just to point out that they exist.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.943
And so I've talked to
women who actually said,

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:33.410
a woman recently was talking about

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.410
how she felt she was not being paid

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:37.210
appropriately at a venture capital firm,

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:39.620
and I said well, have you gone in

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.897
and talked to them about it?

01:10:40.897 --> 01:10:42.740
"Well no, I don't feel
comfortable doing it."

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.910
And then I say you actually have to do it.

01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:48.655
You have to do it because you're
just confirming the notion

01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:53.655
of the unwillingness to
negotiate actually will affect

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:56.770
how you're paid over time.

01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:57.980
That's just the way it is.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.840
Those are the norms.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.257
Until the companies themselves say,

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.827
"I understand that
there's this difference,

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:07.177
"therefore I'm gonna go
out and actually not,

01:11:07.177 --> 01:11:09.537
"I'm gonna evaluate men
and women in such a way

01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:13.530
"that negotiating differences
don't affect outcomes."

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:16.530
That would be the
company's solution to that.

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:18.440
For the individual solution to that,

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.600
it's gotta be to recognize
that these differences exist,

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.870
and that it's worth going in.

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:26.927
Because if you go in, see I
think you can go in and say,

01:11:26.927 --> 01:11:31.197
"By the way, I'm here,
and the CEO of Microsoft

01:11:31.197 --> 01:11:33.297
"said something and
it's actually not true.

01:11:33.297 --> 01:11:35.857
"Women in general are not being recognized

01:11:35.857 --> 01:11:37.217
"for their performance,

01:11:37.217 --> 01:11:39.280
"and I think I wanna bring
it to your attention."

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.150
You could actually bring a
whole bunch of this evidence

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:43.110
into the room with you.

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:48.110
So, but look, I don't have a solution,

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:53.190
because women do, even
though it may be the case

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.380
that a lot of the women
you're dealing with

01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:01.380
are women who have been affected
by these cultural norms,

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.880
and if they could sort
of break out of them

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.070
and behave differently,
they have been affected,

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:08.000
so I don't know how to change that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.600
I don't know how to change that.

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:14.770
- [Woman] Throughout this
whole talk I've been thinking

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:16.920
how grateful I was that you were my mentor

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.200
my first year here on the faculty

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.670
at UC Berkeley in teaching.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.503
- Yeah.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.160
- [Woman] So thank you.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.130
- Thank you, I was very happy to do it.

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:30.100
- [Woman] We did a study
between, I think, 11 universities

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.770
that looked at STEM disciplines,

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:36.657
and their percentage within both academia

01:12:36.657 --> 01:12:39.470
and in industry, and partly
there were some people

01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:41.600
from the European Union there.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.300
And it was interesting
looking at your statistics

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.950
about these are jobs,
these are disciplines

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.510
where there's higher income earning,

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.060
and so the higher empowerment.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.380
But we did find that in
an interesting reversal

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.940
than the pattern you were showing,

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.313
that in many of the
Scandinavian countries,

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:05.150
and Switzerland, the percentage of women

01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:07.260
actually in engineering
or STEM disciplines

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.950
is relatively low, and
Turkey was the highest.

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:13.890
- That's interesting,
that's very interesting.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:18.050
- [Woman] So did you ever
disaggregate by discipline

01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:19.880
in any of those studies?

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.560
- So I was using a whole
bunch of different studies

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.150
which sort of come to
the kind of conclusions

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:28.220
that I was suggesting to you.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.380
I said at the beginning, these are not,

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.560
none of these are my
exact area of expertise.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.080
I do know that number that
I gave you about majors,

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.870
that was a US number,

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.466
that was a kind of choice
of majors in the US.

01:13:42.466 --> 01:13:45.980
I certainly think that
as much as possible,

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.480
the important thing to do here

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.670
is cross country comparisons.

01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:52.380
I mean that's one of the
reasons I recommend highly

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.460
this report that Credit
Suisse did recently,

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.290
because they looked at the pipelines

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:02.020
of women to top management positions,

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.940
and board positions, across
a wide variety of countries,

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.110
and you see that narrowing
pipeline every place.

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:12.210
So you actually do have
a lot of countries now,

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:14.780
you can see that parity

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.150
at the beginning is largely achieved,

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:22.280
but it really dissipates significantly,

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.360
and then the question is what's common

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.470
to the companies or the countries

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:30.410
that explains this common phenomenon.

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:34.500
But I'm not, what would
be interesting to me

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.850
to think about in the
Scandinavian cases is

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:43.850
do women, because of the
cultural norms there,

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:48.760
the pay differentials
between these careers

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.660
may not be nearly as dramatic

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.900
as they are in the United States.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:56.700
So the very big differences in pay

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.928
that result from STEM
versus non-STEM in the US

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:03.630
may be much more extreme
than it is in Scandinavia.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:05.930
After all, we know in Scandinavia

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:07.300
that teachers are paid much better

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.200
than they're paid here.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.550
So just as a start you'd expect

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.303
the differential not to be that large.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:13.240
- [Women] I think that's it.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.290
They would talk about,
particularly in Denmark,

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:18.550
the cultural differences
whereas the women from Turkey

01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:21.320
and Algeria said it wasn't gendered,

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.449
engineering wasn't
considered to be gendered.

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:27.040
- So yes, how do you explain that

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.570
computer science became so
gendered in the United States?

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:31.080
I don't understand that myself.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.113
So I don't have, you need to tell us that.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.300
But it's very important.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.220
Look, one of the things
that's absolutely true

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.980
is that if you look,

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.240
another thing about the
Credit Suisse study.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.360
So they looked at breakdowns by sector,

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.940
as well as by country.

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:55.557
And of course, certain
sectors have much less

01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:01.180
gender disparity in outcome in
companies than other sectors.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.653
So mining and manufacturing
have the biggest disparities.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:10.300
Recreation and health are
gonna have smaller disparities.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.950
You still see the disparities,
but they're much smaller.

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:15.840
So part of this is also sectoral.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.390
So there's a lot of, what
I tried to do in the talk

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:21.910
is sort of say that
there are common things,

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.650
there are enough common
things across companies

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.240
and across countries that there is

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.650
a gender issue wherever you look.

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:33.360
It manifests itself differently,

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.600
but there are gender issues,

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.790
both in politics and in
economic participation.

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:41.138
That's what I would say.

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:42.320
- [Fiona] We'll take one last question.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.520
- Okay, thank you.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.020
Hi, my name is Michael Stager,

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.461
I work in Global Economics
with the Schuler Institute.

01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:51.410
I really appreciate your speaking tonight.

01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:55.010
And my question, I came
actually to hear what you think,

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.240
what I think is probably the most

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.993
important question on the planet today.

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:00.410
And I wanted your input.

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:05.120
And so, freedom to make
one point of context

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.040
before I can make the question.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.510
So Chancellor Merkel
and President Hollande

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:14.333
recently made a trip to Moscow,
and then again to Minsk.

01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:18.570
And there was discussion,
there was a presentation

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:21.700
by a former ambassador to
Russia, Jack Matlock, recently,

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.860
at the National Press Club,

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.420
that we are closer to nuclear war today

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.803
than we were even in the
1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:33.810
So the world is in grave danger.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.350
Many Americans, many people in the world

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.100
are very unaware of such things,

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.870
but clearly the events and steps taken

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:42.330
by Merkel and Hollande
indicates such a situation.

01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:43.163
Now the other side of it,

01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:46.930
and this is the economic
question, is Greece,

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:48.030
and what Greece indicates.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.693
Because it's a very big question,

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.100
and Greece has an option.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.440
Where I'm not sure the
European Union does.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.800
There are nations now known as the BRICS,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.060
Russia, China, India,
Brazil, South Africa,

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.350
nations like Egypt or Argentina
which are joining them,

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:08.000
with incredible economic
growth commitments.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.320
Engineering, science, food production.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.973
Just remarkable process.

01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:15.940
So I'd like to know, we have an initiative

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:19.470
for the United States to join
in that process, the BRICS,

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:20.880
and I'd like to know if you would

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.050
support something like that,

01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:25.270
and what you generally think
in this political context

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:27.330
of this economic question,

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:29.380
which does seem to be
a bit of an east, west,

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.530
or just a divide of two
systems in the world today.

01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:35.740
I don't think the question's
relevant to this talk,

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.990
but I have thought a lot.

01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:38.840
I mean if you're talking about BRICS,

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.420
Brazil, Russia, is that
what you mean by BRICS?

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:47.560
So the truth is, and it is relevant

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.860
to this talk in one respect,

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.860
there is an inexorable
and significant shift

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.800
in the weight of the global economy,

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.950
away from the developed
countries towards the BRICS,

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:02.900
towards the emerging market economies.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:07.030
The two major economies that
drive global growth today

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:08.830
are the US and China.

01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:12.380
China is growing, even with
a significant slow down,

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.960
twice as fast as the US.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.980
China does, actually, quite a good job,

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.810
and it would be interesting to hear

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:22.750
Esther and Harvey talk about
this, on gender issues,

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:27.750
on mobilizing their
talented female workforce,

01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:32.140
and on educating their female workforce.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:35.310
But there clearly is this shift going on

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:40.310
in the world economy,
and different society,

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.950
so what I was trying to say by this

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:47.480
is that you can see that across society,

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.880
at different levels of development,

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.220
even ones that have been committed to

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.580
gender parity for a very long time,

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.970
and have it deeply embedded
in their cultural norms,

01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:59.130
and deeply embedded in their
political institutions,

01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:03.170
have a ways to go, and those
would be the Nordic countries.

01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.910
A very interesting
thing going on right now

01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:08.480
is Japan is basically
studying as much as possible

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.960
what's going on in the Nordic countries,

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.650
and trying to do exactly the same thing.

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:12.930
I mean, it's really quite interesting.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:15.823
They've adopted the Nordic
countries as their example.

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:20.900
But the emerging market countries,

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.070
I mean, so here's, when we listed

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.823
all the countries by gender gap,

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:30.840
certain countries came forward

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.237
to the World Economic Forum and said,

01:20:32.237 --> 01:20:34.637
"We would like to set up a task force

01:20:34.637 --> 01:20:37.047
"with business leaders in our society

01:20:37.047 --> 01:20:42.047
"to improve our performance on
the gender parity measures."

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.120
So what were these countries?

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.070
One was Turkey.

01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:47.880
One was Korea.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.130
One is India.

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:53.040
And one is Mexico.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.927
So these are countries that
just came forward and said,

01:20:54.927 --> 01:20:58.127
"You know, we really
think we can do better.

01:20:58.127 --> 01:20:59.597
"We see the case here,

01:20:59.597 --> 01:21:02.187
"we see that there's
economic benefit to this.

01:21:02.187 --> 01:21:04.387
"We see that we have very talented women

01:21:04.387 --> 01:21:05.677
"that we're not mobilizing enough.

01:21:05.677 --> 01:21:07.580
"Let us work on this together."

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.230
So I think, let's say emerging markets

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.630
are becoming more and more important,

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:14.390
and a number of the big ones now

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:17.210
are focused on this issue.

01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:20.920
And that's how I will
relate to the question,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.695
because it's hard for
me to draw another link.

01:21:23.695 --> 01:21:24.660
Okay.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.840
- [Man] Professor Tyson.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.250
- Yes.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.640
- [Man] As a former student,

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.460
last time we met I was
finishing my PhD at UCLA.

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:40.190
I've also worked since
on development issues.

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:43.540
I've actually seen a very clear connection

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.960
with your presentation today,

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.530
which is really talking
about how social constructs

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:55.530
manifest themselves in economic processes.

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.440
Whether it's at the
micro level of the firm,

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.860
or just individual decisions.

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.410
But what's really interesting is that

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:08.410
as the economy is also
shaping and transforming

01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:10.980
the way that industry is formed,

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.470
and these countries
are competing to absorb

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:17.020
the highest levels of productivity,

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:22.020
they're also trying to adopt
and reform, and transform,

01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:26.490
the social constructs
that define productivity.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:28.650
- Okay, I think that's very important.

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:32.940
- [Man] So by breaking down
these types of studies,

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:37.500
we're actually able to see
how these social constructs

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.500
perpetuate inequality,
perpetuate on productivity,

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.310
and so for one perspective I'm going to

01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:49.980
be building off of the work
that you've just laid out

01:22:50.962 --> 01:22:54.680
in work that I'm doing in
the Middle East in Dubai,

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.760
and really looking at how we can use this

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.930
as examples to look at other groups

01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:01.400
that aren't participating,

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.810
specifically people with disabilities.

01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:06.540
I myself have a severe disability,

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.480
but have benefited from
policies and opportunities

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.390
to change that construct.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:16.250
So I wanted to commend you
for helping us think about

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:20.170
how clearly the way we behave,

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.210
and the way we treat each other,

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:27.030
and the way the policies kind
of define our social roles,

01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:30.670
could actually unlock
tremendous potential.

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.440
And only by doing the type of research

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.410
that you are sharing today,

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:37.120
can we really unlock those keys.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.170
Thank you very much.

01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:39.678
- Thank you, that's really important.

01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:40.511
(applause)

01:23:40.511 --> 01:23:42.160
It's very important research,
it's very important research.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.670
And I really do wanna
emphasize that I think

01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:46.420
a lot of the findings,

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.550
so this was a talk focused on gender.

01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:52.060
But diversity is really the issue.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.530
And a lot of the studies are looking at

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.790
diversity broadly measured.

01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:59.380
And there's a fascinating study

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:03.050
that actually will be coming
out as a case at Haas,

01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:06.830
based on a very large company sample,

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:09.590
and the very large company
sample is demonstrating

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:13.410
the diversity of the team,
these are team engagements,

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:16.210
really does affect both the profitability

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:18.530
of the engagement, and also
the quality of the engagement.

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:22.450
So better decisions,
more profitable outcomes.

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:24.160
Diversity really does matter.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.460
And our social, so understanding
the cultural norms,

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:33.460
because, the reason I like
that table at the end so much

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:36.840
is because we need to be aware

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.120
of the social constructs
we're carrying around.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.900
And we need to therefore,
once we know them,

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.420
we can maybe mentor a
woman to be a little more,

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.880
take a little more risk,

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:53.210
or we can encourage a CEO, no, no,

01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:56.350
you actually do have to have a process

01:24:56.350 --> 01:25:00.050
whereby you're transparent
in how you evaluate people,

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:02.580
you can't have this sort of difference

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.250
in negotiating style
affecting what you think

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:07.820
are meritocratic outcomes,

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.610
but they're not meritocratic outcomes,

01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:10.880
they're something else.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.920
So I think this is very important.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.920
And I do think, so very
large global companies

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:25.711
are playing a very interesting role here,

01:25:25.711 --> 01:25:30.530
because their markets
are all over the place,

01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:32.660
and they're hiring talent
all over the place,

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.330
and they're selling all over the place,

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:37.210
so in many contexts,
all of those countries

01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:39.800
that I mentioned that
are in the task force,

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.240
that is being driven by
their global companies,

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.400
or by global companies who are
operating in their countries.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.630
Because they can see the business case

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.821
for themselves so clearly,

01:25:52.821 --> 01:25:57.700
so in a way, once you can see
the case, or feel the case,

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.490
you can become a real leader here.

01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:00.480
But great research.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.360
I look forward to it.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.321
Okay.

01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:04.410
- Thank you, so to conclude,

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.770
it's my pleasure to
invite Esther and Harvey

01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:10.610
up to the stage to personally thank Laura

01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:12.950
for such an inspiring lecture.

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:13.869
- Well thank you.

01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:16.119
(applause)

01:26:22.396 --> 01:26:23.360
Ah, thank you guys.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.766
It's so much fun to be with my students.

01:26:25.766 --> 01:26:27.100
(laughs)

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.320
it's really lovely.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.153
- We have this for you.

01:26:29.153 --> 01:26:31.330
- Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:32.863
Great, wonderful.

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:37.130
All right, okay, thank you.

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:38.092
Where are they?

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.178
(applause)

01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:41.511
Thank you so much, you guys.

01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:45.351
It's so nice of you to do
this for the university.

01:26:45.351 --> 01:26:46.376
(applause)

01:26:46.376 --> 01:26:49.459
(light upbeat music)
