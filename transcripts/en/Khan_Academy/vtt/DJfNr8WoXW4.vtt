00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.338
- All of the examples
of cell-cell signaling

00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:04.478
that we've looked at
so far have been cells

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:06.118
within an organism, but what I want

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.238
to do in this video is
point out that you can

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.078
also have cell-cell signaling

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.638
between different organisms,

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:15.818
and even between different
unicellular organisms.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.118
And so what we have
here, these are pictures

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.478
of yeast cells.

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.548
Yeast are unicellular eukaryotic

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:25.218
organisms which means they have

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:28.848
a nucleus and they are officially fungi,

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:31.118
and what you see happening in this picture

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:33.338
right over here, it looks like you have

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:36.648
a second yeast cell budding
off of the first one.

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:38.968
This happens fundamentally
through mitosis,

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:41.658
but yeast can actually
reproduce in two different ways.

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:44.598
It can reproduce asexually
through mitosis like this,

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:47.098
but it can also reproduce
sexually, and that's

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:48.818
where we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:48.818 --> 00:00:51.458
about signaling between
the cells, and they do

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:53.198
this with mating factors, and this is just

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.298
an interesting discussion
of yeast generally.

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:58.238
So if you start with a yeast cell,

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:00.588
so this is a yeast cell right over here,

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:03.438
and this is a diploid yeast cell,

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.348
so it has its full complement

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:07.908
of chromosomes.

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:11.838
So it's going to have 16 pairs,

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.008
16 pairs of chromosomes,

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.928
or 32 total chromosomes.

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:18.469
That's a diploid.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.728
So through mitosis it could split apart

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:22.298
and it would do so like this.

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:26.078
The one that buds off for most species

00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:28.098
of yeast will be smaller,
although they're some

00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:30.608
that kind of do more even mitosis.

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:34.858
But through mitosis you could produce

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:38.558
two diploid yeast cells

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:39.558
just like this.

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:42.318
So all of these characters right over

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.838
here are a diploid.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.188
And actually, just to stress,

00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:48.688
that they are eukaryotes.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:51.228
Let me draw a little nuclear membrane

00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:52.418
in here.

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:54.638
But it can also divide

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:56.568
through meiosis,

00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:59.118
so this is mitosis right over here,

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.868
mitosis right over here help produce

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:03.478
these two, but you can also go through

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:05.558
meiosis.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.448
Meiosis,

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:09.488
and if we go through meiosis we're going

00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:12.458
to produce four cells
and what's interesting

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:15.198
about these is that these will come in one

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.688
of two varieties, and you could view these

00:02:17.688 --> 00:02:20.878
as the sex of these yeast cells.

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:22.368
So they could either be

00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:25.328
in the type a variety,

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:28.358
so let's make these two type a.

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.948
So that's a type a, that's
a type a right there,

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.648
or they could be in
the type alpha variety.

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:38.398
So this is a , I'm using

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.438
a different color.

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:41.898
So this is

00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:45.018
a type alpha,

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.618
and this is another type alpha,

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:47.838
and all four of these are going

00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:50.058
to come through meiosis

00:02:50.058 --> 00:02:52.738
from this original diploid cell.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.078
And since we went through meiosis,

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.528
each of these are going to be haploid.

00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:58.238
So these are all going to be haploids.

00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:01.698
This is going to be 16 chromosomes total,

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:05.358
16 chromosomes, chromosomes,

00:03:05.358 --> 00:03:06.568
each of them.

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:07.748
So they're all going

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:10.598
to be haploid

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:12.448
and in fact, each of these can,

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.538
to some degree, live a life of their own

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:17.078
and continue to reproduce through mitosis.

00:03:17.078 --> 00:03:18.498
That's worth pointing out,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.818
that's interesting.

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:21.498
You normally wouldn't associate sex cells,

00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:24.278
if it was anything but
humans you wouldn't think

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:25.818
that sperm cells would
be able to replicate

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.408
on their own, or egg cells would be able

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:28.918
to replicate on their own but in the case

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:30.278
of yeast, they actually can.

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:33.118
So this type a cell could turn into,

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:34.838
through mitosis, it could turn into

00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:37.608
two type a cells.

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:41.298
So this is all just interesting
background, mitosis.

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:42.768
So even the products of meiosis can

00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:44.538
then mitose themselves.

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:46.788
That's all interesting,
this is all the set up

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:49.318
to think about how they actually signal

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:51.848
because these, these haploid cells

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:53.918
that are producers of
byproduct of meiosis,

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:55.298
these are, these right over here,

00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:57.508
they all came from the original ancestor,

00:03:57.508 --> 00:03:59.528
which is actually fairly
typical when we're talking

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:01.968
about reproducing and
kind of pseudo-sexually

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:03.908
reproducing yeast cells.

00:04:03.908 --> 00:04:06.698
They don't have to, maybe
one of the type alphas

00:04:06.698 --> 00:04:09.818
came from another ancestor,
but what happens is

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:12.378
they each release what's
called mating factors,

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:14.788
or you can consider them
to be mating pheromones.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.138
So this type a right over here, it's going

00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:20.028
to produce, it's going to produce

00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:22.448
the type a mating factors and it's going

00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:25.198
to release them into the space around it.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.368
So it's releasing those type a

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.848
mating factors and then

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:31.538
the alphas are going to
release the type alpha

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.108
mating factors.

00:04:33.108 --> 00:04:35.928
So I'll do that in this
orange-ish brown color.

00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:38.578
So they're going to release the type alpha

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:39.818
mating factors.

00:04:39.818 --> 00:04:42.448
And what happens is
each type has receptors

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.568
for the other type's factors.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:48.978
So the type a is going

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:50.568
to have receptors

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:52.658
for the type alpha,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.098
for the type alpha.

00:04:54.098 --> 00:04:56.728
It's going to be in all over the outside

00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:58.118
of the cell, and the type alpha's going

00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.688
to have type receptors for the type a.

00:05:00.688 --> 00:05:03.198
Receptors, I'm going to do that in orange.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:05.928
It's going to have
receptors for the type a.

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:07.958
Let me just draw it like
that, that's not exactly

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.538
what they look like, or
actually nowhere close

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:11.378
to what they look like
but it gives you a sense

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:12.828
of things.

00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:14.888
It gives you a sense of things.

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:17.738
And as through these
receptors it starts bonding

00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:20.588
a lot of, say we're on the
alpha cell right over here,

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.708
it starts bonding to a lot
of these mating pheromones,

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.578
these mating factors.

00:05:25.578 --> 00:05:28.168
Then the yeast cell
itself, it doesn't move

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:30.308
but it starts growing in that direction,

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:31.898
it starts growing in the direction where

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.668
it says, "Hey, I'm sensing a
lot of this mating factor."

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.118
So it starts growing in this direction,

00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:38.998
it starts doing something like that.

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:40.268
And the corresponding thing is going

00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:42.348
to happen for the type a cell.

00:05:42.348 --> 00:05:45.578
It's going to have the
alpha factors attached

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:48.068
onto it, and because
of that it says, "Okay,

00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:51.088
"I'm sensing once again, the factors."

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:53.318
The ligand, it attaches to the receptor,

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:54.438
that's the sensing part.

00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.418
Then you have signal
transduction and it's actually,

00:05:57.418 --> 00:05:59.198
it's not too dissimilar

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:01.058
from the MAPK,

00:06:01.058 --> 00:06:04.788
the MAPK transduction pathway

00:06:04.788 --> 00:06:06.658
that we talk about in other videos.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.178
And then the response the cell has is,

00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:11.128
once again, to start
growing in the direction

00:06:11.128 --> 00:06:13.648
of where it seems that
these mating factors

00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:14.988
are coming from.

00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:17.858
And these kind of
elongation, these outgrowths

00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:20.578
of these haploid yeast
cells, they're actually

00:06:20.578 --> 00:06:22.818
called shmoos.

00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:25.258
So that right there, that is a shmoo.

00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:27.738
And you might say, where
did that come from?

00:06:27.738 --> 00:06:30.248
Well, it came from this
character right over here,

00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:33.058
which was a cartoon
character in the middle

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:35.918
20th century, and I'll, you know...

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:41.968
well, let's avoid any
snickering over the course

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.048
of this video, but that's
what it looks like.

00:06:44.048 --> 00:06:46.028
And as they grow to each other,

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:49.138
that actually allows them to join together

00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:51.488
and form another diploid,

00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:53.478
another diploid yeast cell.

00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:56.358
So if this process were to continue,

00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:58.268
if this process were to continue,

00:06:58.268 --> 00:07:01.378
these two shmoos will join together

00:07:01.378 --> 00:07:05.318
and the genetic makeup joins together

00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:07.948
and so we could get another diploid cell.

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:10.588
And now this diploid cell is going to have

00:07:10.588 --> 00:07:14.178
kind of a new combination

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:16.648
of DNA, so it could benefit from some

00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:17.818
of the variation

00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:20.738
of sexual reproduction.

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:21.838
This is diploid.

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:23.238
Although for yeast cells,

00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:26.218
they've like studied it
because it's not clear

00:07:26.218 --> 00:07:27.518
that these are necessarily coming from

00:07:27.518 --> 00:07:29.138
a separate gene pool.

00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:30.648
These actually could have the same

00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:32.298
ancestor molecule so it is a bit

00:07:32.298 --> 00:07:34.058
of an open question in biology

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:36.228
of why do they have this type of sexual

00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:38.018
reproduction, especially when they're

00:07:38.018 --> 00:07:40.318
coming from when these are essentially

00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:42.818
sibling cells as a byproduct of meiosis.

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:44.498
But anyway, the whole point of this

00:07:44.498 --> 00:07:48.298
is one, to appreciate
these fascinating things

00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:49.738
that are happening even at the level

00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:52.218
of yeast cells, and that you do have

00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:53.918
cell-cell signaling, not just within

00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:56.498
an organism, but across organisms,

00:07:56.498 --> 00:08:00.018
especially, or even unicellular organisms.
