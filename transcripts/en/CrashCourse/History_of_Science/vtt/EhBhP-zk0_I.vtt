00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.900
We started this show by asking, what is history
of science the history of?

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.790
And we answered that question in short with
knowledge-making.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.280
We then went on to explore a lot of kinds
of knowledge-making at different places and

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.660
times, from Ancient Greece and Mesoamerica
and India, to medieval China and Europe, to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.970
outer space during the Cold War, and corporate
R&amp;D labs today.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.050
But remember that everyone makes knowledge
about their worlds all the time.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.760
It’s what humans do.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.000
Dogs eat shoes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.940
Cats turn their butts at you.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.690
And humans ask questions about patterns that
they see in the world around them, in their

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.120
societies, and in their own heads.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.400
Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to tell
all of the greatest stories of the history

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.550
of knowledge-making…

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.969
Because we have limited time.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.219
And, more importantly, because there is no
one list of the greatest stories.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.940
Let’s get meta: this is the future… of
the history… of science.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.500
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399
Doing history involves making choices about

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.020
which events could be seen as “history,”
how to tell the stories of the people and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.939
nonhumans involved in these events, and from
whose perspective to speak.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.080
Perhaps at first, this might seem simple:
aim for something called objectivity, or a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.310
neutrality toward opinions.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.659
Stick to the facts.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.990
Even though we’d love to adopt a purely
objective stance, we can’t!

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.770
We can’t speak every language; we don’t
know every fact; and neither does our audience.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.951
We can do our best to stick to the facts,
but choosing which facts to highlight in a

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.270
short show gives away something about us.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.060
Oh, hey there, Allison!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
Hey, Wythe!

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.249
Allison is the consultant, and Wythe is the
writer.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.869
They did most of the fact-picking on our show.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.700
So how did our team choose which stories within
a given chunk of history to highlight?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.930
Well, for one thing, we read a lot, and we
asked our colleagues.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.209
For another, we focused on stories that were
fun to read aloud and to bring to life visually.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.989
We threw in some stories you may have heard
before, like the absolute amazing-ness of

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.930
Marie Skłodowska Curie.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.260
And we did throw in a few stories that we
were pretty sure that many of you hadn’t

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.180
heard, like the Miltini.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.650
But we also threw in stories to challenge
a simplified heroic version of the history

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.150
of science: we talked about science and empire,
science and race, science and war, science

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.870
and corporate greed, and science and planetary
devastation.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.129
Science, it turns out, isn’t all about lone
hero–knowledge-makers, but about complex

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.040
systems of understanding and controlling the
world—systems that aren’t always moral

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.099
or just, by present standards.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.269
We’ve also specifically highlighted women
in science throughout this show, and that’s

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.209
not only because—as you really should know
by now—there are so many rad women in science!

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.799
It’s also because, historically, they’ve
been under-represented, ignored, or ridiculed.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.900
Remember Jim Watson calling pioneering crystallographer
Rosalind Franklin “Wilkins’s assistant?”

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.650
And we still left out so many—and we know
it!

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.319
We’ve had to cut whole fields of science.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.170
And we haven’t always been able to provide
modern updates regarding sciences that we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.959
mentioned in earlier centuries.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.450
So, before we call this little experiment
of ours finished, let’s give a last shout-out

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.530
to a few folks we haven’t mentioned who
have been making it into history of science

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.599
narratives more often recently.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.590
For starters, we could have covered more chemists,
post-phlogiston theory.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.230
Like crystallographer Ada Yonath, who won
the Nobel in chemistry for the structure of

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.150
the vital cellular machine called the ribosome.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.360
Or Stephanie Kwolek, who invented the first
synthetic extra-strong synthetic fiber, Kevlar.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.780
And we could have talked more about the earth
sciences after the acceptance of fossils.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.989
Geographer Marie Tharp’s maps of the ocean
floor led to the acceptance of the theory

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.129
of plate tectonics—which is a crazy story
that we feel terrible about having to cut!

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.629
We talked a good bit about biologists—but
there are so many more!

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.529
Molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, for
example, won the Nobel for her work on telomeres—the

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:16.060
end bits of chromosomes, that protect the
rest of the DNA.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.220
Telomeres are seen as vitally important to
the study of why humans age—and how we might

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.220
live longer.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.120
There was even an X-Files episode based on
her work!

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.650
That’s how you know you’ve made it in
science.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.139
Of course, there has been a development or
two in astronomy since we figured out the

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.650
heliocentric nature of our solar system.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.490
Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell co-discovered
the first radio pulsars in 1967, and was the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.310
first person to observe them… but was excluded
from the Nobel.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.580
And we’ve read the comments and know there
is a strong interest in the history of mathematics,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.840
so how about acknowledging the contributions
of African-American mathematician Katherine

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.130
Johnson, who calculated critical orbital mechanics
for NASA that were used for the first manned

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.250
space flights.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.280
Being female was only half the discrimination
she faced—and the lesser half at that.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.610
Or Karen Sparck Jones, who pioneered the intersection
of computer science, statistics, and linguistics,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.310
teaching computers how to understand human
language and providing the basis for search

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.310
engines.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.030
And we can’t leave out non-binary or trans
scientists, such as trans evolutionary biologist

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.440
Joan Roughgarden.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.121
She published revolutionary work challenging
long-held ideas about sexual selection, one

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:25.900
of the mechanisms of evolution, and forwarding
a new idea of social selection that better

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.310
explains many animal behaviors.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.680
All of these people could have had whole episodes
devoted to their work!

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.819
But until recently, historians have generally
been pretty bad about representing women and

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.229
many other people who happen to not be white
men as awesome at science.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.150
And representation matters, a lot: if “scientist”
always seems to mean “white dude” in a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.000
given culture, then you probably won’t see
as many women of color going on to become

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.060
astronauts, heart surgeons, or billionaire
app developers.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.270
So, in a way, hero narratives can serve an
important purpose.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.750
They help us meet new kinds of heroes, allowing
more people to see themselves as knowledge-heroes-in-the-making.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.759
But we need to be careful to recognize the
many people involved in creating knowledge.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.949
And the flip side of telling clear, heroic
stories—however inclusive—is that the

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.470
history of science isn’t perfect: because
all sciences are dynamic tools, not perfect,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.979
unchanging wisdoms.

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.389
And because scientists and historians are
people.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:27.389
Remember Newton?

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.389
His model of the world wasn’t quite right
beyond a certain scale.

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.729
The anomalies just kept piling up.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.940
And then physics changed.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.450
That is, how to do science has changed.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.070
And Enlightenment natural philosophers repressed
Newton’s alchemical work until historians

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.700
in the twentieth century made it public again.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.100
That is, how to do history has changed.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.699
So while the history of science as a professional
discipline began as a list of Great Dead White

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.129
Dudes, it’s changed a lot over time.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:01.909
Today, we talk a lot more about knowledge
systems outside of the tradition of science-that-is-called-science.

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.630
Which—remember how the word is only two
hundred years old, anyway!?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.449
And, yes, some people think of history as
one of the humanities, or studies of human

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.200
cultures that are qualitative and non-predictive.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.539
.
But in some universities, history is a social

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:16.539
science.

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:23.389
However imperfectly, historians seek to amass
data about a particular kind of human behavior—knowledge-making—and

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.780
then generate theories that explain it.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.360
Another way of thinking about doing science
and doing its history, as a job, comes from

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.639
feminist sociologist Sandra Harding.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.439
In her work, knowledge is situated.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:40.810
Anyone who makes knowledge has a standpoint—as
does the person writing history about that

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.810
person.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.360
And this standpoint isn’t some subjective,
personal opinion, it’s a way of understanding

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360
reality.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.919
So the selecting of facts that we’ve done
throughout this show is not just about what

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.380
stories we think are fun.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.919
It’s a standpoint that says: “hey, as
far as we know, after lots of time doing Ph.D.s

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:03.610
and researching these topics, this is the
history of science”—even though Allison

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.569
would comment on just about every script that
the stories always much more nuanced and complex!

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.430
And there are so many stories in this history!

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.219
We just couldn’t get to them all.

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:18.430
We’ve been keeping a running list of everything
that hit the cutting room floor.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.270
For example, how about birth control technologies?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:27.620
The Pill came from synthesizing a hormone
out of a raw material—a yam that grows in

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
Mexico, Dioscorea composita, known locally
as barbasco.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.000
The person who invented the Pill was a white
guy.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.020
But the people who could find the yams and
work with them were Mexicans.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.020
They weren’t “scientists” according
to the standards of the day.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.970
But in 2009, historian of science Gabriela
Soto Laveaga published a whole book detailing

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:49.590
how these yam hunters created “Jungle Laboratories”
that allowed for knowledge about plants to

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.240
be turned into lucrative and socially transformative
pills.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.260
Or take biology in the twentieth century.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.960
We just gave you the highlights.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.810
There was so much more going on!

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.590
For example, did the characterization of DNA
by Franklin and the whole gang in 1953 reveal

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.820
the capital-T Truth about how organisms pass
on characteristics from one generation to

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.820
the next?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.820
Sort of?

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.760
It did create useful facts and help spawn
biotechnology as an industry.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.540
But it didn’t answer a lot of other questions—like
ones about epigenetics.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.540
And we’ve since learned that some of the
early ideas about DNA are just plain inaccurate.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:29.160
That process of asking questions again and
again, and revising them in the face of failures,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.850
mounting anomalies, and outside influences—is
the story of science.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:40.560
And the history of science is a similar dynamic
assemblage that we have to revisit periodically.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.690
So there you have it!

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.480
Science is awesome, and its history is so
fascinating that we could keep doing this

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.880
show forever.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.030
From everyone here at History of Science,
thank you so, so much for watching.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:57.540
As Marie Curie said: “Nothing in life is
to be feared, it is only to be understood.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.200
Now is the time to understand more, so that
we may fear less.”

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.230
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.120
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
Thought Cafe.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.820
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.480
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.290
channels like Nature League, Sexplanations, and Scishow.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.440
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.680
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680
love.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.420
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued support.
