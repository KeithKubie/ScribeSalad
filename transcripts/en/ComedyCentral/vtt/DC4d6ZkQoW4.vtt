00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.370
First up-- Why, robot.
Why, robot.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.172
Hong Kong designer Ricky Ma
spent nearly two years

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:10.677
and $50,000 to create a robot
Scarlett Johansson.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.280
-Oh!
-Oh! Robo ScarJo. -(laughter)

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.550
He carefully crafted it to have
the same physical appearance

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.552
as one of his favorite
Hollywood actress,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.153
but unlike the real
Hollywood actress,

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.656
this one does not know how
to file a restraining order yet.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.625
(laughter, groaning)

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.828
Let's see Robo ScarJo in action.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.999
I think robotics is
a new manufacturing.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.767
(laughter)

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.069
Ma insists he won't use it
for anything tawdry.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.238
Uh, which I guess is why
he designed it

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.208
to look like it's trying
to chew a dick off there.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.677
(laughter)

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.713
(Hardwick imitates
robotic chatter)

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.815
(laughter)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.188
Comedians, what do you think
this toothy robot

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.590
is trying to say here?
Maria.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.458
Oh, sorry. I... (laughing)

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.060
Uh, uh...

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.096
(robotically): I want to chew
through your toaster cord

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.798
and watch your house burn.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.068
HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.
That's gonna be her revenge

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.970
when she becomes self-aware.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.738
Uh, Chelsey.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:13.473
(in robotic voice):
I only make 75%

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.676
of what Robert Downey Jr. makes.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.680
-(laughter, cheers and applause)
-HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.150
Randall.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.886
(in robotic voice): Thank you,
Ricky Ma, for proving once again

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.821
Asians can do everything!

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.157
(cheers and applause)

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.430
-HARDWICK: They can.
-That's right. That's right.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.233
Asians can make everything
(bleep)able.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.968
(laughter, cheers and applause)

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.870
That's if you...

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:46.006
-That, too.
-That as well, that as well.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.810
I only hope
the real Scarlett Johansson

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:49.910
doesn't become self-aware.
