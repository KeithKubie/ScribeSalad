00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.090
The vast majority of the human genome is

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.390
actually made up of non coding sequences. In fact,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.700
less than 2% of our genetic code is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.040
actually information that codes for proteins. Now for some

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.420
people this could actually be rather shocking, and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.650
a lot or research in the scientific community has

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.650
gone into figuring out what that other 98% does.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.600
A recent report by the Encode project or the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.750
encyclopedia of DNA elements have revealed that up

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.850
to 80% of our human Genome is involved in

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.330
some sort of roller activity through binding the proteins

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.740
and regulating gene expressing even the production of other

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.410
types of RNA that aren't ultimately turned into protein.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.560
This means that the vast majority of our genomic

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.760
information doesn't actually code for the physical stuff that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690
makes up who we are, but instead regulates the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.150
expression of the coding parts, so that they're

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.020
turned on at the right time and the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.660
right place. After all, that's what's most important

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.010
in the recipe after we define our ingredients.
