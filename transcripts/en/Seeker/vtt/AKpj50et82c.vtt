00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.839
Human caused Global Warming is basically an
accepted fact in most parts of said globe.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.740
147 countries have signed and ratified the
Paris Agreement, meaning they’re taking

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.790
steps to keep the climate from warming more
than 2 degrees celsius from pre-industrial

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
levels.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.689
But one of the biggest polluters has just
announced they’re backing out of the agreement.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.609
Can you guess who that is?

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:20.609
That’s right.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.609
It’s us.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.300
Or the U.S., if you’re not us.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.009
And while that will be catastrophic for the
world because of the whole sea level rise

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.870
and droughts and hurricanes thing, it could
also be a serious blunder for the U.S. economically.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.160
Saving the planet means changing how we produce
and use energy.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.640
Two favorite alternative sources are solar
and wind.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.330
If the whole world is going to want these
renewables, then whoever can make the best,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.830
cheapest, most efficient solar panels or wind
turbines will win.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.990
It’s a wind-win, if you will.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.590
And that brings us back to the United States,
and our will-they-or-won’t they relationship

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.440
with accepting climate change.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.440
While other nations invest tens and even hundreds
of billions in renewables, we could be stuck

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.960
offering a product that nobody wants anymore.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.640
Eventually if we do come around, we’ll likely
have to rely on importing technology that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.330
was developed elsewhere.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.540
Considering an American invented the solar
cell in 1941, that’s a heck of a lead to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
blow.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.250
So, if we’re not taking the lead on this,
who is?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
China.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.920
China has plenty of coal to meet their needs,
so you might think they, like coal and natural

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.340
gas loving America, would be inclined to keep
on burning.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.450
But Chinese cities are famously polluted,
and it’s hard to ignore when cities of 10s

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.810
of millions of people ask if they can just
breathe a little bit better, please?

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.590
China has answered in a big way.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.120
They started with a 5 year plan to raise wind
output nearly 63 percent and more than double

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.880
solar production by 2020.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.950
They’re also constructing 20 new nuclear
power plants with more planned, using and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980
improving on technology from the west.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.330
According to one report, they could spend
as much as $782 Billion dollars to meet their

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.869
emission targets by 2030.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780
Why isn’t the US following suit?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.659
In a word, politics.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.760
Somehow climate science has become a partisan
issue over here, and conservatives tend to

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.510
write it off as a liberal cause.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.740
Many conservatives see solutions to global
warming as something that could hurt the economy.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
Basically, environmental restrictions can
get in the way of businesses doing business.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.610
However, there are some on the right that
see an economic opportunity with solving some

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.900
issues surrounding man-made global warming.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.790
Debbie Dooley, a founder of the far right
Tea Party, is a big advocate for solar power

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.920
and has gotten bans on solar lifted in Georgia
because she believes consumers should have

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
a choice.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.840
James Cason, the republican mayor of Coral
Gables, Florida believes people everywhere

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.470
should worry about sea level rise because
of how much of our economy is dependent on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.890
goods coming in and out of ports.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.310
Even if you don’t believe in climate change,
investing in renewable energy is the smart

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.310
thing to do.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.340
It’s what the rest of the world is demanding,
and the first rule of sales is to give the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.130
people what they want.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.280
Investing in solar and wind could not only
save the world as we know it, but we could

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.740
make a buck while we’re at it.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.730
What’s more American than that?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.270
Environmentalism may be a partisan issue now,
but it didn’t use to be this way.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.150
Matt Morales follows how we got to this point
in his video here.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.430
Even if you’re a climate skeptic, do you
still think it’s worth investing in green

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.430
technology?

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.519
