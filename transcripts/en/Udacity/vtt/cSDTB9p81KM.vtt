00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.570
Congratulations on getting
through all the lessons.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.150
Along the way,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.918
I hope you've thought about what it
would take to build your own mobile app.

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:11.650
And maybe you've had some good ideas for
a really big project,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.620
something that you think would be
successful, or fun to build, or

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.180
a project to scratch your own itch.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.820
Now if you've enrolled in the full
course experience, then you have access

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.740
to project evaluations and
code review by our Udacity coaches.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.930
They want to help you build
a great mobile web app.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.590
Now in the instructor comments
below this video, you'll

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.180
see a link to the rubric that they'll
be using to evaluate your project.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.870
You should take a look at it so
you know what they'll be looking for.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.725
You'll also find a link
to an example app.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.130
We've provided this in case you're
not sure what app you want to build.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.770
If so, then just try building your
own version of that example app.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.430
If you're still unclear,
then talk to your coach.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.190
They're here to help you succeed
in this course and in your career.
