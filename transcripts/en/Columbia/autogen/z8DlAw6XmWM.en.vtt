it wouldn't help
at that stage because you have to go

00:08:56.999 --> 00:08:57.009
at that stage because you have to go
 

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:00.960
at that stage because you have to go
back up and Pete pick up the pieces you

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:00.970
back up and Pete pick up the pieces you
 

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.030
back up and Pete pick up the pieces you
have to have the cable goes and paste

certain kinds of contact so we are

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839
certain kinds of contact so we are
 

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:08.939
certain kinds of contact so we are

learning about that
 

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.309
learning about that
we're already how to get kids so that

you don't know what that is but I know
that's really important the response

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:06.910
that's really important the response
 

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.060
that's really important the response
units changed so if you don't have that

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:09.070
units changed so if you don't have that
 

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.090
units changed so if you don't have that
kind of measurement its problem you've

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.100
kind of measurement its problem you've

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:19.299
they're trying to learn how to read and
 

00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:24.899
they're trying to learn how to read and
they can't do it right so if you can

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:24.909
they can't do it right so if you can
 

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:27.090
they can't do it right so if you can
teach them if you know the right tactic

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.100
teach them if you know the right tactic
 

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:32.220

that develop little capabilities to do
that either because of native

disabilities or because of economic
 

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:43.470
disabilities or because of economic
disenfranchisement now the reason we

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480
disenfranchisement now the reason we
 

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.169
disenfranchisement now the reason we
found this is because we found lots of

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:46.179
found this is because we found lots of
 

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:48.659
found this is because we found lots of
kids with disabilities and we've learned

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:48.669
kids with disabilities and we've learned
 

00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:50.519
kids with disabilities and we've learned
how to get them to get those

00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:50.529
how to get them to get those
 

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:54.090
how to get them to get those
capabilities and then we found lovely

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.100
capabilities and then we found lovely
 

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.549
capabilities and then we found lovely
how that was a problem with the kids

00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559
how that was a problem with the kids
 

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.409
how that was a problem with the kids

language and then have the experiences

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760
language and then have the experiences
 

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.730
language and then have the experiences
that allow them to build on that and

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:05.740
that allow them to build on that and
 

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.859
that allow them to build on that and
once we did that we could make progress

00:34:09.859 --> 00:34:09.869
once we did that we could make progress
 

00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:12.359
