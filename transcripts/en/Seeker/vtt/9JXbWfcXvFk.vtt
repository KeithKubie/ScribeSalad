00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.360
Have you heard of the Millennium Falcon?...
you know, the ship that made the Kessel Run

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.870
in less than twelve parsecs!

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.180
Nevermind the mistaken parlance -- how fast
IS that old bucket of bolts?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.470
Happy May the 4th padawans!

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.870
Today, on Star Wars appreciation day, we thought
we’d pull some of the magic out of the fabric

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.870
of space time.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
See, every nerf herder in the ‘verse knows
that Han Solo’s ship is fast, but even in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
a galaxy far, far away the laws of physics
should still apply.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.390
So based on our physics, could the Falcon
actually do this?

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.890
Firstly, let me just say clearly… nah.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.890
Laugh.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.890
Nah.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.479
The special theory of relativity has shown
the faster we travel: ONE the slower time

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.260
moves for us, and TWO the more mass we gain.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.859
So a ship travelling at, quote, “Point five
past light speed” (whatever that means)

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.999
would have ridiculous mass and require humongous
energies to accelerate and decelerate.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:57.899
Plus, even at 1.5 times the speed of light
-- planets and stars are really far apart.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.269
Even if point-five is 1.5 times the speed
of light it would still take five and a half

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.850
minutes to go from the sun to earth -- and
even at its closest -- 2 hours and 45 minutes

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.850
to get to Pluto!

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.570
And let’s say you could actually travel
the speed of light, even for a minute.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.630
It wouldn’t look all blue and streaky either.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.409
A study from 2013 did the math, and in reality
you’d see this:

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.990
Basically, the Doppler effect comes into play.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
Doppler shift means as you go faster, waves
of energy appear to shorten.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.899
So the screech of a Tie Fighter or ambulance
is higher as it approaches you than after

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.439
it passes you.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.490
This blue shift would turn visible light into
the x-ray range, and the Cosmic Microwave

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.719
Background Radiation -- super dim leftover
light from the Big Bang that permeates the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.020
universe would be accelerated to the point
of being visible.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.020
Amazing!

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.700
But... impossible, based on our physics.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.280
You’ve probably heard of wormholes -- used
in Contact, Interstellar, and my fav fav fav

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.130
Stargate SG-1.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.259
Wormholes ARE an option according to physicists,
mathematically they could exist, but the energy

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.880
required to create and maintain them is astronomical.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.800
Let’s just say, this is Beyond our understanding
right now.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.630
So, to find out what might not be, I reached
out to physicists Dr. Casey Handmer and he

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.740
said, "if you ask an expert ‘Is FTL travel
impossible?’ the answer is only ‘probably.’

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.190
Under the rules we understand, it is cannot
yet be ruled out.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.200
Because time travel is somewhat similar, we
can't yet rule it out either.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.850
There are several strong hints that physics
may permit FTL travel, ranging from the quantum

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.540
physics of the very small and very cold, to
astrophysics and cosmology, which studies

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.880
the universe at the largest scales.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.660
These hints warrant further investigation."

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.470
There is, of course, another option, the hyperdrive
somehow jumps the ship OUT of our dimension

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.820
of spacetime -- meaning we don’t have to
contend with boring old laws of physics.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.940
String theory says that there are higher dimensions
that behave differently, but we’re just

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.310
beginning to understand that, and as Casey
told me, any self-respecting physicist would

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.250
respond to faster-than-light travel with a
big shrug.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.930
All this just shows, that even a long-long
time ago in a galaxy far far away a smuggler

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.560
could have taken our smartest minds to school
on higher physics.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.670
For more about the science in the movies you
love, you should absolutely check out Seeker’s

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.470
new podcast, Bad Science -- it’s fantastic
-- there my buddy Ethan will talk about the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.440
science in movies every week, but with EXPERTS
to bring it into reality.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.650
Some things are possible, some things… eehhh…

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.610
Tune in wherever you get your podcasts, there’s
link in the description.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.550
Science doesn’t ruin everything, take parallel
universes for instance.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.980
Watch this video about where one might have
bumped into ours!

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.570
One last thing, some nerds did the calculations,
and the Falcon might top out at over 1041

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.570
light-years/hour.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.070
Sar Trek’s Warp 8?

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.070
Only zero point six light-years/hour.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.660
Sorry Jean Luc.
