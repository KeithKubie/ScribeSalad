00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.050
- [Instructor] If a sub
n is equal to n squared

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.320
minus 10 over n plus one,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.110
determine a sub four plus a sub nine.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.060
Well, let's just think about
each of these independently.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.920
A sub four, a, let me write it this way.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.910
A,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.770
the fourth term, so a sub four,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.770
so our n, our lowercase
n, is going to be four,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.310
is going to be equal to
everywhere we see an n

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.070
in this explicit definition
for this sequence.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.120
Everywhere we see an n, we
would replace it with a four.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.410
So it's going to be equal to four squared

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.130
minus 10

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.280
over

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.470
four,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.870
over four

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.310
plus one,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.070
over four plus one, which is equal to,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.770
well, let's see, that's 16 minus 10

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.870
over five,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.340
which is equal to six over five.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.650
So that is a sub four.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.540
That is the fourth term.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.260
Now let's think about a sub nine.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.580
So a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.900
sub nine,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.380
so, once again, everywhere
that we see an n,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.860
we would replace it with a nine.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.720
We're looking at when
lowercase n is equal to nine,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.750
or we're looking at the ninth term.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.030
So it's going to be nine squared.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.130
Let me do that blue color just
so we see what we're doing.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.733
Nine squared,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.470
we'll do it in a green color, minus 10

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.410
over nine plus one,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.810
over nine

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.710
plus one

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.040
is equal to, well, in the
numerator, we have 81 minus 10,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.060
81 minus 10

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.730
over 10, over nine plus one.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.710
And so this is going to
be equal to 71 over 10.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.830
Now they want us to sum these two things,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.420
so that's going to be equal to,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.380
it's going to be equal to 6/5.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.870
A sub four is 6/5,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.513
plus a sub nine, which is 71 over 10.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.020
71 over 10.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.347
Well, we can rewrite 6/5
as being equal to 12/10,

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:05.347
12/10 and then 71/10, so plus 71

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.470
over 10, which is equal to,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.890
well, if I have 12/10 and
then I have another 71/10,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.445
now I'm going to have 83/10,

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.940
83/10.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.773
And we're done.
