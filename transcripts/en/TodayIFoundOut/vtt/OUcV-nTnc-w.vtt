00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.890
Why are Dalmatians the Traditional Dog of
Choice at Firestations?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.340
One of the most effective fire-fighting tools
in the middle of the 18th century was the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.400
steam pumper- a machine that consisted of
a boiler which was able to use steam to force

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200
water out of hoses and onto a fire.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.110
The fire brigade’s horse-drawn carriages
would be loaded up with the machine, the horses

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.570
would be hitched up, and the vehicle would
tear off down the road.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
When fire fighters were racing off to fight
the flames, they didn’t have time for the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.570
horses to spook nor to slow down for all the
pedestrians using the road, which is where

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.110
the Dalmatians came in.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.330
Besides being known for forming strong bonds
with horses, in the early 1700s, it was observed

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.540
that Dalmatians were perfectly suited for
travelling long distances.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.370
As stated by the Dalmatian Club of America,
the English felt that Dalmatians had the “strength,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.960
vitality, fortitude and size to keep running
along under the carriage for hundreds of miles.”

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.700
When the travellers rested for the night,
the dogs were also useful for standing guard

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.409
over the horses and the people’s belongings.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
English aristocrats soon picked up on the
practice of having Dalmatians follow their

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.130
carriages and the dogs even became something
of a symbol of social status- the more Dalmatians

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.219
that ran alongside your carriage, the wealthier
you must be.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:29.820
Back to Dalmatians and the horse-drawn fire
carriages- because of the dogs’ strong work

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.299
ethic and stamina, they typically didn’t
have any trouble keeping up with the carriages

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.399
even when they were flying down the roads
at high speeds.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.030
The Dalmatian would scare away anything that
might spook the horses, and also just as importantly

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.319
served as the first “siren.”

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.229
Its bark would alert pedestrians on the road
that the fire brigade was on its way, and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.229
to move off the street.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.229
The horses were also a bit leery of being
so close to burning buildings when it came

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.229
time to stop.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.229
(Can you blame them?)

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.510
While the firemen unloaded their equipment
and rushed off to put the fire out, their

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.749
trusty Dalmatians would stay with the cart,
keeping the horses calm and guarding the firemen’s

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:00.749
belongings.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.759
Not only that, but once they were back at
the fire house, the Dalmatian were often trained

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.159
to sniff out and kill rats and other vermin—kind
of like having a barking cat that was far

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.159
less lazy than a meowing mouse-catcher.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.399
When the much more efficient motorized fire
trucks were created, there were no longer

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.710
horses for Dalmatians to keep company and
no need for them to run ahead of the trucks

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.180
to alert people that the fire brigade was
coming—there were sirens for that now.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.810
Their usefulness spent, Dalmatians might have
vanished from fire stations altogether.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.000
Instead, they turned into fire station mascots,
particularly popular when firefighters go

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.030
around teaching kids about fire safety.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.950
Of course, at this point any dog could be
used, and sometimes that’s the case, but

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.530
given the long standing tradition of using
Dalmatians, it seems likely they will remain

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.060
the dog of choice at many fire stations for
the foreseeable future.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.230
A common myth is that Dalmatians are kept
in fire houses because unlike other breeds,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.370
the loud sound of the siren won’t hurt their
ears.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.850
While it is true that Dalmatians are predisposed
to deafness (only about 70% have normal hearing),

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.320
they were originally around to primarily function
as a siren, as stated, so their hearing wasn’t

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:32.250
really 
a factor.
