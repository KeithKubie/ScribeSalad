00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So now we have an equation in slope intercept form that takes into account

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.631
both that our slope is m and that we have the point s,t on our line. This is

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:11.772
really cool, but I don't think this looks very pretty right now. And you know me

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:15.742
and how I like things in our equations to look pretty. So, let's see if we can

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:19.707
clean it up a little bit. In an effort to make this look a little bit neater,

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:23.737
what happens if we move t from the right hand side of the equation to the left

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:27.903
hand side of the equation? Of course, we need to obey the rules of Algebra. But

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.809
if I said I only wanted the term with t on the left, what equation would we have

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:32.104
now?
