it's working as a punch press on print
and then lastly the growth of the

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:18.980
and then lastly the growth of the
 

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.319
and then lastly the growth of the
shelter industries which is ultimately

00:34:23.319 --> 00:34:23.329
shelter industries which is ultimately
 

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:25.750
shelter industries which is ultimately
seen as a loss of autonomy and this

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760
seen as a loss of autonomy and this
 

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.200
seen as a loss of autonomy and this
becomes the two themes that emerged as

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.210
becomes the two themes that emerged as
 

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.940
becomes the two themes that emerged as
the ones that people are most interested

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:30.950
the ones that people are most interested
 

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.619
the ones that people are most interested
the generative themes that people are

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:32.629
the generative themes that people are
 

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:35.409
the generative themes that people are
most interested in addressing are the

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:35.419
most interested in addressing are the
 

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:37.659
most interested in addressing are the
degradation conditions within the

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:37.669
degradation conditions within the
 

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:40.180
degradation conditions within the
shelter's which is also linked to

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.190
shelter's which is also linked to
 

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.760
shelter's which is also linked to
maintaining their ability to stay out of

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:42.770
maintaining their ability to stay out of
 

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.680
maintaining their ability to stay out of
the shelters because there's kind of two

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:44.690
the shelters because there's kind of two
 

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.530
the shelters because there's kind of two
sides to that same thing and then the

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:47.540
sides to that same thing and then the
 

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.210
sides to that same thing and then the
second one is the exploitation of their

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:52.220
second one is the exploitation of their
 

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.280
second one is the exploitation of their
work in their work working lives okay so

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:56.290
work in their work working lives okay so
 

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.140
work in their work working lives okay so

they didn't dad demand men but they
 

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.380
they didn't dad demand men but they
ultimately had a new agency which at

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:24.390
ultimately had a new agency which at
 

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.000

degrading aspects of living there so

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:28.080
degrading aspects of living there so
 

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.530
degrading aspects of living there so
dealing with those very immediate living

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540
dealing with those very immediate living
 

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.290
dealing with those very immediate living
conditions there was a group called the

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300
conditions there was a group called the
 

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.730
conditions there was a group called the
Northeast Ohio Coalition for the

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740
Northeast Ohio Coalition for the
 

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.680

homeless who argued those weren't the

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:36.690
homeless who argued those weren't the
 

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.830
homeless who argued those weren't the
issues we should spend our time on right

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:39.840
issues we should spend our time on right
 

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.570
issues we should spend our time on right
but for the folks who are living in the

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:41.580
but for the folks who are living in the
 

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.580
but for the folks who are living in the
shelters these were the most important

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:43.590
shelters these were the most important
 

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.380
shelters these were the most important
issues that they should be spending

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:45.390
issues that they should be spending
 

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.140
issues that they should be spending
their time on so I thought that was

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.150
their time on so I thought that was
 

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:53.620
their time on so I thought that was
interesting and I should also say these

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:53.630
interesting and I should also say these
 

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:58.580
interesting and I should also say these
these are what I viewed as ends many of

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:58.590
these are what I viewed as ends many of
 

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.400
these are what I viewed as ends many of
the different ends of this overall oral

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.410
the different ends of this overall oral
 

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.980
the different ends of this overall oral
history project the petition you know

history project the petition you know
 

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.910
history project the petition you know
became an end a product of the oral

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920
became an end a product of the oral
 

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.560

who's pictured here said we need to
 

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.180
who's pictured here said we need to
establish an air war and this is how he

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:35.190
establish an air war and this is how he
 

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.890

referred to a former former Vietnam
 

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.610
referred to a former former Vietnam
veteran and so we set up a radio show

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:40.620
veteran and so we set up a radio show
 

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.320
veteran and so we set up a radio show
that aired on the local college station

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:45.330
that aired on the local college station
 

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.780
that aired on the local college station
and these radio shows each one to some

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:47.790
and these radio shows each one to some
 

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.790
and these radio shows each one to some
extent became a product of the oral

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800
extent became a product of the oral
 

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.040

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.660
history show they brought they each got
tapes they brought them back to the

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:53.670
tapes they brought them back to the
 

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.850

these tapes to other folks people were

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:58.650
these tapes to other folks people were
 

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.320
these tapes to other folks people were
listening to these and what was

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:00.330
listening to these and what was
 

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.650
listening to these and what was
gradually happy happening was this move

movement here of people in the camps is
 

00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:00.429
movement here of people in the camps is
different than the movement of people

and there's tensions right but because I

this that one of the strengths of using

00:42:09.129 --> 00:42:09.139
this that one of the strengths of using

this that one of the strengths of using
oral history process here of the process

00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:12.469
oral history process here of the process
 

00:42:12.469 --> 00:42:15.120
oral history process here of the process
of critical reflection is that in the

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:15.130
of critical reflection is that in the
 

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.099
of critical reflection is that in the
emergence of a what I view is a complex

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:18.109
emergence of a what I view is a complex
 

00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:21.129
emergence of a what I view is a complex
critical analysis is that people can

00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:21.139
critical analysis is that people can

critical analysis is that people can
start seeing while I may be fighting

00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:23.479
start seeing while I may be fighting
 

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:25.809
start seeing while I may be fighting
here that is intertwined with your

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:25.819
here that is intertwined with your
 

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:28.359
here that is intertwined with your
struggle over there right and why we

00:42:28.359 --> 00:42:28.369
struggle over there right and why we
 

00:42:28.369 --> 00:42:30.249
struggle over there right and why we
might be fighting for slightly different

00:42:30.249 --> 00:42:30.259
might be fighting for slightly different
 

00:42:30.259 --> 00:42:32.409
might be fighting for slightly different
things that they're still interconnected

00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:32.419
things that they're still interconnected
 

00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:35.759
things that they're still interconnected
right and so this then becomes a way of

00:42:35.759 --> 00:42:35.769
right and so this then becomes a way of
 

00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:38.499
right and so this then becomes a way of
creating this more complex critical
