00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.470
We live in a world where the idea of love
is fed by a "Happily Ever After".

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.170
Our perception of what should and should not
be is completely skewed by what we have learned

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.690
in media.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.910
The typical pattern of intense passion and
emotions, a conflict that makes us fight for

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.050
that God forsaken love and then the resolution
of being together forever.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.510
We see any romantic or sexual interests outside
of that relationship as immoral and that we

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.820
must constrain ourselves for this one love
for the rest of our lives.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.090
But is there such a thing as your one and
only love?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.350
Is it not possible to love more than one soul?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.510
This question has resulted in cheating, divorce,
resentment, conflicts and a lot of lying.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.289
Is monogamy the only way to be in a loving
relationship?

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.460
More and more people are finding healthy relationships
inside consensual, non-monogamous relationships.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.359
In actuality, the cultures that only accept
monogamous relationships are in the minority

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.449
worldwide.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.950
According to a paper in the journal of evolutionary
biology, 83% of societies allow polygamy.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.130
At Psych2Go, we're bringing you the "8 signs
polyamory may be right for you".

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.680
The first sign is that you have always felt
limited and confined in conventional relationships.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.280
It's not the person you're with that's making
you feel confined, it's the situation.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.689
Have you ever felt like you're no longer acting
as an individual but always thinking about

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.329
being faithful to your partner and you can't
help but think; does this come from a place

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:39.740
of love, freedom and security or does it come
from a place of ownership, jealousy and fear?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.759
Sign number two is that you learn so much
about yourself through others.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.329
Relationships are fun, yes, but they're also
incredible opportunities to learn and explore

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.470
different aspects of yourself.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.290
Each person is a universe and both negative
and positive experiences that we venture in

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.030
with them are a journey to learning and growing
individually as a person.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.270
If you are limited to only one relationship,
there may be aspects of yourself you are neglecting.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.410
Sign number three is that you are the kind
of person who feels energized by other people.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.180
Does diving into experience with people outside
of your primary relationship, nurture, energize

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
and refresh you?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.610
Do you feel energized and refreshed after
you have an innocent yet perhaps a little

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.500
flirtatious coffee with someone from the opposite
sex whilst in a relationship?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
This does not have to imply any physical engagement;
an innocent lunch date is enough.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.200
In a polyamorous relationship, you are free
to flirt, have fun and share your experiences

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.890
with other people in any way you desire.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.310
Sign four is that you like to constantly challenge
yourself in order to grow.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.550
The most common reason for people rejecting
an open relationship is jealousy.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.780
They would rather not deal with the intensity
of jealous feelings they would get with the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.770
very imagination of their partner engaging
with someone else.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.620
But what if polyamory will teach you to be
less jealous and to love with complete freedom,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.060
would this not be like taking an entire weight
off of your shoulders?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.630
This experience, while still being a very
difficult one will teach you to love someone.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.330
Fear, jealousy and possession are not things
that come from a place of love.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.060
Consider it a love boot camp.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.690
Sign number five is that communication and
honesty are very important things for you.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.400
You can't stand lying about anything and let's
be honest, most people feel safer not admitting

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.460
to their partners that they may be interested
in or attracted to someone else.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.890
They may also not feel safe about telling
their partner about certain friendships for

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.630
fear of jealousy.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.500
You are the kind of person who would rather
be open about these difficult topics and feel

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.620
safe in approaching them with your partner.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.200
You think it's best and healthier to tackle
the situation and finding a compromise that

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.730
makes you both happy.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.320
If there is something forbidden to us, we
will only want it more.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.230
If we feel free to be with somebody else,
then the initial excitement of that forbidden

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.850
fruit is gone.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.810
Sign number six is that you don't like living
life by society's rules and tend to question

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.230
everything.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.490
You are not one to follow social constructs
of what should and should not be.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.060
You often find yourself questioning these
in-positions made on us.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.410
Polyamory is instantly rejected by society
and almost seen as a threat to normal relationships

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.150
and normal family life.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.590
However, you prefer to live and experience
for yourself before deciding your opinion

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.380
on something as opposed to following everybody
else like a sheep.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.680
Sign number seven is that you trust your love
and connection with this person more than

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.910
anything.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.320
You don't think that seeing someone else could
possibly take away from your love and devotion

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.780
to your partner.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.440
If anything, it might even strengthen your
appreciation for them.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.900
If the connection you have is authentic, then
it is really hard for that to just go away

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.340
with the introduction of someone new.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.400
Sometimes we just enjoy someone new in our
lives but that does not mean we want them

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.190
to ever replace our partner.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.460
And finally, sign number eight is that you
are aware that we can love more than one person

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.310
and feel attracted to more than one person.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.070
If we learn to accept that one person cannot
fulfill every desire that we have, then we

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.150
will immediately resent our partner less and
appreciate them more.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.480
If we decide to allow ourselves and our partners
to fulfill things we can't through someone

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.030
else, we are making them happy and that my
friend is love.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.450
Thank you for watching this video and hopefully
these signs helped you see if you'd potentially

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.930
be open for a polyamorous relationship or
if you're more happy in a monogamous one.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.450
Let us know if any of these signs relate to
you in the comments and any videos you might

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.720
