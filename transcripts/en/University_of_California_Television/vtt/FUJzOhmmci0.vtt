00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.780
- Miscarriage, also commonly
called spontaneous abortion,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.820
is the loss of a pregnancy
before 20 weeks of gestation.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.920
So around five months.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.580
Miscarriage is more common
than most people realize

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.660
and is influenced
strongly by a woman's age.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.000
Women younger than 30
have a miscarriage rate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.910
of approximately 17%,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.870
and this rate doubles
by the time they are 40.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.010
The further along a
pregnancy has developed,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.130
the less likely a miscarriage is to occur.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.260
There are many different
causes of miscarriage.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.660
About half of miscarriages are
caused by abnormal genetics,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.460
such as the pregnancy having too many

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.590
or too few chromosomes.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.750
Other causes include maternal diseases,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.440
trauma, and infection.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590
But, sadly, the reason
for most miscarriages

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.923
is never diagnosed.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.170
Signs and symptoms of a miscarriage are

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.008
vaginal spotting or
bleeding, uterine cramping,

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.980
passage of clots with or without tissue.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.870
The tissue may look like pieces of liver

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.963
or may be part of a larger blood clot.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.350
If you think you are
experiencing a miscarriage,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.400
it's important to call your provider.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.090
If you have very heavy bleeding,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.700
such as filling a sanitary pad

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.800
in the course of an hour that's sustained

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.000
or if you have severe abdominal pain,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.970
you should go to your
closest emergency room

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.950
for urgent evaluation.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.970
Some ways to help reduce your
risk of a miscarriage are

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.950
avoiding all alcohol, smoking,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.220
and drug use during pregnancy.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.710
Not drinking more than 200
micrograms of caffeine a day.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.560
That's the equivalent of about
one 12 ounce cup of coffee.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.660
Avoiding unpasteurized cheeses

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.380
or unwashed fruits and vegetables

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.250
as this could result
in listeria infection.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.950
Checking with your physician
before taking any medications,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.200
even ones you can buy
without a prescription,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.623
as some may increase the
risk for miscarriage.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.740
Many women who suffer a miscarriage wonder

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.050
if there's anything they
could have done differently.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.811
I reassure my patients that
the vast majority of the time,

00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:03.400
there was nothing that could
have prevented the loss.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.840
After a miscarriage,
many women subsequently

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.820
have a healthy, normal pregnancy.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.237
