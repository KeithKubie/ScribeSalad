00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.590
The project is faculty's
lived experiences

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.500
teaching online
courses, whether that's

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.090
a more traditional extension
school, credit-bearing course,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.360
or a Massive Open
Online Course and what

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.420
they learn from
the experience, how

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
it applies to their residential
teaching and their research.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.810
We've both worked with faculty
for going on five years

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.160
now at HarvardX.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.420
And there's a really
great developed parts

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.145
of the organization
and across university

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.160
that study student
experiences taking courses.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.220
But there's really-- it feels
like a dearth of research

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.760
around faculty's experience
teaching courses.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.950
And we had both,
anecdotally, in the courses

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.150
that we have managed, heard
a lot of overlapping things,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.157
both positive and
also things faculty

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:01.990
wished they had known
when they had started.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.670
And we wanted to
really formalize

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.780
that in using the Spark
grant in a study design,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.080
so that we could pull out
these faculty experiences

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.790
to share with
prospective faculty who

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.280
are thinking about
developing online courses.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.610
And also, staff and
course developers

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.330
who are working with faculty
to improve their experiences.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.090
Some preliminary things we
found are that across the board,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.220
I think, faculty were
surprised at how long it takes

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.310
to create an online course.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
It's quite different than
creating a residential course.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.660
A lot of faculty
transformed the way

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.020
they teach in their
residential course based

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.190
on their experiences
teaching online.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.530
They tend to teach
more interactively

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.840
after teaching online.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.490
And also, a few them
were able to work

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.450
on projects that were more
interdisciplinary that they

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.539
otherwise wouldn't have a chance
to do in a residential setting

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.630
and to collaborate with faculty
that they wouldn't otherwise

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.490
collaborate with.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.280
And some of them altered
their research interests

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.990
and gave them a more
global perspective

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.030
on those who are doing
Massive Open Online Courses.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.180
In some ways, we're still
in the preliminary stages,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.880
in the sense that the
Spark grant helped

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.480
us get to the stage where
we are now to start actually

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.410
using our time to
go through what

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.002
has been coded to then determine
a quasi-list of best practices.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.460
And also, to turn around and
present back to the university

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.220
is really important
for what we're doing.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.980
So while the grant
is up, it doesn't

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.000
mean that the work that
we're doing is done.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.930
In some sense, it's pushed
us to the next stage.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.470
I think putting together
a timeline early on

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.640
is really important.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.225
Obviously, you want to
leave yourself flexibility

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:12.580
as you explore and
develop new ideas.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.280
But in general,
it's a grant, which

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.140
has a specific amount
of time around it.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.420
And you really want to know
what your deliverable is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.320
at the end Holt is very
generous with giving us

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.492
the freedom of
establishing our own goals.

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:28.450
But you still want to
set those goals early on.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.533
You don't want it to just
be an exploratory space.

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:32.980
You really want to know
what you're going into

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.340
and set internal
deliverables to make

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.850
sure you've reached that goal.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.510
The most valuable part of this
grant was having a great coach.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.690
Rebecca was amazing.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.640
And just really having a
sounding board and someone

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.220
to cheer lead us along and
think through the process

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.890
was so helpful.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.040
I think the process would
not have been the same at all

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.762
without her.

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:03.220
I think she was,
in some ways, even

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.790
more valuable than the money.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.290
Yeah.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.480
I'd totally sign off for that.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.713
Rebecca, that's our coach, was
very supportive and helpful

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:12.130
and I think
emblematic, generally,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.440
of what Holt represented
for us, which was a support

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.279
structure when we needed it.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.880
No one was poking around,
asking us what were doing,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.290
but if we needed
help or support,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.570
we knew that it was there,
which was really, really

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.530
nice with this sort of grant.
