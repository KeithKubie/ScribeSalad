00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
At every point of our fluid we have a velocity, but also we have pressure.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Velocity has direction. Pressure doesn't.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now let's try to find out how to incorporate pressure in our equations.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To make things simple, we look at a one-dimensional situation--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a straight pipe filled with fluid.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Capital a is the cross-section area of that pipe.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's replace some amount of that fluid with the piston of width Δx,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and let's assume that the pressure to the left of that piston is p₁

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the pressure to the right of that piston is p₂.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then this force is proportional to the difference of those two pressures.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If p₁, the pressure on the left, is larger than p₂, the pressure on the right,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the force is to the right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we have to choose sides like that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The proportionality constant is simply the area.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If you double the area, you double the force.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If we say that this piston has a volume of v,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
then the area, of course, is the volume of the piston divided by its width.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If we want to use this as part of our differential equations, what should we be writing?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What's the force per volume?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The partial derivative of pressure with respect to x?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Minus the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to x?

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Half the partial derivative or the pressure divided by the square root of the area?
