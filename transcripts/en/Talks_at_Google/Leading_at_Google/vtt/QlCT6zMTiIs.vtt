00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:14.960
ALISON EYRING: My story began
on the 14th of May in 2002.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.400
It was exactly 4:50
in the afternoon

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.524
and I was working in Shanghai.

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:23.328
I was there with two
of my colleagues.

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.580
We were working with a client.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.246
The day was about to end.

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:29.854
One of my colleagues
came up to me

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:32.369
with a phone in her hand,
which seemed [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.540
She said Alison, your family
is trying to reach you.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.930
Immediately, my heart went here.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.590
Because you always know
that's not a good thing.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.482
I went outside and
I held the phone

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:49.180
tightly to my ear to
hear my husband's voice.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.720
He said to me the thing that
I hope you'll never hear.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.890
He said, Alison,
your mom and dad

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.850
have been in a car accident,
neither who survived.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.200
That turned my life upside down.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.020
The next 36 hours, I
can hardly remember.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.150
I flew from Shanghai
back to Singapore.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.172
I went to the United States.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.835
I met my siblings.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.900
And I was there for
three weeks with them

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.810
before I came back
home to Singapore.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.570
When I came back to Singapore,
I was so jet lagged, as you are.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.700
And every morning, I'd wake
up when it was still dark

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.960
and I'd crawl out of bed
and I'd go for a walk.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.460
I called those my morning
walks because all I could do

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.240
was grieve.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.850
Fortunately it was dark
and people passing me

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.050
couldn't see me cry.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.620
I cried every morning but
I started walking further.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.385
My walks, they became jogs.

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:54.740
My jogs became trots.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.190
And then the trotting
became running.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.150
And I continued to run
until December of that year.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.450
Now, when December came, I had
a whole new wave of sadness

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.259
happen because Christmas
day was my birthday

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.550
and it was my dad's birthday.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
And so growing up was always so
special because we could always

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.280
celebrate that day together.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.260
And I knew that
day, we would never

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.560
be able to spend again
celebrating our birthdays.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.095
So I'm really not a
cry baby, even though I

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:27.330
had been crying ever since May.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.400
And I said, that's it.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.714
I got to do something that's
going to give me some hope.

00:02:32.714 --> 00:02:34.130
I had to do something
that's going

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.055
to make me work for the future.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.180
So I thought really long and
hard, what would that be?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.520
And I thought, I'll run
a marathon, as you do.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.670
And so I did.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.950
For the next year, I ran
and I trained and I sweat.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.940
And I ran up till
December when many of you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.520
may have participated in
the Stan Chart Marathon

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.075
in Singapore, of course.

00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:06.640
A December marathon
isn't cool by any stretch

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.690
of the imagination.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.790
And I can still
remember that day.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.560
It was so hot I was sweating
before I even started.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.990
And we had a start off time
at 4:00 in the morning.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.650
I dragged myself through the
42 kilometers of that race.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.340
And I got to the
end and I cried.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.710
But this time, it was the worst
because it wasn't tears of joy,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.340
but realizing that all my
running was never going

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.840
to bring my mom and dad back.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.320
So over the last 15 years, I've
become an endurance athlete.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.920
I realized that when I came
to the end of the marathon,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.960
I came to the
realization that I didn't

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.630
need to run any more to
heal my broken heart.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.410
I just loved to run and
I wanted to keep running.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.780
So for the last 15 years,
that's what I've done.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.220
I became an endurance athlete.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.470
I've had a great time.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.910
I've run, swum-- you
can say swum, I think--

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.840
and ridden a bike
thousands of kilometers.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.560
And I've trained
for and competed

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.130
in a 100-kilometer race.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.390
I've done a couple of half
Ironmen, a bunch of marathons,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.700
half marathons.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700
I just loved it.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.560
And I learned so much
from that experience.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.310
I've learned so much about,
what is my maximum capacity

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.870
and what are the
capabilities that I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.910
need to develop for a race?

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.760
I've learned a lot about
the importance of pace

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.610
and about recovery.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.400
But most of all, I've learned
an important thing, which

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.510
is that if I want to improve
my endurance capacity,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.040
I have to push myself to go
as fast and far as I can,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.630
but no more until I have
the capacity to sustain it.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.830
And that idea is so important.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.490
That's what I call
intelligent restraint.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.990
Now, I think it's so important.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.950
I'm going to see if I can work
the technology and show you.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.110
Those are the pictures
of me doing those sports.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.360
Here's the definition.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.510
Intelligent restraint
is a growth philosophy.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.660
It's one that says that we
want to go as fast and far

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.860
as we can, but no more until
we have the capacity to do so.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.380
Now, fortunately
for my family, I

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.540
am not a professional athlete.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.114
Because if I were, it would not
help us put food on the table.

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:45.030
What I've been doing--

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.330
I actually have had a day
job for the last 25 years

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.850
working with
companies to help them

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.530
solve the people
and organization

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.300
challenges of growth.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.040
And what I see is
that many of us--

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.050
and I say us because I
also lead an organization--

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.540
we don't find the right pace.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.940
We don't quite get it right.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.080
And when we experience that,
there's a range of things

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.550
that we experience.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.380
One of them is that we
might see a stall in growth

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.040
or we might see
waves of what I call

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.810
boom-splat cycles of growth.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.930
Then we might see a flurry
of activities because when

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.780
we're on the upside--

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.660
I always say growth ignores
a multitude of sins.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.460
So then we're on a
downside, suddenly

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.330
we're busy cutting costs.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:42.350
Or we're running to roll out
initiatives to stimulate sales,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.000
but we're poorly executing.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.510
We're inconsistently executing.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.010
Sometimes, with
all those things,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.400
we see employees that are
disengaged and burned out.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.260
Now, I want to make this
more practical for you.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.740
And I just want to
ask, could everybody

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.840
just show me your smartphone?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.060
Does everybody have one today?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.170
I'm not disappointed.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.499
Now I'm, of course, feeling
a little bit exposed here

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.040
because I'm the only
one that doesn't

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.140
have a smartphone with me.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.431
You can take your pictures now.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.090
How many of you have a Samsung?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.020
Some of you.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.780
Let me talk a little
bit about the Samsung.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.200
Now, I got to tell you, when the
Galaxy S7 was coming out-- now,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.750
I'm pretty faithful
to my smartphone

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.250
and I like it an awful lot.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.410
But I was tempted because
it was a good looking phone.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.480
It was nice looking and it
was packed with features.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.800
And the price was right.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.810
Samsung had worked very hard.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.590
As a company, it had become
very fast and very progressive

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.970
and quite innovative
in its space.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.520
And when it released
the Galaxy S7,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.360
it did a classic speedy thing
as it looked over its shoulder

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.930
at Apple in a race out.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.090
It went too fast.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.610
And early on, they knew
there was a problem.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.440
But they were so fast.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.950
They were so unwilling to
stop and to think and learn

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.930
what was going on, that they
failed to understand that they

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.020
had created a phone
that they didn't take

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.295
into account the requirements
of the battery to not catch on

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:19.520
fire.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.050
Going too fast cost them
billions of dollars.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.520
It cost a withdrawal of
a product and huge costs

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.480
associated with the brand.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.075
And Samsung's not alone.

00:08:34.075 --> 00:08:40.570
But let's explore another
organization, one I love.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.220
I grew up--

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.750
Kodak was the king
of photography.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.270
Kodak was this great company.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.270
We all knew what a
Kodak moment was.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.641
Does anybody else
remember a Kodak moment?

00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:55.140
Yeah.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.640
OK.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.610
This is my age group here.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.613
I'm liking it.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.030
Kodak was amazingly innovative.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.820
They developed the
digital camera in 1975.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.530
But they put it
aside because they

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.500
thought it would threaten
their film business.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.050
They weren't willing to take
that step, even when they

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.030
saw the market changing.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.420
Even when they saw that
photography was changing,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.840
they were unwilling to do what
they thought would threaten

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.186
their core business.

00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:31.670
Kodak was encumbered.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.570
It was constrained
by its success.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.440
It had been so
successful that it

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.480
was unwilling to push hard
enough and fast enough

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.790
and it became irrelevant.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.100
Eventually, it
declared bankruptcy.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.190
It sold off most of its assets.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.090
I am happy to say it is
coming back in a smaller form.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.540
It's very focused.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.930
But that'll be another story.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:04.740
Now, it turns out that
in endurance training,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.240
we have a lot of really
lovely rules of restraint

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.950
that can help us.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.890
And I've always found them
to be particularly helpful.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.350
What I find-- and I'll
give you an example.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.670
For instance, let's
say you're running.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.090
You don't want to increase
your mileage more than 10%

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.140
in a week.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.690
Or you don't want
to increase, maybe,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.890
the length of a long run.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.150
Or maybe before a triathlon--

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.310
not a triathlon, a longer
distance, like a marathon,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.360
you start to taper.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.460
So there's these
really nice easy rules

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.160
of thumb that could help
guide the ramping up

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.520
and the ramping down of the
volume of your training.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.610
I love those rules.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.200
They're so simple to apply.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.070
But we don't really have those
rules of restraint in business.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.940
Now, don't get me
wrong, business

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.435
is full of rules of
restraint, right?

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.950
There are things
like don't divulge

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.750
confidential information.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.880
Don't give anyone your password.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.470
Don't give information
in a negotiation.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.210
Don't have an
inappropriate relationship

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.050
with your subordinates.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.250
They keep us from doing bad
things, which is a good thing.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.820
But they don't show
us how to grow.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.230
They don't show us how
we can push our capacity

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.340
for growth, and at the same
time, perform as a business.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.060
I want to share with you three
rules of intelligent restraint

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.330
that I think are fabulous
and easy to apply.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.210
And my hope for you is
that, tomorrow, you'll

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.860
start thinking about,
well, how can I

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.070
put these to work for myself?

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.310
Now, there's three.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.890
The first is focus
overrules vision.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.320
The second, teams
beat strengths.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.374
And the third is
exert, then recover.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.540
And what I'd like to do is
spend the rest of my time

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.320
with you talking through
those three rules.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.700
Let me focus on the first
one, focus overrules vision.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.710
Now, before I
moved to Singapore,

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.930
I lived in Dallas, Texas.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.080
And in December,
sometime in the '90s,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.440
I can remember going to
see the Dallas marathon.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.820
And James and I-- my husband--

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.120
he and I went to see
it with our friends.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.420
And Harry and I stood at
the end, at the finish line.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.510
Meanwhile, James and Christine
sat inside a nice warm cafe

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.760
nearby and ate pancakes.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.370
Well, Harry and I were
so excited at the end,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.860
watching and cheering people on.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.290
Men, and women, and young
people and old people,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.390
and fat people and
skinny people--

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.390
everyone was crossing
the finish line.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.260
And we were so excited.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.330
At one point, an athlete with
one leg and with crutches

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.430
crossed the finish line.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.800
We were so inspired.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.800
Harry and I looked at
each other so excited

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.140
because that man inspired us.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.080
And we looked at each other
and, with complete earnestness,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.870
we shook hands and said we're
going to run a marathon.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.940
Well, the years went
by and the vision

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.280
faded, as did the passion.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.490
Life intervened and it never
brought us to the marathon.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.240
What brought me to the marathon,
eventually, wasn't the vision.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.430
It was focus.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.990
Now, my first marathon--

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.820
I had the holy focus of hope.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.660
I mean, who wouldn't?

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.140
But after that, actually,
what drove me, the focus,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.850
was actually a lot simpler.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.540
I simply knew what the
next race would be.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.060
Once I knew what the
next race would be,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.130
I could have goals for
that race and say, well,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.560
what is it actually
that I want to do?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.890
And then I'd say, now, what's
it going to take to succeed?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.130
Those three things
helped me get focus.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.520
Once I had focus, I
could line up my life.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.730
I could allocate
time and resources.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.050
Since I'm a busy person--

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.130
I got a family, I work, I do
all of this stuff on the side--

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.990
I'd have to say no
to certain things.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.020
And I'd have to line up
resources that would allow me

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.690
to allocate the time to train.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.130
Because you can't really
cheat races like that.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.880
You can cheat a half marathon.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.450
You can't cheat 100k.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.360
And so you really
have to change things.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.420
You have to create routines.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.010
So once I had the focus, I was
able to create a discipline

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.350
that allowed me to finish.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.450
What I see often
in the work that we

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.950
do in organizations
is sometimes,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.790
there's a fuzzy vision.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.880
And sometimes, there's a bit
of a vision of growth, which

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.520
usually translates to
something like, we're

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.730
going to double our
sales at three years

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.890
or we want x percent improvement
in EBITDA over the next three

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.270
years.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.120
So often, we just have
a numerical target.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.480
What I see is that so many
leaders understand the race

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.820
they're in today,
but they don't know

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.340
what that next race will be.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.550
If we don't know
that next race, we

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.410
can't know what success looks
like when we achieve it,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.110
and we can't decide
what it takes to win.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.190
The leaders who really get it
right, that's what they do.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.620
They create incredible focus.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.740
Not only focus for themselves,
but focus with others

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.970
in the organization.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.390
They build a critical mass
that understands that.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.320
And then they work very hard
to line up the resources needed

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.330
in order to win.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.180
I will say that in the work
that we do with growth leaders,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.180
we sometimes find that
they're not very popular.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.850
Because sometimes
it's easy to say yes.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.950
It's hard to say no.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.510
It's easy to take resources.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.370
It's hard to give them up.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.340
So it's very challenging
for growth leaders

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.650
to not only create
focus, but also

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.170
to create real
alignment that means

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.890
that we allocate resources
to what really matters.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.450
So I leave you with a thought
that while vision can get you

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.230
to the race, it's actually
focus that gets you

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.420
across the finish line.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:10.710
Now, second rule is
routines beat strengths.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.960
Now, when I first
started running,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.260
I fell in love with it.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.272
I think it was because
I read this great book.

00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:21.980
It was called Running
the Spiritual Path.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.700
And it basically taught me about
how to do running meditation.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.190
And I would go out--

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.490
nothing made me happier
than to go out at about 6:00

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.130
in the morning and
run on trails all day.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.850
This didn't make my family
very happy, by the way.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.050
But to be breathing, and
meditating, and running,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.010
I just absolutely loved it.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.480
Now, I was pretty slow,
but that didn't bother me

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.110
because I knew in my heart
that this was my strength.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.220
In fact, I even read books
that ridiculed people like me.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.580
And they called it LSD,
Long Slow Distance.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.710
And I said, that doesn't matter.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.820
I'm a donkey.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.890
That's what I'd say.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.730
Not an ass, a donkey.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.700
And so it served me well.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.740
I could run very
far, very slowly.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.310
But one day, at the end of a
40k run, I was coming back.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.140
I was in the jungle.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.800
And it was in a
very narrow trail.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.770
And there was this
very large male monkey

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.359
sitting in front of me.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.120
Now, I was a little
smelly at this point

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.940
because I had been running for
a really long time with a camel

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.500
pack and lots of food in it.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.470
And I must have smelled
like eau de banana.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.295
And as I came up to
that monkey, he shrieked

00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:40.700
and he came towards me.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.220
And I shrieked and I ran
in the other direction.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.380
I took off like a gazelle.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.320
As I sprinted, I felt
the dagger of his teeth

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.760
into the back of my calf.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.930
I screeched.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.400
I looked back.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.380
There was no monkey.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.180
In my haste to escape, in
my sprint of a gazelle,

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.930
I tore my calf.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.260
I learned a very
important lesson.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.310
You can't run like
a gazelle when

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.073
you've trained like a donkey.

00:18:08.073 --> 00:18:10.538
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.160
I thought I had this strength.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.210
It turned out not
to be a strength.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.610
And what I learned is that
my strength, it limited me.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.570
But we're the same way.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.700
Think of how many
organizations--

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.940
we limit ourselves from
changing because we

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.900
want to rely on who we are
and what's made us successful.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.840
When I changed tack, I
recovered from my torn calf,

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.940
I decided I wanted
a new challenge.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.680
I would do triathlons.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.760
That was much easier on my body.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.930
And so I decided to
do a half Ironman.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.210
So since I didn't
know what to do,

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.240
I hired a sports coach, which
I'm very thankful I did.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.180
And I worked with a man named
Scott Molina, who himself is

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.940
an Ironman athlete and a coach.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.650
And he worked with
me and I learned

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.020
something that was profound.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.130
And it was that if I wanted to
improve the capacity of my body

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.250
to go further and faster,
what I needed to do

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.100
was implement progressively
challenging routines.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.860
Our bodies are smart.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:23.710
Like any system, if we don't
push them, they stay the same.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:27.040
In fact, even going out and
having a really tough workout

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.390
doesn't make any difference.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:29.587
It just keeps coming back.

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:31.420
It's one of the reasons
why you should never

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.551
restrict your calories too much
because your body doesn't just

00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:35.050
lose weight.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.870
It says, oh no, you're
starving, and it suddenly

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.370
becomes very efficient.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.260
Our bodies are very smart.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.020
What I learned from these
progressively challenging

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.680
routines was that
it was the routine

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.560
and the ongoing
challenge that sparked

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.385
the development of my capacity.

00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:55.760
I think this is
really important.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.450
There's an awful lot of
people in this room that are

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.330
in fields of human development.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.320
And we've known for two
decades that experience

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.590
is a great teacher.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.254
And we know that challenge
in experience develops.

00:20:09.254 --> 00:20:11.420
But I want you just to go
away and think about that.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.370
It's not just challenge.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.840
It's progressively
challenging routines.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.580
That changes systems.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.850
That's what changes us.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.070
It's not just a
random challenge.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:29.260
Now, I want to give you an
example of an organization

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.320
that I think did a great job
with introducing a routine,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.950
just to make this practical.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.686
This is a company--

00:20:37.686 --> 00:20:39.165
I'll call it ArtCo.

00:20:39.165 --> 00:20:42.730
It's a marketplace
or platform for arts

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.700
and designed products for homes.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.170
And ArtCo has been
very successful.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.290
And it was growing so
fast that-- when you're

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.730
in a very high
growth environment,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.730
it's very challenging
because you start your job

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.210
and, suddenly, it's changing.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.600
So you have to be
changing very fast.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.830
And the volume of work
is constantly changing.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.220
There's a lot of newness,
a lot of challenge.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.210
And one of the things that ArtCo
decided that they wanted to do

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.290
was to find a way to
help themselves scale.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.910
So they introduced a routine
they call scaling day.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.650
And as it sounds, scaling
day happened once a month.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.430
And it started-- they'd
pick a little problem.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.520
They would pick processes
or work activities

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.290
that they knew needed to scale,
in order to sustain growth.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:37.140
And they had this
fabulous office.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.640
In the middle, they
have a glass room.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.320
Many of us have been
involved in activities

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.770
of documenting processes.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.230
And usually, we sit
around and we have Word

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.160
documents and Google documents.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.470
And we're documenting
lots of details

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.900
and no one cares about what
we write and no one ever

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.870
looks at it.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.100
But what ArtCo did was they
made it part of their culture.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.440
Scaling day was
something that people

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.970
wanted to be a part
of because they

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.930
knew it was part of the future.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.480
And so people volunteered.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.470
They gave their time.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.550
They used it to be able
to scale for growth.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.740
Now, in my book,
Pacing for Growth,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.960
which I'm so excited
for you all to read,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.000
you'll find a lot of
examples of routines

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.410
that you can use and implement
to build organization, team,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.340
leader capabilities that
you need for the future.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.060
The beauty of a routine
is that the right routine

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.550
helps you build the capabilities
that you need for the future

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.178
and it also helps
you conserve energy.

00:22:35.178 --> 00:22:39.440
Now, let me talk
about the last one.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.370
Exert and then recover.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.845
It's a little bit different.

00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:49.040
And I have to start with my
own reflection a very important

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.950
recovery moment.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.820
In that first half
Ironman that I did--

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.360
that was the hardest
race I'd ever done.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.000
It took me over seven hours.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.020
And I came back.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.760
I was so tired.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.250
I remember my husband
and girls, they kind of

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.130
scraped me off the floor
and they put me in the car

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.080
and they took me home.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.910
James, in the most
loving way, had

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.630
filled the bathtub full of ice.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.100
He's just a man
after my own heart,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.560
which is what I would do
after a really long run

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.750
because it would lower
my body temperature

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.130
and reduce inflammation.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.510
My daughters were so sweet.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.700
They created a
little spa for me.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.010
And I believe that they
were giving me massages.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.020
But I fell asleep so
quickly I don't even

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.490
remember what happened.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.790
I woke up, consumed massive
amounts of carbohydrates,

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.000
fell asleep, and felt
much better the next day.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.780
Now, that's recovery.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.100
Actually, that's
called passive recovery

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.460
because passive
recovery is when we rest

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.020
and we recharge our battery.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.240
And we all need that, right?

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.250
I think that's why
a lot of us are

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.890
happy that Friday is tomorrow.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.350
So passive recovery
is really important.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.170
It allows us to recharge.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.270
But there's another
kind of a recovery

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.540
that's equally important.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.720
And that's called
active recovery.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.200
And at work, we tend to
think, well, I'm working

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.550
or I'm not working.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.950
And with active
recovery, what we'll do

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.330
is we have a recovery
workout where we go slower.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.600
Heart rate is slower.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.505
It's easier on our body.

00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:25.090
And it not only
helps us recover,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.800
but it helps condition.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.880
And it helps teach
our body how to exert.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.760
And that's an important
aspect of the relationship

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.249
between exertion and recovery

00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:36.040
It's kind of funny.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.890
It's not the exertion
that helps us improve.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.590
It's actually the
recovery, which I always

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.250
find so interesting.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.910
I remember, I think
Troy told me a story.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.640
Troy will be on our panel.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.000
He said that when the
players are playing the game,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.740
it's too late to coach.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.820
And so one of the things
that we have to do

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.690
is to learn how to exert with
the right level of exertion,

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.220
and then to properly recover--

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.530
because those two
go hand-in-hand.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.770
One of the things about
exertion is that often, we

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.170
just mindlessly exert.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.870
We're like hamsters in a cage
and we're addicted to action.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.420
We're just doing, doing, doing.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.160
And we're not
thinking about, what's

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.640
the purpose of my exertion?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.620
In training, we'll
have really high levels

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.500
where we're going all
out, just pushing up

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.000
the capacity of our heart.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.269
Sometimes, we do race pace.

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:30.310
And race pace is helpful.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.130
It helps us know what
it feels like when

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.480
we're going to be in the race.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.500
There's other times where it's
just a little bit lower, where

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.500
we're really pushing
our aerobic capacity

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.480
and we're building our strength.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.880
And then we have our
recovery workouts.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.010
So part of what we have
to do as leaders is

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:53.260
learn to exert on what matters
and at the right level.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.980
And we need to learn to balance
the right kind of recovery

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.960
with that.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.470
What I see with the
leaders that I work with--

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.820
leaders of growth face constant
pressure because, on one hand,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.600
we want to build
capabilities for the future.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.130
At the same time, we have
to execute today's business.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.940
And if we can't execute today's
business, if we can't perform,

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.070
there will be no future.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.620
So really, we have to do both.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.940
We have to perform
today and we have

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.810
to transform for the future.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.380
And we have to learn how to do
these things without killing

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.430
people.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.580
So this rule of thumb is a
way of us thinking about,

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.730
how do we exert mindfully
on what most matters?

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.420
How do we create routines
that allow us to do that?

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.460
How do we allow ourselves
to recover in the right way

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.510
that both teaches us how to
exert, as well as to recover?

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:56.550
Now, what I'd like
to do is wrap up.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.300
And I'd like to say thank
you to Google because you all

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.610
have a fabulous facility here.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.140
And it's so cool.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.010
One of the things that my team
really appreciated working here

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.450
was just to see how Google
not only created this world

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.110
class, dynamic, and
collaborative work space,

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.280
but also spent energy
teaching their employees how

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.550
to manage their own energy
using the workplace.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.660
And so I think you're
really a role model of that.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.100
And I want to
encourage all of you

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.500
to think about that,
about how do you help

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.540
people manage their own energy?

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.090
I want to thank all
of you for being here

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.270
and listening to my
story and participating.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.560
We're only halfway done.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.600
We're going to do a TV talk show
inspired by Graham Norton soon.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.690
I hope that I managed to
get you excited and curious

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.285
about intelligent restraint.

00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:54.210
I hope that you'll leave
here today thinking

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.140
about how you can apply these
principles or these rules

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.590
of intelligent restraint and
become endurance athletes

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.250
for business growth.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:03.750
Thank you.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.125
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.560
Now, what I'd like to
do is, in the moments

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.360
that Darryl's going to
come up onto the stage,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.930
I want you to look to your
left and to your right

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.780
and I want you to introduce
yourself to the person sitting

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.380
next to you.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.630
There's no strangers here.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.240
And when Daryl comes
up, then we'll begin.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.480
It's my pleasure to
introduce Darryl Dickens,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.280
the host of our fabulous show.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.030
Darryl.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:43.162 --> 00:28:44.370
DARRYL DICKENS: I'm mic'd up.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.730
So it's amazing when you
know somebody for 20 years

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.370
and then you learn
something completely new.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.190
That's just really
inspirational.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.730
Fantastic.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.440
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, comes

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.430
the next part of the evening.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.720
And we have an
outstanding panel.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.341
Absolutely outstanding.

00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:03.840
I'm going to start
to bring them up.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.534
And I want lots of energy,
lots and lots of energy

00:29:06.534 --> 00:29:07.200
as they come up.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.150
Now, the first person is
literally a rock star.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.800
Not figuratively.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.590
He actually plays in
a rock and roll band.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.020
He's CEO of [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.666
Come on up, Richard.

00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:22.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:31.430
All right.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.240
Look at that.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.800
Now the next person is
former Olympic coach

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.780
who has recently
moved to Singapore

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.810
and has a fascinating
role here now

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:46.640
as head of coach development
for Sport Singapore, Mr. Troy

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.440
Engle, sprint on up.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.600
Thanks, coach.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.320
Now next, we have somebody
who I just met last week.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.840
And I have to say,
this person has

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.520
one of the sunniest dispositions
that I've ever encountered.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.060
Elizabeth, better known
as Lizzy [? Hamrun, ?]

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.550
who is VP and head of HR.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.960
Come on up.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.331
Bring some of that
glow to the panel.

00:30:21.331 --> 00:30:21.831
Fantastic.

00:30:21.831 --> 00:30:23.490
Fantastic.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.800
Now, last but not
least, somebody

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.520
who is head of a incredible
high growth part of the Google

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.230
business, head of
YouTube, which I probably

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.680
watch 20 minutes a day, and
less and less cat videos,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.350
actually, which is
quite encouraging.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.080
A little more content, now.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.970
I'm going to introduce
Ajay Vidyasagar.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.406
Come on up.

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:47.370
Let's make some more content.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.060
Because we just don't
have enough content.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.180
Let's film this and
make some more content.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.120
All right.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.560
Now, look at that.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.400
We're all lined up.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.180
We're all ready.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.810
I'm excited.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.622
I feel like we're poised
like a [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:59.622 --> 00:31:02.550
for a fantastic panel.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.180
Now, I was thinking how
should we kick things off?

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.720
And I just think that
it's a very natural segue

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.490
from the author to actually
the CEO of a very significant

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.530
company that you
have built. And I

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:21.495
think people want to hear how
do you drink your own Merlot.

00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:24.040
Actually, you like to
drink sauvignon blanc.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.520
So how do you drink your
own sauvignon blanc?

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.570
And when have you found
that, at the company,

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.890
you're running the wrong race?

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.530
That you had to change
the pace, slower, faster?

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.114
How did you know
and what did you do?

00:31:38.114 --> 00:31:39.780
ALISON EYRING: I'll
answer the first one

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.975
because I do prefer
sauvignon blanc over Merlot.

00:31:42.975 --> 00:31:45.630
It will be served later.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.450
So we're a relatively
small firm.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.730
We have about 50 people.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.640
And one of the
things that we do,

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.400
because part of Pacing
for Growth is about,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.650
how do you drive execution
in the day-to-day business,

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.210
as well as build
capabilities for the future?

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.990
And one of the
things that we do is

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.900
we look at work that we have
to do that's particularly

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.300
challenging that we
can create and that we

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.430
can structure so
that it's a learning

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.290
experience for our team.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.060
And then we use a
structured process

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.140
to help them accelerate their
development as they're also

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.030
delivering work.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.620
So that would be an
example of what we do.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.780
DARRYL DICKENS: So it's--

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.337
go ahead.

00:32:24.337 --> 00:32:25.920
SPEAKER 1: I was
going to tell a story

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.860
about where I've seen really
poor intelligent restraint.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.920
We were talking
about this earlier.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.179
I used to work, I feel
like it's a confession.

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:38.720
I used to work in
investment banking.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.345
I'm very sorry.

00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:40.303
You can love me anyway.

00:32:40.303 --> 00:32:41.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.330
Yeah.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.470
And I worked for a company
where, pre the crash,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:52.925
where exertion became a
byword for being employable.

00:32:52.925 --> 00:32:54.930
And there was this
confluence of always

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.830
on technology, the
explosion in capital markets

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.420
and global markets.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.790
And this really,
really alpha culture.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:08.640
And I kid you not, the group HR
director took a conference call

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.530
in the middle of
the London Marathon

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.150
as a sign of commitment.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.710
And you have this
amazing situation

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.880
where league tables
were going around

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.920
about who stayed in the office
the latest-- as a good thing,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.220
by the way, as a good thing--
answering the call at 3:00 AM.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.140
And what we found, by doing
some research, was that--

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.790
we used to use these
algorithms that

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.960
checked for insider dealing.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.290
I can tell you some more
over a glass of wine.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.430
The behavior patterns
that people exhibited

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.830
when they were getting
ready to do insider dealing

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.370
were the same behavior patterns
that people displayed when

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.064
they were behaving unethically.

00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:51.480
And then, because we had all
these league tables about who

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.063
was working, we had
all the technology

00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:56.280
to read who was working,
we did an overlay.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.800
Guess who were the people
who were displaying the worst

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.085
ethical behaviors?

00:34:00.085 --> 00:34:02.322
It's the people who were tired.

00:34:02.322 --> 00:34:04.850
So the people who'd
been overworking.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.520
And we found, this
blew my mind and it'll

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.480
blow yours, tired people
make worse ethical decisions

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.710
than drunk people.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.940
Now, go figure.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.530
And then you look at this
always on alpha culture

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.590
and how many companies
now don't own any assets.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.920
They just own their
reputation and their brand.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.110
And then you look at
how many organizations

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.780
have suffered ethical crises.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.830
Enron, WorldCom, [? Andisor, ?]
The list goes on.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.820
And so exert and then
recover, I think,

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.360
is a massive gap, actually, in
the way that people work today

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.989
and it's had really
dire consequences.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:50.190
So it's something that I think
we should really watch out for.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.030
And I know I've just seen the
worst examples of that ever,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.977
really.

00:34:54.977 --> 00:34:56.560
DARRYL DICKENS: It's
interesting, too,

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.893
because you were talking a
little bit about the business

00:34:58.893 --> 00:35:01.510
cycles and the
additional pressures.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:05.230
Richard, you have such an
amazing set of retail outlets.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.700
You have sourcing.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.410
You have a very significant
complex organization.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.000
You're expanding to the north.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.390
And you've seen some
different business cycles.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.780
I'd be fascinated to hear,
whether it was a growth cycle

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.950
that you really wanted to
ride out and really scale

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.730
or whether it was a downturn.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.095
What examples have
you seen where

00:35:27.095 --> 00:35:29.390
you had to really change
the pace of the company

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.373
to weather it?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.270
SPEAKER 2: The problem
is we can never

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.150
see what's happening outside.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.620
And we know what's going
on within the organization.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.080
But external factors can
throw everything off.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.410
In 1997, end of '96, we had
just completed one buyout

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.470
and we were preparing
to continue expansion.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.920
And what happens is the
Asian financial crisis.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.294
And we were in a meeting.

00:36:08.294 --> 00:36:09.710
I was in a meeting
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.740
I remember this internal
manager meeting.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.580
We were talking how to
expand everything else

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.020
with our financial partners.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.010
And then the message comes
in overnight, interest rates

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.705
have hit--

00:36:22.705 --> 00:36:25.460
I don't know, whatever
percent it was--

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.490
10s of percents.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.180
And we have a lot of debt.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.280
So you wonder, what the hell
is going to go wrong next?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:39.220
So your plans, no matter
how good they are,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.420
are subject to these
outside influences.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.485
And you have to
modify all the time.

00:36:45.485 --> 00:36:47.360
ALISON EYRING: I heard
this great quote once.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.900
It said that we
always overestimate

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.750
the impact of what we've been--

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.160
the 10-year trends-- and
then we underestimate

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.656
what happens next month.

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:56.836
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:36:56.836 --> 00:36:57.720
ALISON EYRING: But
it's interesting

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.386
because I think that
one of the concepts

00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:03.890
of intelligent restraint
is around building two

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.200
important growth capabilities.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.690
One is of outside-in
thinking and the other

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.490
is around customer
aligned innovation.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.540
And those are really
muscles that we

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.540
have to exercise more and more
because you're exactly right.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.890
You could not have known.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.695
But you could be very
fast and responsive.

00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:22.320
So it's about understanding that
there's these little unknowns.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.040
You have to be very adaptable.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.840
And then there's other unknowns.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.850
But we know they're
happening, but then we're

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.620
not being proactive enough to--

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.281
SPEAKER 2: So in
terms of growth,

00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:35.590
you have to pace yourself.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.680
But actually, what happened was,
every time there was a crisis,

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.340
we tried to expand because that
was actually the best time.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.635
Because we're retailers
and when there's

00:37:47.635 --> 00:37:53.830
a recession or whatever,
rental prices go down.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.770
So actually, that's the
best time to pick up leases

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.080
and so on.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.440
But we grew a lot that way
through the financial crisis,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.860
[INAUDIBLE] and all
that sort of thing.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.680
But the other thing
is about this routine.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.550
So actually it's a lot
about training and getting

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.375
the team ready so
that you have to--

00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:19.460
when we open branches,
there are people

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.290
who can just go in and
operate straight away.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:26.260
And we don't try to open a
branch and then hire people.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.057
You actually got to
hire people first.

00:38:28.057 --> 00:38:29.890
DARRYL DICKENS: And
that's very interesting.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.140
It goes back to the comment
that Troy made around,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.590
once you're on the
field, you can't really

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.080
expect to have
any more coaching.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.880
You've really got to be
able to adapt, real time,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.750
and run whatever plays
you have to now do.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.330
So when we think about the,
again, the fascinating analogy

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.560
around, and learnings from,
the endurance training,

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.050
what else should we think
about and take away,

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.740
Troy, in terms of building
high performance teams,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.020
breaking barriers, but
doing it with the right kind

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.600
of intelligent restraint?

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.840
What have you seen, in terms
of the actual exporting side?

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.710
TROY ENGLE: I think
that, as I told Alison

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.210
in my first conversation
with her, the kind of things

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:09.640
that we talked about, and
then when I read the book.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.227
This book literally
could be a book

00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:13.060
about distance running
or endurance running,

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.190
and that's my background.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.800
It's all about not just the
rules of endurance training

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.970
that Alison mentioned.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.880
There are certain
percentages of growth.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.630
They're really more
principles of training

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:29.094
that are based on physiological
response, and as I read this,

00:39:29.094 --> 00:39:33.930
I realized are adaptable to the
physiology of an organism, too.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.750
Things like what
we used to call--

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.700
we talk about the principle
of specificity of training.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.910
You have to understand
what the specific demands

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.190
of the athletic performance
are and you train for those.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:50.256
You focus on the 97%,
rather than the 3%.

00:39:50.256 --> 00:39:53.160
We talk about the principles
of load and recovery

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.300
because the adaptation
actually happens in that time

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:03.720
away from the exertion when
the body reflects and adapts.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.680
Principles of progressive
overload, that you constantly

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.430
stress the system.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.010
Because from a
coaching standpoint,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.722
all the advances
happen at the margin.

00:40:13.722 --> 00:40:15.430
They don't happen
through under-training.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.760
And they absolutely don't
happen through overtraining.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.535
And in the endurance world, as
Alison and I have talked about,

00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:25.700
there are three or four
different critical margins.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.200
There's submaximal margins.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.330
There's margins that
we talk about called

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.950
the anaerobic threshold, which
is that level that you can

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.190
basically maintain for an
extended period of time

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.200
without accumulating fatigue.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.966
That's a really
critical threshold.

00:40:42.966 --> 00:40:44.460
It's highly trainable.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.040
You go beyond, you
stress the system where

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.080
there's a risk of breakdown.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.710
And then there are super maximal
thresholds, which you probably

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:57.900
need, at times, to bump to
so you can expect that pace.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.260
You can train for those
changes in the market, changes

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.470
in the pace.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.280
But you know you can't
sustain them for long,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.100
so you throttle back
down and regroup.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.490
So I'm reading this going,
geez, this book is--

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.050
number one, it makes
me feel smart because I

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.680
see my track coaching could
actually, probably, be

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.200
more than just with what we do.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.490
But it works for everybody.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.020
It's not principles
that are only

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.060
applied at the Olympic level.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.570
They're also with-- they're
responses throughout all

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.980
of endurance training.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.490
ALISON EYRING: One thing
I was going to add--

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.150
often, organizations really
struggle to think about,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.490
what is their maximum capacity?

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.550
We understand today.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.400
But it's hard to
imagine, how are we

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.270
going to be changed tomorrow?

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.770
And one of the stories I told in
the book that I loved was about

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:51.480
how all the experts used to say
the four-minute mile cannot be

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.350
broken.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:52.890
Right?

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.360
It was just not going to happen.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.680
And it took a young
doctor in the UK

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.080
who trained for three
months and then broke it.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.520
And then the record's been
broken 17 times since.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.870
And so I think that
we see that in sport.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.380
That we often have
that idea about, well,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.840
what's the best I can be?

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.572
But then in fact, it's not true.

00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:12.780
TROY ENGLE: There have been--

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.550
Roger Bannister broke
the four minute mile.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.174
And they said it
could never be broken.

00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:18.140
And there have now
been over 400 people.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.990
So we just recalibrate.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.290
And the earlier point
about ethical decisions.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.610
I think, clearly
within our world,

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.870
ethics is a huge issue in sport.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.652
Drugs in sport are
a major problem.

00:42:31.652 --> 00:42:33.420
The thing that most
people don't realize

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.980
is that the most common drugs--

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.460
they don't make you faster.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.545
What they allow you
to do is work more.

00:42:40.545 --> 00:42:45.780
They reinforce that thought
that more is always better.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.820
But the reality is it's
not no pain no gain.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.690
It's no brain, lots
of pain, or something.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.580
You really have to figure out
what the capacity is and it's

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.210
there for a reason.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.080
DARRYL DICKENS: On
maximum capacity,

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.690
when I think about
a business, I think

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:06.440
about YouTube and the phenomenal
growth-- it's hyper growth.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.620
So when you're talking
about maximum capacity,

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.970
how do you, Ajay, look at
removing constraints just

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.670
to continue that
maximum capacity

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.320
to take up the opportunity.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.810
AJAY VIDYASAGAR:
Actually, I think

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.970
I want to share something
that really shook me

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.585
up when I [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:26.585 --> 00:43:29.385
I had this very flourishing
career in television.

00:43:29.385 --> 00:43:33.253
And I said, this is a
place that operates a lot

00:43:33.253 --> 00:43:35.840
like [INAUDIBLE] in television.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.072
And within a few months
after I came to YouTube,

00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:39.650
which was a rocket ship.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.836
It was going really well.

00:43:41.836 --> 00:43:43.590
There was something
that happened

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.265
that really made me very,
very nervous about what

00:43:47.265 --> 00:43:49.680
we were doing.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.620
At that time, around
85% of our consumption

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.020
happened from desktops.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:00.644
And about 15% of our consumption
happened from mobile devices.

00:44:00.644 --> 00:44:03.022
So I vividly remember this
day when we were all called

00:44:03.022 --> 00:44:05.980
in for a leadership meeting.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:13.100
We were told, long story
short, that any content that

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.630
comes in to this platform
that does not make itself

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.310
available on a mobile
device will not

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.303
be [INAUDIBLE] on YouTube.

00:44:23.303 --> 00:44:26.830
And [INAUDIBLE] these
guys should be nuts.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:31.657
We have such an extraordinary
amount of volume of desktops.

00:44:31.657 --> 00:44:33.490
DARRYL DICKENS: We're
doing so well already.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.730
Why change it?

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.563
AJAY VIDYASAGAR: I was
sitting there saying,

00:44:36.563 --> 00:44:38.570
man, I gave up an
amazing career.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.140
What have I got into?

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:45.090
So every day now,
when I think about it,

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.910
it was a lot of what you
talk about in this book.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.410
It is really about prioritizing
and focusing and having

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.740
a very vivid vision of what the
world is going to be and not

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.100
really--

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.330
restrain yourself
[? bases ?] the local data

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.900
that you're operating within.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.700
Today, in many markets, we
have almost the flip of what we

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.589
we at seven years back.

00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:16.500
We have 6 to 7 out
of 10 minutes being

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.950
consumed on connected
smartphone devices.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.575
And pretty much, every
large video platform

00:45:23.575 --> 00:45:27.810
in the world today
struggles with a situation

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.530
where consumers don't get
a consistent experience

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.090
on all devices, which
is fundamentally what

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.570
we re-engineered at that time.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:39.000
And I think it's a great
example of actually

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.630
having a pretty clear vision
of what you want to be

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.820
and focusing on
just that one thing.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.210
And sacrificing an entire
bunch of things that

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.429
may look very painful then.

00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:51.720
But you're going to have an
entire [? division group ?]

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.670
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.340
ALISON EYRING: It's also a great
example of how constraints--

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.900
actually deliberately
constraining certain things

00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.805
helps create clarity.

00:46:02.049 --> 00:46:04.215
DARRYL DICKENS: We're having
a fantastic panel here.

00:46:04.215 --> 00:46:06.423
I just want to pause to see,
are there any questions?

00:46:06.423 --> 00:46:07.720
I was talking to some folks.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.980
Some folks said they had
some doozy questions for us.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.775
Any questions from the audience?

00:46:13.775 --> 00:46:14.816
It's a great opportunity.

00:46:14.816 --> 00:46:17.590
ALISON EYRING: Or
shouts of joy, comments?

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.399
DARRYL DICKENS: Exactly.

00:46:19.399 --> 00:46:20.728
No takers?

00:46:20.728 --> 00:46:21.228
OK.

00:46:21.228 --> 00:46:23.500
All right.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:32.190
When I think about the
book, the three big things

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.220
we should remember
to take away-- this

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.160
shows that I was paying
attention, Alison.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.140
But I, again, ask the panel.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.730
We all have very
different mandates,

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:42.160
in terms of what we work in.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.520
But if we think that
focus overrules vision

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.720
and that routines
beat strengths.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.380
And that you exert,
but must recover.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.680
We're not saying you don't
want to do all three,

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.190
but given the circumstances that
you face with your very, very

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.460
different businesses, which one
would you prioritize right now

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.420
and why?

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.880
SPEAKER 1: I'll have
a go at that one.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.914
Years ago, I never
thought I'd give

00:47:15.914 --> 00:47:20.536
this answer which is I think
routines beat strengths.

00:47:20.536 --> 00:47:22.360
ALISON EYRING: Yes.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.359
SPEAKER 1: I spent 10
years in an alpha business

00:47:24.359 --> 00:47:28.000
and being taught that all you
need to focus on is strengths.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.461
And if you find somebody who's
working for Google or Apple,

00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:37.502
you ask them one question
in the interview, which

00:47:37.502 --> 00:47:39.180
is, when can you start?

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.910
And you focus on your
superstars and your top 10%.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.540
And you ignore the ecosystem.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.410
And I just think that's
absolutely bullshit.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:50.570
And I've learned, no offense
to the talent at Google,

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:51.070
obviously.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.723
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:52.723 --> 00:47:54.106
I'm in the wrong room.

00:47:54.106 --> 00:47:55.490
No.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:00.280
The ecosystem that the
majority of your people

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.330
experience every day is
the thing to go after.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.090
It's not the hypo 10%.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.670
It's not simply the
new product generation.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.195
It's, what's the
majority experience

00:48:12.195 --> 00:48:14.980
that everyone's leaning into
and experiencing every day?

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.770
Because that's what
touches your customer.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.970
And you can't get to
every individual employee.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:25.610
But you can architect the
environment that they're in.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:31.330
And so routines beats strengths
is definitely one for us.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:34.630
And Alison is working with us
on this super cool piece of work

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.170
at the moment where
we are crowdsourcing,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.840
from our front line employees,
to author our new culture

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.390
because we want to put
more speed and energy

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.920
into our organization.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.590
We're an amazing organization
with a huge deep sense

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.050
of purpose.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:56.440
But we say things like, if you
could go and change the world

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.230
and just get through
these 10 committees first.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.800
That would be wonderful
if you could get consensus

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.010
around that human organ you're
growing, that would be amazing.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.510
What?

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.160
How does that square?

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.370
And so Alison's
helping us unleash

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.140
the energy in the
organization by creating

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.840
new routines for everybody
to get to that majority

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.100
experience.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.550
And that's what I've learned.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.460
That's been a big learning for
me over the last few years.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.210
DARRYL DICKENS: It's amazing.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.560
I have spent-- I don't know--

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.290
everybody must be in
the same situation.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.370
I have spent work weeks
doing know your strengths,

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.330
the management offside.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:32.330
And oh, you're a yellow.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:33.380
Oh, you're a green.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.770
Oh, well, you work very--

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.869
on and on.

00:49:36.869 --> 00:49:37.910
And then I read the book.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:42.250
And I go, well, it's
the routine that you

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:45.210
are really clear about that's
going to get you there.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.490
And I found that one
a big one, as well.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.240
Because I was just
thinking, ugh, all that

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.552
stuff I went through.

00:49:52.552 --> 00:49:55.930
ALISON EYRING: Well, I think
one of my favorite chapters

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.540
was the scale to grow,
which was really about,

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.430
how do you have an
abundance mindset?

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.090
And I think, when you
have an abundance mindset,

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.259
you don't say, oh, it's
just one or two people

00:50:06.259 --> 00:50:07.300
that are the chosen ones.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.674
You say, well,
actually, if we're

00:50:08.674 --> 00:50:11.002
going to execute today's
business and make it better

00:50:11.002 --> 00:50:13.210
and we're going to build
capabilities for the future,

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.790
we need a lot of
people on that journey.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.880
And those people have
to be growing faster.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.710
And it can't just be this slow--

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.800
oh, let's go send them all to
this really expensive program.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.000
It's got to be anytime,
anywhere, anyhow.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.860
And I think that's
a mindset that we

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.740
have to shift that we can
develop people better,

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.270
faster, and cheaper when
we change the way we think

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:38.510
about how we develop them.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.051
DARRYL DICKENS:
Other comments, team,

00:50:40.051 --> 00:50:41.452
in terms of the three rules.

00:50:41.452 --> 00:50:43.008
Which one do--

00:50:43.008 --> 00:50:46.710
SPEAKER 2: I think if you're
building the organization

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:53.810
and getting everybody into
doing the right thing,

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.650
then routines is
the most important.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.370
But I think at the
leadership level,

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:01.970
I think you have to think
about focus, as well.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.565
But you're never going to--

00:51:03.565 --> 00:51:06.770
I'm not going to-- frankly,
a shop assistant isn't

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.950
going to think too
much about, what's

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.316
the focus for the group today?

00:51:13.316 --> 00:51:15.710
But at the leadership level,
you've got to do that.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.140
But on the other hand,
routine is something

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.594
that everybody in the
organization can do.

00:51:21.594 --> 00:51:23.260
ALISON EYRING: I
totally agree with you.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.580
And I think about that
in my own business.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.439
It's so easy for us to
know what today's race is.

00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:30.230
What are the capabilities
for the next one?

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.313
That's really much harder.

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:34.860
TROY ENGLE: I'll
take a different one.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:40.680
From a coaching perspective, I
think that focus trumps vision.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.770
From a coaching perspective,
particularly when

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.130
you've identified what
your current capacity is.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.360
We have an old coaching
expression that hope

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.820
really isn't a strategy.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:55.980
And so I think our motto is
design the plan, work the plan,

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.280
and trust the plan.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.180
And I think if you start
with a sense of what

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.400
your current
capacity is and it's

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.850
based on where you need to be--

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.530
and in our case, in
endurance training,

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.320
it may be scientific based--

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.400
you've got your focus.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.210
It's very focused.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.910
You don't get distracted
of off what else.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.470
You know your current fitness.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:17.920
You know your desired fitness.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.610
You're going to figure
out the plan to get there.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.290
And there's a great coach--

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.170
obviously, I'm an American--

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.127
who orchestrated an amazing--
yeah, at this point in time,

00:52:28.127 --> 00:52:29.085
I'm taking no sympathy.

00:52:29.085 --> 00:52:30.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:30.834 --> 00:52:35.589
DARRYL DICKENS: Well, at least
you're here and not there.

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:38.130
TROY ENGLE: But anyway, we came
off a great American sporting

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:38.580
event.

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.080
110 million people
watched the Super Bowl,

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.344
greatest comeback in history.

00:52:41.344 --> 00:52:43.260
And it was orchestrated
by one of the greatest

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.750
sports coaches ever, a
guy named Bill Belichick.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:48.600
And his motto with his
team is do your job.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.719
Do your job.

00:52:49.719 --> 00:52:51.510
And somebody asked what
the halftime speech

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.460
was that resulted in
a 25-point turnaround.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.580
And the speech was, do your job.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.780
You all know where we are.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.071
You know what you've got to do.

00:52:59.071 --> 00:53:00.460
Do your job.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.090
So I think--

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:04.479
DARRYL DICKENS: Brady
[? had ?] at [? 6'3''. ?]

00:53:04.479 --> 00:53:05.520
TROY ENGLE: I don't know.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.978
His wife tells me
he should retire.

00:53:06.978 --> 00:53:07.863
So I don't know.

00:53:07.863 --> 00:53:08.962
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:08.962 --> 00:53:10.920
ALISON EYRING: I had this
one story in the book

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.840
about a leader who's running a
very high growth organization.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.340
And one of my favorite
quotes from him was--

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.480
I said, what's your secret?

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.780
And he says, I do my job and
I let my people do theirs.

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.200
DARRYL DICKENS: Ajay,
you want to choose

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.155
one that, right now, fits what
with the mandate is at YouTube?

00:53:30.155 --> 00:53:32.780
AJAY VIDYASAGAR: I'll echo what
I said earlier, which is really

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.930
around having a very
well defined focus

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:40.791
and having an entire battery
of people buy into the vision.

00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:42.990
Doing that is not easy.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.750
At any point of
time, in any market,

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.255
you have so many opportunities
and so many problems.

00:53:49.255 --> 00:53:53.070
And to try and bottle
all of it up into one

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.100
overarching them and
then getting people

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.823
to run the same race in the same
direction and at the same pace

00:53:59.823 --> 00:54:01.650
is tough to do.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.470
But when you pull it off,
and when it starts humming,

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.200
it's a joy to be a part of.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.510
SPEAKER 1: Alison,
can I just tell you,

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.840
you caused marital
disharmony in my home.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.299
Because my husband--

00:54:14.299 --> 00:54:16.590
I gave him the book because
I thought it was brilliant.

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.651
He also is a long
distance runner.

00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:21.150
And I say, it's
really great and you

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.270
can apply it and everything.

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.580
And he said, oh yeah,
great, great, great.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.371
And he came running in
about an hour later.

00:54:25.371 --> 00:54:26.650
And said, see?

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:27.150
See?

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:28.691
I've been telling
you this for years.

00:54:28.691 --> 00:54:30.090
And I said, what do you mean?

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:30.690
What are you talking about?

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.510
He said, when I'm lying there
and you say, what are you doing

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:34.440
and I say, nothing.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.020
And you say, well, you look
like you need some jobs to do,

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.000
I'm recovering after exerting.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.340
Nothing is a thing.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.820
I am recovering.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.805
So you owe me a glass of wine.

00:54:49.805 --> 00:54:52.850
AJAY VIDYASAGAR: He should
have been on the panel today.

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:55.090
SPEAKER 2: So 90%
recovery and 10% exertion.

00:54:58.085 --> 00:55:00.585
DARRYL DICKENS: I think somebody
mentioned wine didn't they?

00:55:00.585 --> 00:55:02.260
Did they mention wine?

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.490
I'm thinking I'm not going to
show any intelligent restraint

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:07.810
whatsoever over cocktails.

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.720
None whatsoever.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.390
I think we're getting
up to about where we're

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.680
supposed to get to, right?

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.220
I'd like to thank the panel.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.250
It's been an outstanding
conversation.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.860
Alison, congratulations
on the book.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.960
It was heartfelt and memorable.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.920
And it's an
outstanding audience.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.336
I'm really looking forward
to network with folks here

00:55:32.336 --> 00:55:33.630
and have a little bit of wine.

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.470
Thank you very much.

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:37.520
