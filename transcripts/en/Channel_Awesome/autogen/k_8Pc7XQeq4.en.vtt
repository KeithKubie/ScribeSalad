far<00:01:33.810><c> way</c><00:01:33.869><c> I</c><00:01:34.650><c> think</c><00:01:35.220><c> those</c><00:01:35.340><c> are</c><00:01:35.490><c> steps</c>

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
far way I think those are steps
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
far way I think those are steps
backwards<00:01:36.240><c> and</c><00:01:36.500><c> and</c><00:01:37.500><c> now</c><00:01:37.680><c> we</c><00:01:37.740><c> have</c><00:01:37.920><c> this</c><00:01:38.100><c> one</c>

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 align:start position:0%
backwards and and now we have this one
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 align:start position:0%
backwards and and now we have this one
which<00:01:38.579><c> is</c><00:01:38.820><c> I</c><00:01:38.850><c> mean</c><00:01:39.560><c> yeah</c><00:01:40.560><c> it</c><00:01:40.710><c> feels</c><00:01:41.040><c> like</c>

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
which is I mean yeah it feels like
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.420 align:start position:0%
which is I mean yeah it feels like
another<00:01:41.549><c> step</c><00:01:41.850><c> backwards</c><00:01:42.119><c> um</c><00:01:43.040><c> but</c><00:01:44.040><c> but</c><00:01:44.280><c> at</c>

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 align:start position:0%
another step backwards um but but at
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 align:start position:0%
another step backwards um but but at
least<00:01:44.610><c> it</c><00:01:44.850><c> stuck</c><00:01:45.119><c> more</c><00:01:45.540><c> to</c><00:01:45.780><c> the</c><00:01:45.899><c> comics</c><00:01:46.350><c> unlike</c>
