00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.640
You've seen The Rock fight giant animals,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.180
escape the jungle,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.960
and navigate a crumbling city in a helicopter.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.700
Now, watch The Rock fight giant animals who've escaped the jungle

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.220
while navigating a crumbling city in a helicopter

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.700
before you see him get chased by a helicopter into a crumbling building.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.880
Dang, the guy makes so many movies, the Honest Trailer for his last one comes out the same week as his new one.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.040
Based on the 80's arcade game where you slap a button until your giant ape turns into a tiny naked guy

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.720
comes a film that's only slightly less ridiculous

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.880
with action that feels like it was drawn up by a little kid with a box of crayons

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.060
and dialogue that feels like it was written by a little kid with a box of crayons.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.780
"Because all of our research was on that space station."

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.400
Meet The Rock.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.180
He's your everyday, average primatologist, poacher, hunter, ex-Special Forces, former helicopter pilot.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.900
When his bro-rilla George gets infected with outer space growth hormone,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.360
he'll have to use every skill he learned...

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.800
communicating with Vin Diesel on the set of Fast 8

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.180
"You're sad.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.080
It's OK."

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.560
to take down a team of giant monsters,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.160
though he could've done it all himself

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.860
because just like most of his other films,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.520
The Rock's character is literally invulnerable.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.640
"Well, I think she missed all the vital organs, but, uh, don't jinx it."

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.400
But no man rampages alone.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400
He'll get help from people like Naomie Harris...'s agent,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.420
who somehow convinced her this was a good follow-up to Moonlight,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.660
as she plays a scientist who put every animal's DNA into a cocktail shaker just to see what would happen

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.920
"We worked with bat DNA."

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.360
"The growth rate of a blue whale, the strength of a rhinoceros beetle."

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.860
"African spider mouse.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.840
Its DNA makes it capable of extreme regeneration."

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.660
and Jeffrey Dean Morgan,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.960
the government agent who's more down south than a jug of moonshine,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.580
"Hell of a day, huh?"

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.680
twangier than the cast of Deliverance at a Cracker Barrel,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.140
"Well, well, well, looky here. Stealing the hospital whirlybird."

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.720
and redneckier than a biscuit with gravy served on a Confederate flag hubcap.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.240
"Thank you for getting this old cowboy off that plane."

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.380
Aw, Jeffrey, bless your heart, but you're from Seattle.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.920
Y'all need to tone it down a little bit.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.600
"Alright, c'mon, let's git."

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.800
So if you're looking for a pile of one-liners and CGI gorilla fights held together by duct tape and a likable star,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880
you'll love The Rock's latest city destroying adventure.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.580
But if you're looking for logic and depth from the monster punching video game movie,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.720
then brother, you're about as dumb as a...

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.140
pair of scissors.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940
Yep, that's totally what I was gonna say.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.860
Please don't hurt me.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.500
Hey, The Rock really did teach that gorilla everything he knew!
