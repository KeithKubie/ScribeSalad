00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.220
PROFESSOR: Another
part of the course

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.950
is that I also have a
project in the course.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.132
And students do the
projects in pairs.

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:15.090
Partly, because I just
think it's nice for them

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.980
to have somebody to work with.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040
And they've done a
huge range of projects.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.010
I let them do whatever
project they want.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.910
It has to have something
to do with cellular solids.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.680
And some of them
have done, sort of,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.760
analytical things where they've
done numerical finite element

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.010
analysis of some
cellular structure.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.030
Some of them done very
experimental things.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.720
And some have been a lot of fun.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.560
So, for instance,
almost every year

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.850
there are students who
want to work on food foams.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.310
And one year, for example,
there was a group made bread.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.680
And they looked at sort of
the processing of the bread.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.180
And they looked at how
if you used more yeast,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.440
or you let the yeast
rise, or the bread rise

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.200
for longer, how that affected
the cellular structures.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.990
So they sort of
changed the chemistry

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.390
of how they made the bread.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.350
And then they looked at the
micro structure of the bread

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.933
that they got.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.680
I think they even did some
mechanical tests of the bread.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.060
So that was kind of fun.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.900
And I think, probably, the
most interesting project

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.070
any student has done
was on elephants skulls.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.440
So you could imagine an elephant
skull is huge, and it's bony.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.660
So it would be very,
very heavy, if it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.610
didn't have some pores in it.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.500
And elephant skulls,
it turns out,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.120
have some very
large pores in them.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.375
I think partly to reduce
the weight of the skull,

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.500
and the head, and the bone.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.976
The neck has to, kind
of, carry it all.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:30.350
So these two
students came to me.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.933
And they said they
had heard somewhere

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.140
or they'd read somewhere that
these pores in the elephant

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.250
skull had an effect on how
the elephants perceived sound

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.750
and the acoustic transmission of
sound waves through the skull.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.262
And they wanted to do a
project on elephant skulls.

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:49.720
So I was kind of
intrigued by this.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.230
I love all natural
history kinds of things.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.550
And I've worked
before with people

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.620
at Harvard's Museum of
Comparative Zoology, where

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.540
they have bones.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.390
They have stuffed bodies.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.980
They have all kinds
of animals over there.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.750
And I called up a
colleague over there,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.282
and it turned out they had
elephant skulls over there.

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.740
So I went with one
of the students.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.610
And it was an attic
of the building,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.720
this kind of dingy place.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.180
And there was this huge room.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.160
And it was full
of elephant bones.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.184
And they had several
skulls, which are

00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:19.350
like the size of this table.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.891
They're huge.

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:21.080
They're this big.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.580
And some of the
skulls were cracked.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.840
And you could see these
big pores in the skulls.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.240
And then the students
found out that University

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.960
of Texas at Austin has CT
scans, Computed Tomography

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.600
scans of all sorts of bones.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.730
And sure enough, they had
elephant skulls scanned.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.820
And so they got a
three-dimensional

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.170
representation of
the elephant skull

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.860
through this University of
Texas at Austin program.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.790
And then they used that as
input to a 3D printing set up.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.920
So they 3D printed a sort of
mimic of the elephant skull

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.670
with some ceramic powder.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.230
And they made a skull
was about this big.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.920
And then they wanted to look at
the acoustic properties of it.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.795
So what they did was
they suspended the skull

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:04.570
from a string.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.420
And they had a speaker, and
the speaker had a sound.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.940
And they put an
accelerometer on the skull.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.430
And they measured the
vibration of the skull.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.980
And then to compare it with the
skull that didn't have these

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.480
pores.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.370
And they got the CT
image from Austin.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.254
And they 3D printed
this dolphin skull.

00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:23.420
And they did the same thing.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.040
They suspended the
skull from as a thread.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.764
And they measured the vibration.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:29.430
And they could show--
and I've forgotten

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.013
the details of their results--
but they could show, basically,

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.760
that the two skulls had
a different frequency

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.470
response to the vibrations.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.080
And they thought maybe part
of it was because the pores.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.730
So these two sections
here are two sections

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.120
of their 3D printed
elephant skull.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.910
I don't have the entire thing.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.390
But you can see this is the
orbit, where the eyes would

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.790
have gone in here.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.430
And if I turn it over
and you look inside,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.690
you can see these pores in here.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.730
And also if you
look at this section

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.490
lower down on the skull, you can
see this whole porous structure

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.800
here, as well.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.020
And if we flip it over there's
a little bit more over there.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.665
So that was probably the
most intriguing project

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.090
that the students did
as part of this course.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.190
That was quite something.
