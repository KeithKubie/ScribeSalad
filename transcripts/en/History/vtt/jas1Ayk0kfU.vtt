00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.540
NARRATOR: 554 solar days
after the Mars Curiosity Rover

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.500
touched down, it
beams its latest

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.830
high-resolution
panoramic photographs

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
of the Mars landscape to Earth.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.670
Upon inspection, amateur
archaeologists announce

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.750
a startling discovery--

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.750
what appears to be an
effigy located at the gap

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.540
resembling a human statue.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
The find is just
one of the dozens

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.540
of strange earth-like objects
cited in the Rover images,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.380
including a
sarcophagus, a Buddha

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.170
statue, and even a cross.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.880
The Rover images are
generally fairly close up,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.670
and it is possible
to spot things

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.750
like statue heads
and stone blocks,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.040
sometimes with writing
on carvings in them.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.290
It's such a shame they do so
much to destroy these images.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.620
But basically, what they
do is the resize them down

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.250
so that the details are lost.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.960
But, because I've worked in
photographic restoration,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.620
I know how to do it.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.290
All I've done with this is
actually enhanced the contrast

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.080
and sharpened it a little bit.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.710
The details I noticed first were
particularly the eye and nose

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.710
details on the front of the
statue on the left here,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.120
with a very quite
clear mouth structure,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.420
and what looks like
an ear just here.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.880
And you have a long,
narrow, elongated cone

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.380
head shape to the statue.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.620
Now, this may well be
an elaborate headdress

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.460
on this statue here, which
seems to be broken off,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.080
but it's hard to say for sure.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.290
I mean, this is a damaged
statue buried up to its chin,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.250
and there's probably
a lot more of it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.170
buried just below in the sand.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.830
But you can actually see quite
clearly the sort of thing

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.750
you would expect to find
somewhere like a Central

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.750
or South America.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.080
NARRATOR: Might there actually
be ruins of a lost civilization

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.920
scattered across the
Martian landscape,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.330
ruins that mirror those that
exist on our own planet?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.920
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.330
and propose that this is one
of many artifacts on Mars

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.540
that seem to have
counterparts on our Earth.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.710
Certain structures on Mars
may be completely related

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.960
to structures here on earth.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.540
On Mars, we have structures
that look like pyramids.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.040
There are standing stones
and Stonehenge-type

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.330
of structures on Mars.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.960
There's also a structure on
Mars that looks like a Sphinx.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.500
MALE SPEAKER: Around Cydonia,
there are many, many objects,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.380
including an area called The
City, where the so-called face

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.120
on Mars is located.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.040
There's a massive
pentagonal pyramid.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.000
There's a cluster of
other pyramid objects

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.710
that are nearby.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.420
And one of the things that's
really interesting about The

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.710
City is that some people have
pointed out that if you take

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.080
the apex of all of the pyramids
structures there-- and there

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.750
are a number of them--

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.920
that they basically match
the layout of the Pleiades.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.880
Now, this is something that
we've seen here on Earth.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.710
We've seen various ancient
architectural monuments

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.040
that are also laid out to
reflect the constellation

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.000
of the Pleiades.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.750
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
Is it possible

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.710
that the structures on Mars are
real and of artificial origin?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.210
That is something where all of
science says no, impossible.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.750
Well, is it really?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.210
Water on Mars,
impossible, right?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.080
No.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.830
It has been proven.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.250
So we have to ask ourselves,
what civilization built this,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.380
and what happened to them?

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.120
And some have
suggested that they

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.120
actually escaped Mars
and came to earth

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.960
to ensure their survival.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.960
WILLIAM HENRY: When we look to
these extraordinary structures

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.120
on Earth similar to what
we're now seeing on Mars,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.040
it makes you wonder, did
our ancient extraterrestrial

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.710
ancestors teach humans how
to build these monuments,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.460
knowing that one day we would
rediscover our roots on Mars

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.380
and be able to match up what
we've done on Earth with what

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.040
we had already done on Mars?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.580
NARRATOR: Might the various
structures and artifacts

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
found on the surface
of Mars really

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.960
be evidence of a past Martian
civilization, a civilization

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.920
that was recreated on Earth?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.000
If so, why would NASA try
to hide this connection,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.330
and might there be more that
the public isn't being told?
