00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:03.139
The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.529
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.819
And sorry I could not travel both

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.149
And be one traveler,

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:33.419
long I stood and looked down 
one as far as I could

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.559
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.809
Then took the other, as just as fair,

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:53.799
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.172
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:14.464
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:25.034
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:30.516
I doubted if I should ever come back.

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:37.736
I shall be telling this with a sigh

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:47.252
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:56.229
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
