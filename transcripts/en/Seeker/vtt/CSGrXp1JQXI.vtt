Dnews audience member, Stephan, wants to
know, "Why do men have nipples?"

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.830
to which science says, "Psh. Why not?"

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.300
Hey friends, Laci Green here with a
very important topic,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.619
male nipples.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.199
Men don't feed babies with
their boobs

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.320
so why are they there?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.430
The basics go like this.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.039
In the womb, a sperm meets the egg and a zygote
is formed.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.640
All your genetic information is tightly
packed into 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.630
One of those pairs determines your sex.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.340
XX for females and XY for males.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.430
There are other sex chromosome pairings like

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.090
XXY and XXYY,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.660
but hey, that's a whole other video.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.360
The other 22 pairs of chromosomes

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.110
provide the genetic blueprints to make a
human being.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.510
Information about how to form your feet, and
your heart, and your eyes, and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.610
your nipples.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.960
In the third or fourth week,
you're a little embryo, chilling in the womb,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.590
and that's when the nipples begin to develop.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.390
It starts with the milk line, which
runs from your armpit

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.580
down through your breasts to your genitals.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.180
Typically only two nipples are arranged on
the milk line,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.660
but as many as seven can line up and come
hang out.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.040
For most people, these don't develop any further,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.540
but sometimes they do and people are
born with more than two nipples.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.280
You can also have little remnants that
looks like moles, but they're actually

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
just teensy embryo nipples.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.940
Now not only do you get nipples but also
get milk ducts.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.480
At this point, everyone's looking pretty
female. That is until

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.180
the eighth week when the hormones start
pumping.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.830
For males testosterone mean the penis starts
to develop out from the clitoris. The

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.970
scrotum develops out from the labia.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.000
Things like where you'll get body hair,
and how deep your voice will be is determined.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.120
You already have nipples and milk ducts, but
the hormones determine if you'll develop more

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.890
breast tissue.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.920
This happens much later though during the
next hormonal uproar in your lifetime,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.400
puberty.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.659
So if males do have nipples and mammary glands,

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.220
couldn't they produce milk?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.340
Aha! Yes they could, but they're missing the
proper hormones to do so.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.500
Hormone are the law of the land. No
hormones means no milk.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Sometimes on rare occasions, males will
spontanesouly produce milk later in life.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.310
It's called Galactorrhea,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610
which is a pretty epic name to be honest.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.980
Sometimes that happens in infants
too, right after they're born.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.810
When doctors can figure out the cause,
it's usually a hormonal thing:

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.450
not enough testosterone, extra estrogen,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.890
extra prolactin, which is the milk producing
hormone.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.170
But a nice chunk of cases, scientists don't
know why.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.510
It's just one of those cool nature things
that remind you,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.200
sex isn't quite as clear cut as it seems to
be.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.430
Thanks for joining me, guys.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.920
Do you have a question for me, Anthony, or
Trace?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.860
You should leave it in the comments down below
and hey, maybe we'll make a video for you.
