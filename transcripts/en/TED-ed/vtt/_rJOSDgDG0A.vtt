00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.242
The universe is bustling with matter
and energy.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.180
Even in the vast apparent emptiness
of intergalactic space,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.901
there's one hydrogen atom per cubic meter.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:17.151
That's not the mention 
a barrage of particles

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:19.251
and electromagnetic radiation

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.937
passing every which way from stars,
galaxies, and into black holes.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:26.822
There's even radiation left over
from the Big Bang.

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:30.782
So is there such thing as a total
absence of everything?

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:32.553
This isn't just a thought experiment.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.011
Empty spaces, or vacuums,
are incredibly useful.

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:38.492
Inside our homes, 
most vacuum cleaners work

00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:42.861
by using a fan to create a low-pressure
relatively empty area

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.662
that sucks matter in to fill the void.

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:47.242
But that's far from empty.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:49.742
There's still plenty of matter
bouncing around.

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:52.702
Manufacturers rely on more thorough,
sealed vacuums

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.603
for all sorts of purposes.

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:57.422
That includes vacuum-packed food
that stays fresh longer,

00:00:57.422 --> 00:01:02.432
and the vacuums inside early light bulbs
that protected filaments from degrading.

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:05.383
These vacuums are generally created
with some version

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:07.473
of what a vacuum cleaner does

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:10.264
using high-powered pumps that create
enough suction

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:12.983
to remove as many stray atoms as possible.

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:15.223
But the best of these industrial processes

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:17.345
tends to leave hundreds 
of millions of atoms

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:19.264
per cubic centimeter of space.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.345
That isn't empty enough
for scientists who work on experiments,

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.204
like the Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:27.673
where particle beams need to circulate
at close to the speed of light

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:31.155
for up to ten hours without hitting
any stray atoms.

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.216
So how do they create a vacuum?

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:36.506
The LHC's pipes are made of materials,
like stainless steel,

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.885
that don't release any 
of their own molecules

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:42.725
and are lined with a special coating
to absorb stray gases.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.066
Raising the temperature 
to 200 degrees Celsius

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.876
burns off any moisture,

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:50.976
and hundreds of vacuum pumps take
two weeks to trap enough gas and debris

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:54.876
out of the pipes for the collider's
incredibly sensitive experiments.

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.066
Even with all this,

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.436
the Large Hadron Collider
isn't a perfect vacuum.

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:01.536
In the emptiest places, there are still

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:05.136
about 100,000 particles 
per cubic centimeter.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:09.445
But let's say an experiment like that
could somehow get every last atom out.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:13.066
There's still an unfathomably huge
amount of radiation all around us

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.416
that can pass right through
the walls.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:18.395
Every second, about 50 muons
from cosmic rays,

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.635
10 million neutrinos coming directly
from the Big Bang,

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:25.207
30 million photons from the cosmic
microwave background,

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:29.786
and 300 trillion neutrinos
from the Sun pass through your body.

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:32.777
It is possible to shield
vacuum chambers with substances,

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:33.898
including water,

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:36.117
that absorb and reflect this radiation,

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:37.877
except for neutrinos.

00:02:37.877 --> 00:02:40.220
Let's say you've somehow removed
all of the atoms

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.428
and blocked all of the radiation.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.517
Is the space now totally empty?

00:02:44.517 --> 00:02:45.683
Actually, no.

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:49.163
All space is filled with what 
physicists call quantum fields.

00:02:49.163 --> 00:02:51.634
What we think of as subatomic particles,

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:53.828
electrons and photons and their relatives,

00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:56.608
are actually vibrations 
in a quantum fabric

00:02:56.608 --> 00:02:58.807
that extends throughout the universe.

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.899
And because of a physical law called
the Heisenberg Principle,

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.888
these fields never stop oscillating,

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:06.279
even without any particles 
to set off the ripples.

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.659
They always have some minimum fluctuation
called a vacuum fluctuation.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.309
This means they have energy,
a huge amount of it.

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.660
Because Einstein's equations tell us
that mass and energy are equivalent,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.438
the quantum fluctuations in every
cubic meter of space

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:24.249
have an energy that corresponds
to a mass of about four protons.

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.266
In other words, the seemingly empty space
inside your vacuum

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:30.491
would actually weigh a small amount.

00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.864
Quantum fluctuations have existed since
the earliest moments of the universe.

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:36.690
In the moments after the Big Bang,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.570
as the universe expanded,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.061
they were amplified and stretched out
to cosmic scales.

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.572
Cosmologists believe that these original
quantum fluctuations

00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:48.241
were the seeds of everything
we see today:

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:51.460
galaxies and the entire large scale
structure of the universe,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.681
as well as planets and solar systems.

00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:58.682
They're also the center of one of the
greatest scientific mysteries of our time

00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:01.010
because according to the current theories,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.561
the quantum fluctuations 
in the vacuum of space

00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:08.571
ought to have 120 orders of magnitude
more energy than we observe.

00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:10.582
Solving the mystery of that missing energy

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:14.142
may entirely rewrite our understanding
of physics and the universe.
