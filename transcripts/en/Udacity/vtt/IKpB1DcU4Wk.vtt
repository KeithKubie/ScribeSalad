00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.150
There is no cloud,
it's just someone else's computer.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.840
This is a meme that has been floating
around the internet for a while and

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.300
it's true and it's fine,
realizing that can actually help.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.600
It's just a computer.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.420
So you can do the same things
you already know how to do,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.850
like run virtual machines on it.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.490
But since it's someone else's computer,
they will take care of the hardware.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.930
While there are some companies that
maintain their own private clouds,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.090
most people use a cloud
that is run by others.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540
There are a lot of
options to choose from.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.670
Large public cloud providers,
small specialized providers,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.710
open source projects that
let you host your own cloud.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.550
It's hard to pick what to use.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.720
Let's explore the most popular options.
