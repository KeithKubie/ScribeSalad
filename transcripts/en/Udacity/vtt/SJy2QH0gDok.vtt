00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] Here's a typical group of friends in middle school,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and some of the people are popular, some of them might not be.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first step to deciding who's popular is looking at who has a lot of friends.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's draw in some links that show who's a friend,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and friendship links are one directional,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
just because Alice is friends with Bob doesn't mean that Bob is friends with Alice.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll draw our links as arrows so this means this person, we'll call him Bob,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is friends with Alice, and let's say Alice has many friends,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and let's say Bob is also friends with this person.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They're friends with each other.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We have lots of friendship links, some of them are bidirectional but not all of them.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We have lots of friendships.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is this enough to decide who's popular?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you went to a school like I did it's not.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Just having a lot of friends is not enough to make you popular.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You have to have the right friends.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You have to be friends with the popular people.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's not enough to have lots of geeky friends say in high school.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You've got to have lots of friends that are popular.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That means the definition of popular isn't just about having lots of friends.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's about having lots of friends who also have lots of friends.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's what makes someone popular.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We could define popularity of a person is the number of people who are friends with the P.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This means the number of links from someone else to that person is their popularity score.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here is Charlie.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There are 1, 2, 3 links into Charlie, so Charlie's popularity score would be 3.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Alice also has 3 links, so her popularity score would also be 3.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Bob only has 1 arrow going to Bob, so his popularity score would be 1.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This isn't a bad way to define popularity, but it's not quite right.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The definition of popularity doesn't just depend on the number of friends you have.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It depends on both the number and the popularity of your friends.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We can change the definition; let's instead define the popularity score of a person T.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now it's going to be the sum of the popularity of all their friends.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We can write that in a mathematical way, so using the sigma means to sum up.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We're going to take each friend that is in the friends of P,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and we're going to sum up the popularity score of the friends.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If the mathematical notation is unfamiliar to you,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we could also write this as pseudo-Python code.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We're thinking of the popularity of a person P.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Let's assume we have a function that gives us the friends so we're going to start with a score of 0.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We're going to loop through the friends, and for each friend,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
we're going to add to P's score the popularity score of the friend,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and we'll return the score as the result.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now you've seen a mathematical definition of popularity.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
You've seen the same thing as code.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm going to ask you a very important quiz question next.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's an easy one to get right if you try twice because there's only 2 answers,

00:03:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but think about it carefully, see if you can get it right the first time.
