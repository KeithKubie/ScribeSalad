00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:11.370
In the last video we began to visually explore the relationship between the number of sessions I attend and my monthly cost given the different plans.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:24.571
So right here, in this blue line we visualized it for the trial plan, and then this orange dotted line we visualized it for the basic plan.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:30.861
And it meets where it intuitively, hopefully represents what we already understood about the different plans.

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:39.858
The trial plan, we don't pay anything upfront and every time we add a session, so every time we move to the right here we move to the right one session.

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:44.375
We add twelve dollars to out cost, we move up by twelve.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:49.635
Add another session, move up by 12, add another session move up by 12.

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:53.302
On the basic plan we did have an upfront cost on 20 dollars

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:57.574
but the line was less steep, we had to pay less for each extra session.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:02.175
Here when we added an extra session we only had to add 8 dollars to our total fees.

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:05.174
Add another session, you only have to add 8 dollars.

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:12.711
So the orange line starts at a higher point but it is less steep, and we see because of that they clearly intersect.

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:17.303
And they intersect right over here.

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:28.595
So my question to you is, "What is the significance of that point of intersection?"

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:30.436
Well lets think about it a little bit.

00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:34.509
How much do each of the plans cost if I only attend one session?

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:43.434
So we see here from the trial plan it will cost us 12 dollars while on the basic plan one session will cost us 28 dollars.

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:48.342
And you don't even have to look at these tables we set up. You can see this visually.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:54.102
So if we go up one session the trial plan is below the basic plan.

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:57.710
If you go up 2 sessions the trial plan is still below the basic plan.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.008
Although they are not as far apart.

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:07.170
Three sessions, still the basic plan is above the trial plan but they are getting closer and closer together.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.345
All the way until you get to this point over here.

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:19.770
This point is essentially the number of sessions, it looks like five sessions,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.930
it looks like the number of sessions regardless of the plan we choose the cost is the same.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.842
It looks like that cost is right around 60 dollars.

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:38.513
Once we go beyond that point, all of a sudden the basic plan becomes cheaper than the trial plan.

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:46.308
It looks like if we were to take 6 sessions the basic plan would give a lower price than the trial plan.

00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:51.932
But how do we actually figure out what this point is, and what number of sessions, and what dollar value?

00:02:51.932 --> 00:02:56.641
I just eyeballed it right now which is useful with these visual graphs.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:02.839
But what if we wanted to get the exact value and the value is 5.1 or 60.25

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:06.342
How do we get the exact same value?

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:16.703
Well, one way to think about it is, were trying to find out s, or the number of sessions, so that regardless of which plan we choose we have the exact same cost.

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:26.507
So if we pick the basic plan our cost is going to be 20 dollars plus 8 times s.

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:37.768
And if we pick the trial plan the cost is going to be 12 times s

00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:43.508
And were trying to find that unknown s where this value is going to be the same as this value.

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:51.769
where that unknown value of sessions, where regardless of which plan i choose i will pay the same price

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.513
so we're curious about the s where 12s is equal to 20 plus 8s.

00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:00.429
So we set up this equation.

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.976
the equation has one unknown and we should be able to solve this.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:06.369
So lets think about how we can do it.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:12.906
What is the first general idea if we want to figure out the unknown s.

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:19.437
There are many ways to approach theses Algebra problems which is what makes them fun

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:24.507
I try to isolate the s on one side of the equation.

00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:27.847
For me, i want to isolate it on the right side of the equation.

00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:28.900
Since i already has this 12s there and this 20 on the left side.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.100
I could have done other things.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.704
So what is the best way to get rid of this 8s from the left side.

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:42.302
Well the easiest thing i can think of is subtract 8s from lefthand side

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:46.437
But i can't just do that, if I do then this equality won't hold.

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:52.369
These things were equal to each other and if i just subtract from one side then the left side wont be equal to the right side

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:59.755
In order for them to be equal i have to do the same thing on the right side

00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:11.678
Once I do that on the left side these two characters negate each other and i am left with 20 on the left side.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:24.181
And on the right i am left with 12s and take away 8s and i am left with 4s.

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:29.514
So it is equal to 4 times s.

00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:34.173
And so now we are pretty close. I just want an s on the right side.

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:40.176
What can I do to this equation, so i can have just an s on the righthand side.

00:05:40.176 --> 00:05:46.702
Well the easiest thing to do is divide both sides by 4

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:49.436
I can't do it just to one side.

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:52.834
When i divide both sides by 4, what do i get for s?

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:56.109
Well on the right hand side 4s divided by 4 is just going to be s.

00:05:56.109 --> 00:06:08.700
And thats going to be equal to 20 divided by 4 which is 5

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.302
So we eyeballed it and it looked like 5 sessions.

00:06:11.302 --> 00:06:17.592
Now we know for sure that at 5 sessions the cost of either plan is going to be the same.

00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:21.173
But what is the cost of either plan?

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:25.103
Well we should be able to go to either plan because the cost will be the same.

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:31.636
So is we look at out trial plan and we say 5 sessions, how much will that cost?

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:35.263
well the cost is going to be 12 times 5

00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:44.640
so the cost is going to be equal to 12,12 times 5 which is going to be 60 dollars

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.102
the cost is going to be 60 dollars.

00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:53.309
So my question to you is do we even have to try out the 5 in this equation right over here?

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:56.968
See what it would cost under the basic plan.

00:06:56.968 --> 00:07:04.929
Well we wouldn't because the whole reason we got 5 sessions is because we said this is the number f sessions where we get the same cost

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:08.342
For the basic plan or the trial plan

00:07:08.342 --> 00:07:11.091
but if you're curious i do encourage you to find out.

00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:15.375
Substitute a 5 in for s and see that you get

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:21.708
you'll get 20 plus 8 time 5 which is 20 plus 40 which is 60 dollars

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:27.510
So with either plan at 5 sessions the total cost is going to be 60 dollars.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.701
Then is you add sessions after that,

00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:36.845
Because the trial plan is more steep each incremental session after that is going to cost you more.

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:40.838
You start to see that the trial plan begins to get more and more expensive.

00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:44.503
So going back to my question of which gym membership i'm going to use.

00:07:44.503 --> 00:07:46.339
All of a sudden i have an interesting answer

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:51.344
If i plan on attending on average less that 5 sessions

00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:59.091
it probably make sense, less that 5 sessions a month, it makes sense for me to use the trial plan.

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:05.044
If i plan to attend more that 5 sessions a month the basic plan is going to be cheaper.

00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:09.044
If i plan to attend exactly 5 sessions a month it doesn't matter which plan i acutally use
