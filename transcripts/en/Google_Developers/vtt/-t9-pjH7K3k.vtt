00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.340
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.664
for January 28, 2014.

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:10.580
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.830
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.255
on the set and off.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:16.379
Starting the week's
festivities, we head to London,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.530
where Mano Marks invites GDE
Stephen Gray-- no relation,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.690
so far as I'm aware-- to show
us how he added ground overlays

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.380
and weather using
the Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.350
Steve's app uses a tile overlay
to tone down the Maps styling

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.400
and remove Map labels, giving
a nice and clean background

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.681
for weather data.

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:34.805
But the Maps team wasn't
done with a single episode

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.000
here on GDL.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.310
Paul Saxman covered the
basics of adding markers

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.570
to your Map using the
Google Maps Android API V2.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.516
So don't miss either
show, geo-developers.

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:46.390
We then head up the road
from our main campus

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.090
to the Google San Francisco
office, where Chrome guru Peter

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.340
Lubbers hosted the San
Francisco HTML5 user group.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.170
This week's event
focused on WebGL.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.130
Peter also put on a microphone
to be part of the second Office

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.370
Hour session for Udacity CS256,
joining Chris Wilson and Sean

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280
Bennett to tackle
questions around lessons 4

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.440
and 5 in this fast-paced
mobile web development course.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.860
We record every single one
so you never fall behind.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.120
We then invited Open
Source maven Cat Allman

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960
to the studio, who interviewed
Googler Jeremy Allison to talk

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980
on the Samba project,
the standard Windows

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.060
interoperability suite of
programs for Linux and Unix.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.360
And our studios aren't
open to just Googlers.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.750
Mamie Rheingold interviewed
4 young coding member

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.640
of diy.org, an online
community for kids

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.020
to learn skills,
discover cool projects,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.760
and meet other awesome kids.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.651
Hear how they learned to
code and get inspired.

00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:37.900
And up in Seattle, where
they know just a thing or two

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.330
about clouds, Laurence
Moroney and Brian Dorsey

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.130
of the Cloud Platform
team took questions

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.810
on what Cloud
means to customers,

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.590
and how Google offerings
could get even better.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.510
From New York, Ibrahim
Ulykaya took a look

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.240
at best practices
for YouTube's APIs

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.770
on iOS, including YouTube
Direct Lite for iOS.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.917
Then Amy Quispe and
Eric Leichtenslag

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.750
took the time to walk
through the new Google

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.140
mobile ads features in
Google Play services

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.460
and explain how to migrate away
for the standalone AdMob SDK.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.180
The Google Glass team took some
time recently to experiment

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.461
with games on Glass.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.919
The games are quick
and fun, and we

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.750
hope they inspire
our Glass developers

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.550
to start their own projects.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.880
Go to g.co/glassminigames
to find out more.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.740
And Dart Flight
School is coming soon.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.190
You can learn Dart at one of
these awesome events taking

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.430
place around the globe.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.930
You'll learn Dart and get
to explore great frameworks

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.460
like Polymer and Angular.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.270
Go to dartlang.org and
search for flight school

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.940
to sign up now.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.760
And every year,
Google Code-In finds

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.930
amazing teenage programmers
from around the world

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.070
and awards them a four-day trip
to Google in Mountain View.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.980
