00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.446
This time, we need to use the output of 
the function g of x, so the square root

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:08.900
of 4 minus x squared, as the input into f 
of x.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.910
That means we need to square the 
expression for g of x and then subtract 4.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.329
Let's see what happens. 
Squaring a square root just gives us

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.820
what's underneath the radical sign. 
So we get four minus x squared minus 4.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.880
It means out answer is just negative x 
squared.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.282
Now if you want to eventually grap 
composite functions, we're going to need

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:32.481
to consider their domains. 
Before I ask you what the domain of f of

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:36.110
g of x is, let's do a quick review of 
domain.
