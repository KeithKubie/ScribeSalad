00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.089
The ability to drink milk throughout our lifetime,
known as lactose tolerance, evolved about

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.099
10 thousand years ago; over the last century
and a half, the average height of a human

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.230
being has increased by roughly 10 centimeters;
and within the last 6 and a half decades the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.680
global life span has shot up nearly 20 years
largely thanks to science.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.650
Breakthroughs in science have propelled our
species forward - in fact, National Geographic

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
and GE’s new series ‘Breakthrough’ covers
some cutting edge innovations that are happening,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.719
today; from biology and technology merging,
to solutions for our water crisis. But, what

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.790
will humanity look like in 1000 years?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.600
It’s already hard enough to remember a world
without smartphones, but scientists predict

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.890
that within the next few decades, computers
will reach the computational speed of the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.010
human brain.
Not only will they be able to speak and interact,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.379
but listen and remember. This also leads to
a philosophy known as transhumanism. In the

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.000
future, nanobots (or tiny robots) will be
subtly integrated into our bodies enhancing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
our own abilities! No longer will we be limited
by our own physiology, but truly become a

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.840
mixture of biology and machine on the inside.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.290
Ever heard of ‘Utility Fog’? Imagine a
cloud of countless microscopic robots which

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.270
can be rearranged into virtually any configuration
nearly instantaneously. Buildings could be

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.760
constructed as necessary, and disassembled
when space was needed for something else.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.110
Picture your house disassembling when you
leave in the morning so that the space can

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.950
be used for something else!
With increased urbanization and globalization

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.170
the 7000 languages that are spoken globally
today will likely dip under 100.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.850
As we move even further into the future, the
world’s rising temperature and accompanying

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.050
deterioration in the protective ozone layer
will play a major role. Added UV radiation

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.340
reaching the planet may create a scenario
where darker skin becomes an evolutionary

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.690
advantage, as it protects against UV damage.
Increasing temperatures may also affect our

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.280
size; taller and thinner bodies would be better
at dissipating excess body heat, as it creates

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.440
the best body surface area to volume ratio.
Of course, these types of changes take 10s

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
or hundreds of thousands of years and will
depend on our ability to avoid or protect

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.280
ourselves from nature.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.500
New traits from mutations may also arise - perhaps
a new eye colour, or unique abilities! Even

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.030
today, one man has been documented with the
ability to consume and digest nearly anything,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.890
including metal, glass and even toxic chemicals
due to a genetic mutation. Others live with

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.540
a condition called tetrachromacy, where they
can see 100 times more colours than the rest

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.780
of us. But these traits are only likely to
persist if they have some selective advantage

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.560
- so don’t expect a mutant like school-for-the-gifted
any time soon.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.370
But artificial selection or human influenced
changes will likely drive most of our evolution.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.450
We’ll modify our babies genes before birth
to eliminate diseases they may carry, or include

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.710
desirable traits for our offspring. But, while
it may make us smarter, stronger, and better

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.130
looking, such genetic similarity or lack of
human diversity leaves room for a single new

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.900
disease of the future to wipe out the entire
human race.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.510
In the words of Stephen Hawking “Sooner
or later disasters such as an asteroid collision

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.900
or a nuclear war could wipe us all out. But
once we spread out into space and establish

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.710
independent colonies, our future should be
safe.” Space colonization, it seems, is

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.470
an inevitable part of our future.
At the end of it all, we may even conquer

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.090
death by scanning our brains - atom by atom
- and transferring that information into computers.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.180
In this way we could travel at the speed of
light as information patterns, unrestricted

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.660
by our bodies, and requiring no food. Where
our current human generational cycle takes

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.620
around 20 years, a digital individual could
replicate themselves in seconds or minutes.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.270
It’s a brave new world out there - and yet,
you may be surprised by some of the incredible

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.910
science that is happening today! That’s
what the show “Breakthrough” - which airs

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.770
on November 1st at 9pm - attempts to highlight.
The science of today, that tomorrow’s future

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.459
will be based upon. It’s a really fantastic
series of 6 episodes on the National Geographic

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.050
Channel. Be sure to check it out, and let
us know what you think.
