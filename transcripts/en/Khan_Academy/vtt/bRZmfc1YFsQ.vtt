00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.650
In this video, we will
cover the power rule,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.550
which really simplifies
our life when

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.540
it comes to taking
derivatives, especially

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.630
derivatives of polynomials.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.030
You are probably
already familiar

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.090
with the definition
of a derivative,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.560
limit is delta x
approaches 0 of f

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.820
of x plus delta x minus f of
x, all of that over delta x.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.460
And it really just
comes out of trying

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.674
to find the slope of a tangent
line at any given point.

00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:28.590
But we're going to see
what the power rule is.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.710
It simplifies our life.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.890
We won't have to take these
sometimes complicated limits.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.060
And we're not going to
prove it in this video,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.499
but we'll hopefully get
a sense of how to use it.

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.040
And in future videos, we'll get
a sense of why it makes sense

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.530
and even prove it.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.910
So the power rule just tells us
that if I have some function,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.670
f of x, and it's equal
to some power of x, so x

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.710
to the n power, where
n does not equal 0.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.210
So n can be anything.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290
It can be positive, a
negative, it could be-- it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.960
does not have to be an integer.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.150
The power rule tells us that
the derivative of this, f prime

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.460
of x, is just going
to be equal to n,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.490
so you're literally bringing
this out front, n times x,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.040
and then you just decrement
the power, times x

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.889
to the n minus 1 power.

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.430
So let's do a couple
of examples just

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.640
to make sure that that
actually makes sense.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.360
So let's ask ourselves,
well let's say that f of x

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.420
was equal to x squared.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.490
Based on the power
rule, what is f

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.820
prime of x going to be equal to?

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.550
Well, in this
situation, our n is 2.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.440
So we bring the 2 out front.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.910
2 times x to the
2 minus 1 power.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.800
So that's going to be 2 times
x to the first power, which

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
is just equal to 2x.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480
That was pretty straightforward.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.210
Let's think about
the situation where,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.150
let's say we have g of x is
equal to x to the third power.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.280
What is g prime of x going
to be in this scenario?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.236
Well, n is 3, so we just
literally pattern match here.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:13.610
This is-- you're
probably finding

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.260
this shockingly straightforward.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.740
So this is going to be 3 times
x to the 3 minus 1 power,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.995
or this is going to be
equal to 3x squared.

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:25.620
And we're done.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.590
In the next video
we'll think about

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.015
whether this
actually makes sense.

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:29.640
Let's do one more
example, just to show

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.620
it doesn't have to
necessarily apply

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.660
to only these kind
of positive integers.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.390
We could have a
scenario where maybe we

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.470
have h of x. h of x is equal
to x to the negative 100 power.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.450
The power rule tells
us that h prime of x

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.770
would be equal to what?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.030
Well n is negative 100,
so it's negative 100x

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.820
to the negative
100 minus 1, which

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.450
is equal to negative
100x to the negative 101.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.890
Let's do one more.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.260
Let's say we had z of x.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.013
z of x is equal to x
to the 2.571 power.

00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:16.180
And we are concerned with
what is z prime of x?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.890
Well once again, power
rule simplifies our life,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.000
n it's 2.571, so
it's going to be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.760
2.571 times x to the
2.571 minus 1 power.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.632
So it's going to
be equal to-- let

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.480
me make sure I'm not falling
off the bottom of the page--

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.734
2.571 times x to
the 1.571 power.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:41.900
Hopefully, you enjoyed that.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.175
And in the next few
videos, we will not only

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:46.050
expose you to more
properties of derivatives,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.341
we'll get a sense for why
the power rule at least makes

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:49.080
intuitive sense.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.660
And then also prove the
power rule for a few cases.
