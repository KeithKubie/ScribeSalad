00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.270
SPEAKER: In this video,
we'll discuss how to handle

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.270
a cancelled subscription and
how to help a user restore

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.310
their subscription if they want.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.220
Before we begin, you'll want
to have real-time developer

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.960
notification set up.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.450
To learn how to do this,
be sure to check out

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.570
our real-time developer
notifications video.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.920
With real-time
developer notifications,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.280
you'll receive a notification
when a subscription is

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.240
cancelled or restored.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.100
After receiving
this notification,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.290
call the Google
Play Developer API

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.320
from your server to record the
new subscription information.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.880
When a subscription
is cancelled,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.970
the user retains access to
your service until the end

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.960
of the billing period.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.690
During this time, you
can offer the user

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.730
the option to restore
their subscription

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.170
before the expiration.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.770
You need to enable this
functionality via the Google

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.630
Play console.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.200
Sign into your Play console,
and select your app.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.670
On the left menu, click Store
Presence, In-app Products.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.940
Select the Subscriptions tab,
and expand the Subscription

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.840
Settings section.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.440
Check the box Allow Users
to Restore Subscriptions.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.110
Then provide a message in
your app that tells the user

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.240
that their subscription has
expired or will expire soon.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.570
Be sure to include a deep link
to the Google Play Subscription

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.600
Center in this message so they
can restore their subscription

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.470
or fix their payment method.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.680
For more information on
setting up deep links,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680
visit the link onscreen.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.540
The message should be respectful
of the user's decision

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.270
to cancel, so it should
be easy to ignore

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.411
and easy for the user
to permanently dismiss

00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:57.910
this notice.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.110
