00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.140
Alright.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; So it's very cool that we have all this social functionality. I like that.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; what should we do next?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.240
&gt;&gt; So, similar to how we have this, You Can Make a Post,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.120
or Post a File, or Create a New Task. We can create our

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.210
own actions that we can surface in Chatter, to make our lives easier

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.780
to do, you know, a bunch of things that we're doing all the time.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.180
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.180
&gt;&gt; Using Chatter. And so, the cool thing about doing that is when we do these

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.970
actions, it actually posts to Chatter at the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.870
same time. So we can track when these actions

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.330
are happening.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.540
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.450
&gt;&gt; So, what's something that we might want to do, related to

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.190
stage? Something that might happen pretty often in a music festival.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.790
&gt;&gt; I mean, we might want to change the bookings of the bands, or

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.350
something like that. Update, so one of our set times. Can we do that?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.640
&gt;&gt; So, updating set times, no. Creating set times, yes.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.080
&gt;&gt; Okay. Why, what's the difference?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.550
&gt;&gt; So, updating set time would be something

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.090
that we would do from the set time record.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.373
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.170
&gt;&gt; But we can create set times.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.364
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:54.064
&gt;&gt; From the stage itself.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:54.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.
