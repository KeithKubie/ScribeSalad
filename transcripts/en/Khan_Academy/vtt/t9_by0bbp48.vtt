00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.680
All right, we're now on problem
number 15 on page 463.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.050
Let's see, they have a chart.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.010
And it says, city and noon
temperature in Farenheit.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.260
So I'll just write
temperature.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:42.670
And city A is 50 degrees, B is
33, C is 27, D is t degrees, E

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:55.870
is 68 degrees, F is 44 degrees,
and G is 40 degrees.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.610
All right.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.100
Now, so the question says, the
table above shows the noon

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.580
temperature for seven cities
designated A through G.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.890
All right, if the median noon
temperature-- so the median--

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.800
is 40 degrees, then the noon
temperature for city D could

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.120
be any of the following
except?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.420
So the median means what?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.920
It means the middle number.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.680
It means if we were to rearrange
all of these numbers

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.190
from smallest to highest, the
40 would be the middle.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.140
So let's rearrange all the
numbers, I guess, except for t

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.110
from smallest to highest,
because we

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.450
don't know what t is.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:44.630
So let's see, the smallest
is 27, then we go to 33.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.240
Then we have 40.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.790
Then we have 44.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.310
Then we have 50.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.950
Then we have 68, right?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.800
I should have written six
numbers down, and I wrote six

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.910
numbers down, right?

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.140
And they're saying
the median is 40.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.610
So in order for the median to
be 40, this needs to be the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.050
middle number, right?

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.240
The middle number.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.070
That means there need to be just
as many numbers smaller

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.000
than 40 as there are numbers
larger than 40, right?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.460
Just the way I drew it right
now, it doesn't look like the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.060
median, right?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690
Because there's only two numbers
less than it and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.140
there's three numbers
greater that it.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.470
So I think you see where
this is going.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.750
t has to be someplace here.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.420
t has to be someplace less than
40 degrees in order for

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.890
40 to be the median number.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.030
So let's see, it says-- and
actually, t could be less than

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.950
or equal to 40.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.750
Because even if we had another
40 here, then 40 would still

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.770
be the median, right?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.850
Because if you put all the
numbers in order-- you know,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.870
you have seven numbers-- the
fourth highest number would

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.560
still be 40.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.310
So t has to be less than
or equal to 40.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640
So if we look at the choices,
A is 29, well

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.050
that satisfies it.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.260
B is 35, that satisfies it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.220
C is 39, satisfies it.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.440
D is 40.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.120
And then we look at E.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110
E is 42, so that does
not satisfy it, so

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.650
our choice is E.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.600
All right, problem number 14.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.780
This one looks exciting,
and I will do it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.220
in an exciting color.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.420
So let me see if I
can draw this.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.290
So I have a line on the top and
then I have a line that

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.240
goes straight down like that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.330
And then this thing goes
something like this and it

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.570
goes something like this.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.580
Can I draw this right,
draw this even.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.460
And then it goes-- well, close
enough, I think, to what they

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.490
have on the drawing.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.850
And let me fill in all
the information.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.790
So it says these are right
angles, this is a right angle.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.400
The length of this is 6.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.420
The length of this is 6.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.110
The length of this is 6.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.680
And then it tells us that
these are 30 degrees.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.750
And it says, what is the
perimeter of the figure above?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.190
So in order to figure out the
perimeter-- we you know this

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.060
side, we know this side, we know
this side-- we need to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.540
figure out these two
sides, right?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.790
These two sides.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.080
So once we know those,
then we're set.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.460
And you could do some fancy
things here if you wanted to

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.600
go in the wrong direction.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.490
But you'd get the right answer,
you could make a 30,

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.200
60, 90 triangle here and here
and figure out this side and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.070
then figure out the hypotenuse
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.030
But the real trick of this is
just kind of seeing the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.020
negative image here.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.020
Trying to see kind of what
hasn't been drawn.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.430
And I'll show you what I mean.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.160
If we draw-- let's just draw
a little line here.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280
I think now you'll start
to see what I'm doing.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.960
If we have a line here,
what's this angle?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.170
Well, this whole thing is a
right angle, it's 90 degrees,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.340
so this angle would
be 60, right?

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.330
And so would this angle.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.130
This angle would also
be 60 degrees.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.630
And so would this
angle, right?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.000
Because they have to add up to
180, and if two of them are

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.580
60, the third one's
going to be 60.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.580
So what do we know about this
triangle right here?

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.000
Well, it's an equilateral
triangle.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.520
All the sides are the
same because all the

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.990
angles are the same.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.220
Well, we know one
of the sides.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.470
We know this side we made up
because it's going to be the

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.060
same length as this
side up here.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.010
So this is going to be 6.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.480
Well, if that side is 6, then
all of the sides of this

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.400
equilateral triangle are going
to have to be 6, right?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.950
And then we're done.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.610
Now we just have to add
up all the sides.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.340
So it's 6 plus 6 plus 6
plus 6 plus 6, right?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.090
We ignore this one.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.010
This isn't part of the
perimeter, the perimeters are

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.170
the purple sides, so it's one,
two, three, four, five, sixes,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.180
so 5 times 6 equal to 30.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.430
Choice D.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:15.930
All right, problem number 15.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:28.420
m is the greatest prime
factor of 38.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:40.690
n is the greatest prime
factor of 100.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.780
What is the value of m plus n?

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.220
Well, without knowing a trick
here-- a trick hasn't just

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.440
jumped into my head-- let's just
try to factor them, do

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.690
the prime factorization.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.350
And actually the easiest way to
do the prime factorization

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.930
is, well-- look, we want to get
the greatest prime factor,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.020
and this one is actually
pretty easy.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.430
Because you have two, and
then it's 2 times what?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.670
2 times 19.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.240
We're done.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.350
That was pretty easy, right?

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.140
2 times 19, 19 is the greatest
prime factor of 38.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.130
100 might take us a little
bit more time, right?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.740
Because it's 2 times 50.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.070
100 is 2 times 50.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.120
50 is 2 times 25.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.920
25 is 5 times 5.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.290
Actually, that didn't take
us much time, either.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.520
This is just a straight-- I
thought there might be a trick

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.860
here-- but this is just
a straight prime

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.910
factorization problem.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.620
So the greatest prime
factor of 100 is 5.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:48.420
You add them together, 19
plus 5 is equal to 24.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.090
And that is choice C.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.490
OK, let's see if I have time to
fit in problem number 16.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.030
Otherwise I'll do it
in the next video.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.820
Line L has a positive slope
and passes-- let me draw

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.220
coordinate axes.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.870
So that's my y-axis, that's my
x-axis, and I'm going to drawn

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.995
another line in a
different color.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.360
Let's see, has a positive
slope-- so that means it's

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.850
going to go from the bottom
left to the top right.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.790
And it goes through
the point 0, 0.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.400
So this is line l.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.380
Line l looks something
like that.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.630
So this is line l.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.520
If line k is perpendicular to
line l, which of the following

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.190
must be true?

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.409
So it intersects at a
perpendicular angle.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.429
So line k is going to look
something-- let me do it in a

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.159
different color-- line k is
going to look something like

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.710
this, right?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.960
It's perpendicular.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.400
I have a feeling that this is
going to go into something

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.390
that you just need to know.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.110
The perpendicular-- if you know
the slope of something,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.950
let's say line l's slope.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:09.490
Let's say l is y is equal to mx
plus b, but we know it goes

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.240
through the intercept, so
it's actually just mx.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.210
Then we know that line k, right
here, is going to have

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.760
the negative inverse of
the slope of line l.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.880
So it's going to be negative
1 over mx and then plus b.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.030
This could intersect right here,
we don't know because

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.380
they didn't tell us it goes
through the origin.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.830
So we don't know what
b is. b could be 0.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.590
But the bottom line is, the only
thing we do know is that

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.470
if this number is positive,
this number

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.430
is going to be negative.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.880
And they told us that this
is positive, right?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.860
And let's see, choice a, line
k passes through 0, 0.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.330
No, no.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.850
Oh, it's C, choise C.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.440
Line k has a negative slope.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.070
And that's all we know.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.850
See you in the next video.
