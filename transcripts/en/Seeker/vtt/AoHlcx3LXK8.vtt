00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.669
If you know a little about basic biology,
I bet you know that most women have two x

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.040
chromosomes and most men have an x and y.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.290
But do you know some females have a W chromosome?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.470
Hey science fans, Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.000
Bird sex is a little weird.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.670
No I don’t mean because everything happens
with one hole..

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.670
I mean like male/female kind of sex.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.670
I mean…

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.670
I mean…

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.670
Bird’s have strange chromosomes.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.670
Let’s start off with what we know of our
sex chromosomes.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.880
Most women carry two x chromosomes and most
men carry an x AND a y.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.680
There’s room for variation of course, some
people have more than one x, like XXY or xxx.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.850
And this is true for a lot of organisms, like
humans and cats and mice and things.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.579
In these cases the female organisms produce
one type of gamete, all X. but males produce

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.730
two types, x and y.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
It’s the male gamete, or sperm that decides
the sex of the offspring.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.120
But in reptiles it works a little differently.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.730
It’s not necessarily the gametes that determine
sex but the temperature.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.610
Like take the American Alligator for example,
both high and low temperatures turn the eggs

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.969
female while middle range temperatures make
the eggs male.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.959
A reptilian ancestor of both humans and birds
probably relied on this system.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.259
But give or take a few million years and something
else entirely emerged.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.950
Birds have ZW chromosomes.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.409
Yeah you heard that right, ZW.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.090
Which stands for Zery Weird.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.259
Okay not really.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.420
But the ZW chromosomes look nothing like the
XY ones, they don’t share any genes!

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
But they are kind of similar in that the W
chromosome is shrunken, just like Y is in

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.590
our genome.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.590
but wait.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.590
it gets weirder.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.389
In birds, MALES are the homomorphic sex, mean
they are the ones with the double zzs. where

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.429
the females are heteromorphic and have their
own chromosome.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.020
They get both the z and w chromosomes.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.209
But interestingly, in a recent study published
the journal Nature Communications found that

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.579
the W chromosome does not have the genes that
lead to the development of the female.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.079
But the researchers think that the W is a
buffer and that the organisms need two copies

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.869
of certain genes to survive.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.450
According to another study published in the
journal Science Progress, the Z chromosome

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.299
is large and contains almost all the known
sex-linked genes.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.529
So it’s the presence of the number of Z
chromosomes that change the sex of the offspring.

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:12.220
Two copies of it produces a male, one copy
(plus a W chromosome) produces a female.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.739
But why did they evolve this way?

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.610
Researchers think that sex chromosomes evolved
from autosomes.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.890
And the split between ZW and XY systems happened
once a long time ago, since they don’t share

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.069
any genes.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.709
Maybe birds got this flip-flopped gene set
up because of sexual selection.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.650
Many species of birds have males with extreme
characteristics.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.760
Think of like a peacock.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.520
That big tail might garner some womanly affection,
but it doesn’t enable him to fly.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.120
If a female were to get these traits, maybe
it would be detrimental, so having another

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.939
chromosome might balance out some of those
traits.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.640
And having these sex related traits on the
Z chromosome means that when a male gets DOUBLE

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.909
those traits he’s like EXTRA masculine.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.260
But that’s just a theory, scientists aren’t
exactly sure.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.579
So I guess you might say… more research
is needed!

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.230
But weirdly other organisms have similar ZW
systems, but the W chromosome does determine

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.239
the females.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.800
Some Lepidoptera - moths and butterflies have
Z0, ZZW, and ZZWW genotypes.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.719
yeah, the world of animal sex is just weird.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.019
Speaking of butterflies, have you ever wondered
what happens inside of a cocoon?

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:26.680
