1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,880
The Joe Rogan experience. Interesting.
Um, what else should we be concerned with?

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,760
We should be concerned with anything
that North Korea's doing. Oh, absolutely.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,010
I have, um, spent a lot of time in North
Korea. That's why I brought it up. Yeah.

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,140
So I've, um, I advised the North Korea,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,890
actually North Korean governor on the
establishment of a special economic zones,

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,300
which I certainly believe if North
Korea could have economic growth and

7
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,820
integrate into the rest of the world, that
would be great. And so I, I, um, when,

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,530
so you want all this was in 2015
but I've been there twice. Um,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,910
cross the border from China
and zigzag the country by land,

10
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,980
visited 10 or 12 different sites.
So spent almost two weeks by Lance.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,460
I've really incredible.
I mean, North Korea, um,

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,110
one, it's the most organized
place I've ever seen. I mean,

13
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,570
there's not a anywhere there's
like on the side of the road, the,

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,030
the stones are all raked. There's not
a stick. Every little line is drawn.

15
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,880
It's like total control.
There were very, in the,

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,680
in the agricultural areas there were
very few machines and very few farm

17
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,820
animals. So I saw people
pulling plows, like you know,

18
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:10,560
usually have the animal in front of
the plow and the person behind here,

19
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,580
there were like two people in front of
the plow and one person behind the people

20
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:18,870
where the, the uh, the animals
and we would go and visit these,

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,340
the just, cause they didn't, they,

22
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,410
a lot of the animals got eaten
when they had their famine.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,840
And so we visited these different sites
for these special economic zones and

24
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,980
they would say like what they had done
and what they were thinking about doing.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,070
And I would say like, how do you, do you
know anything about the market? Like do,

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,860
what are you going to sell here?
And they said,

27
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:42,000
well we know about clearing land and
building a fence. And then we left,

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,831
we went to,

29
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:47,730
to Pyongyang and I spoke to about 400
economic planners and I said, look,

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,550
I know you have these plans that
do these special economic zones.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,590
It's totally going to fail
the way it's going to work.

32
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,770
You have to connect to the market economy,
you have to empower your workers,

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,550
you need information flow.
How else are you going to learn and adapt?

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,650
So North Korea,

35
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:06,240
it's a really dangerous place and
now it's even more dangerous because,

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:06,930
um,

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,930
president Trump threw it was this kind
of nonsensical hail Mary in these,

38
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,280
these meetings with Kim Jong Un,
there was no,

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,150
never any indication that the North
Koreans were planning on giving up their

40
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,890
nuclear weapons.
They never said they would.

41
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,830
It's the last thing they would do
because their goal is survival.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,280
And so there was this kind of head fake,

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,570
which was like a PR stunt to be able
to say, all right, we're having these,

44
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,200
these meetings.

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,590
And of course the North Koreans weren't
ever going to give up their nuclear

46
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:38,580
weapons there. They're still not.
So now things are ramping up.

47
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,570
So North Korea in the last couple of
days has started firing missiles again at

48
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,010
the United States today and see us
military seized a North Korean ship.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,020
So we're going back to
this very dangerous place.

50
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,610
And so I think we really
need to do a much better job.

51
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,190
We need much more considered.
North Korea has, it's really,

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,000
and these guys are really
smart. I mean, I, the, I, they
are various people say, well,

53
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,820
these guys are poor.
They must not be, I mean,

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,170
like imagine like we're playing cards
with them. We've got the whole deck.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,230
They don't have anything, have
one card. And yet they're there.

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,430
They're in the game. They're
holding us to a, to a stalemate.

57
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,110
And it's really worrying. And why did
you go over there and like, w what,

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,200
what were you thinking?

59
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,360
So I thought a lot about it because I
have a background in human rights. Um,

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,840
I was a human rights officer for
the United Nations in Cambodia.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,790
I'm the child of a refugee.

62
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,970
I have this very strong belief in human
rights and that in supporting people in

63
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
North Korea,

64
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,170
they have about 120,000
people in the most brutal,

65
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,350
brutal,
horrific prison camps.

66
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,390
And so when I was asked to be part
of this six person delegation,

67
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,710
advising them on the special, on the
establishment of special economic zones,

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,680
one instinct was screw them.
I don't want to be part of this at all,

69
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,730
but I also felt that if North Korea could
have some kind of integrated economic

70
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,830
development that would at least
connect them to the world,

71
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,250
that would create some kind of leverage
and that would, uh, that would help, uh,

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,660
help people. So I decided to
go, um, and I'm glad that I,

73
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,790
that I did, but this is, these
are really hard issue people and,

74
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,490
and it's very unfortunate that in,

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,210
in president Trump's negotiations
with the North Koreans,

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,000
human rights was never once mentioned.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,550
And I think that that's
coming back to values.

78
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:37,000
Like we have to be clear about who
we are and what we stand for and be

79
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,340
consistent in fighting for it.

80
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,470
Do you think that Trump didn't bring
that up because he wanted to be able to

81
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,620
effectively communicate with them
and not put them on their heels?

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,310
Maybe. Um, but I feel like
has had they done, I mean,

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,590
I think that if he thought that
there was a real chance of progress,

84
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,130
but the hard thing was he didn't
know much about the North Koreans.

85
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:02,920
He has people and we have brilliant
people working in the United States

86
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,050
government and all of those people,

87
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,920
all of the US intelligence agencies were
telling president Trump that the North

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,210
Koreans have absolutely no intention of
giving up their nuclear weapons. Right.

89
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,600
And so maybe he did think that he would
charm Kim Jong gone, or he would say, hey,

90
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,600
we're going to give you economic
development or, or whatever.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
But I think for most people who were
observers of north who had watched it for,

92
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,000
I thought that was not,
uh, so we gave away a lot.

93
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:32,920
So we didn't mention human rights.
We suspended our military exercises.

94
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:35,530
We gave them the legitimacy
of a presidential meeting,

95
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:39,460
which they'd been wanting for 30 years,
and we didn't get anything back.

96
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,800
So it had we gotten something
back then you could say, well,

97
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:46,600
that was a risk for taking maybe. Mm.
Yeah. I haven't heard described that way,

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,640
but I'm agreeing with what you're saying.

99
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,230
What do you think he could
have done differently though?

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,570
I don't think the meeting should
have happened with no is no, no,

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,770
no conditions. There were no
police. So if he had said,

102
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,740
I'm open to meet with the North Koreans,

103
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,170
which is something the North
Koreans have always wanted,

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,220
we could have met with the North Koreans
anytime I immediately for the last 30

105
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:11,270
years, but in order to do it, they
need to do this, this and this.

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,380
And if they do it, we'll meet like that
would have been a legitimate thing.

107
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,560
But what he said is somebody, the
the, the North Korean, I'm inside the,

108
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:23,000
the South Korean national security
advisors peeked into his office and he,

109
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,510
and he goes, hey, they wanted me
to go. And it was like sure that,

110
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,260
that seems like an
interesting thing to do.

111
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,800
And I think that with this diplomacy
you kind of have to get something.

112
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,760
And so we gave away so much upfront
and the North Koreans weren't,

113
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,390
didn't have an incentive to do anything
in return was his perspective that it

114
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:42,140
would be better to be in communication
and be friends with this guy who's that

115
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,000
was that what he was thinking would be,

116
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,830
but we have real interests
in the sense that we,

117
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:51,620
we have large military forces in Seoul.
We have a lot at stake.

118
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,850
We have our closest ally,
Japan who has had citizens abducted.

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,050
And so I think that was what he
thought is like, let's be friendly.

120
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,910
And then with the force of personal
chemistry, um, everything will,

121
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,500
will unlock. But I think that
was always extremely unlikely.

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,700
What do you think is going to happen
to that country? I think eventually,

123
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,030
and I've written this,
I think eventually this regime will,

124
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,920
will collapse under its own weight,

125
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,180
but it's really held out a long time
because you think of the collapse of the

126
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,300
Soviet Union, they had enough, Soviet
Union had enough bullets to survive.

127
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,081
If they had said,
you know,

128
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,550
we're just going to shoot everybody at
the Berlin Wall and every dissenter,

129
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,300
they would still be, the North Korea has
essentially murdered millions of people.

130
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,810
So with famine and execution
and, and, and, and prison camps.

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
So I think they're going to stay
for a while, but eventually, um,

132
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,640
there will be leaders in North Korea who
will come to the conclusion that it's

133
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:51,641
safer to oppose the Kim family than to
wait for the Kim family to come and get

134
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:53,270
you.

135
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,770
And that tends to happen in these kinds
of totalitarian systems where there's so

136
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:02,480
little trust. There's so little
loyalty. Jesus. Yeah. What is there,

137
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,430
what other conditions like
technologically, like what,

138
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,950
what is their infrastructural on?

139
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,340
So the general infrastructure
is absolutely terrible. I mean,

140
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:14,300
they have roads in the big cities that
are actually quite nice roads because

141
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:18,980
there's no cars. And so, um, but their
infrastructure is, is terrible. I mean,

142
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,440
all of their, their, um, power supply,

143
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:26,441
they have brownouts blackouts all the
time at their manufacturing is all being

144
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,120
decimated.
So it's terrible.

145
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,770
But they have really focused their
energy on building these nuclear weapons.

146
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:38,570
Because they think that these nuclear
weapons give them leverage to do things

147
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:42,040
and to extract concessions
and to get, uh, to get a bits.

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,340
It's terrible infrastructure.

149
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,690
So do they don't have an internet,
right,

150
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:51,530
but they have something similar but it
only allows them access to a few state

151
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,610
run websites. Well average person
doesn't have access to the Internet.

152
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,590
So the way it works is
it's all about loyalty.

153
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,480
So you need three or so generations of
loyalty to the Kim family to even set

154
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,960
foot in Pyongyang, the
capitol. So really? Yes.

155
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,570
So it's not like you can kind
of move around or whatever.

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,540
It's like just to be in the capitol,

157
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,690
like you have to have your loyalty
proven and so average person out in the

158
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,090
country, they don't have
access to much of anything.

159
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,400
They have a little bit more
now than they did in the past.

160
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,050
And then for this relatively small
number of elites who are in largely in

161
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,480
Pyongyang and in the other cities,
which are like,

162
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,140
there's a ring of defense around
these cities and just to, to enter,

163
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,670
you have to have all of these checks.

164
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,940
Some of them have access to limited
internet. Um, but it's, it's,

165
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,940
it's tightly controlled and it's not
like you're kind of going on Google and

166
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,500
look going wherever you want.
Right.

167
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,060
And they probably would get in trouble
if they googled the wrong thing. Yes.

168
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,090
And trouble. It's not just you
trouble, like if you try, if,

169
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,920
if my brother or my uncle does something
that gets me in trouble with the

170
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:02,430
regime,
the whole extended family is out.

171
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,820
And that means you either you go to
prison camps or you're kicked out of

172
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,541
Pyongyang.
I mean,

173
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,140
at this it's all about collective
punish and people are terrified.

174
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,780
And by that ruthless punishment
structure that they've set up,

175
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,760
that's how they've kept
control of the country.

176
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,140
And everybody's forced to rat on each
other, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're,

177
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:19,471
they're,

178
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:24,471
they're actually the compelled to tell
on each other for one thing that you did.

179
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,000
If you don't, then what if you don't,
then you are complicit because they, yes.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,650
So that's, and that's, they're
these horrible stories.
I've met a lot of these, um,

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,920
uh, of these people who are in the prison
camps. Like, I have a, a friend of mine,

182
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:42,690
I mean she was this 13 year old
girl and her father, um, was a,

183
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:46,500
like a low level North Korean official
and then he was accused of something.

184
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:50,430
And so this family that was
privileged all of a sudden was,

185
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,200
was out and just,

186
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,940
just these horrible things in prison
and rape and this little, I mean,

187
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,050
now she's in the United States and
incredibly positive and it's amazing how

188
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:05,370
resilient she is. But this is like a
real hell. It's a real, it's an issue.

189
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,280
And I think that for us as Americans,
as humans,

190
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,960
we're less human when there are people who
are suffering like this. Yeah, I agree.

191
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,980
Now, um, you were traveling
all over North Korea,

192
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,340
but what were they having you do while
you were so we would do is we would go

193
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,670
from one of these special
economic zones to the other.

194
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,070
And in each one it was kind of
the same story. You'd get there,

195
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,700
there'd be like a big field.
The farmers had been kicked off,

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
there was a fence around it.
And then the group of,

197
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,320
of the local officials would come and
they'd have like a big chart and they have

198
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,050
a plan. Like here's where we're going
to build this building and here's,

199
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,920
and I would always ask the same question
like what are you going to do here?

200
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,890
Why do you think you're
going to be competitive?

201
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,770
How do you know what
the market prices are?

202
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,430
How are your workers going to be
empowered so they can change things?

203
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:56,590
And many in the old days it used to be
you just kind of have these automaton

204
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,101
workers.

205
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:01,600
Now workers are actually
making big decisions and
fixing things and they didn't

206
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,280
have an answer to any of those questions.

207
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,110
And that's what happens when you have
these totalitarian top down systems is

208
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:12,010
that like if, if you, being creative
is actually really dangerous.

209
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:16,840
So if somebody says do x, you
just do X. Wow. Yeah, no, it's,

210
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,760
it's really incredible and it's,

211
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,761
it's so sad because I spent a lot of
time in South Korea and this is the most

212
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,270
dynamic place.

213
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:29,740
There's like I often I go to soul just
to see what technology is going to show

214
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,930
up here a few years in the future.

215
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:36,931
I mean it's Seoul is like the future
and then just 35 miles from soul is the

216
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,200
demilitarized zone. Then the
other side it's, it's incredible.

217
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,560
And the real problem would be once they
finally did get free of that community

218
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,530
or the of that,
uh,

219
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,140
that mean you can call them whenever you
want them dictator and that he and his

220
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:57,520
family, what would they,
what tools would they have?

221
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,050
Like how prepared would they be to be
a Tom? Well it's really the good thing,

222
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,570
the benefit that they have if there is,

223
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,110
so here's my thought of what a
scenario a scenario might look like.

224
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:13,030
And I think eventually probably there'll
be some kind of coup attempt against

225
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,950
the campaign.
Let's just say it succeeds.

226
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,220
But that would probably result in another
military dictatorship with another

227
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:18,520
group.

228
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,200
Well we don't know cause then I think
immediately I think the Chinese would

229
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,610
invade. Really? Yeah.

230
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,040
Cause people think of the curve when
people think of the Korean War from the

231
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,780
early 1950s,
they didn't go to the Korean War.

232
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:33,220
It must've been the Americans
fighting against the Koreans.

233
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,570
But the Korean War,
the two sides,

234
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:39,310
where is America and the South Koreans
fighting against the North Koreans and

235
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,540
the Chinese, the Chinese did the most
of the, uh, of the, uh, of the fighting.

236
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,890
And so China and North Korea is the only
country in the world that has a treaty

237
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:51,700
alliance now with China,
kind of like we have with Japan and with,

238
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,530
and with South Korea.
And so China,

239
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,430
their biggest fear is having
a reunified Korean peninsula,

240
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,640
al allied to the United States.
So I think if there was a coup,

241
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,190
the Chinese would immediately
move in militarily.

242
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,730
Then immediately there would be this
call to have some kind of UN body.

243
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,600
Um, and there would be a
call for a UN authority.

244
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,080
And then I think it would be agreed that
the Chinese would stay and they just

245
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,320
would put on blue helmets,
um, like as a, as a UN force.

246
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,930
And then we'd have to
negotiate what happens next.

247
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,730
And I think what the Chinese
would do would be say, well,

248
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,980
we'll leave when the Americans leave,
is that,

249
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,410
I think that would be
what will likely happen.

250
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,310
But eventually I think we're going
to see a Korean reunification.

251
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:37,240
And the good news of these reunified
countries like eastern West Germany,

252
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,840
is there's a whole system
of law that is just,

253
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,550
you just North Korea will be swallowed
into South Korea. And then you have law,

254
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,420
you have an infrastructure, and it'll
take, you know, one or two generations.

255
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,950
But I think that will eventually happen,

256
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:55,130
and I'm hoping it can happen
without nuclear war. Terrible,

257
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,660
terrible bloodshed. But it's
that it's going to be a big
challenge. God Damn. Yeah.

258
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,880
That sounds insurmountable.
Yeah.

259
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:05,210
Just hearing you talk about that all about
North Korea getting absorbed by South

260
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,030
Korea, I'm like, oh my God. Yeah. Luck.
