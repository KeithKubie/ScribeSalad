00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.360
MALE SPEAKER 1: Hey, Jarek.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.986
What's happening?

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:08.360
MALE SPEAKER 2:
I'm coding this--

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.735
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Oh, that's great.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:10.824
Say, listen.

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:12.490
I've been talking to
the folks upstairs.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.980
And we think we need to make
our apps a little more freemium.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.500
Do you think you
can do that for us?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.710
Maybe add a little
freemiumification to our apps?

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.120
MALE SPEAKER 2: Do you even
know what freemium means?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.950
MALE SPEAKER 1: Jarek, look.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.574
I'm more of what you
might want to call

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:27.640
a big-picture kind of guy.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.480
I don't like to get
bogged down in details

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.780
like what is freemium, and
what does that even mean?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.574
I like to leave that
people like you.

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:35.365
So what do you say?

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:38.140
Can you get this done for me?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.192
MALE SPEAKER 2: Well, we could
reshuffle the schedule and--

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:42.400
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.600
Hey, listen.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
I kind of told the folks
in upper management

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.450
we'd have something
for them on Monday.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.460
So I'm going to have to ask
you to come in over the weekend

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.380
to get this done for me, OK?

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.530
Thanks a lot, Jarek.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.540
You're a team player.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.600
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's "Yarek."

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.183
MALE SPEAKER 1: Keep
up the good work.
