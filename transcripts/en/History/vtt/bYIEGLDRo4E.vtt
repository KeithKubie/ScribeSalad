00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.505
NARRATOR: Machu Picchu, Peru.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.928
This stone citadel of
the Inca civilization

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:17.517
was built high in the Andes
Mountains around 1450, AD,

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.478
but was suddenly and
mysteriously abandoned

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:23.732
roughly a century later.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:28.153
Mainstream scholars contend the
construction of Machu Picchu

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:32.741
was led by Emperor Pachacutec,
and took thousands of men

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.284
working decades to complete.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.373
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.418
that the precise construction,
the transportation

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:47.130
of massive blocks, and
the Incas' own accounts

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.509
all point to a very different
explanation for Machu Picchu--

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:56.931
that it was built with the
help of otherworldly beings.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.058
Emperor Pachacutec
was believed

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:03.062
to have had a special bond
with the god Viracocha.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.483
ED BARNHART: Pachacutec,
in the days leading up

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.693
to the great battle
against the Chanka,

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.278
he takes kind of a retreat.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.822
He goes to a lake.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:19.120
And out of the sky drops this
piece of metal into the lake.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.582
When he fishes it out of
the lake, it's a mirror.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:26.169
And he sees an
image in the mirror.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:29.839
This supernatural creature
in the mirror tells him,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.633
I am your father.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.636
You will win many
battles in your lifetime,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.221
this one included.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.475
The image is actually
Viracocha, the creator deity.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:45.897
And then, as Pachacutec stood
with his vastly smaller army,

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.067
these giant megalithic
stones came to life

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.568
and became his army.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:54.072
They crushed the Chanka.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:59.160
Pachacutec actually had the
power of Viracocha behind him.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.412
It makes one wonder
if, in fact, this was

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:04.499
extraterrestrial technology.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.709
NARRATOR: Could the
story of Pachacutec

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.129
levitating massive
stones be true?

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.715
And might the mirror
that fell from the sky

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.761
have been some type
of alien technology?

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.889
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.518
and suggest a new
discovery at Machu Picchu

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.771
may reveal what happened to
this otherworldly device.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:33.736
French engineer David Crespi
was vacationing in Machu Picchu

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:38.032
in 2010 when he discovered
that, at the bottom of one

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:41.661
of the main buildings, there
seemed to be a doorway,

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.331
purposely sealed up with rocks.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.418
In August of 2011,
he reached out

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:52.005
to Thierry Jamin, a
French archeologist that

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.716
has been studying Peru
and the Incan empire

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:58.469
for more than 15 years.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.265
Within a month, Thierry
started his own investigation,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:07.270
with local archeologists and
specialists in funerary sites.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.440
Thierry and radar
technician Ricardo Hamada

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.192
took a scan from above
the blocked entrance

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.571
with ground-penetrating radar.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.909
The image on the radar detector
reveals a large cavity.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.952
And the broken
lines indicate there

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:29.000
may also be stairs, leading even
further down into the earth.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.047
Other equipment detected
that there was metals

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.717
inside this hidden chamber--

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.430
gold, silver, and other
types of metallic objects,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.308
suggesting very strongly
that we're dealing

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:49.729
with some kind of a tomb.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.316
NARRATOR: Although Thierry has
confirmed Crespi's suspicions,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.444
that the odd structure
was an entrance sealed off

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.781
at some point by the Incas,
the Peruvian authorities

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.200
have since banned his
returned to the site

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.119
for further investigations.

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.704
THIERRY JAMIN: [speaking french]

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.915
INTERPRETER: All of the
iconographic and archeological

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.752
elements show us that
this is all associated

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:17.423
with the mausoleum
of Pachacutec, maybe

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.258
the most important
archeological treasure

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:23.846
ever found in Machu Picchu.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:25.848
NARRATOR: Could the
tomb of Pachacutec

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:29.185
lie beyond these rocks?

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:33.147
And is it possible, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest,

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:36.776
that it might also contain
advanced technology--

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.612
the so-called magic
mirror that was

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.614
said to have been
given to Pachacutec

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:45.076
by the creator god Viracocha?
