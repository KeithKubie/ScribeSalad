00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
So I'd like to talk about three

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.270
Infinite series so sums of infinitely many numbers

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.369
So here's the first one 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.000
Blah blah blah. What's that? And the answer is it's 2 this is the problem of Achilles and the tortoise

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.590
Achilles is to

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.939
Stadio or whatever the unit of length is in ancient Greece from The Tortoise

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.558
Well after a while Achilles gains on the tortoise one unit, and so the remaining distance is only 1

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.439
then after a while Achilles gains

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.709
Half of the distance to the tortoise and now the distance to the tortoise is 1/2

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.249
After a little while Achilles gains another 1/4 of the distance to the tortoise and so on and so on and so on

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.819
The story according to Zeno's paradoxes is that achilles never catches the tortoise? Well, of course

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.448
Achilles never catches the tortoise at any of these times

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.469
But if you just wait a little longer

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.938
Achilles will have caught the tortoise the total length that Achilles gains on the tortoise is 2 and that's why this is true

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.279
Now, let's look at 1

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.909
plus 1/2 plus 1/3

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.040
Plus 1/4 plus 1/5 plus 1/6 plus 1/7 plus 1/8 and so on and this never ends. How big is that?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.820
What is that what I mean is if I stop after?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.460
Many many many terms so I can so I'm adding some huge finite list of numbers

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.790
How big is that and what happens when I add more and more and more of them and the answer is this is infinity

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.039
Why well, let me group the terms. Here's the first one here are the next two

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.909
Here are the next for the next eight would end with 1 over 15, and this goes on forever

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.909
I don't want to mark up my desk

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.110
Well, so what exactly does this mean you give me any number at all

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.649
50 trillion and I can stop this series and say ok. I will only go this far

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.889
I'm adding only a finite number of numbers together, but that sum will be more than D trillion. That's true

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.120
Not only for 50 trillion

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.659
But for any number you name no matter how big and that's what it means that the sum of the series is infinity

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.150
So it's blowing up. It's like exactly

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.279
Exactly. We say that the series diverges. So let's look at the first term. Well, it's 1. Thank you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.260
How about these next two terms? Well, you know what? This one is bigger than 1/2

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.430
Each one of these terms is bigger than 1/4

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.590
1/2 is bigger than 1/4 1/3 is bigger than 1/4 and there are two terms. So this is bigger than

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.939
2/4 which is again 1/2. How about these four terms?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.050
They're all bigger than 1/8 and there are 4 of them. So if I add these guys it's bigger than

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.570
4 eighths which is 1/2

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.350
If I look at the next eight terms, they're all bigger than 1/16 and they're eight of them

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.659
so the sum is bigger than

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.650
8/16 which is 1/2 if I stop far enough

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.450
this sum will be more than 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.469
I can go on as many times as I like

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.019
Accumulating what have until I get to more than 50 trillion. So sooner or later

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.190
The sum of these numbers will be more than 50 trillion

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.329
The catch is that I have to go enormous ly far out in order to do it, but let's not worry about that now

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.250
Okay, never mind. Just how enormous that's let's leave it there for this sum which has a name. It's called the harmonic series

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.309
I'd like to explain how to use the harmonic series to stack dominoes

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.780
Well, actually I don't have dominoes in my office, but I have lots of issues of the annals of mathematics. Oh, yes

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.290
I have lots and lots and lots. So we're going to use copies of the annals of mathematics as dominoes

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.510
Let's just take two of them first if I move this one here, it's going to collapse

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.739
but if I move it so that its center of gravity is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.089
Let's see if that works I'm being a little conservative

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.369
The center of gravity of this guy is sitting over that guy and so it does not collapse

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.880
now

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.110
Let's take these two and put them very carefully on top of the third one

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.739
taking care that the center of gravity of this whole guy is above this issue of the annals of mathematics and therefore

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.630
looks

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.400
precarious

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.489
Ok there. It does not collapse

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.260
And now perhaps I could put these three on top of a fourth and if I succeed in doing that I will not tempt fate

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.159
I will just declare that that we have succeeded

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.890
Whoop. So, let's see. How are we doing?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.650
It hasn't collapsed

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.950
Mm-hmm looks a little flaky

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.790
It hasn't collapsed

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.609
how far can we make this guy stick out suppose that I have all those copies of the annals of

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.549
Mathematics or perhaps all the copies of the annals of mathematics ever printed from the beginning of time to the end of time

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.210
Wonder how many that will be

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.170
Anyway, we have all of them and we stack them up and we demand that the pile cannot collapse

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.869
Well, this is merely paper. So sooner or later if there's too much of a load it will be crushed but nevermind these are

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.500
imaginary

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.700
rigid Domino's

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.080
can we ever make the top guy so far out that it is not resting on the bottom guy at all that this edge is

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.039
Not lying at all over this book, but has come out farther

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:56.459
Exactly and the answer is oh, yes. In fact, you can make this this pile come out in that direction as

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.990
far as you like

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.390
Because if you look at it

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.299
but if you have any copies of the annals of mathematics and you do an absolutely perfect job in an ideal world the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.710
Distances that they are slid out from one another are in the proportions

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.919
1/2 1/2 to 1/3 to 1/4 to 1/5 to 1/6 and so on

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.399
to one over N if there are n copies of the annals of math or maybe n plus one copies of the

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.690
annals of math and so the fact that the harmonic series diverges

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.269
Tells you that you can eventually make this pile come out as far as you like

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.880
because 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/4 plus and so on if

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.820
you stop way way far out after a gazillion for a large enough value of a gazillion will be more than 50 billion and

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.309
Therefore this distance out. There will be more than 50 billion times the height of the annals of mathematics

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.739
All right, let's put the annals of mathematics aside. Now. Let's do the same thing to

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.309
the series 1 plus 1/2

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.100
squared plus

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.529
1/3 squared plus

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.520
1/4 squared plus let me keep going

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.350
Squared ok, blah blah. Now, let's try to do the same thing. We're gonna take the first term. All right, so that's 1

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.860
Thank you. Let's look at the next two terms

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.179
Now this is 1 over 1/2 squared

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.509
This is smaller than 1 over 1/2 squared

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:35.079
So we've got two terms and they're each smaller than 1/2 times 1/2. So that's smaller than 2

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720
times 1/2 times 1/2

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.989
That's smaller than 1/2. Let's look at the next four terms. Here. They are

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.289
They're all 1 over 4 squared or smaller

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.110
So they are smaller than 1/4 squared plus 1/4 squared plus 1/4 squared

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:00.520
Plus 1/4 squared there are 4 terms there. And so these guys together are no bigger than 4 times

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.179
1/4 squared that's 4 times 1/4 times 1/4 and that's 1/4

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.119
So this whole thing is less than 1/4 if I looked at the next eight terms and played the same game

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.660
I would find that that's less than 1/8 and so on

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.809
So now look if I go out to a gazillion terms

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:27.130
I'm guaranteed that what I've got is less than 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus 1/16

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.640
plus

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.669
Something-or-other. I stopped at 1 over some power of 2. Hey, wait a minute remember first result

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:39.968
This series never be the sum of these guys is never more than 2 the sum of all these numbers is 2 and the sum

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.699
Of the first gazillion numbers will be slightly less than 2

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.440
So therefore I'm guaranteed that no matter how many terms of this guy I take

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.070
It will be

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.780
less than 2 so it doesn't run off to infinity the

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:59.799
the harmonic series does and in fact, you could wonder what is the value of the sum of all of these terms and

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.820
that was a

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:07.179
Famous unsolved problem of the 18th century and the answer is PI squared over 6

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.630
Pi creeps in where you would least expect it

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:21.070
I was exactly here this place and I was having an interview than the phone rings

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:30.369
Hello and the voice was saying hello, this is Las Navas from Budapest
