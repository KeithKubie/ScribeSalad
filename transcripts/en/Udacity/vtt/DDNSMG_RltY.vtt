00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.060
While creating this course, I visited

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.380
Facebook with Dean Warren Solomon and spoke

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.310
with many data scientists. I learned a lot about EDA, and I'm excited

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.680
to share those stories with you throughout the course. First, you'll hear from

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.780
Aude to talk about what she finds most interesting about being a data scientist.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.408
&gt;&gt; So what I really like is, being able to go from real world that, we have

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:26.400
like billions and trillions of rows of data. You don't know what's interesting.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.024
It's like gigantic thing and you need

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.058
to, must investigate and have some ideas on

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:35.174
what might be interesting, and then try

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:39.372
investigating it, like, in different ways. Sometimes you

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.063
use, charts, sometimes you use maps and

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:46.065
sometimes you come across something that's, interesting and

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:51.480
that you want to, dig a little bit more into. And then eventually, once we have

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.970
figured out something interesting that we've developed the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.340
corresponding algorithms, then the goal is to have an

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.000
impact on, either understanding the world or changing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.070
the Facebook product. And being able to go from.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.730
We have all this data, we don't know what to do with it. So like, we're going to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.290
make a significant impact on like, understanding mobility

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.010
or improving Facebook. That's like a, a real awesome

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.010
flow of work.
