&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So, before I tell
you a little bit about the author,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.900
I need some audience participation.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.620 position:56%
If you've ever had a taco in this
country, enjoyed the taco, stand up.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.930
I want to show her something.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.930
Stand up. This, this
is taco nation, right?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.230
Here we are.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.390
I mean, you know, like what
better food in the world

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.910
and why wouldn't she
make a Tacopedia book.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.570
It just seems like unnatural.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.350
She brought with-- She
brought the Spanish version.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.260
I have the English version,
it's why we're here today,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.380
and that was first published in
2015 and republished this year.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.990
And it's just a treasure trove.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.440
It's on my desk as a
reference at work, of course.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.370
In addition to the really cool map,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.710
which is why it's called
"Tacopedia".

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.230
You just get to find
out all kinds of things.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.230
Plus, she's managed to fit, you
know from my perspective, like six

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.860
or eight recipes on a single
page, like that's unheard

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.180
of in the cookbook world.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.830
And part of the reason why she got
to do this is for what she wrote

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.680
in the book, which I'll
explain in a minute.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.100
But to give you a little
bit of her background,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
Deborah Holtz is the
cofounder and director

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240
of her country's Trilce Ediciones.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.230
I've butchered that I know.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.690
It's a publisher best known for
its popular culture books as well

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.190
as poetry books and
children's books and essays.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.050
And the editors and publishers
themselves are well-trained

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.120
and their geographical position
makes them ideal to talk

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.890
about Latin America as
well as United States.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.740
She also served as president
of the Mexican Alliance

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.720
of Independent Publishers.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.150
And she has said that her company
has sought to introduce risky

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.990
and different books aimed not
only at the Mexican market

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.330
but at international markets
because Mexico's proximity

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.670
to the United States is
beneficial in this way.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.150
The US has the world-- this--
And this is the author's words,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.910
"The US has the world's largest
Hispanic population and ethnicity

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.060
and which is about to become the
country's second largest ethnic

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.250
minority of which 34 million
people are either Mexican

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.960
or of Mexican heritage."

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.390
And that-- So that
represents, as you can imagine,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.810
a good marketing opportunity
for people in her business.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.270
Now, about "Tacopedia" itself,
I'm also going to use her

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.910
and her coauthor Juan Carlos Mena
who did the many illustrations

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.210
and great design of the book.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.420
She says, "It occurred to me there
must be something deeply rooted

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.680
in our culture that makes tacos
this culinary wonder loved

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.820
by the whole world, that ensures
the tacos are peerless contribution

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.150
to the culinary universe
are perfectly cooked

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.420
that the salsas have just
the right level of spice

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.730
and that the tacos are filled
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon--

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.530
5 o'clock in the morning as if it
were 2 in the afternoon and served

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.880
to people of all social classes."

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.510
She realized that like-- unlike
any other dish, tacos are the--

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.650
one of the most definitive
traits of Mexican culture.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.000 position:56%
And so, to pay tribute to it, that's
how they came up with this book,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.420
and she'll tell you all about it.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.280
And she's explained to me through
this book what tacos al pastor is.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.790
And I thought, I knew that
as a food professional.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.510
So, without further
ado, Deborah Holtz.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.710
[ Applause ]

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.220
&gt;&gt; Deborah Holtz: Hi,
thank you so much.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.570
Hello. Thank you everybody
for being here.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.050
I'm very, very incredibly excited.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.480
This is the first time
I come to this fair.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.040
It's a very different fair
from the ones I used to--

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.180 position:56%
or I'm used to go like the book
fairs in Mexico and other countries.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.060
There are basically publishers
that put their stands et cetera.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.370
And being here in this author
feast is really amazing.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.680
I would like to thank
especially the Mexican embassy,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.820
our ambassador Alberto Fierro
and from the institute--

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.840
Cultural Institution
of Mexico and Gustavo.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.640
And obviously, the people at
the National Book Festival

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.520
for having the brilliant idea

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.730
of having three Mexican
authors today in this festival.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.120
I think, it is important
to make a stand.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.100
I am Mexican and I'm
very proud of it.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.260
I don't think that's
being a criminal.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.320
So, being here before you is great.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.380
And I thank you all for
being here and listening

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.660
to this taco presentation.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.320
I made this PowerPoint so it could
be clearer why we thought that,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.640
as Bonnie was explaining,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.050
that we needed a taco book
being such an obvious thing.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.070
And well, we-- I suddenly
realized as any other Mexican does

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.800
in a taco place at 5 o'clock in the
morning after coming from a party.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.850
We all go to have tacos
before going to bed.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.980
I know that's not very recommended
by a doctor, but that's what we,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.950
Mexicans, do at all
times of the day.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.710
So, I went to this party.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.350
And after the party at 5 o'clock,
we went to a taco place and,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.910
you know, a bit drunk, tipsy.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.320
And I was like there, you
know, sitting at the table

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.980
and suddenly I was
looking at the taquero,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.980
the guy that makes the tacos.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.560
And I was amazed at the-- by the
speed at which he could make a taco

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.570
like tens, thousand, I don't know
how many tacos by the minute.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.660
The woman from the salsa
had the salsa ready.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.260
The waiter had already
cleaned the table.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.550
The tortilla woman had the
tortilla right on the dot, hot,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.530
because everything with a taco
has to be done in the minute.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.020
And I started thinking, "Wow, these
guys are amazing, they didn't go

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.460
to the fast food university
or anything, you know.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.170 position:56%
Something must be happening that all
of us are sitting here at 5 o'clock

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.380
in the morning, people that are
going to work, people like me

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.590
that are half drunk, you
know, coming from a party.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.240
And so, there must be
something in our DNA

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.420
that explains why all
this is happening."

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:54.870 position:56%
So, I had this like eureka moment of
doing "Tacopedia" because I thought

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.340 position:56%
that this reflected not only a dish,
you know, something you eat like,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.650
you know, a pizza or a burger,
which are great kinds of food.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.160
But this, you know, has-- had roots
way beyond the time we were living

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.500
in our past and obviously,
with all the pre-cultures

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.290
of Mexico, the Aztec, et cetera.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.780
So, that's how it all started.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.690
It took us four years to get
together all the information.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.500
And this is a presentation
I put together for you.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.210
So-- I'm sorry, I have to-- OK.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.440
So-- Well, as Bonnie said, the book
was first published in Spanish.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.610
I'm going to show you images of
the book published in Spanish.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.540
But we're fortunate enough to
have it now published in English

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.790
by Phaidon, a great
publishing house.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.830 position:56%
And so-- Well, the obvious question,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.530
and this is how it all
started is, what is a taco?

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.450
It may seem an obvious question.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.930
Everybody knows what a taco
is, but not really everybody.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.080
OK.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.140
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.970
This guy is sitting in front

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.560
of a basket something
saying he loves Hispanics.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.260
I don't think Mr. Trump
knows the difference

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.570
between Mexicans and Hispanics.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.090
And he certainly does
not know what a taco is.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.690
So, this image, you
know, made me very happy

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.610
that we have a "Tacopedia".

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.590
If one of you can later send him
a book, I will be very grateful,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.730
and all of the Mexicans will.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.090
So-- Well, there you
have the commentaries.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.800
"A taco bowl is just a taco with
a big beautiful wall around it,"

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.570
which I love and, "The best taco
bowls are made by immigrants

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.150
who resent a rich prick
calling them rapists.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.690
Love, inauthentic Mexican."

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.270
So-- Well.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.490
And it seems, you know, I'm
very happy for this translation

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.390
because when we talk about
tacos, there seems to be

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.970
like confusion, you know.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.680
All countries export their
main dishes obviously,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.370
you have Italians,
Chinese, et cetera.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.280
But Mexican food, for obvious
reasons, became very popular

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.470
in the United States, especially
because of the large chains,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.040
Taco Bell and then Chipotle,
which have loads of restaurants.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.440
And there, you can
see the importance

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.770
of Mexican food in
the United States.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.650
So, it's now $43 billion
what it makes

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.700
in the food market
in the United States.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.320
And obviously, the largest
chains dominate the market.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.060
So, I think, there's
a big difference

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.230
between a real taqueria where--

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.490
which we have there
and the Taco Bell.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:17.220
And the tacos at Taco Bell
calls tacos and a real taco.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.870
So, thank you for the opportunity
of talking about the real tacos.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.360
So, this is "Tacopedia"
published in English.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.780 position:56%
And the first pages, we wanted to--
since it was all born in a taqueria,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.750
in many taquerias in Mexico,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.690
this is the way they tell
you what tacos you can order.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.820
So, we figured, we would
do the index of the book

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.790
like you see the tacos
in a taqueria.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:55.120 position:56%
And as you might see and we will see
later on, we have 16 types of tacos

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.610
and we'll be talking about them.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.310
So, just to make the point, for
example, this is a taqueria,

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.420
nothing to do with Taco Bell.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.700
So, Alejandro Escalante who is
the guy who did the research

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.030
and we worked very
close together with him,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.960
me and my partner Juan Carlos Mena
who is responsible for the design,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.690
believe that tacos
is the very backbone,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.070
the heart of what Mexican--
being Mexican is.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.610
It is, you know, in the
bottom of our hearts,

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.770
it's not just the food we eat, it's
a whole representation of our way

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.320
of understanding life, our
way of relating to each other.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.890
And obviously, when
we say we want to eat,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.840
we have the synonymous expression
of, I'm going to eat a taco,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.720
even if you're going to
have ptomaine, you know.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.320
Having a taco is synonymous
for us for eating.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.820
And tacos are very
ancient in our culture.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:10.860 position:56%
The first tortilla is believed to be
invented 1,000 years Before Christ.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:17.840 position:56%
And so, we wanted to begin with this
book explaining where the tortillas

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.770
and where maize came from.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.880
So, the first, you
know, thing to know is

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.880
that tortillas obviously
come from maize.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.610
Maize is a plant that was
originally from Mexico,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.940
from the state of Puebla.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.710
And the story goes that there is a
very ancient legend among Mexicans

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:49.580
that say that we owe the discovery
of maize kernels to an ant.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:55.310
It was a black ant that told
Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican god,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.220
you know, the feathered serpent,
that there was these grains

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.940
in a mountain called Tonacatepetl.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.300
And so, the ant showed Quetzalcoatl
the way to the mountain.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.870 position:56%
And that's how maize was discovered.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.220
And after that obviously, many gods
related to the maize which was,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:26.270
you know, the main deity for the
Mexicans in all of the cultures

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.870
in Mexico and in the other
southern countries like Guatemala,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.390
Central America and some
countries in South America.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.490
We have many types of maize.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.220
Maize was not the plant
as we know it right now.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.720
It breeded, you know, with
many different types of maizes.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.470
And right now, we have,
I don't know, like 40,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.890
50 types of different maizes.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:58.310
But what is amazing about
maize is that with maize,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.670 position:56%
you can't make a tortilla, you know.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:06.230
Many people don't know that-- you
think you take, you know, a corn,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.680
the ear of corn, and you crush
it and you make a maize dough,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.560
and with that, you have a tortilla.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.050
No, totally wrong.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:22.170
The greatest discovery of all this
is not corn itself, but nixtamal.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.350
The dough with which you make
a tortilla is called nixtamal.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.550
And this incredible invention,
we don't know who to--

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.230
I don't know who to clap to because
there's no inventor or discoverer

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:42.580
that is mentioned in the history of
Mexico, who came up with the idea

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.120
of having this alkaline water
heated at night with lime,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.890
just as the lime we
use for construction.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.290
So, you heat that water with lime.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:15:00.270
And there, you put in the maize
kernels so they are soften.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.950
And then, you wash them,
you take out the hull

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:10.700
and that's how you make the
basic ingredient for a tortilla.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.090
What is incredible about
this process as well is

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:20.250
that unlike maize, nixtamal
has much more vitamins

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.280
and protein that maize itself.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.530 position:56%
What this process of cooking
provides is of a thing called niacin

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.750
which makes possible
to absorb vitamins.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.040
So, that talks of an
incredible tradition.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.210
And it can show us that our
very ancient people were very,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.460 position:56%
very well-fed because they ate
tortillas and of course, they hunted

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:53.620
and had game, fish, frogs,
ant, insect as we will see.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.350
And from the maize, a whole variety
of different dishes can be made

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.410
from drinks like pinole,
atole, et cetera,

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:10.890
as well as alcoholic beverages
when you leave it to ferment.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.600
Here is the nutritional fact.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.480
We thought it was important
to have the nutritional facts

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.080
of the tortilla in the book.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.260 position:56%
And you will find that it's not only
not fattening, much less fattening

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.680
than bread, but very
nutritious for its vitamin,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.310
proteins, et cetera, et cetera.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:39.420
An average Mexican consumes
130 pounds of tortillas a year.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.630
Wow, quite a lot.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.930
If we would have that
without the Coke,

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.190
we wouldn't have the first
place in obesity in the planet.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.400
So, flour-- So, we
have the tortillas,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.560
they have always been made with
the same process, the nixtamal

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.700
and afterwards you crush
the grains with a metate,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.150
which is made out of
volcanic stone and there's

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.490
where the woman traditionally
makes the tortillas.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.990
It was not until 1947, imagine,
when the first machine--

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.790
tortilla machine appeared
with a guy named Celorio.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.530
But these machines have
exactly the same technology

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.980
as the first tortillas ever made.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.710
The volcanic stones are the ones--
I'm sorry, that crush the grains,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.340 position:56%
and that's how tortillas come about.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.380
So, we have many utensils, you say.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:44.740
Well, we have many things that
are credited for having a tortilla

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.970
and to keep tortillas
and producing tortillas.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.670
Instead of having a very boring
list of everything that is involved

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.370
in a tortilla, we thought
we could make a lottery.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.610
So, we made a lottery with
all the different instruments

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.600 position:56%
that are involved in its production,
where you have the tortilla press,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.990
the tenate which is where you keep
the tortillas, well obviously,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.910
nopal because you can make
nopal tortillas, a taco maker,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.840
the metal stove, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.600
So, this is a taco lottery.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.180
And you can find all
about it in the book.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.360
Then, we have obviously, the
animals you put inside the taco.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.330
Tacos obviously, are made
out of the tortilla itself

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.450
because for making a taco, you
have obviously a holy trinity,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.940
as we call it, the tortilla,
the filling and the sauce.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.990 position:56%
So, this book starts with the
tortilla then we go to the fillings.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:50.740
And the Spaniards, when they
came, brought along the animals

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.690
that are usually now eaten inside
tacos because the ancient Mexicans

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.710
and in Mexico, there were no cows,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.980
there were no sheep,
no lamb, no pigs.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:08.240
So afterwards, you know, when they
came, they brought these animals

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.080
which are now very important
part of making a taco.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:21.670
So, we have the three basic
animals that are used to make tacos

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:27.040
with their parts-- four-- I'm
sorry, including the goat.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.230
And now, you know, when we
get to part 2, it's taco time.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.740
And taco time means
we're going to make--

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.590
like traveling through the 16 basic
types of taco we have in Mexico.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.500
These are the 16 from the
pages of each type of taco.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.670
We put them together so
you could see, you know,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.380
how they are very similar
in their layout.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.880
And the first taco we start
with is tacos on the grill.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.150
Of course, tacos on the grill
are the most popular tacos.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:09.140
As you see in the-- what
is this, right-hand side--

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.870
all the way to the right-hand side,
we have a map of Mexico stating

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.970
in what part of Mexico these
type of tacos are consumed.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.100
Then, we have the animal
it is made with.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.870
And finally, the instrument
you use to cook it.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.980
So, in all the 16 types of
tacos, we have that reference.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.790
And we start obviously, with the
history of that type of taco.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.090
The grill, well obviously,
the first grills

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.480
for the Mexicans were
made with wood.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.620
It was a wooden bed or
with-- even with a maguey,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.730
which is a plant we'll talk about
later, and they put their food.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.890
Before animals came
with the Spaniards,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:01.070
they cooked dogs, fish,
game, et cetera.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.410
And so, tacos on the grill
became very popular, but--

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.430
especially in the northern
part of Mexico.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.770
We will find out through the book
that taco is such a rich, rich,

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:17.070
rich, rich dish that it
has thousands and thousands

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.890
of interpretations
because each region

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.900
of the country has
different backgrounds

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.330
and that produces a different
type of preparing the food

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.700
and of ingredients obviously.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.270
So, tacos on the grill are eaten
in the northern part of Mexico.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:43.780
And in that part, they don't
eat as much maize tortillas.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.330
The Spaniards who went
to the northern part

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.060
of Mexico brought along as
well flour, wheat flour.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.220
So, there's a custom there
to eat the tacos with flour.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.630
Here in the United States, flour
tortillas are very popular.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.590
Those are done with
flour and a bit of lard

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.840
to give them their
plasticity and their flavor.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.900
So, that's the northern
part of Mexico.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:16.190
And, you know, thinking about
the way we talk about ourselves,

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.910
the way we eat, et cetera, we
thought that we had to put some

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.150
of the popular culture
sayings because everything we--

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.200
you know, the double sense
jokes, et cetera, we make,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.180
there are many related to the taco.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:37.370
For example, here, we have one
where the meat of el carnicero said

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.820
that from the head to the
cola, that means to the butt,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.440
everything is bistec de
bola, it's a way of saying,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.320
that woman is whoa, you know.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.310
So, it's a-- So, we have many of
these sayings related to taco.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.280
For example, you put a lot of cream

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.370
into your tacos means
you're very conceited,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.350
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.050
So-- And instead of
having, you know,

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.810
dots to separate the paragraphs,

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.810
we made these illustrations
of people eating a taco.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.360
So, every time you come to
a separation of paragraphs,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.910
we have people eating a taco.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.290
And finally, since it all
started in a taqueria,

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.590
we wanted to end each chapter
with an interview with a taquero.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:34.040
Being a taquero is one of the most
incredible professions in Mexico.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.030
It is sometimes inherited
by generations.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:43.270 position:56%
And people that know how to do
tacos are very proud of their trait.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.580
And they're incredible to watch.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:51.500
So, this is a-- Every
chapter ends with the recipes

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.730
because although it's great to go
to the best taquerias on the planet

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.750
and if you can, there's
nothing that competes with that.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.770
But if you insist of making tacos
in your home, we put the recipe

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.280
of those tacos at the
end of each chapter.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.860
And then obviously, a small list
of the best tacos in Mexico.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.040
Then, we have tacos on the grill.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.370
The grill was brought
as well by the Spaniards

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:27.410
as I was saying before we had
the wooden stove, et cetera.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.300
And these tacos are
written in the whole

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.630
of Mexico, it come from any animal.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.290
And what makes the
difference is the preparation,

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.230
the sauces, the chilies, et cetera.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.990
And according to the
region, these vary.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:50.250
So here for example, we have a very
famous song by a Mexican composer

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:53.190
for children music, Cri-Cri.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:59.870
And this is called the comal which
is the ancient way of cooking.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.980
It was in a grill,
but the ancient grill.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.990
And really, the grill is
just a reloaded version

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.710
of our ancient comal.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.390
So, this is a conversation
between the comal and the pot.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:19.010
And-- So, just to show you how
the taco culture is embedded

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.050
in everything you can think about.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.610
And well obviously, the interview
with this taquero whom I love

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:34.170
and he's in the cover of our
Mexican version, this is the guy.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.720
We love this guy because he says,
well, coming out-- what did I do?

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.720
Coming to Yucatan-- was it me?

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.920
OK, right, coming to-- I mean,
coming to Mexico and to Coyoacan

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.570
and not eating tacos at El-- at
the place called El Chupacabras is

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.320
like going to the zoo and
not seeing the monkeys.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.150
So, we love that, you
know, what this guy said.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.860
So, we decided to put it on the--

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.050
I don't know, if I missed
some-- yeah, there we go.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.460
So, this is the guy
from El Chupacabras.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.520
And then, we have the very
famous tacos al pastor.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.580
These tacos were invented recently.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:28.730
They were brought obviously, by the
migrants from the orient, Arabs,

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.100
Greeks, Indians, et cetera.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.220
It's just a vertical grill.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.770
But the-- An interesting
thing about tacos al pastor is

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:44.720
that unlike shawarma, gyros or
doneraki which are the oriental way

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.030
of doing these tacos, in Mexico,
we substituted the lamb for pork.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:53.760
So, most of the tacos al
pastor are done with pork.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.920
And the important thing is how
you marinate the meat during the

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.220
night time.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.930
You have like 24 hours
marination of the meat.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.740
And nobody knows exactly
why it has a pineapple.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.490
So, if anybody knows here, why,
where, who invented the thing

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.250
of having a pineapple at
the top, nobody knows.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.400
It has an onion at the bottom
and this pineapple at the top.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.030
And these are the taqueros.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.490
They are, you know, a feast to see
because they can do loads, loads,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.030 position:56%
loads, loads of tacos by the minute.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:34.480
And there are a lot of, you
know, when kids go to eat tacos,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.550
they have these competencias,
however you say it,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.630
of how many tacos can
you eat by the minute.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.150
So, it's not only the making,
but the eating as well.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:50.770 position:56%
And-- Well, I have to say that tacos
al pastor then suffered another

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.330
transformation in Mexico City.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.060
This is the only taco-- well
with taco transformation,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:01.620
we can be credited for I think,
which is to put onion and cilantro,

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.180
that's coriander in the taco,
which is called the garden.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.580
So, you have tacos with garden,

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.310
thanks to a Mexican
taqueria called El Tizoncito.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.120
Then, we have the barbacoa
tacos, very easy to make,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.920
you just do a hole in your
garden, about six feet deep.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:26.060
And inside the hole, you
put some volcanic rocks,

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.270
you can get them anywhere,
volcanic rocks.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.650
And on top of the volcanic
rocks, you put maguey leaves,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:39.000 position:56%
which is the plant out of which of
its different varieties you get out,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.490
tequila, mezcal, et cetera.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.360
Maguey is a very important
plant in Mexico.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:50.690
So, they put these maguey
leaves and the lamb,

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.070
it has to be a very young lamb.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.630
Preferably, before the
lamb mates, that's a very--

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:04.170
they call it kid lamb, I think,
which is at least 45 days old.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.750
And they do this because
when the lamb mates,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.430
it secretes a substance from, I
don't know, it's like a hormone

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.570
or something that makes
the meat stink.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:23.080
So, that's why it's preferable
to kill a very young lamb.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.570
And so, these are the
barbacoa tacos.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.630
And this type, besides
being a special taco,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.180
it's a type of cooking.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.880 position:56%
So, we use this pit on the ground
to cook many things, cochinita pibil

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.790
and many other dishes
that are representative

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.900
of different parts of the country.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.560
Birria, for example,
is a type of barbacoa,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.570
but it's done in a different way

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.050
with different marination
and it has a soup.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.950
You always see the
soup with the birria.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.030
And it's specifically eaten
in the central part of Mexico,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.580
especially in Jalisco, Guadalajara.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.330
I guess that many of you
have been to Guadalajara.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.490
So when you go there, the
thing to eat is birria.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.890
I'm going to go a bit faster.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.250
How much time do I have?

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.400
Because I still have
like 13 tacos to go.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.060
So, the head meat tacos, I don't
know, I don't eat head meat tacos

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.570
but our-- there are people
that would give their lives

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.550
for a good head meat tacos.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.290
There's the part which
is called maciza

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.910
which is the strongest
part of the head.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.290
And then obviously,
you can eat the cheek,

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.310
the tongue, the eyes, et cetera.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.510
And then, if you don't
know which one you want,

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.460
you can have a combination of every
thing which is called a combo.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.800
So, you can have all
the head, you know,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.860 position:56%
sliced into pieces inside your taco.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.650
These tacos are great because
they are homemade every single day

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.440
by usually the guy and his wife
or just the guy or just the wife.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.790
But you can usually see around the
country these guys with their bikes

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:13.260
and a basket beside-- in the back
part covered with some plastic.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.750
And inside that basket, there's
these tacos, which they heat--

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:23.150
they maintain the heat
so you can eat them,

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.730
usually like at 12
o'clock and daytime.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.920
So, if you go around Mexico,
you'll see these guys, you know,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.550
just they are in the corner,
and you can have a taco sudado.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.880
They're usually filled
with-- filled--

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.150 position:56%
I'm sorry, with beans or with mashed
potatoes prepared in a certain way

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.420
and obviously, meat tacos.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.850
Then, we have the carnitas
tacos which is pork tacos.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.190
And one of the great
things about this taco is

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.340
that not only the meat is
used, but the skin is pressed,

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.830
and a thing called
chicharron is eaten as well.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.960
And it's a big favorite
with guacamole.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.730
Chicharron with guacamole is one

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:12.760
of the derivatives
of this type of dish.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.290
Then, we have the chilorio
tacos, which are eaten

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.930
in the northern part of Mexico.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:24.610
It's, again, a taco which
is similar to chorizo.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.610
But instead of putting it in a
tripe, like you do with salami

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.990
or stuff like that, it's
just eaten like that.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:37.040
And it's a thing of the
State of Sinaloa, probably,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.620
you've heard of Mazatlan.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.620
And then, that's where they
eat these chilorio tacos.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.430
Cochinita pibil is the most famous
dish from the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.850
Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Campeche.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:57.440 position:56%
And this type of tacos are done
exactly the same way as the barbacoa

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.810
and the birria, which you saw
with this pit on the ground

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.730
and they put-- exactly, the
same process, but with pork.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.830
And here, the interesting thing is
the pork is marinated with a lot

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:15.710
of salsas and spices
that were not Mexican.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:22.810
All these spices came from Europe
like, for example, we have oregano.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.910
They put pepper, we
didn't have pepper,

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.760
pepper is one of the
important ingredients for this.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.280 position:56%
And afterwards, you have to put
onion, we didn't have onions either.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.140
You have to put those onions
in a special type of vinegar

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.410
and then you put it on top of
the taco and it's delicious.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:45.220
That onion is done with
peppercorns as well.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.790
The stewed tacos which
are my favorite

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:52.550
because I stopped eating
meat, as you might imagine.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:59.310
The stewed tacos are any type
of thing you can, you know,

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:07.950 position:56%
cook like rajas, chili rajas and
then with vegetables like the flower

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.440
of the squash, which are
delicious, et cetera, guacamole

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.850
and many other things that can
be done to eat stewed tacos.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:22.170
And then, this is my favorite.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.740
We became so obsessed with
these parts of the book

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.580
that we recently did a book
especially on eating insects

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.070
because insects are one of the
most ancient traditions in Mexico,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.240
not only in Mexico but in
many parts of the world.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.830
And somehow, insects have
been satanized, they're like--

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.620 position:56%
seen like the devil itself because--

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.450
well basically, because of the
movies and all the science fiction

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:54.930
that always-- you know, the bad
guy has the face of an insect.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:58.730
So, we're very scared of
insects but we shouldn't be

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.960
because insects are
the living creatures

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.480
that have the most high content
of protein in the planet.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:15.760
If you compare an insect to a
cow, it has like 30% more protein.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.540
And the process it takes to
produce a kilo of protein

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:27.090
of insects takes the third part
of energy as producing meat

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.000
that comes from cows, et cetera.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.560
So, we think that eating insects
will be the future of this planet.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.840
We became fascinated
with the subject.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:45.140 position:56%
I brought you-- This is the book we
just published called "Agridofagia",

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.740
which means eating
grasshoppers or crickets.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:55.060
And I think it's interesting to
know how-- besides, you know,

00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.140
all the incredible dishes
that are eaten like crickets,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:06.830 position:56%
the worms that grow in the leaves of
the maguey, the two types of worms

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.020
and the jumiles, which
you have to eat alive.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.320
I haven't eaten those.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.360
But it's supposed-- Then,
you know, it crawls,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.340
you can see people eating those
and crawling through the--

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.850 position:56%
to the faces of the people that are
eating them because the flavor comes

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.510
out when you eat them alive.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.030
And obviously, you can
eat all types of insects.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:32.470 position:56%
But what is incredible is that
Mexico has the most important number

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.430
of edible insects in the world.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:41.540
We have 549 species of insects
which makes us a very rich country.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.260
And I hope we, you know,
can do something about it.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.280
Then, insects are being
processed to do flour with them.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.400
And it is the flour that has the
highest protein content you can

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.700
ever find.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.500
I think, there's a big
industry here in Texas.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.640
And in Canada, they're doing
this flour thing as well.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:09.120
And now, you have crunch bars,
even dog food made out of insects

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.540
with very high protein content.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.340
Well then, we have the mixiote
tacos, which are pig tacos,

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:21.730
but they are wrapped
around a very fine layer

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:27.380
that the maguey has,
this outer layer.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.010
With it, you wrap the meat.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.840
And so, it gives it
an incredible flavor.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.290
Sadly enough, the maguey is a
plant in danger of extinction.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.260
So now, they sell you
these very fine papers

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.200
which with you can wrap
the mixiote around.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.070
And my favorite as well,
the seafood and fish tacos.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.370
We have two very large
coasts in Mexico,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.540
the Atlantic and the Pacific.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.730
And fish tacos have
become very popular.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.070
You have now, for example,
fish tacos al pastor

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:09.120 position:56%
which is marinated fish in the style
of the pig thing but with fish.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.380
And all through the coast, you
have seafood and fish tacos

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.930
that are fantastic
depending on the catch.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:22.350
For example, in Tijuana,
in a place called Rosarito,

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.600
you have lobster tacos
that are eaten

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.890
with a gigantic tortilla
called tortilla sobaquera,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.800
which is made with flour.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.880
And it's called sobaquera
because it's

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.380
so big you could put
it under the armpit.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.740
And so, these tacos
are made with lobster.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:46.510
And what is amazing is that you put
butter into it with rice and beans.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.480
And it's the most delicious
thing you will ever taste.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.230
I strongly recommend
that you go to Rosarito

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.130
to eat these lobster tacos,
they're one of a kind.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.820
And-- Well, as you can see there,

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.180
there we see where
these tacos are eaten.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:08.110
And finally, suadero tacos
which is different parts

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:12.790
of the body of the pig and the cow.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:18.470 position:56%
Deep fried tacos, which are any
kind of taco that you deep fry them.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:24.650 position:56%
And we thought it was interesting to
have the instructions to eat a taco.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.270
Not only, you know, more
or less you have an idea

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.740
of the vast array of tacos we have.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.900
And now, it's important
to know how to eat it.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.140
Because if you eat a taco
like this, all the guacamole

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.690
and the salsa will drop in
your shirt, which is not good

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.720
and you will not look like a
taco expert if you do that.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.130
So, you have to incline
your body and you have

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:55.110
to take the taco lifting
your-- this finger like that,

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.600
because you can't hold
the taco like this, no,

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.220
it's-- no, not done that way.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.050
And then, you know, everywhere
where there's a taco place,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.390
there always is a dog around.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.580
So, you don't have to kick
the dogs, they're friends.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:16.400
OK. And-- Well, many people say,
"OK, but what about enchiladas

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.160
and all the other types of tacos?"

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.950
Well, we believe, OK, these
are derivatives from the taco,

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.190
but they're not a taco because
you can't eat them like this.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.590
You wouldn't want to eat
an enchilada like this.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:33.580
So, these are like cousins of--
to the taco which are enchiladas,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.680
and of course we have
thousands of way of--

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.100
ways of doing the enchiladas.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.310
The quesadillas of course
which are not properly tacos

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.400
because the tortilla is
folded in another way.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.490
And strangely enough, although
quesadillas means cheese

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.320
with a tortilla, the majority

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.190
of quesadillas are
not done with cheese.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.000
So, that's a mystery.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.970
They're called quesadillas because
of the way you fold the tortilla.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:09.230
But inside, you can find, I don't
now, mushrooms, the flower of--

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.760 position:56%
squash flower, I'm sorry, et cetera.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.810
So then, we have the very popular
tlayudas from the state of Oaxaca

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:23.550 position:56%
which are gigantic tostadas that can
measure up to, I don't know about--

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:28.180
I don't know how to say it
in inches, but very big.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:33.930
And they're done with a very
special cooking process with lard,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:39.000
with beans, with cheese,
avocado, the meat of your choice,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.320
especially tasajo which is the meat
they eat in Oaxaca which is a meat

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.870
that is cured in salt and that way,

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.420
you can keep the meat fresh
for a long, long time.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.240
That way, the meat is done as well
in the northern part of Mexico,

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.960
where not always we
had refrigerators.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.620
So this way, you can keep the
meat fresh for a long time.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.900
So, we have tlayudas.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:09.330
And then, we have this appendix of
all the near cousins of the tacos,

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:12.230
where we have tamales, et cetera.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.340
We call it vitamin T,
which are tacos, tamales,

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.030
and it's what makes us strong.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:24.790
So, this is the vitamin T where
we have the picadas, pellizcadas,

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:29.840
salbutes, sopitos, chambergos,
gorditas, gorditas with pork rinds,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.000
cazuelitas, et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.420
And obviously, the tamales
which are, you know,

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.920
another book in itself
because there are loads

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.950
of different types of tamales.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:44.800
And I was telling you in
this holy trinity of the taco

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.630
that entails the tortilla,
the filling.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.050
There couldn't be a taco
book without the salsas.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:58.910
So, we have the recipes
for 36 different salsas,

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:04.430 position:56%
the main difference being those that
you cook or those that are uncooked.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:09.880
And obviously, the flavor
depends on the incredible number

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.030
of chilies we have
available in Mexico.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.900
And we couldn't leave
out the guacamole,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.620
which is a chapter in itself.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.950
And there are many ways
of doing a guacamole.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.020
Everyone can swear by the bible

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.270
which is the best guacamole
in the world.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.860
There are those who say that
you absolutely have to put lemon

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.040
into the guacamole, others
that say that pepper.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.780
But what we are sure--
very sure about is

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.920
that you don't put green
beans in the guacamole.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.930
The New York Times which
is a very respectful

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:51.750
and fantastic publication
came out with this taco--

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:56.880
guacamole recipe with green
beans, and everybody went crazy,

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:04.720
especially President Obama who
immediately tweeted, please, no,

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.190
there's no green-- the
peas, peas, I'm sorry,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.380
green peas in the guacamole.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.160
And finally, came to
terms of agreement

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.410
with Jeb Bush on the subject.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.420
So, that's a guacamole.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.450
And this is the whole salsa.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:27.670
So, as we were finishing the book
and having all these references

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:31.350
to the-- to all the parts of Mexico
that have all these different types

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:36.980
of tacos, we figured out that
our map is a map of a taco.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:43.070
So, we did this tacography to
show the incredible vast amount

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.360
of tacos we have and that
any region you go to,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.940
you will have a different type
of taco and within that region,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.480
millions of different types
of preparing that taco.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:01.130 position:56%
So, this is just to show you how the
taco itself is a universe and it's,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:05.380
well I think, one of the
most rich dishes we can eat.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.410
It shows that our culture
is embedded in a very,

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:16.360
very rich antique tradition
that makes us, you know,

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.700
very proud of our food
and of being Mexican.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.410
And I'm very happy to have
shared this with you today.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.210

No time? Well, there's--
no questions.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.790
We did this video.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.150

this video just

is to eat tacos in Mexico.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:56.150

this with the many Mexicans
