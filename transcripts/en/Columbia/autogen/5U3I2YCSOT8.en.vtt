00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.990
hand hygiene is very interesting because

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
hand hygiene is very interesting because
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.730
hand hygiene is very interesting because
it really involves trying to change

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
it really involves trying to change
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.220
it really involves trying to change
behavior because when I first study hand

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230
behavior because when I first study hand
 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.510
behavior because when I first study hand
hygiene I was looking at the

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520
hygiene I was looking at the
 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.790
hygiene I was looking at the
microbiology what germs grow on your

hands what soaps work the best and what

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
hands what soaps work the best and what
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.000
hands what soaps work the best and what
I learned after a period of years is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
I learned after a period of years is
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920
I learned after a period of years is
that it doesn't really matter if you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
that it doesn't really matter if you
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.500
that it doesn't really matter if you
even had the perfect soap if nobody uses

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
even had the perfect soap if nobody uses
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050
even had the perfect soap if nobody uses
it then it's not gonna make a difference

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
it then it's not gonna make a difference
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960
it then it's not gonna make a difference
so my interest sort of changed over

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
so my interest sort of changed over
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089
so my interest sort of changed over
years from sort of more of a micro

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
years from sort of more of a micro
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.849
years from sort of more of a micro
biologic emphasis to how do we change

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859
biologic emphasis to how do we change
 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.029
biologic emphasis to how do we change
behavior it's been a very stubborn

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039
behavior it's been a very stubborn
 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.849
behavior it's been a very stubborn
problem and whether it has to do with

infection or whatever there have been
 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.129
infection or whatever there have been
major efforts now to change not just

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:52.139
major efforts now to change not just
 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.439
major efforts now to change not just
individual behavior but the systems in

individual behavior but the systems in
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.289
individual behavior but the systems in
which people work to make it easy to do

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299
which people work to make it easy to do
 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.299
which people work to make it easy to do
the right thing people are often advised

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
the right thing people are often advised
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160
the right thing people are often advised
to sing happy birthday when they wash

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
to sing happy birthday when they wash
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139
to sing happy birthday when they wash
their hands but you could sing happy

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
their hands but you could sing happy
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939
their hands but you could sing happy
birthday 20 times and be washing your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
birthday 20 times and be washing your
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410
birthday 20 times and be washing your
hands and yet still wouldn't work you'd

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
hands and yet still wouldn't work you'd
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120
hands and yet still wouldn't work you'd
be doing it wrong because if you look at

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
be doing it wrong because if you look at
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070
be doing it wrong because if you look at
the way people often wash their hands

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
the way people often wash their hands
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560
the way people often wash their hands
they rub their palms together but it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
they rub their palms together but it's
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.180
they rub their palms together but it's
the fingertips that are actually

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190
the fingertips that are actually
 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.340
the fingertips that are actually
touching people and touching other

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
touching people and touching other
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530
touching people and touching other
things so when you wash the hands the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
things so when you wash the hands the
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420
things so when you wash the hands the
main thing is not the time but just to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
main thing is not the time but just to
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.610
main thing is not the time but just to
make sure that you get all the surfaces

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620
make sure that you get all the surfaces
 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.040
make sure that you get all the surfaces
between and particularly around the nail

have to worry about a sink you can have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
have to worry about a sink you can have
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.900
have to worry about a sink you can have

enough you need to use enough so that
you can actually rub it in with your

you can actually rub it in with your
 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.980
you can actually rub it in with your
fingernails like this and then rub like

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
fingernails like this and then rub like
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.520

and the alcohol works as long as it's
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850
and the alcohol works as long as it's
wet so you have to put enough on so that

wet so you have to put enough on so that
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590
wet so you have to put enough on so that
it doesn't immediately dry when you put

it doesn't immediately dry when you put
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229

about 30% of healthcare-associated

about 30% of healthcare-associated

about 30% of healthcare-associated

infections were
preventible now we think it's probably

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
preventible now we think it's probably
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.660
preventible now we think it's probably
more like 70% so let's say that I am

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
more like 70% so let's say that I am
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.430
more like 70% so let's say that I am
working with you and you're my patient

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
working with you and you're my patient
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.530
working with you and you're my patient
and I don't wash my hands

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540
and I don't wash my hands
 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.240
and I don't wash my hands
the chances that you're going to get

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250
the chances that you're going to get
 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.650
the chances that you're going to get
infection are pretty low but if you have

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
infection are pretty low but if you have
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.950
infection are pretty low but if you have
open wound if your immune system is weak

open wound if your immune system is weak
 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.280
open wound if your immune system is weak
that kind of thing you will will likely

that kind of thing you will will likely
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.490
that kind of thing you will will likely
get an infection so the the problem is

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
get an infection so the the problem is
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.270
