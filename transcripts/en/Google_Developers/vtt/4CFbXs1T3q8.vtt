ROMAN NURIK: I think onboarding
is one of the hardest

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.700
things to design, right?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.580
Those first 30 seconds of
using an app are critical.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.880
If users get annoyed or confused
in those first 30 seconds

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.700
they're just going to
uninstall your app.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.930
Then all that work
you spent designing

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.320
every single little
interaction to its perfection

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.382
in the rest of the app is just
going to kind of go to waste.

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:21.340
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.580
I'm a designer on the Firebase
team here at Google New York.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.430
Today I want to show you
the onboarding experience

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.080
for this app called Notion.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.260
It's an email app, and I
think the way it onboards

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.820
new users is done really well.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
It's really interesting.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.640
So let's take a look.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640
So I'm going to go ahead
and open up the app,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.190
and the first thing it does
is it asks me for permission

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.980
to access my contacts,
which makes a lot of sense

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.760
for an email app.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.500
So I'll go ahead and accept.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.279
One thing it could do is maybe
ask for this a little bit later

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:52.570
in a slightly more contextual
way, but I think overall,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.500
this is fine.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.090
Next it's going to
ask me to sign in,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.465
and the nice thing here is I
don't have to type anything.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.860
I don't have to enter
an email and a password.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.750
It's looked at the
stuff on my device

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.220
and it's let me just choose
something and move forward.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.700
One thing I should say here
is that for an email app

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.090
this makes a lot of
sense, but most apps,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.920
you should try to probably
avoid requiring sign

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.750
in or registration up front.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.700
You probably want
to give the user

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.950
a sampling of your
content, a little bit

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.930
of a feel for your
app before asking

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.640
them to commit to your app.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.010
The next thing it does
is it asks me to choose

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.110
a notification frequency.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.110
This is really clear and
makes a lot of sense as well,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.870
but one of the things
I might suggest here

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.410
is you could potentially
just show notifications,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.030
and then in that
first notification

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.532
that a user receives, they could
choose their desired frequency.

00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:41.740
I think this is fine, though.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.680
This is very common to ask
about notifications up front,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.749
so it's OK.

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.290
But this could be
potentially one way

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.270
to reduce the number of steps
in onboarding, which is really,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.030
really good for conversions.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.890
The next thing that
it does is it shows

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.390
me this conversational card.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.890
It shows me my
email, but then it

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.534
says Notion needs a little bit
of time to understand my email.

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:01.450
I think this is great.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.600
It's really friendly.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.975
It's really engaging.

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:05.350
It makes it feel
like I'm talking

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.080
to a human, which really
makes this app approachable.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.135
Now, once Notion
understands my email,

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.010
it's going to take me
through a tutorial that

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.710
teaches me about some of
the more advanced features.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.240
And the first step
here is it shows

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.520
me the difference between
important and unimportant

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.230
emails.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.730
I think one of the things that
could be a little better here

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.240
is there could be a slightly
less subtle visual distinction

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.080
between these.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.040
It's a little unclear--

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.050
or less clear-- which
one's important,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.060
which one's unimportant.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.870
So either using some sort of
motion or showing it in context

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.250
might work a little better.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.410
Now this next step is
really, really interesting.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.740
Most tutorials have a
Next button in every step,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.080
but here there's no Next button.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.770
To proceed you have to
use this gesture to swipe.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.340
I think this is kind
of a gutsy move.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.600
It's really good to
kind of force people

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.790
to learn this key
interaction, and I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.520
think this makes a lot of sense
because it's really important

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.540
that I learn this.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.280
If I don't learn
this, I'm missing out

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160
on a huge part of this app.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.360
So I'll go ahead and
make that gesture,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.580
and then it shows me the results
of having done that gesture.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.670
So it kind of gives me
that sense of confidence

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.550
that this is what happens
after I take that action.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.620
So this last bit here is I've
learned how to use Notion,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.050
I'm scrolling through, and
you'll see this floating action

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.860
button that shows a number or
a count of unimportant e-mails

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.060
that Notion has found
for me to archive.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.410
So once I press this, it selects
all those unimportant emails

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.190
and then I can take
action, archive or delete.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.780
Now the cool thing is,
once I press archive,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.600
it shows me a way to
make that even faster.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.970
I think this is super,
super important.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.080
It's taken this context of
I just performed an action,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.660
and it's teaching me about
ways that I can speed that up

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.690
even more.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.360
One of the notes
here is that I think

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.535
this uses a dialogue which
takes me out of my flow.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:54.160
One of the things
that the app could do

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.340
is potentially show a bottom
sheet that isn't modal.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.510
So that's how Notion
onboards new users.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.650
I think it's really,
really delightful overall.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.108
I think the fact
that I didn't have

00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:06.250
to type anything in the
first couple of seconds,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.125
I could just select an
existing email account

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.910
to sign in was excellent.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.590
You definitely don't
want to lose users

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.066
just because you have these long
complicated forms to fill out.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.690
Also, one thing that's
really important

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.209
is the language they use
was really friendly, casual,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.130
informal.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.400
And that kind of tone,
that kind of language

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.260
makes it much easier
for users to form

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.010
an emotional bond with your app,
which I think is really great.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.720
And lastly, I think
that Notion was

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.180
really sensitive to context.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.490
It almost felt like the
actions I was taking,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.080
Notion was responding to really
well in the right moment.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.350
So I think that overall,
it's a job really well done.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.167
Definitely take a look at the
app if you get a chance to,

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.000
especially if you're
designing an onboarding

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.010
experience for your own app.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.940
So that was my take on
Notion's onboarding experience.
