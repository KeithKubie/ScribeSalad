00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.880
INTERVIEWER: War is a
devastating but real part

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.150
of life that affects millions
of people around the world.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.760
We see the explosions
and troops on TV.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.550
War leaves behind scarred
earth and communities

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.720
left to pick up the
pieces, trying to rebuild

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.480
the life they once knew.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
And in some cases, using
the remnants of war to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.205
do just that.

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:25.510
MARK WATSON: My
name is Mark Watson.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.120
I'm a professional
photographer based

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.320
in Lyttelton, New Zealand.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.150
This image was taken in the
southeast Asian country of Laos

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.709
in Khammouane Province.

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.750
INTERVIEWER: Mark was in
Laos during an epic bike

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.740
tour of Asia, starting in China
and riding 13,000 kilometers

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.470
to Indonesia, a trip
that lasted nine months.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.060
MARK WATSON: Our route took us
through China, Laos, Vietnam,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.120
Cambodia, Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.080
We chose to keep our
trip to rural areas

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.160
mostly and in the
mountains and high country

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.120
as much as possible.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.002
I find it fascinating to see how
people live in remote places.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.210
INTERVIEWER: But it was
after entering Laos that Mark

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.617
discovered a new fascination.

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.700
MARK WATSON: I became
curious about this war scrap

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.040
everywhere, shrapnel,
bomb casings,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.110
cylinders from cluster bombs,
and the long-range fuel

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.280
canisters.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.120
During the years 1953 to
1975, a fierce civil war

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.740
was fought in Laos.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.676
In many ways, this
conflict was overshadowed

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:21.050
by the war in
neighboring Vietnam

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.140
because both the American and
Vietnamese governments denied

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.440
their involvement in it.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.050
From 1964 to 1973,
the US dropped

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.060
more than 2 million
tons of ordinance

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.210
on Laos during 580,000
bombing missions.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.190
That's equal to a plane load
of bombs every 8 minutes,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.400
24 hours a day, for 9 years.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.710
This makes Laos the must heavily
bombed country per capita

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.370
in history.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.310
INTERVIEWER: But it wasn't
the military history

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.060
Mark was interested in.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.150
It was what happened after,
after the bombs ceased

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.102
and the troops returned home.

00:01:56.102 --> 00:01:58.060
MARK WATSON: Up to a
third of the bombs dropped

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.290
did not explode, leaving
Laos contaminated

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.600
with vast quantities of
unexploded ordinance.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.480
Scrap from such
widespread bombing

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.850
has been utilized in
people's homes and villages

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.100
for everything from house
foundations to planter boxes,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.760
to buckets, cups, and cow bells.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.780
This photo is of
local canoes that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.190
been fabricated from war
scrap, because I recognize

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.580
them to have been made from
the discarded long-range fuel

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.482
tanks from American bombers.

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:23.940
INTERVIEWER: It's
a resourceful way

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.010
to deal with something that
caused so much tragedy,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.252
but unfortunately, some
tragedies continue.

00:02:30.252 --> 00:02:32.710
MARK WATSON: Over 20,000 people
have been killed or injured

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.270
by unexploded ordinance in
Laos since the bombing ceased.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.920
To this day, these
munitions are still

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.520
scattered throughout
the countryside

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.090
and are frequently found and
often accidentally detonated.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.560
This also created a
scrap metal industry,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.050
which is now shrinking
but has been responsible

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.030
for many deaths as poor
villages recover and exchange

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.929
this dangerous
resource for money.

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.470
INTERVIEWER: Today
there are a number

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.020
of NGOs working to clear Laos
of these mines and bombs,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.060
but at the current rate it
could take more than 100 years

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.170
to clear them all.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900
In the meantime,
people here are going

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.390
to have to continue to live
alongside these deadly relics

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.700
of war.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.350
Photography undoubtedly
has the power

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.260
to change the way we
feel about many things,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.490
including our ideas on war.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.150
Check out this
episode next on how

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.170
photographers on the front
lines are doing just this.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.580
SUBJECT: When people
started to photograph war,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.630
these images helped bring the
realism and the horror of it

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.270
to the world, to people living
far away from the conflict.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.520
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.260
Thanks for watching.
