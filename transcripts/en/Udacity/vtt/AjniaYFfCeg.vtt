00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.410
Why don't you try doing some basic analysis on our Sochi Olympic

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.010
medal count data?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.260
Using the data frame you created in the previous exercise, compute the average

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.220
number of bronze medals earned by countries who earned at least one gold medal.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.080
Save this to a variable named avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.120
Your code should go here
