Why the Inside of Apples Turn Brown When Exposed
to Air

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.160
If you’ve ever wondered why the inside of
apples turn brown when exposed to air, well,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.199
wonder no more.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.310
The insides of apples turn brown when exposed
to air thanks to a built in defense mechanism

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.320
against bacteria and fungus.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.170
The trigger for this is damage to the cells,
such as when you cut the apple, which then

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.050
results in certain enzymes within the cells
being exposed to oxygen.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.579
When this happens, the enzymes react to the
oxygen creating an oxidized layer that provides

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.640
some protection against foreign bodies.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.609
More technically, an enzyme called polyphenol
oxidase (also known as tyrosinase), which

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.879
is comprised of monophenol oxidase and catechol
oxidase enzymes, when exposed to oxygen will

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.399
result in phenolic compounds in the apple
tissue turning into ortho-quinones or “o-quinones.”

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.670
O-quinones are what is providing the protection
from bacteria and fungi as they form a natural

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.770
antiseptic.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.380
The o-quinones themselves have no color, but
they further react with amino acids and oxygen

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.050
to produce melanin, which is how we get the
brown color on the cut cells of the apple.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.980
If you want to keep cut open apples from going
brown quickly as they do when just sitting

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.230
on the kitchen counter, simply place them
in a refrigerator.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.540
This will drastically slow the chemical reactions
and thus the oxidation process.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.469
You can also, of course, limit the apple’s
exposure to air via sealing it in an airtight

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.950
bag or jar.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.710
Another option here is to put the cut apple
in water for a similar effect.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.390
If you don’t mind a lemony flavor, spray
the exposed area in pineapple or lemon juice.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.420
This will stop the polyphenol oxidase from
reacting to oxygen thanks primarily to the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
acidity of the juices which denature the browning
enzymes.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.729
(This also works with avocados, potatoes,
etc. for the same reason.)

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.070
If you don’t like the taste of lemons, a
similar method involves rubbing the surface

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.380
of the apple in salt, sugar, or some form
of syrup.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.960
Yet another method of stopping the browning
process is to heat the apple to extreme levels,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.579
which if the temperature is high enough is
another way to denature the polyphenol oxidase.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.510
This is commonly done when making things like
apple pie by dropping the apples in boiling

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.569
water and leaving them there for a few minutes.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.650
Bonus Facts:
• Cocoa, tea, apple juice, and coffee are

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.099
all varying levels of brown for the exact
same reason a freshly cut apple’s pulp turns

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.880
brown- polyphenol oxidase.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.459
Polyphenol oxidase also is needed in the browning
of humans, once again involved in the process

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:43.390
of creating melanin.
