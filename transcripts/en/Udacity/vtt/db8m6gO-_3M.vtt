00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.051
Here's the sum of two more trinomials. These trinomials are a little bit more

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:08.290
complicated because they have multiple variables with exponents. I want you to

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.511
try this one out. What do you think the sum of this trinomial and this trinomial

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.534
would be? Enter your answer here. You might stumble a little bit on this one,

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:19.217
which is totally okay. I want you to try your best.
