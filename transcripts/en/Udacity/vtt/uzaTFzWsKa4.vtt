00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 83.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you remember this method, you realize there were four quartiles,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and individual elements separate those.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This one's called the median, the lower, and the upper quartile,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and these guys are the ones being picked.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, 163 - 3 special elements makes 160, divided by 4, makes each of these 40.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We pick the two center 40s, plus these three special elements and get 83.
