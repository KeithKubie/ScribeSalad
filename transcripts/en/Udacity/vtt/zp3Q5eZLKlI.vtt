00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.700
So you understand focus and

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.910
you understand semantics,
two crucial pillars of accessibility.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.595
To wrap things up, let's spend
some time talking about styling.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.500
Now this is a broad topic,
but I'm going to try and

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.800
segment it into a few important areas.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.198
The first is ensuring that our elements
are styled to support the accessibility

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:19.678
of work that we've already done.

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:24.210
This means adding styles for
focus and various ARIA states.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.864
Once you've got that squared away,
we can look at how to make sure our

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:31.140
UIs are flexible, and
can handle being zoomed or scaled up for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.801
users who may have trouble
reading smaller text.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.932
Lastly, I'll talk about color choices,
look at the importance of contrast and

00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:41.410
making sure we're not conveying
information with color, alone.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.860
So there's a lot to cover.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.360
Let's get started.
