00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:09.642
Onkuri:<i> Government agencies in
 many parts of the world</i>

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.310
<i>either don't know much about</i>

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.379
<i> the problem of
 wildlife trafficking</i>

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.016
<i>or they might be understaffed,
they might be under-trained,</i>

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.818
<i>they might be under-equipped.</i>

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.121 line:0%
So, we go in to help them and
supplement their efforts.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.390 line:0%
We give them
investigation training

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.892 line:0%
we sometimes act as decoy buyers

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.295
to help them gather
evidence that they need.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.997
<i> This is a
 typical seizure.</i>

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:35.168
<i>Each one those little blue bags
contains one balled-up pangolin.</i>

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:39.005
<i>A typical seizure can have
anything from 50-200 animals</i>

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.775
and they are transported
under extraordinarily

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.244
unhygienic and
inhuman conditions.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:48.214
They're just balled-up
and stuffed into boxes.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.282
They may be, you
know, half-starved

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:54.754
and certainly dehydrated by the
time they reach the market.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.556
Then to increase their
body weight

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.525
they are force-fed flour
and sometimes even cement

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.594
just so they can
make more money.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.830
<i> Another trade we worked
on was the exotic pet trade.</i>

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.435
<i> This is a fairly typical
 tourist night spot where</i>

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.938
<i> these people walk around
 and they ask tourists</i>

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.073
<i> to take pictures
 with slow lorises.</i>

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.809
<i> These animals are all
 poached from the wild</i>

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.176
<i> and their teeth
 are yanked out</i>

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.745
<i> so they don't bite
 the tourists.</i>

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.614
<i> And when we were working
with the police team on this</i>

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.750
<i>one of my colleagues who doesn't
 always do investigations</i>

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.752
she asked me,
"Do you not sometimes

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.755
feel bad about what
you are doing?"

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.089
In the sense that you are

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.958
gaining the trust of
these traffickers.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.493
Obviously they like you and
they talk to you nicely

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.428
and then you get them arrested.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.531
And I thought about it
and I realized that

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:40.966
no, I don't feel bad for them.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:46.372
- ( audience laughter )
- ( applause )

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.675
That's because...

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.776
That's because once
you go undercover

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:51.911
and you start talking to them

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.315
you realize they feel
nothing for these animals.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.650
One of the traffickers we
talked to, she told us

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.153
about how she would smuggle
baby slow lorises.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.654
She would put them
in little boxes

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.291
little cardboard boxes and put
all those cardboard boxes

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.460
inside a big suitcase
to send by air.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.195
The animals were sedated.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.365
And she told me that if
all the animals survive

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.734
then obviously she was
giving them too much air

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.269
and she could cram in a
few more the next time.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.006
But if less than half survive,
then she would consider

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.809
putting them in slightly
larger cardboard boxes.
