&gt;&gt;Craig Barrrett: Hi, You Tube.
When is the economy going to recover? Well,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.720
actually no one really saw the depth that
we were going to plunge to. Nobody saw the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.580
financial meltdown. So all those experts who
are telling you exactly when it's going to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.099
recover, I think have established their credentials
well in advance.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.349
We know it's going to recover. My only comment
to CEOs and to business people alike is continue

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.160
to invest in new products, new technology.
Every time you have a recession you try to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.121
save your way out of it. Never works. You
have to invest your way out of a recession.

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:42.329
The economy will get better when we get new
products, new technology, new capability to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.989
bring to the citizens of the world. So remember
to keep the investment stream going.
