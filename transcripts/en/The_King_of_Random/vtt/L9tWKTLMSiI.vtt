00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.420
Guys, we showed you how to make a bow
out of some PVC and some fiberglass.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.220
Now, it's time to learn how
to make arrows that are so soft,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.270
you can get shot in the face,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.100
and not worry about
whether it's going to hurt.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100

[Music]

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.720
[Music]

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.890
To get started with this build,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.360
there's a couple of
things we need to pick up.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.100
The first is some blank arrows,
and by blank arrows,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.080
I mean ones that
don't have tips on them.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.800
This is usually how you can buy
them at sporting good stores.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.900
It's also important to get
the arrows that are not made of wood.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.140
These are arrows that
are designed for shooting at people,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.190
and wood arrows have
the possibility of breaking

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.579
in a way that they splinter,
and keep travelling with a sharp point.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.530
The arrows made from aluminum,
carbon fiber, or fiber glass

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.359
aren't going to break
in that dangerous way.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.229
I grabbed these at the
local sporting goods store.

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.249
But of course,
they're also available online.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.079
Along with the arrows,
we have four different types of foam,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.100
each progressively
squishier than the last.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.880
I also have a scrap
of some cotton cloth,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.940
a roll of athletic tape,
and some duct tape.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.880
Each arrow will also
use a single penny,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.949
and we've got a
bottle of contact cement

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.400
to glue all the pieces together.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.700
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.020
We'll take layers
of these four types of foam,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.580
and glue them all together
in a stacked cylinder.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.200
These will add a nice cushion
onto the front of our arrow,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.690
which will cover
with a piece of cloth,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.860
and secure in place
using the athletic tape.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.110
I have a small circle,
2 inches in diameter,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.000
that I cut out of piece of cardstock.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.040
We now need to cut a few pieces
out of each of our types of foam

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.520
this exact same size.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.200
The first type of foam is a sleeping pad.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340
This whole roll is from
Walmart and cost about $6.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300
We need to cut 4 of our
2 inch circles out of this foam.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.360
[Music]

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.340
Next, we need to cut one circle
out of some floor mat foam.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.360
I have here a scrap piece,
which is perfect,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.600
because I don't need that much.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.200
If you're not able to get
your hands on some floor mat foam,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.500
a few layers of the
thicker foam from craft stores

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840
should work just as well.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.720
Next, I have a foam squishy football
that I bought at the dollar store.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.240
We want another circle
cut out of this foam

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.920
about 1 inch thick.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
[Music]

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.320
Finally, we have some seat cushion foam.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680
This stuff is super, super soft,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200
and we want to have 2 inches of this.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.620
If you have some of this foam
that's already two inches thick,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.800
you can use that.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.540
I have a 1 inch thick piece,
so, I'm going to cut out two circles.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.719
We have all of our
foam circles cut out,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.780
and we now need to cut
some holes in our first layers.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.740
Two of them will need small holes,
about the width of the arrow,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.140
and two of them will
need slightly larger holes

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.540
just slightly smaller than a penny.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.180
[Music]

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.900
Now, like I said, I do want
this slightly smaller than a penny,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.489
so I'm going to try,
and go inside of this trace line

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.380
by just about a millimeter.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.400
The holes are cut
in our first layer of foam,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.500
and now, we need to prep
the head of our arrow.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.480
Take a strip of duct tape,
and then tear it in half.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.540
We want to start winding duct tape
around the tip of the arrow head

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.240
until the tape is the
exact same diameter as a penny.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.400
[Music]

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.600
Our little tape coil is
now just as wide as a penny,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360
and we want to take a penny,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.879
press it down onto the top of that,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.500
and then use a little bit
more tape to secure that in place.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.840
This is a safeguard,
so, that no matter what happens,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.240
the tip of the arrow
can't push through the foam,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.620
and stab someone when
you shoot them with the arrow.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.019
The arrow tip is prepped.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.320
So now, we need
to start adding our foam.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.660
The first step is going to be
to glue the four bottom pieces together,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.640
making sure that all the holes
are nicely in line with each other.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.600
For gluing foam, contact cement
is the best kind of glue.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.740
It has a very strong hold,
and it goes on nicely.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.820
[Music]

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.700
The tip of our arrow is obviously
too small to fit through that bottom hole.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.769
So, we're actually going to do
is slide it down on the bottom.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.239
The fletchings, these little
feathers on the back of our srrow,

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.680
are surprisingly flexible,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.400
and will squish down
to fit through that hole.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.340
Now, we can slide
this whole cylinder foam up,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.460
and we need to fit
the head down into the foam.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.099
Because we cut the foam
smaller than the size of a penny,

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.549
it's a little bit too big,
but that will help hold it in place

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.840
when it's squished in there.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.760
Once the tip of the arrow
is levelled with the foam cylinder.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.160
It's time to add the next layer.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.959
Now, we need to do
the same things

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.480
with the next layers of foam.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.379
Our foam football piece,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.020
and then the two pieces
of our furniture foam.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.180
With all of our layers
of foam stacked up,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.360
we can now see just
how much impact that can absorb.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.880
The front really squishy bits
do a lot of absorbing,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.340
and then the back pieces of foam,
just sort of slow down the momentum

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.700
as the arrow compresses.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.180
With all of our foam
pieces glued together,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.730
we now want to add
a cloth covering over the whole thing,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.720
so that we don't accidentally
grab a piece and tear it apart.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.020
It's not super important
what cloth use for this.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.480
Something that's not
going to scrape your face

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.820
is probably a good bet,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.760
and we just need to
cut a square out of that,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.780
about 8 inches by 8 inches.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.380
Let's center the foam head of our arrow 
right in the middle of that cloth,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.040
and then let it drape down on the sides.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.120
At this point, we're going
to use our athletic tape

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.340
to secure the cloth onto the arrow.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.320
Piece of tape is just attached
to one corner of the cloth

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.120
brought down over the foam,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.320
and secure it around
the neck of the arrow.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.080
Let's do that for
all four corners of our cloth.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840
Now, we want to take
more of our athletic tape,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.000
and wrap it all the way around,
holding the corners of the cloth down.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.280
Continue wrapping all the way
down the rest of the arrow head.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.400
The wrapping should extend down
off of the arrow head onto the shaft.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.320
Make sure some of the tape
is wrapped all the way around

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.400
the gathered bits of
tape on the arrow shaft.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.780
This will help prevent it
from peeling apart later.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.120
We now have an
incredibly squishy arrow head

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.940
that soft enough that
it can hit a person at high speed

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.620
without worry of injury.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.880
Yesterday, we built our bows.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.000
Today, we built this arrow.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.400
Let's give this a test fire.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:53.640
[Music]

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.260
That's not a real slow-mo.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.320
I'm just smooshing at that.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.520
I'm just smashing it slowly.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.260
Yep.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.680
So, I just took an arrow to the eye.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.330
It was pretty much
a bull's eye or a person's eye.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.890
It was a direct shot right on my eye,

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.540
and you know what?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.220
It was startling,
but it didn't hurt.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.620
There's no pain.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.760
My eyes not like
red and bloodshot,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.620
and I'm not going to
the hospital or anything like that.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.600
Like these are very well padded.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.160
With your PVC bow,
and your well-padded arrows,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.580
you are now ready to
start hunting your friends

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.160
in a completely non-destructive way.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.800
Grab some friends,
grab some supplies,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.100
and start making these immediately.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.040
Because archery tag is a ton of fun.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.180
Guys, that's not all,
there's more for you to see.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.180
That little box up at the top

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.750
will transport you
directly to our last video,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.740
and you should go check that out.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.700
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.710
you should be watching next,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.910
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.300
so, you never miss a video.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.420
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.380
Talk to you then.
