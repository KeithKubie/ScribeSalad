&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Thank you, everyone,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.920
so much for being here today.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.930
I have some brief opening
remarks before we get

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.360
to our first wonderful panel.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.680
I wanted to begin with a
territorial acknowledgment,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
which I will read from because
I cannot memorize anything.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.990
We acknowledge the
Piscataway and Pamunke peoples,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.750
whose traditional and unseeded
territory we're gathered

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.050
upon today.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.660
Gathering here, we pay
respect to the elders,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.950
both past and present.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.420
We acknowledge the grave
harm that colonialism brought

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.030
to these lands and
in particular,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.310
the erasure of both indigenous
and African identities

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.720
under not only slavery
but racist laws

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.050
that segregated all peoples

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.680
into the binary classification
of white and black.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.060
We honor those who have
lived and do live now

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.410
at the intersections of
identity and experience

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.720
which we will be
exploring today.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.420
We also honor and thank
Piscataway Indian leader,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.600
Chief Turkey Tayac,
whose leadership

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.510
in the indigenous
social justice movement

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960
of the 20th century
played a pivotal role

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.390
in reclaiming indigenous
identity not only here

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.220
but in communities aligned with
the American Indian Movement

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.010
for self-determination
around the world.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.230
Thank you again, Dan
[assumed spelling],

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.410
for such a nice introduction.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.480
It has been just an incredible
year to spend in what,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280
I hope you'll agree,
is an incredible space,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.500
in addition to the wonderful
reading and the conversations

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.380
that I've been able to have
and events that I've been able

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.660
to organize and participate in.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.320
One of my very favorite things

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.720
about being here is just
wondering around the building

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.090
which I hope you'll take
the opportunity to do

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.010
if you have time today.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.460
My work here is focused
on, as Dan mentioned,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.700
the ethics of Mars exploration,
specifically the ways

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.380
in which our plans
for space intersect

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.270
with our histories
here on earth.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.050
And in particular, the way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.590
in which we employ historical
narratives and use those

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.440
to discuss space has a
way of reshaping the way

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.100
that we interpret what
happened here on our own planet.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.240
And so these affect not only
our understanding of the past

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.890
but of the present
and the things

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.190
that we might do in the future.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.680
And so I've been spending time
here digging into the stories,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.950
we tell about why we go to
space and who we conceive

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.530
of being an explorer,
and also, of course,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.070
the rapidly changing
policy landscape

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.900
that is now shaping what
we will do in the future.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.200
So you heard a little bit

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.020
about the chair's
position here from Dan.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.100
I wanted to remark also

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.800
that Barry Blumberg was not
himself an astrobiologist

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.930
despite having been
the first head

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.270
of the NASA Astrobiology
Institute.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.670
His specialty was actually in
infectious disease and he--

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.390
I think it's interesting that he
was the person who felt it was

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.380
so important for there
to be this dialogue

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.800
between the sciences
because he--

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.630
between the sciences
and the humanities

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.310
because he himself was a
person who was just interested

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.680
in a wide variety of things.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.280
He won the Nobel Prize actually
for identifying hepatitis B.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.950
And so when I-- some of their
reading that I got to do

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.060
about him, he was allotted as
having prevented more cases

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.360
of cancer than anyone
in history.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.680
So if anyone is looking
for something to put

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.220
in their memorial, no pressure.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.400
But he was, it sounds
like, an incredible guy.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.190
And so it's been a real
honor to spend time

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.180
in such a unique position where
one has the opportunity to deal

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.560
with both issues in
the humanity and--

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.470
in the humanities and in science
as well because very few places

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.060
or positions like
this exist, I think.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.810
So as I mentioned, one

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.310
of the things I've really
enjoyed doing is wandering

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.090
around the library aside from
our many incredible collections.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.430
We also have a wonderful
collection of Ethernet cables

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.640
that are retrofitted
in the basement.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.600
But the thing that I
specifically wanted

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.410
to touch on-- is that somebody's
alarm, I think, is going off.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.910
So, one of the things that I
happen to cross while walking

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.160
around here was Thomas
Jefferson's Library and just

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.460
down across the way there.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.770
And, what was most
striking to me

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.760
about it was not
necessarily books themselves

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.470
but actually the exploration of
the organization that he is--

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.720
which was based on
Francis Bacon's method

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.300
of organizing libraries into
memory, reason and imagine.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.750
And so, Bacon thought of this
as being memory being history,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.330
reason being philosophy

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.190
and imagination being
specifically poetry.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.990
But I immediately saw how these
three categories could really

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290
shape the way that I was
thinking about this sort

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.300
of multifaceted exploration
of Mars

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.420
and the ethics surrounding
our going there

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.050
of human beings actually
living beyond Earth.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.720
So today, we'll dive into
memory from the standpoint

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.140
of these historical narratives
that I mentioned earlier

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.700
and how they reshape-- how we
think about our own history.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.350
And we'll also talk
about reason.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.150
So not just philosophy, as
Bacon [inaudible], but also some

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.890
of the newer things that
we've discovered about Mars

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.420
and its own history and
also the policy landscape

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.300
that we're now entering
into in space.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.060
And, we'll end also
with imagination talking

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.140
about futurisms from
perspectives

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.340
that are often not centered

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.980
in the conversation
about our future.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.430
And I hope that you'll stay
the entire day if you can.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.730
I think it will be really fun.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.400
We'll also have a number
of wonderful performances

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.360
that we'll speak to each one of
the panels that we have here.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.690
So, thank you all
so much for coming

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.060
and thank you tremendously
to all of the panelists

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.800
who are here today and who
have taken the time to travel

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.700
and be part of this event.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.020
So without further ado, we'll
move on to our first panel.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.740
So, the panels today are divided
into three beats, each augmented

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.590
by a performance as
I mentioned before.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.680
And this first panel is
called the Right Stuff.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.270
So the overview for this
was that Tom Wolfe's book,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.200
"The Right Stuff",
was really seminal

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.250
in creating this archetype of
this sort of fighter pilot,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.470
space cowboy astronaut.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.750
And it really cemented that idea

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.340
of like all astronauts being
Chuck Yeager in popular culture.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.510
And, in many ways, it also
drew on frontier themes

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.940
that have been used
to talk about space.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.290
And so, in this first
panel, we'll be talking

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.590
about how these narratives

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.250
of space exploration
influence our modern ideas

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.100
about who can explore space.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.600
And what it means to really
have the right stuff and how

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.450
that meeting might evolve
and how we could change it.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.340
So without further ado, I
will introduce our panelists.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.630

Nord also communicates with
the public regarding science,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.950
science policy, diversity,
and inclusion.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.620
He trains scientists in
public communication,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.930
advocates for science
funding and works

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.850

associate in theoretical physics

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.860
at the University of Washington,
Seattle, and lead axion wrangler

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.310
and social media team member

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.010
for the NASA STROBE-X
Probe Concept Study.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.710
In 2019, she will be an
assistant professor of physics

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.880
at the University
of New Hampshire.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.170
Her driving impulse is
to understand the origin

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.800
of spacetime and the
particles that populate it,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.190
as well as how everything
got to be the way it is.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.170
Recognized as one of 15 Black
Women Who Are Paving the Way

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.300
in STEM and Breaking
Barriers by Essence Magazine.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.710
Prescod-Weinstein studies
particle astrophysics

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.010
and cosmology.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.180
And her research spans from
large scale cosmic acceleration

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.950
to the very small
dark matter particles.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.870
She also has a strong interest
in feminist philosophies

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.140
of science and science,
technology and society--

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.470
excuse me, science
technology and society studies.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.910
And she was the recipient

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.760
of the 2017 LGBT+ Plus
Physicists Acknowledgement

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.540
of Excellence Award.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.290
Her work was featured in
Huffington Post, Gizmodo,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.350
Nylon and the African-American
Intellectual History Society.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.550
Please welcome Chanda
Prescod-Weinstein.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.600
[ Applause ]

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:44.120
Our next panelist
is Ashley Shew.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.530
Ashley Shew is assistant
professor in the Department

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.470
of Science, Technology, and
Society at Virginia Tech,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.400
and works in philosophy of
technology at its intersection

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.700
with disability studies,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.360
emerging technology,
and animal studies.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.230
She is the author of
"Animal Constructions

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.100
and Technological Knowledge"
and co-editor of "Spaces

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.600
for the Future: A Companion to
the Philosophy of Technology".

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.900
Shew is a recent awardee

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.280
of a National Science Foundation
CAREER Grant, running from 2018

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.310
to 2023, to study
narratives about technology

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.630
from the disability community
that often stand in contrast

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.930
to dominant media

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.160
and engineering narratives
about disability.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.960
Please welcome Ashley Shew.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.220
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.150
So each of the panels will
have a slightly different

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.910
panel format.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.610
And for this morning, our
panelists have elected

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.660
to give an opening statement.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.460
So we'll just begin from
left to right with Dr. Child.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.760
&gt;&gt; Brenda J. Child: Great.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.060
Thank you.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.360
Is this on?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.660
Can you hear?

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.960
OK. Great.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.760
So I spend most of my
time, my scholarly life,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.070
thinking about American Indian
lives in the early 20th century.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.130
And so when Lucianne
first invited me,

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.070
I thought she must have
the wrong person in mind

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.540
as someone who's trained
in American Indian history.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.310
But I really appreciate
being invited in for the work

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.650
that you're doing and how
broadly you're thinking

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.130
about interdisciplinarity.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.940
It's really exciting to be
part of this conversation

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.940
and to read the work of
these, to me, young scholars

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.760
and the work that they're doing.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.450
It's very exciting.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.460
American Indians often
use the word survival

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.860
to describe the last 500 years
of European settler colonialism.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.940
In fact, just earlier this week,
I was reading a dissertation

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.840
by a young scholar from
Canada who went a step further

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.050
and used the term "surthivance",
and I thought, well,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.410
that's an interesting idea.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.810
As survivors, many of
us are thriving today

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.370
and that's really
exciting to see especially

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.380
from the vantage point
of the university,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.600
the things that are going
on in Indian country today

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.070
and with our students.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:09.410
Of course, not all of us are
thriving but it's exciting

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.240
to be part of some of the
work that's taking place

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.560
in Indian country today.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.650
As indigenous people, I
just want to say thinking

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.220
about that term surthrivance, we
want to be around in the future

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.380
and we, of course, have
been in this country

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.430
and in North America and the
Americas for a very long time.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.820
So perhaps in the future, we
would like to travel to Mars.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.680
I'll leave that open.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.650
That sounds like sort
of an exciting thing.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.910
Of course, this conversation
and the ideas

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.300
that Lucianne has presented
made me think about how,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.630
as American Indian people,
we were very big players

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:54.120
in the explorations that
took place 500 years ago.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.170
So why not participate

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.020
in interplanetary
exploration as well.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.650
And I guess it got me
thinking just a little bit

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.730
about what indigenous people
have to offer in thinking

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.210
about interplanetary
exploration.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.480
Of course, as I mentioned,
we helped out a lot

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.090
in the settlement of North and
South America, teaching settlers

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:22.260
to do things famously like grow
corn and learn how to survive

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.740
in this new environment.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.370
So we have that experience
to offer.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.500
Perhaps less well known or maybe
we don't think of this as often

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.270
because of the way that
American Indian people settle--

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.380
have settled in more
recent centuries.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.890
And so, since the reservation
era, people tend to think

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.360
about American Indians
as living within a kind

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.740
of geographically bounded
space, but that's not the way

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.040
that we've always lived.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.730
We were, in fact, big settlers.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.350
We moved around through
the Americas.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.840
I'm from the Great Lakes from
Minnesota and in our part

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.490
of the world, we traveled
by canoe and we know

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:07.050
from new scholarship that's
taking place in the Pacific

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.230
that indigenous Hawaiians
and people

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.320
from the Pacific were
amazing travelers.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.940
And in fact, we have a new
scholar who's joined us

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.790
at the University of
Minnesota who is teaching a--

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.800
he's from Guam and knows a lot

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.140
about Pacific traditions
of canoeing.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.240
And he's teaching a class
on comparative canoes

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.010
at the University of Minnesota.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.900
And actually has a double-hulled
canoe that he stores

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.420
in the University Boathouse.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.140
So, native people have been
travelers for quite a long time

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.890
and we have had, of course,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.470
some famous native people
who've been travelers.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.220
You probably know thinking
about this part of the world

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.120
that Pocahontas traveled from
the Chesapeake to London.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.110
She's probably one of the most
famous of native travelers.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.690
And there's-- If you
head over to the NMAI

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.830
and you see the Americans
exhibit, there is a large story

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.610
about Pocahontas and
how she's kind of played

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.960
into American history and
even American imaginings

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.580
of native people.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.520
There's another famous traveler
that I often think about,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.480
a man named Black Elk, who was
a Lakota who traveled to Europe

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.350
to perform in the
Wild West shows

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.920
and this was a fairly
common experience.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.220
I have a friend who's
just written a book

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.160
about indigenous London,
about the early Inuit

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.870
and other travelers
from the Americas

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.570
who came sometimes
involuntarily,

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.310
sometimes at their own
will to parts of Europe.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.090
At the University of Minnesota,
I feel really fortunate

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.220
because I have a-- you know, I
always have wonderful colleagues

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.100
to rely on and I just
want to mention the work

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.850
of David Chang who's
written a recent book

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.200
about Native American--

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.500
or Native Hawaiian
global geographies.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.970
And what he has asked
us to do is to kind

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.530
of shift the paradigm, and
he has a couple of questions

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.010
that I'm just going to
kind of post to you.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.500
So he says in his new
book, what if we were

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.800
to understand indigenous
people as active agents

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.670
of global exploration rather
than the passive objects

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.980
of that exploration,
which is I think what most

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.250
of us have learned
in studying American

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.680
or European or world history.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.650
So he also says, what
if instead of conceiving

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.780
of global exploration as an
activity just of European men

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.090
and we know the names, right,
even if we're not experts,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.930
Columbus, Magellan, Cook.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.990
We thought of it
instead as an activity

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.040
of the people they discovered.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.170
And this is the shift
that he tries to make.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.600
And so, Chang also says, what
could such a new perspective

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.360
on the project of
global exploration reveal

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.900
about the meaning of
geographical understanding

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.530
and its place and
struggles overpower

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.210
in the context of colonialism.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.940
So, I highly recommend his book.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.040
When I read a book
like this that is full

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.930
of provocative ideas and
also beautifully written,

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.510
I'm always really jealous.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.190
So I wish I could say
these were all my ideas,

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.750
but I want to leave you
with some of those points

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.050
that he makes and highly
recommend his new book

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:39.080
which is called, "The World
and All the Things upon It."

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.380
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Thank you.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: Good morning.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.780
Thank you to Lucianne and the
Kluge Center for having us

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.230
and having this discussion.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.040
And it's a privilege
to be sitting here

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.710
with you folks to
talk about this.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.460
The idea of continuing
to go out there that--

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.800
as if it's a necessity,
as if it's our--

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.360
as if it's our destiny
is a clear question.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.720
I used to be on the side
of, oh, we have to go

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.610
because it's what's next.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.460
And in the last decade,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.160
that whole perspective
has been changing for me.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.680
And, in the last couple of
years as I began to work

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.040
on the intersection of
artificial intelligence

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.010
and astrophysics, it has also
provided a new lens to think

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.970
about what work and what work
means to us an individuals

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.540
and what work means to society.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.090
If we are going to go out there,
if we're going to go further,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.020
it is-- very likely, it is
going to be highly automated.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.800
It is very likely that software

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.790
and advanced algorithms are
going to be a key part of that.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.920
And if we think about
the huge complex machines

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.940
that drive our society,
governments, corporations,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.900
those were already sort of like
advanced algorithms, in a way.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.490
They're these complex things
that we can't interpret

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.340
that we don't know
how they work.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.350
And they have commodified
human beings.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.590
That is how those
systems have survived.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.110
And so when we accelerate
that machinery

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.730
with artificial intelligence,
what will that mean for work

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.180
as we're in space,
what will that mean

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.150
for how human bodies are
continued to be treated?

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:32.170
So I think if we are going to--
if we're going to consider how--

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.000
if we're going to think
carefully about how we're going

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.290
to get out there, if we're
going to refocus who we center,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.550
we need to ask how
we've been doing it here

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.180
and if we're ready
for that change.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.120
And if we're ready for-- if
we're ready to say we're going

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.030
to out there and try to be
something different out there,

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.960
what makes us think we can
do that if we weren't ready

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.030
to be something different here.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.300
I think we're here
right now on Earth

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.640
with these new technologies,
we're in an inflection point.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.570
And, we have a decision to
make about whether we are going

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.240
to continue to allow
power to accumulate

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.850
through these technologies or
if we're going to find a way

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.170
to shift that power to folks
who haven't had it before.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.150
So that's one lens through
which I view this challenge.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.110
As-- With my role in
University of Chicago

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.840
as Lucianne mentioned,
I'm the faculty leader

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.980
for the Space Explorers Program.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.890
This is a method-- This is
a thing that's being going

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.190
on for 25 years.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.490
I recently joined it.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.060
And we're trying to
shift it in a way

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.240
to prepare a new generation of
thinkers and feelers and humans

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.980
for approaching work and
research in a different way.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.840
So the nuts and bolts
of this program are

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.960
that we have essentially
30 students per year,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.540
they're from-- they're
in high school.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.090
And, right this year,

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.800
it's coming out their
rising sophomores.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.040
And we engage with them in--

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.880
they're in labs inside
the University of Chicago,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.270
but it's meant to be a
non-classroom environment

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.130
so that they can more experience
science as an everyday thing.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.650
So they can more experience
science and technologies

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.260
and build a habit like what many

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.430
of my colleagues are
researchers and scholars there.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.910
So there's a habit of thinking,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.390
at least in our current
academic context.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.690
And so we want to develop--

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.880
those students to develop those
skills so that they're ready

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.010
for the next set of
challenges which--

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.330
it's not about memorizing
things,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.740
it's about knowing how to think.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.480
It's about knowing how
to approach problems.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.820
So this last year, to put a
finer point on this, our--

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:53.340
the idea was that-- so how
do we have you learn how

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.650
to do research that's not
trying to think about things

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.530
from the back of a book,
trying to figure out what's

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.980
in the back of a book.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.080
It's how do you think about
a problem that matters to you

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.500
and how do you apply
science and technology to it.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.150
And so this year,
the 30 students went

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.970
through three different
teams, 10 students each,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.800
and we asked them, how would
you develop a civilization

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.600
on a foreign terrestrial body,
on another terrestrial body,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.550
extraterrestrial
body, 400,000 people

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.380
with the main considerations
being energy generation

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.320
and energy distribution.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.960
And in a way more
critically, how do you engage

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.700
with those questions from
an ethical point of view?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.360
And so they were charged
to answer questions about,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.860
how do you help people survive
and how do you ask about--

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.120
how do you think about how human
bodies and humans are treated

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.560
in that kind of environment.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.880
And, somewhat to my
amazement, but then again not,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.320
because these students
are amazing,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.670
they came back with
amazing answers.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.180
They only had a week
to think about this.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.990
And they blew us away.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.320
It was amazing.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.140
And so, I think about--
when we think about work

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.520
from the context of AI and
automation, we think about work

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.670
from the perspective of research
and how do we build skills

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.100
from other generation.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.070
I'm asking myself, how do we
rethink how we train ourselves,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.920
how we rethink, how--
not only, you know,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.740
what the right stuff is, but how
do we think ahead to be ready

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.120
for what the next important
kind of right stuff is.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.750
Thank you.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.860
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
So, you guys are amazing

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.400
to follow Norse kind of way.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.220
So Spanish artist,
Santiago Sierra,

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.080
recently told The Guardian U.K.
newspaper, this was actually

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.280
in the newspaper, I think,
yesterday or the day before,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.700
"Planting a national flag

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.980
in a hitherto unvisited
place has never been an

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.530
innocent gesture.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:02.240
This is how colonial
processes always begin".

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.450
So because I am a black and
Caribbean-American descended

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.480
from slaves, I'm more
familiar with the great law

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.630
of the Iroquois than I
am with any moral rules

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.780
that my African ancestors lived
by because I'm actually not sure

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.050
who my African ancestors were.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.650
And my basic understanding of
this law is that it teaches

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.160
that we must consider the
impact of our actions on those

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.050
who will live seven
generations from now.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.560
And I know that when
colonial processes begin,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.340
no one is really thinking of
the next seven generations.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.970
It's just not how
colonialism works.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.840
And so because of this, the list
of anxieties that I experience

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.400
when thinking about the
right stuff is really

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.360
about whether we are--
have the right stuff.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.620
When I think about humans
arriving on another planet

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.150
like Mars, you know, questions
I'm asking myself, could--

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.260
and when we go to the
moon which is actually one

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.700
of the first destinations,
I think, is could mining

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.700
on the moon forever alter how
our future generations see this

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.510
majestic and natural
satellite of Earth?

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.560
Who will profit, who will
perish in the expedition?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.850
Will such missions ultimately
exacerbate inequalities

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.860
that already exist on Earth?

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.700
And in fact, well, missions to
Mars make life on Earth worse.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.220
How can we have these
conversations with a language

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.930
that refuses to untwine
itself with the lingua franca

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.740
of settler colonialism,
so discovery, exploration,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.220
settlement, colonizing,
you dig a little bit deep

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.340
and these words come back
to settler colonialism.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.700
And then, what are possible
future generations on Mars?

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.800
So by this, I don't
necessarily mean human

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.610
or even Earth-originating life,
but who and what do we eclipse

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.460
by choosing to lay
claim to land elsewhere.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.830
So I think about this
as a Star Trek fan.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.330
And, I mean, I'm in annual
Star Trek convention,

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.320
gold ticket holding, seen every
episode of every series fan.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.590
Anyone who follows me on
social media had seen the many,

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.700
many pictures to prove it.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.260
And we'll only think the show
has its problems on the whole,

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.340
I've lived its expansive
vision not just of humanity

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.000
but of humanoidity of all
of us humanoids learning how

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.020
to share not just a
planet but a galaxy.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.920
And so as a physicist,
I spend some time

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.950
at the conventions
explaining to fellow fans

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.850
that warp-speed travel,
travel at the speed of light,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.400
is probably not going to happen.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.340
And this means that the
key generative moment

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.520
for first contact
with another species

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.190
in the Star Trek universe,
humans reaching warp one

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.490
and catching the attention

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.250
of the Vulcans is probably
never going to happen.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.820
It's probably not possible.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.140
And it's likely possible that
even if Vulcans did exist

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.700
and had better space travel
technology than we do,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.930
they still can't
travel at warp either

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.750
and more likely they figured out
how to live multigenerationally

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.670
on a ship that could
take multiples

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.210
of seven generations
to get anywhere.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.870
So, then again, physicists have
often been wrong in the past

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.200
about what is possible
so I always

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.730
like to include this caveat, so
maybe we will be wrong again.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.090
So as I was thinking about
coming to this event,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.670
I reached out to Connor Trinneer

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.900
who played the engineer
Trip Trucker

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.240
on the penultimate Star
Trek series, Enterprise.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.130
I don't know if anybody
else is a Trip fan.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.280
I was. And I was especially
keen to hear from Connor

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.230
because Enterprise is
the series that deals

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.660
with Earth's first forays
from the solar system

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.790
and how humans go on to
form the storied federation

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.030
of the Vulcans, so this is
kind of the origin story.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.060
So, he had to deal
with things like what

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.430
if a planet didn't have
animals but the air was filled

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.730
with psychedelic Pollan,

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.720
that was a great
acting episode for him.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.400
What if having sex with an
alien woman got a human cis

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.700
man pregnant?

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.360
These were just some of the
scenarios that he had to get

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.690
into character for so that
Trip could grapple with them.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.210
So, I expected Connor to
tell me to mention something

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.990
about the Prime Directive, the
Vulcan rule which is adapted

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.950
by the federation and
teaches us not to interfere

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.690
with the internal
development of other species.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.570
But instead, he said
something to me

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.830
that perhaps reflects his
childhood in a community

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.460
that had a strong presence of
both native and white people.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.740
He always thought that if
we did meet another species,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.660
it would be because they wanted
something from us and that

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.720
that could get uncomfortable
pretty quickly.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.050
So I hadn't really thought
about that going into this sort

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.980
of ironically because I
guess it's the storyline

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.570
from pretty much
every alien film.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.990
You can tell I don't really
actually watch alien films.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.060
They always want something
from us and it's never good

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.570
and much has been written
by indigenous scholars,

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.190
both here in the Americas and
elsewhere, about how the style

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.410
of storytelling reflects
the kind of white anxiety

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.050
that one day they might
become the victims of the kind

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:37.800
of colonial apocalypse they
visited on indigenous people

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.670
in Africa, the Americas, the
Pacific islands, Australia

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.100
and New Zealand and
Asia, even sometimes

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.670
on their own European
Peninsula of Asia.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.870
But what struck me in
thinking about Connor's framing

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.390
of it was, in fact, how
we could be the ones

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.680
who want something
so it could be us.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.190
We could be the ones who
want something from Mars

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.620
and from the moon, perhaps to
buy time by extracting resources

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.680
that we learn-- we
refuse to learn how

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.750
to conserve here
on planet Earth.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.050
So a question that I think
we should ask ourselves is,

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.370
in wanting something,
do we eclipse futures

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.060
that we are not confident
to imagine,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.670
do we violate the Prime
Directive before there is a

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.710
civilization to even disrupt.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.950
So some of you may be aware
that I became a bit notorious

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.640
in the astronomy community
for supporting Kanaka Maoli,

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.890
Native Hawaiians who
oppose the building

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.780
of the Thirty Meter Telescope
on the Mauna Kea volcano.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.310
I have an undergraduate degree
in physics and astrophysics

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.670
and astronomy, it's actually
grammatically incorrect

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.660
on my diploma and a master's in
astronomy and a PhD in a field

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.080
that blends astronomy
and physics, cosmology.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.150
So I got a lot of accusations
that I just hate science

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.650
and that's why I was doing this,
but my support for them was not

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.270
because I hate science,
not because I don't

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.800
like pretty pictures of galaxies

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.110
or think Kanaka Maoli shouldn't
be allowed to participate

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.750
in the kind of scientific
work that I do.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.310
I actually get an
extensive amount of hate mail

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.770
with that particular accusation.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.410
I was accused of these things by
people who were more interested

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.090
in character assassination
than dialogue, I think.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.510
But the truth is as a
descendant of slaves and a child

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.580
of a small tropical
island, Barbados,

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.360
I understood the terrible
entanglement between science

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.550
and a failure to imagine
other ways of being

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.890
and other ways of knowing.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:29.120
So much of-- as my research is
about curiosity and imagination,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.580
my day-to-day realities as
a scientist are deeply tied

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.040
to science as a tool that
enhances colonialism,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.710
and that has been one of
my struggles as a student

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.920
and practitioner of science.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.150
So to give some examples,
astronomers were once funded

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.800
to watch an eclipse
from Haiti in order

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.350
to enhance our ability
to measure distances.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.610
And this was to ensure
that slaves

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.600
and goods would move
faster across the Atlantic.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.740
Today, they are funded to
help develop adaptive optics

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.100
and military technology

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.220
that makes our beautiful
pictures clearer.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.450
All of the telescopes on
Mauna Kea have been fitted

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.650
with adaptive optics technology.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.130
But they make their pictures
clearer whether they are spy

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.870
images or galaxy images.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.640
We are only a few years out from
an award-winning white woman

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.140
astronomer, Sandy Faber,

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.540
referring to Kanaka Maoli
protectors as they are known

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.340
of Mauna Kea as a "horde of
natives" attacking astronomy.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.240
Her words were recirculated
uncritically by leaders

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.840
in our field such as the chair
of the astronomy department

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.750
at UC Berkeley, until
students some

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.270
of them Native American sounded
the alarm to the rest of us.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:39.010
So it is in this context I
ask about human travel to Mars

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.990
or really anywhere, even
across the Atlantic, why now?

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.310
Do we have the right stuff
to connect with other lands,

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.490
when the most powerful
among us refuse

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.040
to acknowledge our relationship
to the lands that we know

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.110
or the lands that we knew?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.260
Do we have the right time in
human history for this new way

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.470
of being in the solar system?

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.450
What meaning does a
mission to Mars have

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.660
for making black lives
matter, for being idle no more?

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.970
Will it keep our waters safe?

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.080
The promise of technological
advancement

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.860
that will improve lives
and enhance exploration

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.690
as tantalizing, but then what
of Ferguson, is a pipeline

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.690
through standing rock progress
for the people of that land?

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.780
Is the global warming we have
achieved through technology?

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.410
And this can be read as
an achievement of a kind

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.140
that we know how to
warm an entire planet.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.950
Is that progress?

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.310
And in relation to that,
is our relationship

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.920
to progress catastrophic?

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.240
So these are the
questions that I have

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.520
when we consider what is
the right stuff for us

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.570
and what is the right stuff
for the solar system around us.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.160
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Well, if she
had a hard job I have even more

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.460
difficult one.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.230
It's hard to go last
after a panel like this.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.760
So I work on disability
narratives.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.650
So what would I be doing here?

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.400
The assumption with
the right stuff is

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.840
that disabled people aren't,
they don't have the right stuff.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.970
My particular work
is on technoableism,

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:15.410
meaning I think a lot about how
the narratives of technology

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:18.730
that we have often
reinforce ableism.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:24.980
And, sometimes do this by using
the language of empowerment

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.290
to cover up an ableist
narrative about disabled lives

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.100
that would see us as defective
and needing to be fixed.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.810
But oh, yay, technology.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.020
So a lot of the ways
in which I think

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.850
about how disabled people
have or have not been included

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.260
in what counts is
having the right stuff,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.250
it takes three different veins.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.910
So, the first is, I've been
thinking about how everyone

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:49.100
in space is going
to disabled anyway.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.470
So we don't recruit people with
disabilities, but if you go

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:54.380
up in space, the changes
to your body will mean

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.360
that you come back
with some sort

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.770
of disability whether it's
a temporary disability

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.880
or more long term if we're
talking about changes to vision,

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.670
if we're talking about
things like osteoporosis.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:11.510
I'm also thinking in this vein
that everyone who goes to space,

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.850
if we're talking about
becoming interplanetary,

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:19.060
might want to make themselves
more like disabled people.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:25.880
So when I think about how we
address different disabilities

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.460
and the technologies of
those involved, my friend,

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.410
Mallory Kay Nelson [assumed
spelling], when I started,

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.090
we were having a
conversation about space poop

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.390
because it's my favorite.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.850
And, sorry, Lucianne.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:40.230
And, she-- we were talking about
how hard it is to poop in space

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.890
and all the different like
attempts to make good toilets

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.910
in space, it's really
hard, y'all.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.840
And, she was like, you know,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.960
astronauts should
just have ostomy bags.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.480
We should change their digestive
tracts, such that instead

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.190
of taping a bag to your anus,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.600
you already have a
bag system worked out

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.410
and all the equipment that's
involved and that sort of thing.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.850
And it's not-- it's going be a
lot less gross actually in terms

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.450
of the accidents that
happen with space poop.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.040
So just to think about
cyborgyzing ourselves to think

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.630
about both being and
becoming disabled in space,

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.620
it's one of the lines
through which I think

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.920
about these things.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.660
The second has to
do with recent work

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.160
from disabled and deaf artists.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.450
So if you follow the
#CripsInSpace on Twitter,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:33.460
there was a recent issue of the
Deaf Poets Society that focused

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:38.750
on space narratives from
people with disabilities.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:43.240
And asked about what bodies
were actually best to send up

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.120
and about the narratives
they've heard about space life.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.900
So part of it is, you know,
feeling as if when you're told

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.370
as a child you could do
anything, that's not true a lot

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.670
of times for disabled people.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.480
We know who gets recruited
for things, who can serve

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.130
in military and space context,
and it's not disabled people.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.430
But also in terms

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.210
of how disabled people might
be better at going to space.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.840
So some of these
artist narratives,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.240
Sam de Leve [assumed spelling],
one of the co-editors,

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.590
they talk about how navigating
the world on a wheelchair,

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.880
they're always pushing
off of other surfaces.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.410
Like this looks a lot
more like lower gravity.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.430
When you think about how
bodies move in space, in fact,

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.600
physically disabled people might
be much more adept at movement

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.670
in lower gravity just from all

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.360
of the training they've
been doing on Earth

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.060
on navigating surfaces in ways
that people who ambulate do not.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.830
The third way in which
I'm thinking about some

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.720
of these things is
about how disabled

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.490
and deaf people have been
included in space research

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.970
but never considered
candidates for going.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:50.130
So during the 1950s and '60s,
you have the Gallaudet Eleven,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.810
which it consisted of 11 people
who were deaf from Gallaudet.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.670
Yeah, I guess you guys just
could have filled that in

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.570
from your prior knowledge.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.640
But, there were all these tests
about motion sickness, right?

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.380
So, the people they recruited,
because of hearing loss that had

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.760
to do with inner ear conditions,
they don't get motion sick.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.260
So, in testing for how
people might go to space,

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.700
they use deaf bodies
to figure out things

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.560
about motion sickness
instead of saying, "Hey,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.250
maybe we should recruit deaf
people to actually be part

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.710
of this test because they don't
experience motion sickness

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.750
in this way", but they were used
as a test ground to help figure

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.610
out how able-bodied people could
go space instead of saying,

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.930
maybe these people
ought to be considered

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.230
as candidates as well.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.720
So I think throughout in
these three different lenses

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.580
when I'm thinking
about the relationship

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.160
of disability narrative and
becoming interplanetary.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.800
And I think about the
discriminatory like things

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.330
that are already built
in to what's going

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.610
to be the right stuff
that there is right stuff.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.280
And that someone can have it
at all and that we don't need

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.450
like a variety of
people with lots

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.650
of different types of stuff.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.970
I'll turn it over
to you, Lucianne.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.270
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: OK.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.700
Thank you to all the panelists

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.770
for these wonderful
provocative opening statements.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:14.180
I promise we will return to
space poop later in the panel.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:19.270
I'd like to return momentarily
for our first question

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:24.450
to really the central theme
of this particular panel.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:25.800
And that we've talked a lot

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.600
about making science
more inclusive

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.200
or space exploration
more diverse,

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.720
or broadening the definition
of who can be an explorer.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.730
And I-- One of the-- And I
should mention also that in each

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.430
of the panels that
you'll see today,

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.480
the panels have all
participated in pre-event calls,

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.530
so I want to thank them for
being the co-creators of some

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.300
of the questions that
we'll be talking about.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.700
But I'd like to start with
what is diversity for,

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.540
and maybe I can prompt
Chanda to do,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.730
as she is already
doing, reach of the mic.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.030
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
Yeah.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.330
So I think that this was
one of the things that came

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:12.120
up in our pre-call and if
I were to do a little bit

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.150
of self-advertising, I
have an article coming our

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.670
in the science journal

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:22.210
of feminism next year called
Making Black Women Scientists

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.620
Under a White Empiricism.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.410
And one of the things that
I talk about is that all

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.960
of our arguments for
diversity at the funding level,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.810
at the federal level, and this
is encoded in our documentation,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:37.620
is that it's-- diversity is
necessary for national security

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.360
and it's necessary for
workforce purposes.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.360
And so, this rubs me the wrong
way as an African American,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.760
as an Afro-Caribbean
person, because it returns us

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.930
to black people being
necessary for labor purposes.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.600
I mean, at least this time,
the plan is to pay people

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.450
so that's good and to
sort of allow them to live

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.480
where they want to,
redlining is still a thing.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.430
So, I think that when
we talk about diversity,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.200
somehow white people
continue to get to be curious

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.410
and black people continue
to be there for the sake

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.980
of supporting white
curiosity, in some sense.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.560
And so we're still kind
of the support stuff.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.940
And so I'm very troubled by
that, and I think really want

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.040
to turn towards an
intersectional post-colonial

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.730
analysis rather than analyzing

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.010
from a diverse--
diversity standpoint.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.010
I actually think that
diversity can be quite dangerous

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.810
because it allows us to
sidestep these conversations

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:39.020
about colonialism and about
having equal access to rights.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.240
So, we're not talking about
the privilege of going to Mars

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.380
or whatever, we're talking
about having the same ability

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.440
to access your right
to participate

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.350
in whatever human society
has decided to do with itself

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.670
that these are rights
that people are prevented

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.550
from accessing rather
than privileges

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.850
that are granted to some.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.740
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Anyone else?

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:09.020
I think I'd like to hear from
you, Brian, about how you think

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.510
about inclusion in this
particular context given your

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.810
work with space explorers.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: It's hard-- yeah,
so, echoing everything that is--

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.060
that what you just said.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.910
When-- So I'll start with how
our academic institutions tend

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.730
to train us for changing
our inclusive practices

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.030
and diversity.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.890
They tend to say,
hey, let's just--

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.210
as Chanda said, let's
side step this and talk

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:46.060
about maybe your implicit
bias or maybe what it means

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.710
for these additional
human bodies to come

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.920
and provide this
commodity of knowledge.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.530
And that's the only
way that we talk

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.040
about in these academic
institutions.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.350
So, in spaces explorers,
we don't do that at all.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:02.000
We ignore that entire
conversation and we go

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.670
for the key deeper
questions, I think, which are,

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:13.260
how do humans think about--

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.840
how do humans approach
ideas of justice?

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.980
How do we think about how
we just treat each other

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.280
on a one-on-one level?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.470
So, in the Space
Explorers Program this year,

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.440
when we're in this building
for six or seven days,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.930
10 hours a day and the
sophomores are thinking

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:35.440
about these questions, they
end up approaching it by having

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.020
to get along with each other.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.600
Yeah-- Or in a context where
they are diverse group.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:48.000
And, the nuance comes in, in
the one-on-one conversations.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.580
And so we're there to ask them
questions to-- as they stumble,

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.990
we're there to ask them
questions to answer

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.670
for themselves and
approach them--

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.360
approach the difficulties
head on.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.900
And so, I look at it and
our program looks at it

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:10.090
as justice first and none
of these other aspects.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.390
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:14.260
I had the great honor
of being a panelist

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.700
on the Space Explorers Program
and I was really impressed

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.930
with the depth of
thought and the centrality

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.200
of the distribution
and ethics questions.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.050
Not just in the way it was
post to the students but also

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.180
in the way that the
students dealt

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.180
with those topics
first, I think.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: They
were very honest.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.350
They didn't hold anything back.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:39.920
They asked some very challenging
questions especially in one

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.550
of the contexts for these
100,000 person civilizations is

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.850
the spaceships

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.740
or multigenerational
spaceship Earth.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.170
And, they came up with
some pretty crazy answers,

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.570
I won't go into them,
but there are things

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:02.240
that we see our societies
using here that are not good.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.900
The control over the human
body was one of the ways

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.880
that they were trying
to manage how do you--

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.200
how you maintain this one
population on a spaceship.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.580
And so they answered those
questions in that, I think,

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.420
negative way because they hadn't
been exposed to real way--

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.900
or other ways of thinking
about it that are-- that--

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.650
or thinking about humans as
humans and not as machines.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.950
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Interesting.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:35.920
You know, when we talk about the
commodification of people for,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.000
you know, some purpose being
used as tools, you know,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.590
this larger enterprise, one
of the things that you raised,

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.770
Brenda, during our call is that
there have often been cases

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.920
in history and you
brought up American Indians

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.690
in the military, where
something was considered

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.970
to be a good thing
about a stereotype

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.390
that ultimately was
harmful to the person.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.120
So maybe you could
speak to that.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.800
&gt;&gt; Brenda J. Child: Yeah.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.700
So, as I was thinking about
these questions in terms

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.610
of American Indian history, I
kind of was reflecting on some

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:14.470
of my early work which was about
the history of Indian education

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.840
and how native people
were thought of,

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.970
I'll get into the
military but, of course,

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.870
when the federal government
was putting native people

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.930
on reservations and wanted to
move to kind of privatization

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.930
of land because Indians still
had a lot of real estate.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.770
They decided a companion
program would be to put children

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.210
in off-reservation
boarding schools.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.380
And at that time, one of
the arguments for this

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.870
in the late 19th century, I
mean, there were all sorts

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.910
of reasons for doing it,
but one of the arguments

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.720
from the perspective of
Washington and policymakers

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.020
and people who kind of
thought about native issues is

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:59.180
that native people seem to be
dying a lot in the 19th century

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.170
or the late 19th century was our
kind of all-time population low

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.740
and we're very vulnerable to
problems like tuberculosis.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:12.890
And, so, the boarding schools
were argued for as, you know,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:16.780
a way to help native people who
had kind of inferior bodies.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.660
And so they could enter into
athletic programs and things

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:29.320
that would help them because
of their, you know, the poor--

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.810
you know, what had
happened to them

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.300
because of their
hereditary-- heredity.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.810
And so, that's interesting
that that's kind of one side

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.340
of how people have
looked at and policymakers

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.040
and reformers native bodies.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.490
And then, some-- at some point,
things changed, and maybe it had

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.050
to do with kind of high rates

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.480
of native people's
military participation

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.720
in the 20th century, where
they were then thought

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.980
of as having desirable bodies

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.070
because they were
so good at hunting.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.470
They were so good at gathering.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.490
They were so good scouts.

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.260
And so, to the detriment,
I think, of native people,

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.620
they were often put on
the kind of frontlines

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.180
in military conflict
since World War I.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.200
So, native people-- the
ideas about native people

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.040
and whether they have the right
stuff or not, has kind of comes

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.880
and goes with federal policies.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.180
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.450
And I'm struck at how this
parallels the disability

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:33.020
narratives that you brought
up in your opening comments

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.760
about like the Gallaudet Eleven.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.210
What do you think
the underlying--

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.450
well, I think I know the
answer to this question,

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:47.070
but what is the underlying
pushback against people

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:50.740
who are disabled here on Earth
having active participation?

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.800
What do you hear most
often in response?

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.200
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: If you
know the answer, no.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.390
Well, I mean, we have a
pervasive culture of ableism

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.130
that almost everyone
participates in.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:05.430
You know, I'm disabled,

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.250
I'm still on learning
ableism every day, right?

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.620
The assumption that disabled
people are enable to do things

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.100
in history that undergirds that,

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.270
history that includes
institutionalization,

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:21.140
push people out of sight,
right, if they don't behave

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.080
in the ways you hope they will.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.490
And often, that just
means they target people

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.790
who are poor, right?

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:32.220
We also have a history
of sheltered workshops.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.210
So when you talk about the
commodification of people,

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.550
you can still pay disabled
people subminimum wage, right,

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.550
in segregated workplaces.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.630
Those are beginning to
become undone, there's a push

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.010
to eliminate these things and
a push to get subminimum wages

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:54.340
to not have that anymore,
but it's also still there.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.500
You know, we're still closing

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.400
down institutions
in Virginia, right?

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.610
We're close to Virginia
that-- what was the--

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.980
Virginia, I think, Colony for
the Epileptics and Feebleminded,

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.330
it has a new name since the '80s

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.830
but it won't be shutdown
until 2020.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.910
Like we're still in a history
that we're dealing with,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.520
the legacies of ableism.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.490
Disabled people are--
have much higher rates

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.580
of underemployment even under
good employment conditions.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.670
The idea that you have to
hide if you're disabled

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.350
if you're going to go in for a
job interview is very common.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.010
I'm an amputee and my
amputee groups, they say,

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.270
wear pants to an interview,
don't wear a skirt.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:38.760
Don't wear, you know, shoes
that'll reveal in any way

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.730
that you're disabled because
they'll think you can't do

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.030
things, right?

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.510
Even when we have
technologized bodies

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.140
that sometimes allow
different functionalities

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.320
that people might expect,
it's still the case that a lot

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.850
of people hide they're
disabled and they do

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.470
that for military
service too, right,

00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:00.860
if you have any mental
health issue raised,

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.300
you're not getting
into the military.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.210
It's not just about
physical disabilities here,

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.520
the doubts people have
about whether you'll be able

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.750
to do things are huge.

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:15.170
And I think that exists for a
lot of different populations

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:20.630
but it's one that, in terms of
recruitment for space, right,

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.770
there's a compulsory able
bodiedness to a lot of things

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:27.150
that we do, but it's much
more intensified when we talk

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.110
about recruitment programs
for space exploration

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.380
or for the military
or for anything

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.070
where physical prowess is
valued, maybe mistakenly

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.900
at times, right, because I can
think about different types

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.770
of disabled bodies that might
navigate surfaces much better

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.760
in space than actually
able-bodied people.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.610
But we're not often
very creative

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.780
about thinking about
bodies at all.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.780
Like one thing you find out when
you become disabled is you have

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.110
to adapt every day and
work around surfaces

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.730
in a way you never expected.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.390
That's a lot like when
astronauts will go

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.690
to space, right?

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:01.990
You have then to
think creatively

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:04.530
about the spaces you're in
and how you'll move in them

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.770
and think ahead and plan
ahead or planning ahead.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:12.980
And, you know, there's
this whole different world

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.080
that you have to adapt to.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.610
And I think most humans don't
necessarily think about that,

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.490
because a lot of the
spaces are already made

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:27.310
to suit people who
are non-disabled.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.950
So, you know, when I think

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.940
about how we creatively
address spaces,

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.800
thinking about disabled
bodies, I think, provides a lot

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.290
of excitement for me about
what could be done differently

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.380
in this vein by this
commodification,

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.680
I think, underlies it all.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.070
I think you hit it in
your first comment, Brian,

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.840
this commodification
bodies, whose bodies

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.830
and minds do we value
is central here.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.960
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Yeah, go on, please.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: So, I'm wondering
if I can ask a question

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.690
of some panelists if they
have some thoughts about this.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.530
Over the weekend,
I was thinking,

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:07.230
do we think that it would be
possible if one of the ideas

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:09.080
of going into space,
one of the reasons,

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.670
could it be to take everything
that we've learned about this

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:14.970
and in a sense start over?

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:20.990
Do you see that as a
reasonable reason to go?

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.320
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
So, I guess--

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.260
you know, I think the first
question I would ask is,

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.040
how can we get out of a
conversation where we're talking

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.200
about value and bodies at all.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.160
I-- And I think partly
because in--

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.430
you know, from a philosophical
standpoint, I'm in a history

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.740
of knowledge, that's
one knowledge system

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.180
that we continue to operate in
that we never really get out of.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.520
And if we can't get
out of assuming

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.790
that that axiomatic
starting point, that bodies

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:54.780
and objects are things to be
valued and that land is a thing

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.750
to be valued, then if we take
that as our starting point,

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.740
it follows us into space.

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:07.430
So, I think we can't
escape from ourselves.

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.290
We always go with us.

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:13.600
And, so, wherever we take the
experiment, we are running

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.890
that experiment on,
can we be better,

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.740
can we address knowledge
systems where--

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.710
you know, to contextualize
for some people, some--

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.130
one of the issues with Mauna
Kea because they didn't talk

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:29.730
about this at all, is that Mauna
Kea is a traditionally sacred

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.510
space for not all Kanaka Maoli
because there's quite a bit

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:37.230
of diversity, but for people
who are spiritual practitioners,

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.200
it was a burial ground.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.830
They don't use European
style markers that this is

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.560
where the bodies are, so in
fact, you dig up a telescope

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.950
and you're digging up
somebody's grave essentially.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.110
And in-- Not just
in native Hawaiian

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:56.930
but several Pacific communities,
the land is a family member.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.780
So this is a violation
of a family member.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.310
And I think that when a
lot of people heard that,

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.910
it can be read very
superficially, like, yeah, yeah,

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.380
you think of the land as part

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.820
of your culture,
part of your family.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.930
But I really think that the
challenge for those of us

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.910
who did not grow up in that
knowledge system context is

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.570
to sit with the idea, what
if this was my mother,

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:22.650
what if this was my sister.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.960
And just to say to yourself,

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.440
it doesn't matter whether
that's not intuitive for me,

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.070
it is now my task to
make that intuitive.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.400
And I actually think as a
physicist, this is not hard

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.530
because people come to me and
say, oh, quantum field theory,

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.870
I'll never got it, or
general relativity, how did--

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:39.760
I'm a relativist by
background and by training,

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.560
how did you get used to the
idea of curve space time instead

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.290
of thinking of gravity
as a force.

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:46.950
And I told students that if
you sit with it long enough,

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.350
eventually it becomes
intuitive to you.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.180
Curve space time is much more
intuitive to me than gravity

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:55.300
as a force is, which is
maybe why I'm a relativist,

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.480
maybe there's a-- how my
brain works type thing

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.780
happening there.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.080
But the point is, is
that you sit with it.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.400
And so, I don't know if it
matters where we do the sitting

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.990
but I think that we
have to do the sitting.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.300
And that's one of the reasons
the why now question is

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.350
so important, and it
was the question I asked

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.110
for the Thirty Meter Telescope.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:13.670
I love the idea of
having something

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.190
like the Thirty Meter Telescope.

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:18.880
I think I might be interested
in the idea of, for example,

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.070
nuclear power as an
alternative energy source.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:25.530
But I want us to
do it in a moment

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.870
where we can do it responsibly.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.420
And I don't know what
responsibly means,

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.050
but I know that I don't
think that we are there yet,

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.860
particularly with the
Thirty Meter Telescope.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.200
And I actually think that there
would have been a possibility

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.900
that had the TMT
Corporation gone about things

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.560
in a different way, the outcome
now might have been different.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.200
But they never actually
tried to get the by-end

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.860
from the community and
have the conversation.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.460
And so in fact, I spent a
lot of time during the height

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:53.760
of those protests, nobody

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.550
in the astronomy community
ever asked me about this

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:57.100
because they were too
busy pillaring me.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.790
I spent a lot of time explaining

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:01.910
to people what the Thirty
Meter Telescope would do

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:06.510
and why it mattered so much
to astronomers, and realizing

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.850
that a lot of the protectors,
nobody had bothered to have

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:12.310
that basic conversation
with them.

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:14.050
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Brenda, you wanted to--

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.310
Just put it here, either way.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.050
&gt;&gt; Brenda J. Child:
Yeah, just in--

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:19.950
I like your comments
very much, Chanda.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:25.400
I was thinking how another
sort of kind of a stereotype

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.110
in another sort of
barrier to thinking

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.800
about indigenous people
is having the right stuff,

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.520
is that often we are not
thought of, I noticed,

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.540
and even in the university
context,

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.790
as not being modern people.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.320
And so, when you have something
like the telescope project

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.760
and you have indigenous
people making, you know,

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:50.050
an argument that this land is
sacred, it's like our mother.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.290
People are thought of as, well,

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:55.620
you don't like science,
you're not modern.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.610
Well-- And in fact, indigenous
people just like they conceive

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:01.830
of themselves as travelers
and explorers also think

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.970
of themselves as scientist but

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:06.310
yet respect is a
really important part

00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:11.040
of how native people
conceptualize their science.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.720
And sometimes I noticed in
the university that we get

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.400
into conflicts at
my university, we--

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.600
the Department of American
Indian Studies has gotten

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.070
into conflicts with--
over telescope projects,

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.820
the one in Arizona
at Mount Graham.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.370
And the argument was just,
you know, you don't--

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.420
why are you oppose to
this, this is science

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.070
and we have the right
to go in and do this.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:34.980
And it's like, we're not talking
about rights, we're talking

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.370
about our responsibilities.

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.520
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.570
Yeah, certainly, it reminds
me also of some of the reading

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:49.480
that I've been doing about like
the creation of national parks

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.560
and the way that the
wilderness was thought

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.010
about by settlers coming
in and thinking, well,

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:59.750
like a wilderness is where
people aren't and not caring

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:03.010
for the fact that it was, you
know, used by multiple nations

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.950
that there had been
longstanding, you know,

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:10.560
habitation there and the way
that those two things, you know,

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.540
national parks which
people now think

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.480
of as these wonderful treasures
was actually really tied,

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.410
I think, to Native American
reservation creation as well

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:22.990
and the dispossession of lands.

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:27.580
And I had a question
that's totally gone now.

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.900
So hopefully, it'll come back.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.590
You know, I think one of the
things that comes up again

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:40.820
and again also is just access
to education and to information.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.940
And, the narratives that exist

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:50.250
about having either specialized
knowledge or being allowed

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.190
in a particular space.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:58.040
And I think also a commonality
that I hear throughout some

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.840
of the things that we've been
talking about is the ways

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.420
in which access is often
offered at the expense

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.620
of a person's existing identity.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.260
And maybe, Ashley, you
could speak to this

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.000
from the standpoint of the--

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.010
one of the most dominant ableist
narratives which, of course,

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.820
is that, you know, all of this
technology development will

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.470
create people who are, you know,

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:29.460
able-bodied in the
sort of typical sense.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.760
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: So, yeah.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.070
So, when we think about who
can go to a space, right,

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:38.100
not just who can go to space,
but a lot of this is intention

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.290
with people's comfort, right?

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:44.380
So to have bodies that could be
in comfortable spaces to be able

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.550
to be comfortable as
someone who's neurodivergent,

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.090
for instance.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:55.850
The spaces are going to be
different or planned ahead

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:59.930
in ways that we can plan
ahead for space, right?

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:03.710
So when I think about creating
environments that are good,

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:07.090
right, I think a lot
about, you know, curve cuts

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:08.510
and things like that, too.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:13.060
But, who has to be uncomfortable
to be in a space often,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.930
and habits of my mind and
I'm sure it's the same

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.460
for my fellow panelists here
in thinking through their work,

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.580
and what sort of compromises
must be made in terms

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.660
of how you identify and
whether you identify

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.130
and whether you care
to tell anyone.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:31.170
It's why I actually am
pretty excited about the idea

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:34.160
about thinking about how we'll
be all the disabled in space.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.990
So, there's this idea-- it's
gone on a favor in some ways,

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:41.070
but people used to talk about--

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:44.780
non-disabled people call
them TABs, which stands

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.460
for temporarily able-bodied.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.710
I think there are all sorts of
problems with that narrative

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.490
because you shouldn't just
care about disabled people

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.280
because you might be
one one day, right?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.580
That shouldn't be-- like I
shouldn't have to make it like,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.360
you'll be disabled too,
but I think because--

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.940
and when we think about what
space we mean for our bodies,

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.270
we're already like
organisms that grew

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.140
up in a particular niche
in the world, right?

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.000
So, we're animal type.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.330
And, already parts of the world
are not particularly accessible

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:13.040
to us that are unfriendly to
our bodies in particular ways,

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.270
and we're going to be taking
that to even greater extremes.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:20.250
So to think about what that
looks like for moving bodies

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.050
in places and how our
bodies will be compromised

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:26.760
in different ways, and what
that will mean for thinking

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.700
about all bodies if we
expect, especially even

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.710
if we don't leave this planet.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:38.420
Our success with global
warming, as Chanda pointed out,

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:42.810
means that all of our bodies
are not going to be fit

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:46.760
to the environmental niche that
is coming for us in the future.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.440
So to think about
disability as a category

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.230
in which that's permeable
for a lot of people,

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.460
a lot of people don't imagine
themselves becoming disabled

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.850
in the future, they should.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:01.810
But that is not often
part of how anyone plans.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.820
I mean, that's why we have sort
of a housing crisis for elderly

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.540
and disabled folks and why--

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.310
I don't understand why
we keep building houses

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:12.610
with stairs, right?

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:16.510
There are just some basic things
about how we failed a plan,

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:23.270
not just for space, but
for age and for our--

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.980
what we've done to the planet,

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.670
all of those things
in it together.

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.970
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.270
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
I just kind of want

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:31.930
to add something to this,
and I know I keep coming back

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:36.040
to Mauna Kea, but I think for
me, it was a seminal point

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.200
of having to evaluate what am I
still doing here and am I going

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.550
to stay in the scientific
community.

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:46.390
And coming back to the question
of modernity and who gets

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:50.380
to be modern, one of
the protector science

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.980
that was my favorite was
pono science is possible.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.210
And I'm not going to pretend
to explain what pono means

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:01.290
to people, but essentially the
idea was that there is a way

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.660
of doing science that
is ethical and keeping

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.830
with Kanaka Maoli values.

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:09.830
And, I think the second thing
that really stood out to me,

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:12.100
there was a beautiful
essay by Bryan Kuwada,

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.650
who's one of the
people I got to know

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.620
and someone I would
consider a friend, called,

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.150
"We Come from the
Future, Join Us",

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.680
that he wrote in
response to this.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.960
And I would encourage everyone
to go and read his words.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.260
But in fact, you know, I meet--

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.830
I drew the parallel between
general relativity and thinking

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.680
about the land as a family
member for very specific reasons

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.290
because GR is considered
advanced techno knowledge.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.270
And I think that having to
sit with this idea of land

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.450
as family is equally, if not,

01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:45.510
more difficult material
to think through.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:49.020
And so maybe the difficulty
that scientists had

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.080
with understanding that Kanaka
Maoli position was because it is

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.000
so advanced if we
were to use that word.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.640
And I think that that's a really
important thing to think about,

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.360
which is, could our
science even be better?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.510
I don't think that that
should be the reason to think

01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:06.330
about respect, but I think
that that's certainly a feature

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.280
in the same way that Ashley
is thinking about, I think.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.250
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.070
Sure.

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: So, my brief
thought is that, you know,

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:21.380
centering the ableist
perspective and centering--

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:28.120
or not even thinking about
indigenous people's perspectives

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.820
in how they live their
lives, not thinking

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.120
about that is almost

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.360
as willfully not
centering innovation.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:40.760
We're saying we want to live
in an unimaginative way.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.310
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:48.680
And to build off of imagination,
one of the things that came

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.070
up in our discussion, of course,

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:53.100
is how we imagine
the scientists.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:58.420
So, pop culture depictions
of scientists and how they do

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.270
or don't describe what we do

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:02.910
and how they also
influence the way we think

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:04.880
of who is an explorer.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.520
So-- And I'll throw that out
to anyone who wants to take it.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.190
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Disabled
explorers

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:15.550
and scientists are always
depicted as evil, right?

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:18.400
So as you were saying
that it was like, well,

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.890
where does this intersection
happen when you have--

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.880
when disabled people have
representation in some way?

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.250
I mean, we have like Captain
Hook, you know, evil scientist,

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:35.350
mad scientist, right, a
neurodivergent scientist

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:37.390
that populate our
stories like even

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.600
when we're imaging how disabled
people when it's possible

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.370
to insert them in the
narratives we have

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.590
with the narratives we're given.

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:47.420
It's never on a positive light.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.150
It's kind of-- it
just prick me to think

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.450
about that as you've said it.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:57.740
We don't imagine good scientists
who have the right stuff perhaps

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.770
as disabled people ever.

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:01.070
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.070
Or we imagine them as
having a special skill.

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:06.010
So I'm thinking about the
movie "Contact" where there's--

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.310
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Oh, yeah.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.610
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: -- you
know, he's listening in the--

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.280
but he doesn't get to be
first author on the paper,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.020
the movie is not about him.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.320
You know, they just
sort of come in

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.790
and like serve a special
place and then are jettisoned

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.200
for the rest of the movie.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.500
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Yeah.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.800
Yeah, the sidekick.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.100
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.400
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
I guess--

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.470
I think about the film
"Hidden Figures" and I'm going

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:32.900
to assume everyone in the room
knows what that film is about.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.670
And, maybe ironically,
something that really bugged me

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.950
about the movie was-- or
I shouldn't say bugged me,

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:40.250
but something I struggled

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:44.300
with during the movie
was skin color because--

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.600
well, a couple of things.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.090
So, first of all, the actual
hidden figures were paid

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:50.810
so well, that with two
years of their salary,

01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:52.280
they could buy a house.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.340
And so actually sort of the
socioeconomic representation

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.850
in the film is not accurate,

01:07:56.850 --> 01:07:59.720
and we all know Hollywood
likes to dramatize things.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.670
But I thought a lot about,
you know, what is the message

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.060
that gets sent about who the
hidden figures are, if that's--

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.720
if you only watch the movie
and you don't read the book.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.300
The other thing is, is that
they were light-skinned.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.270
And I want to highlight that
because as everyone can tell,

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.500
Brian and I are fairly
light-skinned people.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:23.350
And we are two of really
three maybe black cosmologists

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:27.610
in the United States
who hold PhDs right now.

01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:30.620
And so I think the other thing
that we have to think carefully

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.310
about is even within our
narratives of diversity

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.460
and inclusion that certain
people are more likely

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.820
to get through the door.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:42.480
And I really struggled
with that dimension

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.180
of hidden figures being
missing, the discourse

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.150
that it was really only
light-skinned women

01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:49.360
of a certain socioeconomic class

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.300
who were actually getting
those opportunities

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.170
and it wasn't working
class darker-skinned women

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.370
who were getting
those opportunities.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:09:00.310
And I think that that needs to
be part of the conversation,

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:04.040
even in the culture today,
that certainly I continue

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.360
to experience racism, and
I'm occasionally very shocked

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.250
by this because I'm like
I'm so pale, are you really

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.590
like that invested in it.

01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:14.760
And not that I think it
shouldn't happen to me,

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.310
I'm just even because
people don't always know

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:19.350
that I'm black, I
continue to be impressed

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.210
that like it finds me anyway

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:25.980
in our one-drop deeply
committed anti-black culture.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.860
But I think that that is
really a feature that we have

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.920
to think carefully
about how skin colorism.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.670
And I think, again, this
is written on the body,

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.750
is maybe another way of putting
it, that all of these ways

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:41.460
of how our bodies are perceived
and which ones are perceived

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:45.270
as being closer to the
ideal, even if nonideal,

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.840
become part of the conversation.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.140
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: No,
and this picks

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.440
up on how we design things.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.750
So if we want inclusion
and diversity,

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.250
sort of design team
is we need to have.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.520
There are so many good
examples of failures,

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.530
of planning like the soap
dispensers, you know,

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.120
automatic soap dispensers
and sinks

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.090
that can't see black
people, right?

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:07.190
Because who is on that
design team testing that out?

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.640
Yeah. And there's the-- if you--

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.350
on YouTube, it's
a wonderful video,

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:14.360
it's called, the HP is racist.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.890
And it has two best buy
employees who discovered

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:22.890
that the HP cameras could not--
they were doing facial detection

01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:27.240
and following faces, but
only for people of skin

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.060
of a certain lightness, and
it's also a very funny video.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.070
But just in how we're
programming things

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:36.340
and how we're attending the
things we're already building

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.640
with the people we already
have, what we're failing

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.480
in engineering teams on a
regular basis in those ways.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.390
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And
this goes back to your point

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:51.720
at the beginning, Brian,
about the increasing use of AI

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.820
and machine learning in really
every aspect of our daily lives.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.940
If you're not familiar
with machine learning,

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:04.420
this a major part of how
your choices are given to you

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.430
in terms of like its
probably greatest use,

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.320
beside from the military,
is marketing.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.040
But when we think about, you
know, the design of algorithms,

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.270
for example, a lot of the,
you know, skin detection

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.780
or facial recognition, a
lot of that is used already

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.520
in policing often without
the consent of the community

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.680
that it's deployed on.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.160
And, you know, all of the facial
recognition algorithms perform

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.980
more poorly on people who
are darker skinned and women.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.440
And so, again, women
who are black

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.460
and darker skin fear the worst

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.180
in the technology
that we design.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.320
And a lot of those are
inseparable from science

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.350
as an enterprise because
those are the same algorithms

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:55.420
in many cases that we use on
pretty pictures of galaxies.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.180
Yeah. Did you have
another comment?

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.480
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
Yeah.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.520
I think-- I just want to make
sure that I-- I think the--

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.220
there's a debate
within, I guess,

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.870
I'll vaguely term it ethnic
studies about where we are

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:18.340
in terms of how racial
identification works in society.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.690
So there are some
people who think we are

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:23.110
in a black, not black society.

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:26.000
And so you're either black or
you're not black and that's kind

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.140
of where the default
lines exist.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.570
And then there are other people

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:32.710
who think it really falls
along skin color lines.

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:36.400
And so, if you are
of African heritage

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.750
but if you're lady enough, then
it's no longer kind of a factor.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:47.640
And I think of as-- of
racist as social technology

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.750
that was developed, and
I've written about this,

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.840
so I wrote an essay
called "Physics of Melanin"

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.920
where I talk about how
we could have used earwax

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.000
to divide people because
some people have hard earwax

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.310
and some people have
soft earwax.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:05.750
And instead-- And it was
a technology that was kind

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:07.380
of developed in hindsight,
well, oh now,

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.310
we have all these
dark-skinned slaves,

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:12.110
so how do we separate them and
make sure the Irish don't think

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.790
that they're on the
same side with them?

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:17.740
And also-- And there's a
complicated conversation

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.590
about how indigenous people
were sort of fitted into that.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:23.980
But, again, I think that when
we talk about technology,

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.490
I guess we have to think
about these concepts

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:31.000
as social technologies
because race was really made

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.490
into a scientific concept even
though it is a social concept.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:38.970
And, again, that's something
that follows us into space.

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:43.010
But coming back to Brian's
question about, you know,

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:45.680
what if we use space
as kind of a laboratory

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.090
for experimenting
on these things.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.670
I think we do in the
sense that, you know,

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:53.140
I scour the new astronaut class

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.410
for where-- how dark
is everyone.

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.720
That's always my first
question when I look at--

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.270
when scientists are
selected, myself included.

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.220
If I'm the only black
person in the room,

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.230
I knew I'm the only
black person in the room

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:05.530
and I am light-skinned.

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.530
That's part of the conversation.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.850
And so that would be
part of our conversation

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:12.300
of who do we even send
up in that laboratory,

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.940
and I'm sure Black Twitter
would have a lot to say about,

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.670
are those people dark enough,
are there enough women, oh,

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:20.640
that person is not cess.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.710
And I love that Black Twitter
has those conversations most

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.010
of the time.

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:29.260
But I think that in some sense,

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.560
we can escape our social
technologies and we need

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.580
to acknowledge that our
social technologies are fused

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:39.190
with our physical technologies,
including who bears the brunt

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.600
of our global warming that
it is the global south

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.020
that felt it first and only
now are we really starting

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.320
to feel it further up north.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.150
And so, I like to remind people

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.520
that hurricanes have been
killing people in the Caribbean

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.000
for a long, long time,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.490
and typhoons have been killing
people in Southeast Asia

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.040
and South Asia for
a long, long time.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.990
But it's only now that
people are like, oh,

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:00.460
maybe we should really
do something

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.790
about that, I mean, some people.

01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:05.790
So I think that we need
to not think of technology

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:11.180
as a physical thing,
and I think race is kind

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:15.110
of a central point for that.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.230
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And
since I promised we would return

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:20.960
to space poop, I will
use that to branch off

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.970
into the physicality of us all
as human beings and the fact

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.230
that we have these social
contracts that are on top

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.030
of actual human bodies.

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:34.340
And I think my-- from
our pre-event call,

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.720
my favorite quote was Chanda
saying there's no freedom

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.020
in poop.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:42.390
And that we have this
like wonderful noble image

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:46.330
of the astronaut
out there exploring,

01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:49.770
being the representative,
and also having to deal

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.070
with all of these things.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.490
I see you're already
holding the mic, Ashley.

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:56.230
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: You're
explaining it well, yes,

01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:58.570
I mean managing bodies, right?

01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:01.340
I mean, what we've learned from
the history of space and pooping

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:03.600
in space and peeing in space,

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.530
like it's been messy
and awkward.

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:11.770
The image of the astronaut as
being like a buff white dude

01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:16.080
who is somehow a cut above
the rest, who have made it

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.590
on the space program, but in the
end, he's either strapping a bag

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:25.910
to his anus or wearing a diaper
and like it just gets as patched

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:28.820
like realizing that we're
like meat bags all the time

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:34.670
and managing these meat bags,
is a real, real challenge.

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:35.970
Yeah.

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.270
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:38.570
Anyone else?

01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:39.870
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:

01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:43.580
I think I should
clarify my comment.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.230
[Laughter] I'm going to-- Oh,
I'll just say that I think the--

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.410
one of the things we
talked about is how it came

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.350
into the popular consciousness
that astronauts had

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:55.550
to wear diapers or bags, which
was that there was a conflict

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.240
between astronauts
who were a couple

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.390
and I forget exactly what--

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:01.690
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Texas de Flores.

01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:03.190
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
Texas de Flores, the woman put

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:06.640
on a diaper and drove
continuously.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.610
And she wore a diaper so
that she wouldn't have

01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:09.910
to get out of the car.

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:11.220
And I think I must
have been a first

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.520
or second year graduate student
in astronomy and I had no idea

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.710
that this was how
astronauts dealt with poop.

01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:22.150
But that, you know, even
when you go into space,

01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:25.700
you cannot escape your poop.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.450
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Sometimes
you literally can't.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:30.950
I mean, the backup of the one
toilet that sent like bits

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:37.770
of fecal matter around the cabin
before they landed, like it's--

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:39.740
like we don't think
about our bodies

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.640
as engineering challenges
generally every day,

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.190
especially if we're able-bodied.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:44.490
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:45.790
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Right?

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:48.610
But these-- The mechanics
of these things that a lot

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.890
of disabled people have to
think about every day, right,

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:53.820
thinking about the
mechanics of using a restroom

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.880
under particular
conditions, for instance,

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.750
or even how close a restroom is.

01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:04.280
You have to, if we're going
to make these huge plans,

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.430
like most people just
take toilet thing

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:09.680
as a given, and they shouldn't.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.280
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: You
know, I think interestingly,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.730
even though we-- you know, aside
from this news story bringing it

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.900
into the public consciousness,
we often hide that aspect

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.350
of the realities
of going to space.

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.230
But when I worked with
students, for example,

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:28.640
so we have a Gemini capsule
at the other planetarium

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.090
and right next to it in the
display case is the poop bag.

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:37.150
And it is the thing
that students are like,

01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:40.430
I had a couple of interns
who were working with me

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:43.630
to write poetry during
part of their time to go

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:46.440
around through the
museum and speak

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.560
to different artifacts
in the museum.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.730
And one of them wrote an ode

01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:53.760
to the poop bag and
I was like, yeah.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.990
So, we're coming to the
end of our time here.

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:00.680
We're going to have
some time for Q&amp;A.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.550
But maybe if I could ask
all of the panelists,

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:06.890
I'd love to return
to this concept

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.820
of not just the right
stuff but the right time

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.310
since we have people who
think about time in a variety

01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:14.610
of different ways here.

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:17.360
And maybe if you can each
offer a closing remark

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.020
if it moves you.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.870
Whoever wants to go first.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:28.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: So, I'm not
sure I have a comment on time,

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.820
but I think the thing that is
clarified for me at least sort

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:37.680
of verbally in my head during
our discussions is, as you said,

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.710
social technology, and if I can
turn that around a little bit

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.460
and say that all
technology is social.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.700
And when we say the right
stuff, there's this implication

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.180
that there's an objectivity
to these technologies

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.490
or objectivity to the
scientific perspective.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.300
And there's an objectivity to
what a scientist or someone

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.440
who goes into space
looks like and that--

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.190
but that objectivity is false
and that objectivity is just set

01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:03.600
up by the people who have
accumulated enough power

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.920
to define that as the
objective perspective.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.960
And maybe that means that--
and maybe since, you know,

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.790
living with that idea for so
long myself that our destiny is

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:17.420
to be in space, maybe
that objective perspective

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.990
that I thought I had is that
the time is always now to go.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:24.220
And we need-- and maybe that
default, maybe that idea

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.480
of objectivity as we
always progress outward

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.220
and we always progress to expand
may be turning that around

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:37.340
and saying-- and just
continually asking maybe

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.750
Chanda's question of why now.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.300
Maybe that's where
we need to just--

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.610
we need to keep going
instead of always saying,

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:45.970
yes now, yes next, yes next.

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:47.740
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And I'd
love to hear from you, Brenda,

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.340
also from the standpoint of
somebody being deeply embedded

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.800
in the history and not just
solely the young history

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.100
of space exploration.

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:00.020
&gt;&gt; Brenda J. Child: I'm afraid
at this point I just have--

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:05.010
I keep thinking about jokes
and since we were talking

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:08.030
about poop, we can
talk about jokes, too.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.450
So, I think about
different variations

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:16.260
on Native American jokes about--

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.940
that I'm reminding often
with the kind of debate

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:22.050
on immigration to
the United States

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:25.590
and native people always having
to remind folks that, you know,

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:28.460
we're the ones from here
and you folks are all

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.400
from some place else and you're
the settlers, and we always joke

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.860
about what if the
settlers leave.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:37.620
So I'm thinking about kind
of a future where a fantasy

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.610
for native people where, what
if the settlers leave and go

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:42.260
to other planets, in Mars,

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.500
and we get to stay here
with our ancestors?

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.850
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: So the question
of when is the right time,

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:52.360
you know, I don't--
just as I don't think

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.110
that there is a good answer to
who has the right stuff, right,

01:21:56.110 --> 01:22:00.380
I don't think the answer
should be linear or clear.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.260
I don't think we're ever
going to have an answer

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.220
to what the right time might be.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.760
A mass of an asteroid is coming
that'll really put a time clock

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.600
on things, right?

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.870
But, you know, I think it's good

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:17.070
to consider multiple
perspectives as we think

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:21.930
about who belongs in space and
what the timeline is going to be

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:25.920
for what that looks like and
who the stakeholders are.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.010
And, I mean, these things are--
there will be no right time.

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:36.090
There is no right stuff
but there's stuff and time.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.780
I'll turn it over
to a physicist now.

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.080
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.720
That's actually a
really good lead

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.020
in to what I was going to say.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.320
So thank you for the setup.

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:49.320
So, the key insight
of Einstein's theory

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.260
of general relativity,
I think, is that there--

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:55.140
and really the key insight
of special relativity is

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.830
that there is no such thing
as an objective observer.

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:03.080
And I went through a
PhD, two qualifying exams

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.380
that cover this topic.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.820
I took GR, I taught GR
before I really realized

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.120
that this was the key insight.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.310
And, I highlight this
because it came out in-- I--

01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:17.800
my mom is a radio host
on the Pacific Network

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.640
and she sent me a bunch of
archival material, and in there,

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.420
buried, was a session from
the American Association

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.390
for the Advancement of
Science 1983 meeting

01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:30.000
where the late Joseph
Johnson, a black physicist

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.560
from Florida A&amp;M University, who
had actually played a major role

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.480
in my life much later, talked
about this insight and realizing

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.140
that it took a black physicist
who doesn't work on relativity

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.410
to reframe the area that I
was a specialist in for me.

01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:50.720
And this was really--
it wasn't--

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.680
I heard the recording for
the first time last year

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.040
and actually just wept through
it because I was so stunned

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.860
to hear this recording of a
man that I'd admired so much.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.880
And so, in connection to
this question of, you know,

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.680
what is the right time and
what is the right space

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.850
and where bodies inhabit space
and are part of space time,

01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:18.490
I think about the Palikir
people who live in a region

01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:21.010
that we would, I guess, roughly
call the Peruvian Amazon.

01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:25.760
And they have a completely
different astronomical system

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:31.870
than we do in, I guess, what you
call institutional astronomy.

01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:35.160
And, what's interesting is
because-- maybe because--

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:39.510
I shouldn't speak on this as
a big-time expert or anything,

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.950
there are a lot of snakes in
the Amazon, there are a lot

01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.630
of big snakes in the Amazon.

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:48.400
And this way of thinking of the
Palikir people reflects this.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.310
And so, in fact, instead of
using a Cartesian geometry,

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:54.370
so a Cartesian, everything
is boxy and squary,

01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:57.880
they use what we would call a
curvilinear system that is built

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:05.710
around snakes in the sky
and their spiritual system.

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.470
And what's interesting
about this is

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:09.930
that they can actually account
for the movement of the stars

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:12.170
across the night sky
through the seasons better

01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:14.820
than we can using their
geometrical system

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.670
because their geometrical system
allows for things to be curved.

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:20.900
And they also have five seasons.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.200
They don't have four.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.220
And they can predict from
looking at the sky to the day

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.790
when the rains are
going to change

01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:28.380
into a different rain season.

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:32.180
So coming back to our
question of who is modern,

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:38.030
we can't do weather prediction
for crop, but they can.

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:41.470
And so when I think about time,

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.980
we have a particular
relationship

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.590
to the Thirty Meter Telescope
timeline of when we need

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:48.070
to see galaxies now because
careers need to evolve

01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:50.240
in a certain way in
the astronomy community

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.230
because there's a new
generation coming up.

01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:57.430
But I'm guessing that people
who are feeling the impact

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:00.760
of global warming on their
systems, their technologies

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.290
of knowing the weather,
for example, are thinking

01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:08.640
that now is the time to figure
out how to deal with the fact

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.830
that these established
technologies are now being

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:12.810
shifted by things that
people on the other side

01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:16.330
of the planet are doing
with their technologies.

01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:18.630
And so I can imagine that
people have very different

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:21.490
relationships to what is
significant in this moment

01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:25.630
and in this time, and that
there's no objective observer,

01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:26.930
that's the thing we
have to sit with,

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:30.900
is that astronomers are not
more objective about this.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.410
Astronomers who are for the
TMT are not more objective

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:37.410
about this than astronomers who
were not for the TMT, et cetera.

01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:40.460
But I think that when we think
about now, we need to recognize

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.590
that there are many
different nows

01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:46.070
and that our now may not be--

01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:49.780
comes with it in a position
of power perhaps or a position

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:53.080
of disempowerment or a
sense of disempowerment,

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.410
and that that is always tied
to our social technologies.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.740
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Right.

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.040
We have some time for
questions, but first,

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.710
let's thank our panelists.

01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:04.010
[ Applause ]

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:12.520
So, if you have a question,
please raise your hand.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.250
We have two people
with microphones.

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.220
I see there's a hand
up over there.

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:23.170
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much
for the-- for your thoughts.

01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:25.060
I have one question,
while coming here,

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.920
I was reading the news and the
Atlantic Magazine just published

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.660
the piece called, "Moon is
open for business," and it's

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.050
about the private interest
and the business interest.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.710
And, you know, we talked
about-- you talked about ethics.

01:27:38.710 --> 01:27:41.650
I was wondering if you can
comment on how do we talk

01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:46.840
about ethics in a society
that is driven by economics,

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.200
accumulation of wealth
[Inaudible].

01:27:49.200 --> 01:28:00.910
&gt;&gt; Ashley Shew: Yeah, I mean,
so one way to think about ethics

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:03.200
in terms of economics is
to think about what sort

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.190
of economic system we want

01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:08.270
that could address a greater
number of people's needs.

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:14.060
So, a lot of how we think about
space at least is with SpaceX

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.650
and other companies coming
on the fray is in terms

01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:18.950
of commercial interest, right?

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:22.080
So the moon is open for business
and the things that Elon Musk is

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.870
up to, for instance,
invoke a particular system

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:30.400
by which perhaps some have
gathered, you know, free sources

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.720
to be able to dream
these big dreams while--

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.880
well, they don't pay their
employees as much as we would

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.890
like to see them paid,
or we have a system

01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:48.510
where people aren't benefiting
from the labor that they put in,

01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:52.190
or are devalued and not--

01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:54.340
so being commodified
has a certain edge

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.630
but being not a commodity
in terms

01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:59.250
of labor also has another edge.

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:02.190
So to think about ethics
and economics together is

01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.730
to question if whether
the system we're

01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:08.010
in will produce just results.

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:10.670
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:11.970
I think also in terms of--

01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.580
since you brought up
the SpaceX narratives,

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:19.050
the narratives coming out of new
space companies that say, "Oh,

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.600
we're going to make it
accessible by making it cheaper

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.420
and it'll only be
$200,000", and, you know,

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.950
not everybody will want
to sell their house

01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:32.300
that they definitely have
that is worth $200,000.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.620
But just the underlying
assumption, right, that, first,

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:43.120
you will part with your worldly
possessions in order to, what,

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.820
live on Mars and be at
the behest of the company

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:47.120
that brought you there?

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.400
You know, I think we have
many examples of company towns

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.090
and exploitation here
on Earth that inform us

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:56.630
that that is not a good
premise to be starting with.

01:29:56.630 --> 01:30:03.140
Oh, we have a question there.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:06.520
&gt;&gt; So, I think that a
key question for any sort

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.730
of exploration is always how
do we prepare for something

01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:11.520
that we've never seen.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.600
So my question is practically,
how do you think that we as kind

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:21.140
of a society at large prepare
to build a future for something

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.910
that we have never experienced?

01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:26.220
So thinking that, it's easy
to view astronauts as cowboys

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.580
because we've seen cowboys.

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.400
It's easy to say that
we're meant to go out

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:34.460
and explore space because we've
experienced Manifest Destiny.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.990
So how do we build
visions for something

01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:40.840
that doesn't exist
in a practical way?

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.480
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein: So,
oh gosh, this is being recorded.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.790
I'm going to be nice about it.

01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:48.500
So, I love the new Star
Trek series, I really do.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.690
But I want to say that
actually, I think this connects

01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:57.190
to the last question,
which is that they went

01:30:57.190 --> 01:30:59.880
out in the Star Trek
universe anyway.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.370
They go out with a very
clear ethical guide.

01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:05.060
I actually think that the Prime
Directive is a pretty important

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.320
one, and actually of the
problem of the first episode,

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.210
I'm not really giving
it away for anyone

01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:11.870
who hasn't watched
the series yet,

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:14.550
but really the first 10
minutes is not really thinking

01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:18.540
through what happens if you
don't hold the Prime Directive

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:22.230
around you as a barrier to
choices that might violate it.

01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:25.430
And it comes up a lot
because they do violate it

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.730
like all the time.

01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.440
Usually it's not so catastrophic
as it is in this new series,

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.690
but I think it really
does come down to,

01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:34.800
we have to prepare ourselves
ethically and morally

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.180
and in terms of our
thinking about respect

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:42.880
as Professor Child was saying
that you were never going

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.950
to be able to prepare
for every scenario

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:48.270
but you can prepare yourself
to be a decision maker

01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:51.700
in situations that
are unfamiliar to you.

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:54.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: Riffing off
that just a little bit,

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.590
I think that some of the failure
of our educational system is

01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:02.600
that we prepare for tasks of the
past, because people are setting

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.050
up the jobs of the future
for the people that they want

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:08.350
to be in those positions.

01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:13.780
And so, I'm-- I think we need to
rethink how we approach training

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.250
in technological tasks

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.730
and I would include
social technology in that.

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:22.380
And so, why don't we-- why
aren't we training folks

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:27.160
for solving problems
that they care about

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.950
and then learning all the pieces
to get to that as they need

01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:32.970
to instead of saying, hey,
just go through all these steps

01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:35.970
and then, oh, eventually, you'll
figure how to do research.

01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:38.390
So, in a sort of-- in a
specific context like that,

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:43.240
I think we need to innovate how
we're educating each generation.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.360
&gt;&gt; Brenda J. Child: And I
guess I would just add to that

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.820
to think about the history
of settler colonialism

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.110
around the world, and there's
been so much fantastic work

01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:55.370
in that area in the last
decade or so but a lot

01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:56.750
of it doesn't make our--

01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:59.150
it's way into public
school education.

01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:02.700
Just a few years ago,
there was a-- we did a--

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:06.130
we're working on a grant, the
historians at the University

01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:10.970
of Minnesota was-- teachers in
the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:14.610
and when they were
writing the grant,

01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:17.920
they asked how much history
education the teachers had

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.540
and they discovered that the
average high school social

01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:27.160
studies history teacher, it had
1.5 history courses in college.

01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:34.760
&gt;&gt; So, going back both to the
there's no objective observer

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.080
and there's no good time.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.760
A lot of what we-- what a lot
of us think about when we think

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.910
about colonizing Mars is,
oh, it's a blank slate

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.990
because nobody is
living there right now.

01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:47.880
But it's not like we're
only going to there once.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.800
How do we envision a way

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.350
of sustaining whatever
structures we put

01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:57.910
up when people are going to be
going back and forth presumably

01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:02.440
to Mars and to other places?

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Nord: You're talking

01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:06.420
about gentrification
of Mars [laughter]?

01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:11.620
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
I guess I kind of--

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:15.400
I went through this quickly but
I think in my opening remarks,

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.680
one of the things that was
kind of motivating me was what

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.300
if the Vulcans had come to Earth
before humanity had a chance

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.550
to develop?

01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:27.320
And, so there are lots
of scientific reasons

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.830
that you might argue
that the probability

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:33.150
of this being an actual
issue for Mars are small,

01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:36.540
but we also have often been
wrong like, for example,

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:39.690
about the speed of light
about 140 years ago, right?

01:34:39.690 --> 01:34:43.640
So, we don't actually know
what could happen on Mars

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.140
if we didn't mess with it.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.870
And, so that's actually
before you even get to the--

01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:52.950
I mean, maybe the gentrification
metaphor here is maybe an

01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:55.920
interesting one and that like,
you know, maybe there are things

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.860
that were going to
happen in that community

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.250
and this actually stands
out to me in Washington D.C.

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:02.230
as someone who's been
part of her childhood

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:06.590
and to come a perk, that
coming through the city now,

01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:08.950
it's like it's a
completely different city.

01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:11.590
And, one wonders, what are the
things that might have happened

01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:15.910
on U Street, if U Street had
been allowed to remain U Street,

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:18.490
instead of so many businesses

01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:22.140
and black people
being forced to leave?

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.440
And I actually think
that that has

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.990
to be our question
before we even think

01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:29.330
about sustaining ourselves
there, is really sitting openly

01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:32.660
with the ethical question if
we have now made a decision

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:38.610
about the future of Mars
and nothing will happen

01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:43.570
in a non-anthroposcenic
way on Mars ever again.

01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:48.200
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Also
point out that it's true

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.430
that we don't, you know,
see like space giraffes

01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:53.100
or human beings walking
around in the surface of Mars.

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:57.100
But, in many ways, we have often
quite literally only scratched

01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.540
the surface and we don't know
what history might be there,

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.710
we don't know whether
there are microbial

01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:07.420
or even more complex communities
of life under the surface.

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.490
You know, the results
of methane on Mars is--

01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:12.840
are very, very tantalizing.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.290
They could be geological.

01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:16.940
They could be-- you
know, it could be oil,

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.480
like there's any number of
possible outcomes for that.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.620
And so I think-- And we'll
talk about this later

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.080
with the concept of
environmental personhood

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.880
and how we think
about environments

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.090
and whether they have
life in them or not

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:35.320
as being something
that belongs to us.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.850
So I hope you'll stick around.

01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.150
Time for one last question.

01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:42.440
I see someone in the back there.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:46.630
&gt;&gt; So, assuming that we do
indeed want to colonize Mars,

01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:50.550
we want to give the first
colony every chance of success,

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:54.630
and it could still fail even
if we do everything right.

01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:57.620
So it takes resources
to put people into space

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.130
and picking the people
most likely

01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:03.000
to succeed is critical
to reducing the risk.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.550
So, I think that it's
been a point well made

01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:08.910
that it's very prickly
question to ask,

01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:14.270
but what are the characteristics
of the optimal first colonists?

01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:16.070
How do we pick those people?

01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:18.730
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:

01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:22.340
Depends on whether your goal is
actually colonization, right?

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.790
I think like-- I think--

01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:26.690
I probably want someone
who doesn't think

01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:27.990
about it as colonization.

01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:33.210
I'm sure that Donald Trump
disagrees with me about that.

01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:42.160
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Someone else?

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.460
All right.

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:50.750
Well, let's thank
our panelists again.

01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:52.050
[Applause]

01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:53.350
&gt;&gt; Dexter Spits,
a.k.a. Jordan Holmes,

01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:55.310
was raised in Prince
George's County, Maryland,

01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:58.240
a suburb of right
here in Washington DC.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.390
His curious mind has led him
to become a jack of all trades;

01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:05.170
a musician, an entrepreneur,
a scientist and an engineer,

01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:07.190
and a spoken word artist.

01:38:07.190 --> 01:38:10.640
Holmes relocated to Chicago
in 2014 after graduating

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.500
from Virginia Tech where he
met his mentor, Nikki Giovanni.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.070
He began his music, pursuit of
his music career as Dxtr Spits,

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:20.830
a witty, impactful,
energized lyricist.

01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:25.400
Holmes also launched his company
"Onli Packs" in August of 2017.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.900
Onli Packs are functional
backpacks

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:29.790
with prints from local artists.

01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.340
And, without further audio,

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:42.270
we'll give it over
to Dexter Spits.

01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.680
[ Applause ]

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.980
&gt;&gt; Dexter Spits: Raise
this up a little bit.

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:51.520
Very, very, excited to
be here and to speak

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.630
on such an amazing topic.

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:56.730
Also, it's nice to be the
dumbest person in the room,

01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:59.620
because clearly, I mean, the
entire panel was just filled

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:02.400
with brilliant minds and
I love to just, you know,

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.100
learn and kind of soak in.

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:10.990
So I wrote a few pieces, kind
of related to my experience here

01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:14.200
on earth, because I think
a lot of the times we look

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:20.210
out elsewhere and thinking about
colonizing and/or you know,

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.650
moving on to new planets.

01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:26.840
Or we tend to look outward
at a lot of the problems

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.950
and whatever is going
on within society.

01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:31.920
We look at, well this is the
problem [inaudible] a lot

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.220
of the times.

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.900
Whatever's going on within
society are all reflections

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:37.810
of something that's
happening within us.

01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:40.350
So I think that our, the
key is actually to turn

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.580
and look inward opposed
to outward.

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:45.170
So I wrote something
kind of in the spirit,

01:39:45.170 --> 01:39:51.470
it's called Visitors,
story time by the way.

01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:54.430
So I'm hanging with a
few friends in a park,

01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:58.420
not going to lie, couple of them
are inebriated I don't know,

01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.810
this may or may not
have anything to do

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:01.710
with the next part of the story.

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:05.460
But we see this UFO,
we freak out a bit,

01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:09.130
we wonder if it's real, our
eyes are glued to it as it moves

01:40:09.130 --> 01:40:11.670
without making a sound.

01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:15.470
It lands softly in front
of us, the door opens,

01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:19.960
smog pours out the entrance,
and a silhouette appears.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.960
A voice speaks to us, not
aloud, but in our minds,

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.260
it says that they are
communicating telepathically

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.440
and that they are from
a galaxy far, far, away.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.410
And they're here to conduct
a study, they have questions,

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:36.300
they have been listening
in on humanity for a while,

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:40.550
long enough to be
confused, very confused.

01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:43.640
They ask can we help to clarify.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.940
They understand some
of the words

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.180
but not the feeling behind them,
not the humanness behind them.

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.080
Not the true experience
of being human,

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.540
so they ask, can we help them.

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.690
And I say yes.

01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:58.700
They ask me to explain love.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.500
I say I don't know
exactly what it is,

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.330
but I know it's in our core.

01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:05.550
We can explain it biologically
but that's not the fun part.

01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:07.020
I say the really amazing part is

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.300
when you see it in
action between us.

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.740
When you see us give a shirt
off the back, off our own back

01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:16.730
for another, when you see us
greet a stranger with open arms,

01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:19.720
as if they were family, when
you see a person so engulfed

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.980
in another that they bond
to the best of their ability

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:23.670
for the rest of eternity.

01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:28.090
They stop me there and ask,
well then what is hate?

01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:30.640
I say I don't know exactly.

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.200
But it seems like
it is in our core.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.200
It may be a leftover
from tribalism,

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.330
manifesting in a modern way.

01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:40.230
Some think it's deeper and tied
to the meaning of our existence.

01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:42.860
It's painful to see it
in action between us,

01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:45.750
it shows up in the form of
violence, phobias, prejudice,

01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:48.430
racism, sexism, intolerance
between people

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:51.070
that don't look like us.

01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:54.260
And even worse sometimes
the ones that do.

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.400
With too much of it we boil over
from the pressure of negativity,

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.600
usually from a place of hurt.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:05.440
Then they proceed to
ask me, what is loss?

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.200
I say it's one of the
hardest things to cope with,

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.690
we lose our family and friends
to time, they all pass away,

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:14.880
and so will we but until you do
you have to process every bit

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.570
of loss that you have taken on.

01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:20.810
Sometimes we lose so
much that we forgive,

01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:23.390
that we forget what
it is like to have.

01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:25.150
Where sometimes,
so much is taken

01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:29.420
that we forget what we deserve
to have in the first place.

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:32.090
They ask me what is happiness?

01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:35.760
I say I'm not sure if
I've ever really known it.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.370
Let's say it may be temporary

01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:40.320
and maybe that's what
makes it so special.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.850
Knowing that loss is
omnipresent, still finding a way

01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:47.480
to be present enough to enjoy
our bodies in this space,

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:51.160
our stories, smiling whether
it's for a reason or not,

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.520
and not as a front but because
something inside us gives us

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.030
permission; permission
to be okay,

01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:01.250
permission to experience bliss.

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:04.010
They ask me what is destiny?

01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.950
I say it's wherever
we are headed.

01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:09.470
We feel like we know and we
think that it will be positive

01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:11.870
but we have no idea
where this will lead.

01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:14.390
The universe does not owe
us a fairy tale ending

01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:17.720
and that's why we must be
so careful in this moment.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.480
AI is just a step away, our feet
will soon land on Martian soil,

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.290
tension is high across nations

01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:26.760
and across the globe our
children are forgetting

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.580
about a world without screens.

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.540
Attention spans are decreasing
but attention is being brought

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.650
to the ugliest pieces
of who we are,

01:43:34.650 --> 01:43:38.240
a brutal truth of our essence.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.480
So lastly they ask
me, what is hope?

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.580
And do I have it?

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:51.400
Hope is like I guess I first
have to start with who I am,

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.770
I am a product of love that
my mother and father had

01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:56.910
for one another, their
relationship crumbled

01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:59.950
but it never transpired
to the point of hate.

01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:03.980
They lost each other and I
grew up in a lost period where,

01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:07.450
as a lost boy in a scary world,
doing my best to find a way

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:10.990
to be happy, understanding
that it's just as important

01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:12.930
to experience happiness
and sadness

01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:17.020
and that my personal destiny
is tied to our collective story

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.820
in a way that hopefully
gives promise

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.660
to our collective future.

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.980
So do I have hope?

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.240
I am hope, we all are.

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.280
And although I cannot be sure
that we will figure it all

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.310
out between us, at least I know
that there is hope inside of us.

01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:38.460
They stared deeply at us,
not just me and my friends

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.060
at the park, but they
looked deeply in my eyes

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:46.920
as if they were looking into our
entire species, and they say,

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.340
that's all we need to know.

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:53.150
Without a name, a
goodbye, or another word,

01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:58.200
they closed the door, the ship
silently rose, and they left.

01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.500
I hope it mattered.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.800
That's that piece.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.100
[ Applause ]

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:10.010
Okay, so now for the
heavy stuff, you ready?

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.060
So another piece of it, if
you haven't figured out,

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.880
I'm a black guy, right?

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:20.600
So, that's a piece of
some of my experience

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.900
within this existence.

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.870
Funny thing about the facial
recognition technologies

01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:28.570
that are happening, I
kept getting tagged as,

01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:33.380
what is the guy's
name, Chadwick Boseman,

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:36.700
for the whole black
panther campaigns

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.650
when that movie was coming
out so it was kind of funny

01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:41.410
because I don't think
we actually look alike.

01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:43.920
But it's just kind of
interesting how you kind

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.960
of get categorized and lumped
so for about a solid month,

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.650
I was getting peppered
with being tagged,

01:45:49.650 --> 01:45:52.100
like Facebook auto tagging
and people made memes

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.400
out of me, it was terrible.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.780
But anyway, the more
important part is,

01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:00.460
living in that experience, again
I turn inward when I'm looking

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:04.000
to address a lot of the things
that kind of effect how I move

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.710
through the world outwardly,

01:46:05.710 --> 01:46:08.520
and this piece is
called, Black Male.

01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:14.440
By default, every
letter that comes

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.060
to my house is black
mail, get it?

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.360
[ Laughter ]

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.200
There it is.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:27.980
By default, every letter that
comes to my house is black mail.

01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.860
Black male looks for
a proper definition

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:33.940
of what being a man is, preacher
man tells him to find God,

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.380
politician man tells him in God
we trust but cannot be trusted,

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.720
policeman tells black
male to raise his hands,

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.140
fireman sees the smoke and
knows the heat is coming,

01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.610
black male only arise when
they want something from you.

01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:48.510
Black woman wonders why black
male only seems to listen to men

01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:53.400
for advice, black male feels
like the world is against him.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.700
Preacher man tells him to pray

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:57.740
to a God whose image sometimes
looks like his slave master.

01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:00.010
Politician man says don't
worry about the details,

01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:01.540
I will be your economic savior.

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.170
Policeman puts his finger on the
trigger, fireman sees the spark

01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:06.470
and knows the heat is coming.

01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:10.250
Black male is impossible if you
burn all the evidence, right?

01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:12.540
Black woman concerned, woman
wants black male to open

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.870
up his heart and let it all.

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:15.360
Black male runs from
his feelings

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.510
as a black woman
will blackmail him.

So, no but that piece is,
I think, relevant just

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:57.530
because I kind of dug deeply
in terms of how I grew up

01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:00.560
and things that were kind of
influencing me even to now

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.030
as I walk through the world
and this next piece is kind

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:07.510
of a deeper reflection of that,

01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:10.490
kind of on another
side of the coin.

But these stories, when
I was thinking of them,

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.810
were so relevant to these
points because these are a lot

01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:19.900
of things that manifest
that we can't work

out between one another
and we, as you know,

01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:26.880

many times with the panel,

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:32.420
how can we expect to go
beyond and perform any better

when we can't quite
get it right here.

So it's not that I don't think
that we can get it right,

01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:41.450

need to be had in terms

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:44.660
of how can we be better
towards one another.

of us moving beyond planet earth
and it's, it's really a story

of survival, and one that
is important to all of us

way that you got here.

to actually open a gash.

And as I grew up,
it became apparent

01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:57.080
that cuts are inevitable,
they are part of life,

01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:00.130
and if you live long enough,
there's a cut waiting,

usually when you
least expect it.

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.350
And if you're really unlucky,
it will cut deep enough

01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:08.510
and cause enough damage
that it leaves a scar.

01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:12.030

your days that you were hurt.

01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:15.130

remember pain, or the jagged

01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:17.710
or sharp edges the
left a reminder

that you are not
invincible, a scar.

See the funny thing about
scars though is that yes,

01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:28.440
they remind us that we are
only human and can be hurt,

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.110
but they also remind
us that we survived.

listen or have the patience

to even hear me finish
a sentence or for

this be fair?

developed and it pushed me

not understand how this could

young, what a cruel joke.

How could this heal?

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:27.770
The third cut was the
deepest; it was in my mind,

01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:30.910
the most elusive and gradual,
I was cut by the feeling

01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:33.830
of not being enough, learned
from my environment and worsened

01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:35.150
by the lack of role models.

01:56:35.150 --> 01:56:37.950
I didn't know scientists or
business owners or engineers

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:40.360
and I realize this was
less of a cut and more

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.800
of a void, but it still hurt.

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.300
And I wondered how
it could be fair?

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:48.810
And how could it heal?

01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:51.210
They all cut deep and
they all left scars,

01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:54.910
but from all three, I healed.

01:56:54.910 --> 01:57:02.550
From my first cut on my tongue,
and, I'm sorry, side note,

01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:05.090
I was not planning on being
this emotional up here today.

01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:09.010
My father's here though
and he's one of the people

01:57:09.010 --> 01:57:11.730
that has witnessed this, so.

01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:15.040
From my first cut on my
tongue, because of my stutter,

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.000
I began to heal by writing.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.800
Since no one listened, I turned
to pages and let it all out,

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.570
and eventually gained
confidence in what I had to say,

01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:26.320
and began to say
it stutter or not.

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.660
And as I kept writing
and speaking and trying,

01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:32.670
the cut began to clot, the
scars heal, and I grew stronger.

01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:36.670
I still have them to remember
but I do not let them stop me.

01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:40.330
From my second cut on my chest
from the tumor, I began to heal

01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:42.270
by learning to face my fears.

01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:43.880
I couldn't control
the circumstances

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.990
but I could control
at least who I was.

01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:48.070
I learned to calm my
mind through meditation,

01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:51.230
I learned to receive help
and that it was okay.

01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:53.890
I went through the surgery and
treatment and got a clean bill

01:57:53.890 --> 01:57:55.210
of health and walked
away knowing

01:57:55.210 --> 01:57:58.930
that I could have courage even
in the most ultimate fear.

01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:04.380
The cut began to clot, the seal
got stronger, a scar formed.

01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:08.390
I still have it to remember
but it does not stop me.

01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:11.490
The last cut in my mind was
the hardest to overcome.

01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:14.620
Not feeling enough,
I healed slowly,

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:18.710
from years of self-taught,
I used my writing and speech

01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:21.220
that I learned in my first
cut to write and perform,

01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:24.410
but I needed to hear, I healed
from the courage that I learned

01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:27.400
in my second cut to step
out and try and try again,

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.960
and be vulnerable
enough to ask for help.

01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.540
And eventually I found mentors
that assured me that as long

01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.760
as I gave it my best, I
would always be enough.

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:42.140
The cut began to clot, the seal
got stronger, the scar formed.

01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.400
I still have it to remember
but it doesn't stop me.

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:48.190
See, the funny thing about scars
is that yes, they remind us

01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:51.540
that we are human and can be
hurt, but they also remind us

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:54.800
that we survived, we
made it another day,

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.440
we survived another battle,
another paper cut, a dagger,

01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:02.770
the universe tried us, and we
replied, you played yourself,

01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:13.510
because we're still here.

01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:14.810
Thank you.

01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:16.110
[ Applause ]

01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:17.410

[ Applause ]

01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:25.540
-- thank you, so random
anyway, it's fine, it's fine.

01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:29.130
Random, random side note, so I
am a material science engineer

01:59:29.130 --> 01:59:31.800
by day, when I'm not writing
tremendously depressing stuff.

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:35.390
But it's kind of interesting
because full circle,

01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:39.220
I researched at John's
Hopkins, I went to school

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.620
at Virginia Tech and
I thank University

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:42.920
of Washington, correct?

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:45.810
Also, no wait, who's, wait,
you're University of Washington,

01:59:45.810 --> 01:59:47.530
okay I'm sorry, because
I mixed it up, okay.

01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:50.590
But I also did research there
so it's kind of full circle

01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:53.030
and just interesting
be involved in an event

01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:54.620
with so many great minds so,

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:56.340
thank you so much
everybody, I'm around.

01:59:56.340 --> 02:00:00.230
I promise you that I'm not
always this like, depressed

02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:03.380
and intense, we can have normal
conversations if you want.

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:06.800
And thank you so much for just
coordinating this amazing event,

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.300
I know you put so
much work and effort

02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:14.650
into it and it's beautiful.

02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:15.950
So thank you.

02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:17.250
[ Applause ]

02:00:17.250 --> 02:00:19.320
&gt;&gt; So our second panel today
is called Mars on Earth.

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.410
And, this deals with the
intersections between Mars

02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:27.040
as a planet, a real physical
space, and the way that we think

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.020
about environments
on Earth history.

02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:33.070
And, nowadays, we know more
than we ever have before

02:00:33.070 --> 02:00:36.200
about the Martian environment
and some of the history there.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.780
But, as I mentioned this
morning in many ways,

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:41.380
we still just scratch
the surface.

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:45.890
And so, we want to look in this
panel at what we can do to think

02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:48.700
about the exploration
of other worlds

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:51.160
or human beings living off
world in light of the history

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.380
that we've had here
on our own planet.

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:57.470
So, without further ado, I
will introduce our panelists

02:00:57.470 --> 02:01:01.590
and if I can ask you to walk
up as you saw this morning.

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.590
Dana Burton is a PhD student

02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:05.140
at George Washington
University's

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.030
Anthropology Department.

02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:09.830
Her research follows the search
for life on Mars and seeks

02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:13.060
to understand the epistemologies
of value and order which come

02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:17.000
to be applied to Martian life by
various policymakers, scientists

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.960
and private entrepreneurs.

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.460
With attention to feminist
and multispecies literature,

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.770
her work explorer visions
of life and living in space

02:01:25.770 --> 02:01:28.260
and how it shapes our
conceptions of the environment,

02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.950
sociality, and governance.

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:34.360
Thus far, her work has taken her
to myriad conferences, lectures

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.830
and laboratories, in D.C.,
Texas, and California.

02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:40.100
She plans to be a part of
projects further a-field,

02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.730
whether they be space
analog sites

02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:44.780
in Iceland or Chile or beyond.

02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:48.360
Dana is also an avid fiction
reader and enjoys blues dancing.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.360
And above all, she loves
drinking tea and getting

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.890
into conversations
about affect, presence,

02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:55.510
and the intricacies
of everyday life.

02:02:00.210 --> 02:02:03.880
Nathalie Cabrol is the director
of the Carl Sagan Center

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:06.070

as analogs to early Mars.

02:02:30.210 --> 02:02:33.200
She documents life's adaptation
to extreme environments,

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.090
the effect of rapid climate
change on lake ecosystems

02:02:36.090 --> 02:02:40.300
and habitats, its geobiological
signatures, and relevance

02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:42.340
to planetary exploration.

02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:45.730

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:07.960
in the North American West,
1854-1954", explores Ojibwe

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.870
and Anishinaabe sovereignty
in the United States

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:13.880
and Canada during the
19th and 20th centuries,

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.720
centering her research on
Anishinaabe ways of knowing.

02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.240
Thank you so much, the
panelists, for joining us today.

02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:32.440
In this panel, we'll
be directing questions

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.540
to specific folks here on
the panel, but I hope to hear

02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:39.170
from each one of you in
turn about your thoughts.

02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:43.750
So, the very first thing that
I'd like to talk about, again,

02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:45.290
goes back to this
theme of narratives

02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:48.160
that we have been
revisiting here today.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:51.320
And, my first question
is for you, Margaret.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:54.670
So one of the things that
often comes up in space is

02:05:54.670 --> 02:05:58.540
that we often use a
comparison to the frontier.

02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:02.670
And I think often times,
that's invoked in a way

02:06:02.670 --> 02:06:06.340
that is not particularly
critical that invokes frontiers

02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:11.250
and the American West in a very
positive sense when, in fact,

02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:14.850
the exploration of the American
West was harmful to many people.

02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:17.780
And, given your scholarship,
you know,

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:19.530
how do you think the narratives

02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:22.450
that we use shape our
understanding of history

02:06:22.450 --> 02:06:25.330
and the way that we
envision the future?

02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:27.700
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl: I
think talking about space

02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:30.490
in that language of the
frontier, one of the things

02:06:30.490 --> 02:06:34.770
that it does is it goes back
to these settler fantasies

02:06:34.770 --> 02:06:39.070
about what the West was, what
North America was, right,

02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:41.180
the language of the
new world, the language

02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:44.960
of this virgin wilderness
that is untouched

02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.220
by any real habitation
despite the fact, of course,

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:52.360
that there's, you know,
millions, maybe even tens

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:56.690
of millions of Native Americans
living in North America,

02:06:56.690 --> 02:07:01.220
not to mention South America,
but the language of the frontier

02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:06.610
of discovery imagines virgin
wilderness, untouched space

02:07:06.610 --> 02:07:10.120
that exists for one
purpose and that purpose is

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:15.430
for the exploitation of the
new commerce, the exploitation

02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:17.750
of the settlers rather than as

02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:23.660
like a fully developed
space place on its own.

02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.080
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And
do you see parallels to that

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:27.420
in the way that we
talk about space?

02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:28.720
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl: I do.

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:31.130
And the language comes up
a lot like when various--

02:07:31.130 --> 02:07:36.190
I know there is-- I don't
remember who it was from SpaceX

02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:40.460
that was talking about not
wanting space to be a wild west.

02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:46.490
There's lots of language about,
you know, going out and carrying

02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:49.500
on this narrative
of exploration.

02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:52.990
When people talk about
exploring space, the language

02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:57.340
that they use often references
the past using the language

02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:00.190
like frontier.

02:08:00.190 --> 02:08:03.130
I mean, that's inherently
invoking the story

02:08:03.130 --> 02:08:07.850
about the exploration of
North America, the settling

02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:10.940
of North America that doesn't
actually match the reality

02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:14.620
of what happened, but
instead puts, you know,

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:18.770
these fictional explorers
in kind of, you know,

02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:21.630
glowing lights where
they're, you know,

02:08:21.630 --> 02:08:24.990
doing good for the
rest of humanity.

02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:26.290
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:29.550
So-- And if I can broaden this
to the entire panel, you know,

02:08:29.550 --> 02:08:33.930
the use even of the word
colonization was very heavily

02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:35.750
debated back in the '70s.

02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:38.020
There were all these
meetings at NASA EMS

02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:42.500
about imagining life human
beings living off world

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:46.050
with one camp sort
of exemplified

02:08:46.050 --> 02:08:49.440
by Stewart Brand being that, you
know, we should use colonization

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.840
because it would help us
remember, in his words,

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.720
I think it was, what was good
and bad about colonization,

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:59.740
which we could take
into in and of itself.

02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:01.990
And then folks like
Carl Sagan saying

02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:04.650
that we should use
something like space cities

02:09:04.650 --> 02:09:07.550
because cities have a lot of
different kinds of people.

02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:10.470
But one of the things that I've
really been wondering about is

02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:14.390
to what extent does our
choice of wording matter.

02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:18.200
You know, many of the
things that I think a lot

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.110
of scientists even who shy away

02:09:20.110 --> 02:09:23.160
from saying colonization
will use like discovery

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.500
or exploration as sort of
neutral words, and I'd love

02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.300
to hear from the panel
how you choose your words

02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.630
when you talk about
these things.

02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:34.550
I see now that you're
reaching for the--

02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:35.850
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol:
Yes, no, just--

02:09:35.850 --> 02:09:40.940
it reminds me, and Bobak might
be also sensitive to that.

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.560
Words are, you know, very
important, but engineers

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.250
and scientists, when they're
preparing mission to Mars

02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:51.540
on where they have to operate
the mission in Mars, well,

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.790
for the Mars Exploration
Rover team, we had to work

02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:57.790
on a dictionary, because
I was saying something

02:09:57.790 --> 02:10:01.470
and I had somebody right
next to me who was nodding

02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:03.850
and hearing the words
but we realize

02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:07.300
that sometimes we're not
saying the same thing at all.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:09.860
So, there is a perception.

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:13.140
As an environmental scientist,
I can tell you that, for me,

02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.650
there is no negative
connotation to say

02:10:15.650 --> 02:10:19.020
that bacteria colonize a rock.

02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.320
They do what they do.

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.520
They are just expanding their
territory, but for them,

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.560
there is no negative
connotation.

02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.990
I think that the
negative connotation comes

02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:31.280
from the interaction of--

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:34.670
in human history when people
actually did nasty things

02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:35.970
to each other.

02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:39.100
But, I think that this
is the weight of history

02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:42.780
that we put behind the
words, and we have to be,

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:45.320
you know, acknowledging this.

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.110
But you can also say, well,
OK, we are colonizing Mars

02:10:49.110 --> 02:10:54.060
as the bacteria is
colonizing the next rock

02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:56.650
because this is what they
do, they need to grow

02:10:56.650 --> 02:10:59.320
and they are going
to this other space.

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.430
So, I would say, yes, we need
to be very sensitive to history,

02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:05.800
but we also have to understand

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.550
that sometimes we could go
beyond the words themselves.

02:11:09.550 --> 02:11:16.180
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: Just to quickly
follow up with that as well

02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:19.750
as also, you know, along
the line of being sensitive

02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:22.000
to words is also
not hiding the fact

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.080
that those histories
happened either, right?

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.630
Exactly. So, like the
idea that if we're going

02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:31.710
to replace the word colonization
with something else,

02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:34.780
is it actually changing the
actions that are happening

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:37.660
or is it just invoking a
different kind of mask?

02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:41.570
And then what would get smuggled
in with those different types

02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:48.010
of activities if we call it
habitation or something else?

02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:52.380
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: So I also
find it rather interesting

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:55.950
because 10 years ago, I'm
sure I was guilty of some

02:11:55.950 --> 02:12:00.340
of the Manifest Destiny sort of
things as well and, you know,

02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.810
trying to be more
aware of the situation

02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:06.360
as a representative of NASA.

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.920
I think one of the things
that's interesting is a lot

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.640
of this comes up from
an American dominance

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:12.940
in the space exploration field.

02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:16.700
You don't necessarily hear the
same words, in my experience,

02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:18.460
with some of the
other space agencies

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.910
that I've had the
opportunity to work with.

02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:26.750
And so, as kind of the de
facto owners of sort of this,

02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:29.340
you know, whether it's
NASA, whether it's SpaceX,

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:33.000
whether it's, you know, kind
of industry, going to Mars,

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.430
that certainly does mean
that we sort of tend

02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:38.130
to the familiar terms.

02:12:38.130 --> 02:12:40.970
And you see even in the
current administration, right,

02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:44.390
there's sometimes some almost
a religious-like aspect

02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:47.400
of divinity, of a sort of
amount of-- you know, again,

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.230
a Manifest Destiny,
but as imparted to us

02:12:50.230 --> 02:12:54.410
by a supreme being version
of that in our conversations.

02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:57.100
But I think also to your point
is we definitely do strive,

02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.450
right, in engineering even and
we're very technical people,

02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:02.910
but we also work very hard
to define the semantics

02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:04.380
of what we're talking about.

02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:06.900
And that those things
really do matter in our--

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:08.310
you know, in our case
often times is just

02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:11.170
because if I make the
wrong choice based

02:13:11.170 --> 02:13:13.100
on an interpretation of what
you're doing, we've lost,

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:16.840
you know, a billion dollar
mission but also because it's--

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:19.640
you know, it's the way that
we come to a common framework.

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:21.980
So I'm willing to accept,
of course, any term,

02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:24.880
but I think we also have
to, you know, as a society,

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.200
agree on what the
meaning of that term

02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:29.730
as in what the connotations are.

02:13:29.730 --> 02:13:32.370
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
So, if we can explore some

02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:35.070
of these narratives
a little bit more.

02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:39.060
Dana, I wanted to particularly
ask you, given your background

02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:42.420
in anthropology and your work.

02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:45.980
Another thing that I hear a lot,
when we talk about this stuff,

02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:49.650
is not just necessarily
references specifically

02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:53.380
to the American west or the
frontier, but we also hear a lot

02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:57.120
about like what humans do
and don't do, and I wonder

02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:01.980
if you could speak to that.

02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:05.240
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: So, I guess one
of the first things you learn

02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.080
as an anthropologist is that
people are very different

02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:15.460
and it's very difficult to wrap
your head around difference

02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.650
because often in so much of our
everyday lives, we're trying

02:14:18.650 --> 02:14:21.970
to relate to each other, we're
trying to find similarities.

02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:25.050
Society and institutions are
all about making categories

02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:28.770
and then fitting people or
objects or beings into them.

02:14:28.770 --> 02:14:31.200
So, particularly with
space exploration,

02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.620
you have to be very
careful about the ways

02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:38.370
in which the human or
personhood is evoked

02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:42.810
because it can also not
give enough attention

02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:46.630
to the myriad different types
of experiences that people have.

02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:50.120
So, I think a really
good example would be

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:53.560
from what we talked about in the
first panel, which is, you know,

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:57.390
how people relate
to their bodies.

02:14:57.390 --> 02:15:01.170
Humanity has multiple
different types of ways

02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:05.920
in which we understand
privacy or intimacy

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.100
and the ways bodies
get visualized

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:11.750
or recognized or acknowledged.

02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:16.470
And so, it will be interesting
to see how these projects

02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:19.770
that push people
outside of known

02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:23.610
and recognizable environments
will shift how we understand

02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:27.540
bodies and people and humanity
in relation with each other

02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.470
as well as relationship
with the environment.

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.210
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: What do
you think-- if there exists one,

02:15:35.210 --> 02:15:37.580
do you think that
there's a concrete effect

02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:41.500
to making statements
about what humans do?

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:49.330
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: A concrete
statement to what humans do?

02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:51.670
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah,
so I'm asking specifically

02:15:51.670 --> 02:15:55.560
about how these shape
or ideas of--

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.080
you know, to return to actually
to that first panel of like

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.000
who is an explorer or how we
include or disinclude people.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.930
You know, I think often times
when that phrase of like it's--

02:16:07.930 --> 02:16:10.690
it is in human's
nature to explore,

02:16:10.690 --> 02:16:14.130
I think that often shapes
the way that we think

02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:16.060
about who an explorer is.

02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:18.050
So I wonder if anyone
wants to speak to that.

02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:21.230
And I throw it out, not only
to you, but to the whole panel.

02:16:21.230 --> 02:16:23.360
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: I
can start at least.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.830
It's-- I've also heard that
a lot in terms of, you know,

02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:31.410
people want to explore its
human's destiny to go forth

02:16:31.410 --> 02:16:36.580
and know and-- know
the universe.

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:39.840
But, I think that
something that we could say

02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.980
with the humans are is,
we relate to each other,

02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:49.110
we interact with each other, and
we have these common experiences

02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:52.630
that deeply affect
who we are and it's

02:16:52.630 --> 02:16:58.400
through these different
experiences that we are able

02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:03.940
to comprehend a lot of the
narratives around space.

02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:07.990
And so, you know, the
idea that even thinking

02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:10.720
of the word exploration is going
to have different resonances

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:13.560
with a lot of different people
and yet at the same time,

02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:16.870
we may be able to understand
what those resonances are

02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:20.160
and where those common grounds
are and have conversations

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:27.570
that would promote in theory
of respectful or a type

02:17:27.570 --> 02:17:31.190
of exploration hopefully
that isn't all exploitative.

02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:37.620
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Anyone
else want to comment on that?

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.340
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol:
Obviously, you know,

02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.300
this aspect of anthropology
and relationship, et cetera,

02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:44.460
isn't on my expertise.

02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:48.360
What I can relate to is, once
again, going back to looking

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.710
at life on this planet, we
say humans are explorer,

02:17:51.710 --> 02:17:55.260
you can take this statement
and take life as an explorer.

02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:57.310
And the reason why we're
still here today is

02:17:57.310 --> 02:18:01.450
because life has given itself
a chance to adapt and evolve

02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:04.410
and survive by multiplying
its environment

02:18:04.410 --> 02:18:07.320
and the habitat it has been
colonizing for 4 billion years.

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:10.680
So it's not just human, this is
not something that is specific

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.460
to us, what is specific to us is

02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:16.380
that now we have the
technology to take it farther.

02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:19.610
We also have a society
that allows human to relate

02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:23.200
to each other, but it's
not specific to human,

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:24.980
it's specific to life.

02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:28.200
So, if you want to take the
interaction between humans

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:31.920
and how it's going
to color exploration,

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:36.780
you can say this also of
symbiotic systems of life.

02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:38.940
How you're successful
or less successful

02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:42.090
in an extreme environment
is who you are going

02:18:42.090 --> 02:18:46.120
to associate yourself
with and use the strength

02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:49.290
of the next body of yours,
the next microorganism

02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:51.220
to make the system function.

02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:56.320
As a human, we can see this
this way, and it is that--

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:59.710
and when we're having this
discussion just before the panel

02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:03.310
and we had it even, you know,
a few days prior to that.

02:19:03.310 --> 02:19:12.230
For me, I see all of you in
this room not as gender or races

02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:14.660
or as an environmental
scientist,

02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:16.990
I see you as the product

02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:21.070
of environment, climate
and history.

02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:22.560
The differences in our bodies,

02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.120
difference in our
culture reflect

02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:28.430
where we have been evolving,
where our history reside,

02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:31.300
what kind of climate
we have been under.

02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:33.500
How we have perceived
the environment

02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:36.530
and how we relate
it structurally

02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:38.960
as organism, we are
all the same.

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.830
The difference we are showing
here is really about that.

02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:46.010
And it's true for all system.

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:49.150
What is really interesting
is how are we going

02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:52.390
to use this reflection of who
we are which is a reflection

02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:58.650
of biodiversity and adaptation
into the next exploration.

02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:02.790
The same-- that is true
for microorganic colonies,

02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:05.010
it's true for us as well.

02:20:05.010 --> 02:20:07.530
But on top of this, we
have brought what we call

02:20:07.530 --> 02:20:10.410
intelligence and, again, as
an environmental scientist,

02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:14.130
I would say that, you know,
anybody will make it this far,

02:20:14.130 --> 02:20:17.630
you know, on our planet has to
be intelligent in some ways.

02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:22.290
But we brought a society and
we brought an interaction

02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:27.130
which is negative or positive
but we all have strength.

02:20:27.130 --> 02:20:29.350
Beyond our diversity,
we are here,

02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:32.590
we are survivors,
we're adaptable.

02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:35.360
And I think that this is what
is going to take us next,

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.350
this is what we need
to use beyond the terms

02:20:37.350 --> 02:20:40.560
of colonization, between
the-- beyond the terms of,

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.530
you know, cultures, et cetera.

02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:48.140
We need to bring our
strength like symbiotic system

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:49.690
if we want to make it.

02:20:49.690 --> 02:20:52.340
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:53.640
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl:
One of the things

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.340
that this conversation makes
me think about and, I'm sorry,

02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.360
I guess today finds
me in a little bit

02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:04.280
of a pessimistic mood,
is the way that appeals

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:09.940
to the public good or
universal truce have been used

02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:12.890
to violate the rights

02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:15.970
of minority peoples
throughout history.

02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:20.190
I think maybe an example that
fits this space is, I mean,

02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:23.120
not too far from here,
there have been drawers full

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:27.390
of native people's bodies,
ancestor's bodies in drawers

02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:31.670
for decades, right, stolen
from graves, heads cut off

02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:35.540
by US military generals
and reduced

02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:38.180
to data for the public good.

02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:41.890
And when native people asked to
have their ancestors returned

02:21:41.890 --> 02:21:43.470
to them, they were said,
well, you're standing

02:21:43.470 --> 02:21:44.890
in the way of science.

02:21:44.890 --> 02:21:48.570
We all need this knowledge,
this is something that--

02:21:48.570 --> 02:21:50.670
you know, that is
for everybody's good

02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:53.130
and your objection
doesn't, you know,

02:21:53.130 --> 02:21:55.060
carry as much weight
in this conversation.

02:21:55.060 --> 02:22:00.370
And so, I have questions
about how this--

02:22:00.370 --> 02:22:02.000
you know, this appeal

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.470
to a common humanity could
potentially, not necessarily,

02:22:05.470 --> 02:22:08.240
but potentially be
used in a similar way

02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:11.100
to override the perspectives
of people

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:16.810
who don't necessarily
agree with, you know, yes,

02:22:16.810 --> 02:22:19.780
with people who are
making decisions.

02:22:22.850 --> 02:22:25.130
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: I think you
are right, we are talking kind

02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:26.590
of similar theme to
climate change, right,

02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:28.910
where we are making
decisions on behalf

02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:31.720
of everybody whether
we like it or not.

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:35.380
I think you hit an interesting
point of technology because,

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.550
you know, the technology allows
us to explore is also some

02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:40.090
of the technology that allows
us to survive and thrive

02:22:40.090 --> 02:22:43.250
in our environments, right, the
fact that we can get crop yields

02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:46.150
that are, you know, hundreds
of times what they were

02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:49.210
and also can, you know, the
[inaudible] the extract oil

02:22:49.210 --> 02:22:53.740
from sand essentially and make
our cars go for years to come.

02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:56.860
It is an interesting dilemma,
though, because, right,

02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.090
those are things
that both have the--

02:22:59.090 --> 02:23:00.540
you know, the benefits
to some of us

02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:03.540
and not necessarily equal
benefits to all people.

02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:05.470
And it's a really difficult
challenge, and I was thinking

02:23:05.470 --> 02:23:07.150
about the earlier panelists,

02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:08.990
it's from a narrative
perspective, it's very easy

02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:11.000
for me to be like-- ask all
of you to close your eyes

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.820
and imagine, for example, a
world without homelessness.

02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:16.230
And for most of us in this room,

02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:18.520
it really doesn't change our
life in a significant way.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.210
But if I ask you to close your
eyes and imagine you're living

02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:25.400
on Mars, the life story is a
very dramatically different one.

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:27.720
And I think that's one of the
problems that we sort of have,

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:30.170
is the sort of the
ability to put ourselves

02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:31.470
in these other perspective

02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:33.390
and how do you tell the
narrative of, well, obviously,

02:23:33.390 --> 02:23:34.920
if I was a homeless person--

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:37.470
the life that I'm not homeless
is a significant difference

02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:38.770
to me.

02:23:38.770 --> 02:23:41.470
So how do I then put
myself into that perspective

02:23:41.470 --> 02:23:43.030
and I think that's
the challenge that,

02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:44.630
you know, each of us faces.

02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:48.240
I think, you know, the way
that I'm slowly learning

02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:50.170
to do this is, right, through
conversations like this

02:23:50.170 --> 02:23:52.960
and to kind of think
about, OK, what is it not

02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:54.660
like to have my own experience

02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:56.580
but to have other
people's experiences.

02:23:56.580 --> 02:24:00.390
And amazingly, right, we slowly
see, I think, overtime that some

02:24:00.390 --> 02:24:03.590
of these differences
come full circle, right?

02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:05.250
I think of L.A., for
example, where we used

02:24:05.250 --> 02:24:08.640
to have bike paths throughout
the city that were torn out for,

02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:10.920
you know, freeways to be made

02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:14.020
and now we're going back
to bike paths, right?

02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:16.310
So what's-- you know,
what's old becomes new again

02:24:16.310 --> 02:24:17.610
and it is an interesting thing.

02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:19.240
So, to start thinking
about some of that like,

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:21.330
what are the things that
we are missing out on

02:24:21.330 --> 02:24:25.290
because of so-called progress
but as in return like sort

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:28.980
of cyclical process, you know,
not that we can cut corners

02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:34.010
but maybe there is a way for us
to sort of think in those terms.

02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:35.310
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:38.170
You know, the point that
you both have brought

02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:43.010
up about not everyone
necessarily agreeing

02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:48.940
with space exploration, I guess,
I would say as an enterprise

02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:51.800
or even the language that
we use around it, right?

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:54.760
I-- It makes me think actually
of some of the questions

02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:59.080
that exist about
astronaut health and, again,

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.450
returning to this idea of
bodies in space, right?

02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:05.620
That essentially for
long duration missions,

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:08.580
if we were to go to Mars
or something like that,

02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:11.960
there's no way for those health
standards to actually be met.

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:14.750
So the way that it's
currently done is that NASA has

02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:18.360
to evaluate whether they
will violate the standards

02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.610
for astronaut health in
every single mission case.

02:25:21.610 --> 02:25:26.790
And so, there's also this
slightly more subtle issue,

02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:28.740
right, of informed consent.

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:33.020
So you can say with astronauts
individually could, you know,

02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:34.860
we love thinking about
the individual here

02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:38.590
in the United States,
a lot of [inaudible].

02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:41.710
And so you could say, well,
an astronaut can choose

02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:46.770
to undertake a mission that
might create damage to them.

02:25:46.770 --> 02:25:50.790
However, when we think about
things like Mars sample return,

02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:54.500
you-- or even just private
space industry being in charge

02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:57.110
of flight, you know, when you
launch something into space,

02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:59.930
you launch over other people.

02:25:59.930 --> 02:26:04.630
You have the potential for risk
in which people are not able

02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:07.990
to actually consent
to being part of that,

02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:10.240
either because they don't
know what's going to happen

02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:11.950
or because they are-- you know,

02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:14.860
space doesn't obey
national boundaries.

02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:17.230
And then you also have things
like planetary protection

02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:20.560
which is this series of
policies which we'll get

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.560
into momentarily, where you
could bring something back

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.710
into the Earth environment that
would compromise us in some way.

02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:31.770
I wonder if we can
turn to thinking

02:26:31.770 --> 02:26:34.210
about policy and treaties.

02:26:34.210 --> 02:26:38.460
So, the Outer Space
Treaty which dates

02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:42.700
from 1967 is this governing
document of all of the things

02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:45.520
that one can and
can't do in space.

02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:48.760
I think my-- well,
prior to this year,

02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:53.040
myself and my fellow scientists
have a pretty warm fuzzy feeling

02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:54.340
towards the Outer Space Treaty

02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:57.700
that it's this very aspirational
document, and we'll dig

02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:59.000
into that in a moment.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.670
But first, I wanted
to look specifically

02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:01.970
at planetary protection.

02:27:01.970 --> 02:27:06.160
So, maybe I'll throw this
to Bobak, can you talk

02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.980
about planetary protection,
probably what it is

02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:12.470
and then how it's
implemented in missions?

02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:13.770
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: Yeah.

02:27:13.770 --> 02:27:15.070
So for those of you
who don't know, right,

02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:19.000
we do also have essentially
kind of our own Prime Directive

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.330
when it comes to exploring other
places which is as we go there,

02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:27.090
we are-- for-- largely for--
honestly, for selfish reasons,

02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:29.740
which is we are trying to
preserve the environment as is.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.850
So that if we ask additional
scientific questions

02:27:31.850 --> 02:27:33.180
about those environments,

02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:34.810
then we haven't compromised
the readings.

02:27:34.810 --> 02:27:36.110
So, what that boils doubting

02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:38.540
for our missions is
essentially places

02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.980
where we think there's a
credible chance of habitability

02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:44.990
like Mars, like the moons
of Jupiter and Saturn.

02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:48.920
We deliberately clean
our traveling spacecraft

02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:51.380
and make an assessment
of how dirty they are

02:27:51.380 --> 02:27:53.260
from a biological perspective.

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:56.220
And the probability that
they reach an environment

02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:58.890
where they could contaminate
that environment and say,

02:27:58.890 --> 02:28:02.250
you know, it has to be less in a
certain combined chance, right?

02:28:02.250 --> 02:28:05.140
So, I say, there is some
number of spores, you know,

02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:10.240
essentially of various microbial
life on my rover, the likelihood

02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:13.970
that it reaches a place that
has water or something else

02:28:13.970 --> 02:28:16.070
where they can survive, likely
they survive the whole trip

02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:18.740
from Earth to Mars, and then I
multiply that out and I figure,

02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:20.110
OK, it's less than
one in a billion,

02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:22.400
that's an acceptable risk.

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.200
But also of course, as Lucianne
mentioned, it comes back

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.030
to Earth which when we took
a sample and return, well,

02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:30.950
from preserving the
sample as a pure lunar

02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:32.250
or Martian environment.

02:28:32.250 --> 02:28:37.020
And as a preventative measure
for us somehow, you know,

02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:41.460
bringing back Andromeda strain
and like, you know, taking over.

02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:45.180
So, with that regard, it's,
you know, as an engineer,

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:48.160
it's one of my-- it's
like one of those rules

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.230
that we deal with, right?

02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:51.900
Like an essentially as an
engineer, I don't want to have

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:53.750
to worry about how
clean my parts are

02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:55.860
because it makes my
job a little harder.

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:58.800
But as, you know,
as the big picture,

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.780
we're able to understand,
OK, the context of this is

02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:03.360
if we are looking for a life
on Mars, the last thing we want

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.160
to find is life that we
brought with us and be unable

02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:07.460
to answer the question.

02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:10.340
And to me, the question is very
different difficult in part

02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.280
because we're not entirely sure

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:14.010
of whether life could've
originated at Mars

02:29:14.010 --> 02:29:16.860
or the places can [inaudible]
essentially life propagates with

02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:20.870
or without us like through
asteroids and other means,

02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:23.660
and whether life would look
the same in it's origin,

02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:25.490
so meaning that even if
it's independently derived,

02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:27.120
it doesn't have to be
DNA-based, it doesn't have

02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:29.890
to have other similar
trait star life.

02:29:29.890 --> 02:29:32.760
So, we use those rules in
order to protect those kind

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:35.530
of boundaries and be able
to ask scientific questions.

02:29:35.530 --> 02:29:38.950
But I think it's really selfish,
I don' think we are thinking

02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:41.580
of that, oh, from the good of
Mars perspective that we're in,

02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:45.290
you know, from the good of
the science perspective.

02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:47.730
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And,
you know, I think currently,

02:29:47.730 --> 02:29:52.040
the current administration
is very pro-relaxation

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:53.340
of regulation.

02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:55.860
And I know that there
are some people,

02:29:55.860 --> 02:29:59.030
at least within like the
scientific community as well

02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:02.450
as maybe new space companies and
enterprises who don't want have

02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:06.010
to pay for planetary
protection, who have suggested

02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:09.130
that one should relax
planetary protection.

02:30:09.130 --> 02:30:10.600
And you've written
about this, Nathalie.

02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:13.990
Can you speak to what you
think planetary protection

02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:18.000
requirements, how and
if they should evolve

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.300
as we move forward?

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:21.580
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol:
Yeah, well, you know,

02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:24.160
I like to flip questions on
their head just to make sure

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.580
that I'm looking at
different perspectives.

02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:29.580
And I think there is a
misperception right now

02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:31.250
about planetary protection.

02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:34.370
And I will go with
Bobak on this.

02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:36.770
It makes his life
very complicated

02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:38.310
but that's a good thing.

02:30:38.310 --> 02:30:43.010
We could discuss scientifically,
you know, would it be difficult

02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:47.130
to recognize terrestrial
life and Mars life?

02:30:47.130 --> 02:30:50.120
You look at coevolution and I
think it would be pretty easy

02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:54.300
to see who is coming from where,
because the evolution of Mars

02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:57.870
and the Earth very early-- even
very early was very different.

02:30:57.870 --> 02:31:02.260
But given that, we still want
to send the cleaner spacecraft.

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:04.530
On the other hand,
there is this perception

02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:07.270
of planetary protection
as, you know,

02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:09.030
the bad guy who's
preventing you from going

02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:14.600
to the really cool place
where you want to explore.

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:15.900
See? See this smirk.

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:19.070
Well, you know, that's
a misperception.

02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:23.270
In fact, what planetary
protection is doing--

02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:26.870
should be doing and should
continue doing is really

02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:30.680
to bring in front of you
the question, what they are,

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:33.460
what are the potential
issues, but just not

02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:36.220
to let you know that,
no, you cannot go there,

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:39.010
to put you to work and
say, how I am going

02:31:39.010 --> 02:31:40.490
to be able solve that question.

02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:43.690
In fact, this is a source of
progress for me as somebody

02:31:43.690 --> 02:31:45.860
who was thinking in terms
of exploration strategies.

02:31:45.860 --> 02:31:47.750
Now, I'm just thinking
in terms of what kind

02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:52.150
of technology can I develop to
complete a cleaner spacecraft,

02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:56.580
to do penetration
of the subsurface

02:31:56.580 --> 02:32:00.510
where life actually could
be that is completely clean

02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:03.330
or are there ways from
biological experiment

02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:06.180
that I'm going to able to
recognize that life is coming

02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.560
from Mars or the Earth.

02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:11.510
And we are running against
time here because as you said,

02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:16.230
you know, there was a time
where space exploration was NASA

02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:18.780
or ESA or the Russian agencies.

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:20.080
That's not the case anymore.

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:21.380
I don't know if you are aware

02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:24.640
of there is a Tesla
going to Mars right now.

02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:30.040
And there are no real policies
in place at this point in time

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:32.510
and also as for biologists,

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:37.600
I would like to discover whether
there is life on Mars like not

02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:43.640
if life on Mars before humans
go, because once we're there,

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:44.940
we will find life on Mars.

02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:46.540
I'm not being fastidious.

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.310
We're just a microbio factory.

02:32:48.310 --> 02:32:49.990
And we already know
that some microbes

02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:52.960
that we are carrying would
survive to some extent

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.170
in some places on Mars.

02:32:55.170 --> 02:32:58.690
So, for me, planetary
protection has

02:32:58.690 --> 02:33:02.930
to become an enabler
of exploration.

02:33:02.930 --> 02:33:05.650
And that's something that
prevents us from exploring.

02:33:05.650 --> 02:33:07.940
And I think that a lot of
good can come out of this

02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:10.570
because as usual, you're
pushing the envelope of thinking

02:33:10.570 --> 02:33:13.920
as exploration does and we
can come back to the question

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:17.230
of climate change where
technologies we are, you know,

02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:20.010
developing for planetary
exploration are actually helping

02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:24.480
us monitor faster and better
environmental change on Earth.

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:28.270
But-- So that would be my
viewpoint on these things.

02:33:28.270 --> 02:33:31.870
And right now, it still
fuzzy, a fuzzy discipline

02:33:31.870 --> 02:33:34.160
where we don't have
real policies.

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:37.010
And we're asking all the
questions and everybody is going

02:33:37.010 --> 02:33:40.380
out there to the "final
frontier of space"

02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:44.910
without real guide lines on
what is harmful, what is not.

02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:46.210
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:33:46.210 --> 02:33:50.130
And if we can go to talk about
that policy, you know, Margaret,

02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:53.990
given your scholarship with
a, you know, nation head

02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:58.250
and sovereignty throughout
history for indigenous people,

02:33:58.250 --> 02:34:02.760
I wonder if you could speak
to the outer space treaty as,

02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:05.250
you know, should
scientists be as sanguine

02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:11.450
about its aspirational nature
as they perhaps are sometimes?

02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:13.990
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huetttl: So, I
think one thing that the history

02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:16.990
of treaty-making in the
United States specifically,

02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:20.420
and I think you could expand
this to Canada, Australia,

02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:24.120
and other places where
European nations have colonized,

02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.020
I think it teaches
us to be cautious.

02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:30.900
We're in a building that has
hundreds of native treaties,

02:34:30.900 --> 02:34:32.260
treaties with native nations

02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:37.130
and the United States has
broken every single one.

02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:41.620
And it's especially bad when
resources are involved, right?

02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:44.720
I think the good example of this
is the Treaty of Fort Laramie

02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:48.770
from 1868, which was
a treaty primarily

02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:51.130
with the Lakota people.

02:34:51.130 --> 02:34:52.750
And it protected
the Black Hills.

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:55.400
Inside the Black Hills
are Lakota territory,

02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:58.870
the United States can't go here.

02:34:58.870 --> 02:35:01.860
And the United States'
responsibility is

02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:06.660
to make sure any US citizens
who go into Lakota territory,

02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:09.020
the military will
help remove them.

02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:12.270
But then, some of those white
citizens who weren't supposed

02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:16.180
to be in Lakota territory in
the first place found gold.

02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:20.990
And as has so often
happened in US history,

02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:22.980
it became a free-for-all, right?

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:24.280
The US military ended

02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:29.200
up actually supporting the
settler miners who were looking

02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.310
for resources, violating
the treaties,

02:35:31.310 --> 02:35:34.440
starting a really
terrible genocidal war,

02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:37.890
and completely violating
the terms of the Treaty

02:35:37.890 --> 02:35:42.480
of Fort Laramie, which they
continue to violate to this day.

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.490
The pipeline controversy is
also related to violations

02:35:47.490 --> 02:35:48.790
of the Treaty of Fort Laramie.

02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:51.370
So when there's resources
at stake,

02:35:51.370 --> 02:35:58.650
these kind of really grandiose
treaty terms often are not

02:35:58.650 --> 02:35:59.950
carried through.

02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:03.220
And part of the reason
for that is that baked

02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:08.400
into the United States' legal
system is a legal system

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:14.620
that privileges private
enterprise and both individuals'

02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:20.030
and incorporations' access
to resources and access--

02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:23.820
and the United States'
right to certain territory,

02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:26.460
going back to the
Doctrine of Discovery,

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:30.320
which said that it
started out as a papal bull

02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.540
in the 15th century and says

02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:37.260
that whatever Christian nation
discovers a territory has the

02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:39.470
rights to the territory
everything

02:36:39.470 --> 02:36:43.190
that is in that territory.

02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:47.150
And this concept is baked
into the US legal system

02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:50.850
and makes it really
easy to defend actions

02:36:50.850 --> 02:36:57.350
that would walk back, you know,
like the Outer Space Treaty.

02:36:57.350 --> 02:37:00.370
And I mean, we saw it under the
previous administration as well

02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:04.490
when they passed-- when
Congress passed a law that said

02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:07.170
that the products of, I
think it was asteroid mining

02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:12.930
and maybe more generally
that whoever is mining

02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:16.640
that has a right to profit
from those resources.

02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:20.830
And so, you know, there's
already been some undermining

02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:23.520
of the principles of
the Outer Space Treaty

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:25.870
within just the United
States, and that's not talking

02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:29.770
about other nations
around the world as well.

02:37:29.770 --> 02:37:31.310
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: I
think one of the things

02:37:31.310 --> 02:37:35.490
that always strikes me is
that a lot of, you know,

02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:40.430
the move to extract resources,
so for example the Space Act

02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:44.490
from 2015 that you've just
referenced really clears the

02:37:44.490 --> 02:37:48.180
path for, sure, you can't
own a celestial body

02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:50.840
which is what the Outer Space
Treaty says, but you can,

02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:52.310
you know, own its resources.

02:37:52.310 --> 02:37:55.500
And particularly, I
was struck by the fact

02:37:55.500 --> 02:38:00.430
that water was explicitly
included in the Space Act.

02:38:00.430 --> 02:38:04.340
But at the same time,
a lot of the companies

02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:07.290
that are expressly
interested in doing

02:38:07.290 --> 02:38:10.220
that will also use this
rhetoric about how going

02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:11.740
to space will change us.

02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:16.280
And I wonder, Dana, maybe
you can speak to this.

02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.700
You know, I think there's
certainly the possibility

02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:22.410
for space to be something
that challenges us

02:38:22.410 --> 02:38:26.500
and perhaps makes us grow
but what do you think

02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:28.250
of that assertion, you know,

02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:34.420
in light of things
humans do and don't do.

02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:38.330
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: Well,
I guess it depends

02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:41.820
on how people define
being better.

02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:47.340
So, what protections
make me think of is

02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:52.100
that there is a certain
type of valuation being put

02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:53.430
on whatever you're
trying to protect

02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:55.650
and that there are certain
people who are privileged

02:38:55.650 --> 02:38:57.930
to ensure that protection
and are pretty good.

02:38:57.930 --> 02:39:01.970
And particularly in terms of
like resource extraction, right,

02:39:01.970 --> 02:39:04.630
we have to ask the question
of who would be benefiting

02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:07.060
and how those benefits
would be redistributed

02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:08.690
if they are redistributed.

02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:13.250
And it seems as if, and this
is something the first panel

02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:18.010
touched on as well, like if
space is to become a place

02:39:18.010 --> 02:39:21.680
or a space where we can
experiment with different types

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:27.460
of socialities where we can
finally hopefully acknowledge

02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:30.860
personhood in a different way
or just being in different ways,

02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:35.730
then it's going to also have
to ask questions of like, well,

02:39:35.730 --> 02:39:39.790
how do we value people?

02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:42.640
When people become
objects, then what kind

02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.250
of different manners
do we have in relating

02:39:45.250 --> 02:39:47.100
to them and using them?

02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:49.410
Who has all these different
powers and privileges

02:39:49.410 --> 02:39:51.690
that can decide those things?

02:39:51.690 --> 02:39:53.590
So, will space make us better?

02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:56.760
Hopefully, it will make us
actually ask these questions

02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:02.610
and maybe even put into
dialogue with public forums.

02:40:02.610 --> 02:40:05.270
And that's something
that I feel as if I need

02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:09.430
to do more exploration of, which
is like how often do we engage

02:40:09.430 --> 02:40:13.360
in public events like
this on these topics?

02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:16.490
Often, they're held in
either scientific conferences

02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:17.790
or academic conferences

02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:19.600
or at least those
spaces that I've been in.

02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:22.130
So how can we expand
these conversations

02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:24.800
so that it's not just
us talking to each other

02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:29.050
but actually talking about
what we imagine to be--

02:40:29.050 --> 02:40:32.020
space to be, and
how it could help us

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:36.210
to grow beyond just catalyst

02:40:36.210 --> 02:40:40.010
or extractivist dialogues
and discourses?

02:40:40.010 --> 02:40:41.310
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:40:41.310 --> 02:40:43.600
I guess I'd be curious to
hear from the whole panel

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:46.010
or whoever wants to take it.

02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:49.590
What do you think of the
rhetoric coming out of new space

02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:52.240
or some of the plans
that are thrown out there

02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:55.400
that are sometimes I think
out of the realm of fiction?

02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.310
But what do you think the effect
is of those ideas to things

02:40:59.310 --> 02:41:02.010
like the Tesla in space that
you mentioned, Nathalie,

02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:06.420
terraforming some
of these plans/ideas

02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:10.130
for these off-world
environments?

02:41:10.130 --> 02:41:12.380
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol: Well, you
know, I think at this point

02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:15.610
in time we're confronted
with two things.

02:41:15.610 --> 02:41:21.760
There is the, I do this thing
because I can, you know.

02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:23.750
And there is a little
bit of that

02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:25.440
and what's-- and this is great.

02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:29.190
Don't get me wrong, I
really do appreciate

02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:32.750
and I think this is a
great opportunity for us

02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:36.160
to have other people than
just elite and government.

02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:39.370
We're capable now of putting,
you know, assets in space

02:41:39.370 --> 02:41:43.650
and help the development
of technologies

02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:46.340
and maybe moving humans
around, et cetera.

02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.000
On the other hand, there is
also a little bit of catching

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.010
up into, you know, what
it entails really to,

02:41:54.010 --> 02:41:56.170
and sorry to utilize
that word, colonize,

02:41:56.170 --> 02:42:00.720
but right now we are going
with that, to settle Mars

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:03.650
and really what happens
when you are there.

02:42:03.650 --> 02:42:07.910
There is a little bit a
romantic vision of exploration

02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:11.630
where we are going to land on
Mars and, you know, we are going

02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:15.500
to send 100,000 people and they
will stay there and from there,

02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:18.160
we are going to become an
interplanetary species.

02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:22.340
Ultimately, this is going
to happen but it's not going

02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:25.510
to be easy, it's not--
it's going to be messy,

02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:28.920
and it is going to
humble us very much.

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:31.080
And I think that there is
an understanding that going

02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:34.140
to Mars is not easy, it's hard.

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:37.140
It's hard even to
land robots on Mars.

02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:42.730
It's hard to keep people alive
during the flight to Mars.

02:42:42.730 --> 02:42:45.290
The first thing that's going to
happen when they land on Mars,

02:42:45.290 --> 02:42:47.860
they are going to be
weakened by the travel.

02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:49.160
They won't be able to get

02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:51.750
out of the habitat
for at least a month.

02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:54.060
I think that the old studies
were showing something

02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:55.360
like that.

02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:58.800
But when you're an astronaut,
you have plenty of, you know,

02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:04.250
to keep you busy in your
spacecraft before you go out.

02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:07.050
But once you go out and
that's the main difference

02:43:07.050 --> 02:43:10.660
between the romantic
vision that is inherited

02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:14.730
from the exploration on Earth
and the reality of going

02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:18.320
to Mars is not even
being on the moon.

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:20.920
When you are on the moon,
you look up at the sky

02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:23.450
and you see your planet is
right there, you communicate

02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:25.400
in three seconds, all right?

02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:28.810
And if something goes wrong,
well, you're back pretty fast.

02:43:28.810 --> 02:43:30.390
Once you are on Mars
and especially

02:43:30.390 --> 02:43:32.490
when somebody is going to
tell you, you are going there

02:43:32.490 --> 02:43:35.620
and you are staying there,
there is no ticket back.

02:43:35.620 --> 02:43:37.100
Then what happens?

02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:39.040
You're in this confined
environment.

02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.550
When you're on Earth
wherever you are,

02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:45.130
even in the most
lost place on earth,

02:43:45.130 --> 02:43:48.140
if you want to take a walk
because you are mad at the rest

02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:51.010
of the crew, you take
a walk, all right,

02:43:51.010 --> 02:43:52.350
you go out and you walk.

02:43:52.350 --> 02:43:55.750
And so on Mars, there is
a limited amount of time

02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:58.310
that you can spend
out per day just

02:43:58.310 --> 02:44:00.490
because of the radiation
environment.

02:44:00.490 --> 02:44:04.360
The people you are with, you
better go along with them

02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:07.410
because you are going to be with
them for a very, very long time.

02:44:07.410 --> 02:44:10.190
And you know, so the idea
of going back to Mars,

02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:13.890
colonizing Mars, I
think needs to be--

02:44:13.890 --> 02:44:18.610
excuse me, refrained
into what we know

02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:20.370
of Mars, the reality of Mars.

02:44:20.370 --> 02:44:24.210
I think there is a little
bit of romanticism right now

02:44:24.210 --> 02:44:30.610
that is infused into the vision
of some corporate companies.

02:44:30.610 --> 02:44:33.950
But at the same time, the
dream is the driver, you know,

02:44:33.950 --> 02:44:35.370
we first dream of things.

02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:38.550
It's just like a kid who
wants to be a firefighter,

02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:41.800
why they want to do that,
because there is a red truck,

02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:43.740
you know, and they are heroes,

02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:45.300
or in explorers, a
little bit of that.

02:44:45.300 --> 02:44:47.860
There is no red truck but if
you survive, if you made it,

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:50.050
you come back, you've
discovered something new.

02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:53.540
And then as the kid grows
up, they need that--

02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:56.400
you know, they learn that
they need to have skills

02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:57.700
and they need to, you know,

02:44:57.700 --> 02:44:59.460
being a firefighter is
not only the red track.

02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:01.820
And this is going to
be the same thing here

02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:05.640
with the romantic vision of
exploration of a planet that is

02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:09.030
so far away that you cannot
just take the next cab

02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:10.330
and come back home.

02:45:10.330 --> 02:45:13.050
So, for me, this is what
I-- you know, right now,

02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:14.380
this is a little
bit of the danger

02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:17.390
because of the romantic
approach to exploration.

02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:18.740
There are steps that are taken

02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:21.840
that might not be too
wise or too smart.

02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.340
But if we work together, I
think there is a great deal

02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:27.880
of good things that can
come up with the merging

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:32.830
of the experience that NASA
or ESA or other agencies have

02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:38.360
with the-- we can do type of
approach of corporate companies.

02:45:39.490 --> 02:45:41.940
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: I mean, I--
obviously I love new space.

02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:44.370
It enables us to do a ton of
things that we weren't able

02:45:44.370 --> 02:45:47.770
to do, you know, 10 years
ago, which is great.

02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:50.900
I think the big concern and
sort of what you're getting on,

02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:52.760
right, which is the narrative
and sort of being seen

02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:56.290
as a very romantic, all these
habitats and these, you know,

02:45:56.290 --> 02:46:00.900
various-- when we walked by the
botany building on the way here

02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:04.190
and I kind of imagined like that
could be like a Mars settlement,

02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:05.930
right, with the glass
and I'm look out

02:46:05.930 --> 02:46:10.070
and I got plants growing
inside, making air for me.

02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:12.520
But I do think it's some sort
of-- yeah, and to be fair,

02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:15.300
right, I mean my own institution
is sometimes guilty of this,

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:19.100
the romanticized vision of,
you know, astronauts walking

02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:21.610
on the surface of Mars
for the first time.

02:46:21.610 --> 02:46:23.840
The challenge is real.

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.240
I think that the big concern
with that narrative is always

02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:28.260
that if you don't want--
if you don't need it,

02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:31.430
you get discouraged which
then sets back the legitimate,

02:46:31.430 --> 02:46:33.270
all the stuff that
we're trying to do,

02:46:33.270 --> 02:46:36.810
but also the setting
of that precedent.

02:46:36.810 --> 02:46:38.620
And it was kind of, you
know, I mentioned earlier

02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:40.890
where like people talk about
the time for doing things

02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:43.730
and of course I think if so many
people including myself, right,

02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:46.790
the time is always now because
I'm only going to be alive for,

02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:49.060
you know, any years
more and I want

02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:51.590
to discover life somewhere
else in my lifetime.

02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:53.520
I want to see people
do certain things.

02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:55.460
I want to accomplish
certain things.

02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:58.560
And so it's always this-- And
part of that is because I grew

02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:01.400
up on a vision of, oh,
these are achievable things

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:04.710
in my lifetime, so therefore
I want to achieve them.

02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:07.050
And I think that's part of
the issue with the narrative

02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:11.970
of this, you know, let's expand
to Mars kind of thing which is--

02:47:11.970 --> 02:47:15.260
again, if we sell everybody
on a very romantic narrative

02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:20.800
and we either don't deliver
or even if we do, it just sort

02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.330
of sets us up to have to do
these things and not necessarily

02:47:24.330 --> 02:47:28.000
in the-- and I don't want to
say it like in a calculating way

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.150
but in a sort of
methodical systematic way

02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:32.620
where we really appreciate
what we're doing.

02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:35.380
And, you know, someone
like myself,

02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:37.640
the dream is very
much alive with space.

02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:38.940
I love the challenge of it.

02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:40.240
So honestly, at the end
of the day, if I don't get

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:42.830
to do all these things, I'm
going to be happy because it's--

02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:45.120
the fun is in trying to do it.

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:47.540
And some-- you know, most of the
time, when we try to succeed--

02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:48.840
I mean, we are trying
to succeed,

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.150
most of the time, we succeed.

02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:53.720
But if there wasn't a little
bit of a gamble or a risk to it,

02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.810
it would certainly be
a lot less exciting.

02:47:55.810 --> 02:47:58.510
But I think, right, it's one of
the we're really need to find,

02:47:58.510 --> 02:48:04.330
is what is the balance of
storytelling that we strike

02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:07.280
between encouraging
people to sort of wants

02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:11.040
to tackle these seemingly
insurmountable challenges and,

02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:13.060
you know, dream big and
do certain, you know,

02:48:13.060 --> 02:48:16.630
things and how do we do that
in a way that's constructive

02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:17.930
for society, right?

02:48:17.930 --> 02:48:20.150
Is it focusing in
on different areas?

02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:22.200
Is it telling a story
that is more

02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:25.110
about the journey than the end?

02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:27.100
You know, I don't have
an answer for that,

02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:29.710
but I think that's kind of one
other things that are, you know,

02:48:29.710 --> 02:48:32.080
as you were talking,
it sort of reminded me.

02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:34.730
And again, I'm very optimistic

02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:36.520
about the work that's
being done.

02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:38.160
I think that's incredible stuff.

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:43.830
But I am concerned about
the subdivision of it all,

02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:46.550
or sort of the salesmanship
of it all.

02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:49.710
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Nathalie,
do you have something--

02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:51.010
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol: Yeah,
just to add something.

02:48:51.010 --> 02:48:54.160
I think that with
becoming interplanetary,

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.200
there is something that, you
know, that was not present for--

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.540
in the exploration of our
own planet, and which is

02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:03.730
that now you are
adding a new world.

02:49:03.730 --> 02:49:06.110
And it's not a new planet Earth.

02:49:06.110 --> 02:49:07.960
We're not starting with that.

02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.260
We're starting with a world

02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:11.500
that is very hostile
in the first place.

02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:14.680
And I think this is-- when
you think about implications,

02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:15.990
you have to think at two levels.

02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:19.550
So the first implication
is, OK, how is this going

02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:23.550
to serve society as a whole, you
know, here and somewhere else?

02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:26.330
But there is also, you
know, what's happening

02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:29.620
on this humankind on Mars?

02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:31.580
What are they becoming,

02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:33.340
especially if they
are not coming back?

02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:35.900
So we have to-- You
know, maybe this is

02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.190
where the big difference
is between exploration here

02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:41.210
on Earth and what has happened
with the exploration of Mars,

02:49:41.210 --> 02:49:45.070
is that when you are on Mars,
you are completely on your own,

02:49:45.070 --> 02:49:46.400
which you were somewhere,
you know,

02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:49.040
on Earth as well
and in some places.

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:51.790
But here, you are
in an environment

02:49:51.790 --> 02:49:54.650
that you were not
the master of it.

02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:58.550
The environment is going to
dominate you for very long time.

02:49:58.550 --> 02:50:00.520
And you have to count
on each other.

02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:02.830
You have to use each
other smart.

02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:04.660
It's the big equalizer, yeah,

02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:07.550
the environment will
completely dominate you

02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:09.070
for hundreds of times.

02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:11.640
And by the way, those
beautiful spheres that you see,

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:14.610
you know as much as I
do how many, you know,

02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:16.300
asteroids are falling
at the surface

02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:18.000
of Mars every single year.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.430
So we better be under the
surface for quite some time.

02:50:21.430 --> 02:50:25.040
But what I'm saying
is that unlike Earth,

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:28.750
you just cannot take a walk
and find the next spring,

02:50:28.750 --> 02:50:32.220
the next cascade and, you
know, leave off and ride away.

02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:34.330
You're going to have
to count on each other.

02:50:34.330 --> 02:50:38.280
You have to-- So this is where
maybe differences between people

02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:40.030
and race and gender,
et cetera is going

02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:43.660
to be maybe a little less
important, because well,

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:46.260
you are one against
the environment.

02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:47.560
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
I think I'm--

02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:50.050
I actually wanted to spend
the last couple of moments

02:50:50.050 --> 02:50:54.770
of our panel here talking about
Mars as a physical environment

02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:59.780
because I think, you know, often
we think of ourselves as masters

02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:02.400
of our environment,
which we objectively

02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.930
on this planet are clearly not.

02:51:04.930 --> 02:51:08.780
And also, you know, the
relationship of the environment

02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:10.750
as being something
we can or should try

02:51:10.750 --> 02:51:15.240
to control I think is not
shared by every culture.

02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:17.240
You know, one of the
things that came up,

02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:20.660
and since I haven't specifically
mention it in this panel,

02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:23.890
all of us where co-creators of
the things that we're talking

02:51:23.890 --> 02:51:25.930
about here, so we did
these pre-event calls.

02:51:25.930 --> 02:51:28.180
And one of the things
you brought up, Margaret,

02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:31.720
was environmental personhood
and some of the ways

02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:35.950
in which indigenous cultures
have thought of environments

02:51:35.950 --> 02:51:39.220
but also engaged with the
level system and with policy,

02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:42.340
so maybe if you could
speak to that.

02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:43.640
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl: Yeah.

02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:48.100
So, I was thinking of an
example from New Zealand

02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:51.380
where the indigenous
people there were able

02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:53.420
to get legal personhood
protections

02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:57.600
for a particular river,
so that any violations

02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:03.410
of the river are the same as
violations of like a human body,

02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:06.090
and the treat-- you know,
they have legal recourse

02:52:06.090 --> 02:52:11.550
to environmental damage done
to this like physical entity

02:52:11.550 --> 02:52:16.060
that represents their
relationship with this place.

02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:20.360
So that's one way that
indigenous people have,

02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:24.550
you know, used the legal
system both to their advantage

02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:27.020
and to the advantage of
the environment, right?

02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:30.800
I know India has also given
personhood status to at least

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:34.150
to two of its rivers in
order to fight pollution.

02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:37.200
And so, you know, for me,
the question is there's a--

02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:43.350
if there isn't-- like there's
not necessarily other people,

02:52:43.350 --> 02:52:45.550
right, out on Mars?

02:52:45.550 --> 02:52:49.350
But does Mars, right, as
an entity have a same right

02:52:49.350 --> 02:52:52.350
to some sort of status,
you know,

02:52:52.350 --> 02:52:55.190
equivalent to the
personhood status

02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:58.880
that this river in
New Zealand has?

02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:00.180
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:04.700
And this also came up in our
call in the sense of I think one

02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:07.700
of the ways I hear people
sometimes split the difference,

02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:11.580
right, is well, you know,
we'll be able to do whatever

02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:14.950
or industry can do whatever to
an environment after we're sure

02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:17.540
that life is not there.

02:53:17.540 --> 02:53:24.980
And I don't know when that could
possibly ever actually happen.

02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:28.540
Yeah. So, what are-- And I'll
throw this out to the panel

02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:31.990
as a whole just as a parting
thought, what are your thoughts

02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:36.130
about how we should conceive
of Mars as an environment

02:53:36.130 --> 02:53:39.620
or even why we study
other planets?

02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:43.980
And maybe I'll give
that to you first, Dana.

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:47.900
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: So, a couple
of kind of branching thoughts

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:51.720
with this is that Mars
as an environment is

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:54.340
as much an environment
here on Earth.

02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:57.650
And in preparing to go
to Mars, there are lots

02:53:57.650 --> 02:54:02.470
of different strategies and
protocols and programs being put

02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:05.410
into effect that are
changing the landscape.

02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:09.590
So, just thinking of new
space, right, they're trying

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:13.970
to create different types of
rockets, so reusable rockets

02:54:13.970 --> 02:54:16.940
which could technically
land in different places

02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:20.460
and don't necessarily have to
be launched from certain places,

02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:24.450
I don't know, the science stuff,
I could move to these guys.

02:54:24.450 --> 02:54:26.230
But just taking into
consideration

02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:28.430
like what places are we
then changing in order

02:54:28.430 --> 02:54:31.990
to fulfill these goals
of space exploration?

02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:33.740
So, if we're thinking
about Mars and we need

02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:37.690
to understand constables of life
or, you know, is it organic,

02:54:37.690 --> 02:54:42.650
is it carbon-base, again the
science, we also have to think

02:54:42.650 --> 02:54:45.320
about what kind of tests are
we performing on entities

02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:48.000
and bodies here in
order to understand

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.880
that type of environment.

02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:51.930
So, I think these
larger questions

02:54:51.930 --> 02:54:54.740
of like the Mars environment
are as much a reflection

02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:57.780
of how we've treated the
environment here on Earth.

02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:00.760
And I think that would-- as
a parting thought would be

02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:06.350
to really take a good reflection
of how our search for knowledge

02:55:06.350 --> 02:55:11.950
and our understandings of life
are impacting how we work with

02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:14.900
and see life here and
I wonder if we could--

02:55:14.900 --> 02:55:17.950
you know, maybe that would be a
point of doing something better,

02:55:17.950 --> 02:55:23.700
is incorporating a more
perspective that is respectful

02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:28.230
and incorporates-- or is
collaborative with difference

02:55:28.230 --> 02:55:31.970
and understands difference
better.

02:55:31.970 --> 02:55:40.720
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol: I'm going to
take a slightly different take

02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:43.070
at this obviously and I
don't have your expertise

02:55:43.070 --> 02:55:47.610
and I'm dealing with the aspects
of, well, yeah, carbon-based

02:55:47.610 --> 02:55:49.640
and environment and
things like that.

02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:52.290
So I think that we are
doing our homework,

02:55:52.290 --> 02:55:54.660
astrobiology is doing its
homework right now in trying

02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:56.820
to figure out what kind of
environment and what kind

02:55:56.820 --> 02:55:58.860
of coevolusion Mars
could have been.

02:55:58.860 --> 02:56:01.200
Because if you're looking
for a life on a planet,

02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:03.150
you have to think about
coevolusion, you have to think

02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:04.810
of Mars as a biosphere.

02:56:04.810 --> 02:56:07.810
And that goes back a
little bit to the personhood

02:56:07.810 --> 02:56:12.050
that you are mentioning that
is not exactly the same thing.

02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:15.160
I know exact-- I think I
understand very well what's

02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:17.900
happening here where you're
giving, you know, legal rights

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:20.430
to a planet, to a
river, et cetera.

02:56:20.430 --> 02:56:23.910
But in terms of environment
where you are recognizing

02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:28.170
that we are part of a
biosphere, we are not outside

02:56:28.170 --> 02:56:30.630
of a biosphere, we
are part of a system,

02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:32.570
and then if you are
hurting that system,

02:56:32.570 --> 02:56:34.560
you are hurting the
entire biosphere.

02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:37.510
Then there is a little bit of
that too, there is a respect

02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:38.810
of the system you are part of.

02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:41.170
I think that what we
are doing is trying

02:56:41.170 --> 02:56:42.870
to put ourselves
outside of that.

02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:45.370
We're seeing this with the
environmental change right now.

02:56:45.370 --> 02:56:50.150
But to go back to your question,
as in astrobiology going

02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:52.500
to extreme environments
and looking

02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:55.210
at what we think could be
the most evolved type of life

02:56:55.210 --> 02:56:57.980
that could be on Mars right now,
which basically are microbes

02:56:57.980 --> 02:56:59.880
because there's not
enough energy

02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.350
to just sustain complex
life on Mars,

02:57:04.350 --> 02:57:09.390
I'm looking at what these
microbes are in an environment

02:57:09.390 --> 02:57:14.230
that is very relevant to what
Mars was 3.5 billion years ago.

02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:16.970
And they are telling me
something very profound

02:57:16.970 --> 02:57:22.100
about humans, and which is that
in those places where we go,

02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:25.760
the earliest organism we see
are blue and green algae.

02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:31.430
And you see them and they
can't thrive in radiation,

02:57:31.430 --> 02:57:34.540
in places where radiation
is extremely strong,

02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.900
in places that are a little
bit cold where there is a lot

02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:39.790
of aridity, et cetera,
et cetera.

02:57:39.790 --> 02:57:42.780
Fundamentally, they are the same

02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:44.410
but they become a
little different.

02:57:44.410 --> 02:57:45.950
They are developing
different pigment.

02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:49.910
They are developing different
capabilities to adapt

02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:51.880
because of the place
they are at.

02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:54.270
And so this is telling
me about, you know,

02:57:54.270 --> 02:57:56.930
something about our humanity,

02:57:56.930 --> 02:57:59.370
our new evolution,
we are adaptable.

02:57:59.370 --> 02:58:03.260
We are the product of our
environment of our history.

02:58:03.260 --> 02:58:08.300
Going back to Mars, I am
wondering if by going to a place

02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:10.980
that is environmentally
completely different is going

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.530
to help us finally figure
out what it means to be human

02:58:14.530 --> 02:58:17.650
when you are removed from
your planet of origin.

02:58:17.650 --> 02:58:20.520
And when you are getting, you
know, confronted to something

02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:24.260
that is completely different,
you finally all of a sudden,

02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:28.970
you know, what is-- what it
means to be human is going to,

02:58:28.970 --> 02:58:32.220
you know, get to the surface but
being on another planet then all

02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:37.120
of a sudden you will lose your
humanity what was making you

02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:38.420
human in the first place.

02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:42.920
So it's an interesting paradox
that exploration of environment

02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:45.050
and the Martian environment
could bring

02:58:45.050 --> 02:58:47.330
to humans finally
discover of who they are.

02:58:47.330 --> 02:58:50.160
What it means to be us.

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:54.590
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: So to--
one of your points, right,

02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:58.800
in terms of that the
developments, right, I do know,

02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:00.890
right, for example
that Mars sample return

02:59:00.890 --> 02:59:05.110
which is a robotic mission
is effectively, right,

02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:07.340
being very high priority-- its
always been a high priority

02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:08.640
from a scientific perspective

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:13.200
but is being pushed forward very
quickly because of the potential

02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:16.470
for humans to go to Mars
and contaminate environment.

02:59:16.470 --> 02:59:19.660
That is not obviously,
you know, the dozen,

02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:24.000
two dozens samples I will get
back is certainly not what you

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.560
would ideally want but I know

02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:28.020
that there is some
pressure to do that.

02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:31.350
Because we're afraid that the
environment is contaminated then

02:59:31.350 --> 02:59:35.160
once that happens then
there's no going back.

02:59:35.160 --> 02:59:39.330
I think for me the exploration
that kind of keys for it

02:59:39.330 --> 02:59:43.150
as far as-- and I work really
in robotic exploration,

02:59:43.150 --> 02:59:46.580
is I think of it
mostly as a kind of way

02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:49.780
of reflecting upon ourselves,
you know, there is sort

02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:53.020
of an inherent curiosity
to me, of course,

02:59:53.020 --> 02:59:56.290
about whether we're
alone in the universe.

02:59:56.290 --> 02:59:58.810
Statistically speaking I would
say it seems very unlikely

02:59:58.810 --> 03:00:01.850
but there was sort of sense of
looking at these other places

03:00:01.850 --> 03:00:05.150
as reflections upon like how did
we-- what is our origin story?

03:00:05.150 --> 03:00:06.450
How did we arrive here?

03:00:06.450 --> 03:00:08.490
How does a place
like Earth form?

03:00:08.490 --> 03:00:11.910
What is the context for
life showing up like ours?

03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:16.070
Mars is in so many ways
are very obvious reflection

03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:18.540
and from the fact that
when we see pictures of it,

03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:19.840
we can imagine ourselves there.

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:22.140
We can-- there is a gravity
that's similar to ours,

03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:24.360
there was, you know, a warmer
weather environment in the past.

03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:26.010
There's still a lot of things.

03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:28.750
As inhospitable as Mars is
there are far more, you know,

03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:31.150
inhospitable places
in our solar system.

03:00:31.150 --> 03:00:34.530
So there is a fair amount of
ability to sort of reflect

03:00:34.530 --> 03:00:36.730
on our own planet like
kind of hope that some

03:00:36.730 --> 03:00:39.440
of these are opportunities
to do that I think.

03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:41.440
Yeah, there are most
powerful images of course

03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:44.480
of space [inaudible] are
often the once that show earth

03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:45.780
in the context of the places

03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:47.920
that we're visiting whether
the Earth on the horizon,

03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:52.440
Mars or the [inaudible]
picture from the voyagers.

03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:56.240
So I do sort of see them as
a way of looking at ourselves

03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:57.790
and being introspective.

03:00:57.790 --> 03:01:00.790
And I hope that many of
the people who continue

03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:04.630
to do this will also see that
as a motivating factor for this.

03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:09.800
It's not necessarily to
accomplish something there

03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:13.980
as much as to sort of a kind of
accomplish something here about,

03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:15.320
you know, an understanding
or some

03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:17.560
of us have a deeper
understanding of ourselves.

03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:20.620
And I think if someone will
speaks to the commonality

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.240
of experience, what
I mean it's very hard

03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:25.900
to imagine we're very different
when you see earth as, you know,

03:01:25.900 --> 03:01:29.250
a pixel on a, you
know, an image.

03:01:29.250 --> 03:01:31.310
It makes you feel a lot--
I think a lot more--

03:01:31.310 --> 03:01:33.680
a lot more alone but
also lot more connected,

03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:36.710
so I hope that that's
kind of the version

03:01:36.710 --> 03:01:39.010
of exploration that
we take forward.

03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:42.440
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl:
I'm not really sure how

03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:46.320
to answer this question,
but I think Nathalie

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:49.960
when you're talking about, you
know, that seeing everything

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:53.740
as a system, that is very
similar to, you know,

03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:58.740
my own understanding of things
from a slightly more, you know,

03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:00.920
not claiming this is a universal
[inaudible] perspective

03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:02.820
but you know, that's
how I was taught

03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:07.910
to understand my relationship
not just with things on earth

03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:10.110
but with, you know,
the sun the moon,

03:02:10.110 --> 03:02:15.380
and the larger system
as well and things.

03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:18.410
You know, it's important to
maintain some sort of balance.

03:02:18.410 --> 03:02:24.170
And so I would think that,
you know, it would be--

03:02:24.170 --> 03:02:26.920
I mean and I guess
my ideal situation,

03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:28.500
Mars would be viewed not just--

03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:34.740
again as this blank slate
resource for us to learn about,

03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:37.070
you know, ourselves which I
think is an important part

03:02:37.070 --> 03:02:41.760
of it, but also as an entity
in a self that deserves respect

03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:45.240
and we can learn about as well.

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:46.540
If that makes sense.

03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:47.840
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
All right.

03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:49.140
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol: That
makes a lot of sense

03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:50.440
because when you look--

03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:51.740
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Sorry we're--

03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:53.040
I know we have a lot of
wonderful comments to make

03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:55.440
but we have time for questions
and answers now and I don't want

03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:58.310
to cut into that so, let's
everybody thank our panelists.

03:02:58.310 --> 03:02:59.610
[ Applause ]

03:02:59.610 --> 03:03:07.260
And as in the morning
we have mic runners,

03:03:07.260 --> 03:03:09.730
so if you have a question,
please just raise your hand

03:03:09.730 --> 03:03:19.270
and someone will
bring a mic to you.

03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:21.870
&gt;&gt; So, first of all, great
responses and answers.

03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:28.790
So, it seems like there's a kind
of like a talker or center point

03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:34.680
around us being connected
as, you know, one.

03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:38.880
How do you navigate-- this can
be for anybody on the panel.

03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:42.910
How do you navigate a
political landscape or kind

03:03:42.910 --> 03:03:46.990
of media landscape now that is
kind of not in that interest?

03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:50.920
It's a bit more divided
and kind of pitting people

03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.340
against each other, so
maybe even through your work

03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:56.930
or into your personal, you
know, lives how do you kind

03:03:56.930 --> 03:04:00.890
of navigate that component
so that people can resonate

03:04:00.890 --> 03:04:03.700
with the fact that we
have more of a connection

03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:10.690
on a fundamental base?

03:04:10.690 --> 03:04:13.100
&gt;&gt; Bobak Ferdowsi: So, I think
for me personally, right,

03:04:13.100 --> 03:04:17.510
it definitely do try of
connect at an individual level

03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:21.410
with what resonates with me
and hopefully share that kind

03:04:21.410 --> 03:04:23.220
of excitement passion.

03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:26.210
In terms of a more broad
perspective, I think,

03:04:26.210 --> 03:04:29.330
it has been an effort
on my part.

03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:33.910
It become easier over time of
trying to use more inclusive,

03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:36.120
you know, terminology
in terms of, you know,

03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:37.720
of course NASA is-- right,
we made the transition

03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:40.020
from man's space to human
space volume, things like that

03:04:40.020 --> 03:04:44.390
but just trying to sort of
bring that perspective into it.

03:04:44.390 --> 03:04:47.370
And ultimately, you know,
I don't necessarily expect

03:04:47.370 --> 03:04:48.670
that any of these
things is going

03:04:48.670 --> 03:04:50.850
to connect with 100% of people.

03:04:50.850 --> 03:04:53.830
But in the interest of sort
of including as many people

03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:58.070
as possible is trying to convey
what are the benefits to people

03:04:58.070 --> 03:05:01.750
and I think while, you know,
NASA does an incredible amount

03:05:01.750 --> 03:05:04.650
for our science, we
are not necessary--

03:05:04.650 --> 03:05:05.950
that's not the set of division

03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:08.390
that we always tell
to the public.

03:05:08.390 --> 03:05:11.290
Whereas, working with
Indian now, right,

03:05:11.290 --> 03:05:14.460
the thing when they talk
about their space program,

03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:17.230
they are literally
talking in, OK,

03:05:17.230 --> 03:05:21.750
we are able to grow more crops,
we're able to better predict,

03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:26.560
you know, meteorological
events, evacuate areas

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:28.520
so that even though the
storms are getting worse,

03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:31.450
we're actually seeing fewer
casualties in places like that.

03:05:31.450 --> 03:05:33.960
And that is a direct
tangible thing that, right,

03:05:33.960 --> 03:05:36.300
that benefits, you
know, people directly.

03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:38.110
And I think that's--
to try to talk

03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:43.460
about to those point is sort
of where I think that's, again,

03:05:43.460 --> 03:05:45.070
it's a newer thing
for me when I'm--

03:05:45.070 --> 03:05:47.970
it's kind of the direction
that I feel like I'm going.

03:05:47.970 --> 03:05:51.570
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabrol: I will
add to what Bobak is saying.

03:05:51.570 --> 03:05:54.430
This is something that I
presented a few years ago.

03:05:54.430 --> 03:05:58.150
When I'm making public
presentation, I always talk

03:05:58.150 --> 03:06:01.510
about from the Earth
to Mars and back.

03:06:01.510 --> 03:06:03.890
And it can be Mars or it
can be something else.

03:06:03.890 --> 03:06:09.570
It a planetary exploration
of world is that--

03:06:09.570 --> 03:06:14.490
and I'm going to take the
example of environmental change.

03:06:14.490 --> 03:06:19.180
In that case, you can
see the climate change

03:06:19.180 --> 03:06:22.480
on Earth a little bit
like a planetary mission

03:06:22.480 --> 03:06:26.730
where you have very finite
resources, very limited amount

03:06:26.730 --> 03:06:28.450
of time to understand
what you have.

03:06:28.450 --> 03:06:30.220
You have a scientific goal.

03:06:30.220 --> 03:06:32.810
You have very little
bandwidth to communicate

03:06:32.810 --> 03:06:36.470
and very little time together as
much as that as we can to figure

03:06:36.470 --> 03:06:38.810
out the question or the
answer to your question

03:06:38.810 --> 03:06:40.670
or articulate your
question better.

03:06:40.670 --> 03:06:44.630
And this is exactly what we
have with climate change.

03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:46.190
We have something
that's upon us.

03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:48.500
I'm-- I cannot even say
now that it's coming at us

03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:49.800
like a freight train,
it's there.

03:06:49.800 --> 03:06:51.750
It's all over the place.

03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:53.280
And we have very,
very little time

03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:55.070
to understand what's going on.

03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:58.360
And what people don't realize
is that with this, you know,

03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:02.050
our mindset of having to
solve question really fast,

03:07:02.050 --> 03:07:05.920
very efficiently, planetary
exploration is developing tools,

03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:07.720
new tools and new way

03:07:07.720 --> 03:07:10.080
of approaching planetary
environment

03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:14.890
that you can take back to the
Earth and use it for the benefit

03:07:14.890 --> 03:07:16.650
of everybody trying to
understand, you know,

03:07:16.650 --> 03:07:19.940
what is the next best thing to--
not only monitor the environment

03:07:19.940 --> 03:07:22.970
but maybe help, you know,
slow down what's going on.

03:07:22.970 --> 03:07:25.600
So, I think this-- even

03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:29.820
if people don't realize it
day-to-day, there are a couple

03:07:29.820 --> 03:07:31.120
of reason for that is

03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:32.800
that everybody is busy
doing their own thing

03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:35.630
but as Bobak was saying, NASA
is not doing a very good job

03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:38.210
at mentioning the good
stuff that happens on Earth

03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:40.750
because of planetary exploration
and what they are doing.

03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:42.350
And I think they should
do that a lot more.

03:07:42.350 --> 03:07:45.970
So, this is happening,
this is not necessary

03:07:45.970 --> 03:07:48.090
because it's not happening
is because you don't know

03:07:48.090 --> 03:07:50.660
about them and so the
effort maybe you should be

03:07:50.660 --> 03:07:53.300
about those agency and
this is NASA and this ISA

03:07:53.300 --> 03:07:54.600
and this everybody else.

03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:56.740
Maybe the Indian agency
is doing a better job

03:07:56.740 --> 03:08:00.540
at is relating what
we are doing as far

03:08:00.540 --> 03:08:02.690
of an endeavor for mankind.

03:08:02.690 --> 03:08:05.510
And which is actually true
it's not like a small amount

03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:08.170
of people doing something
for an elite.

03:08:08.170 --> 03:08:09.470
That's not right.

03:08:09.470 --> 03:08:11.570
This is not out to be presented.

03:08:11.570 --> 03:08:15.490
How many things you are wearing
or using that is actually,

03:08:15.490 --> 03:08:17.790
you know, the result of
planetary exploration.

03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:20.500
You don't know it, you know,
you don't even know about it.

03:08:20.500 --> 03:08:23.400
So, there is an effort
for us to be made of.

03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:29.010
And, of course, for people like
us go out and talk to the public

03:08:29.010 --> 03:08:31.050
and say what's happening.

03:08:31.050 --> 03:08:34.080
And also maybe, you know,
take the kids and say well,

03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:36.340
you know, be part of this.

03:08:36.340 --> 03:08:37.770
And also find on your way,

03:08:37.770 --> 03:08:40.080
we're having this
interesting discussion early

03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:44.200
on about how kids have their own
judgment and mindset et cetera.

03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:48.390
They probably have very good
idea on how we can make this--

03:08:48.390 --> 03:08:50.690
the exploration for humanity.

03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:54.190
&gt;&gt; Dana Burton: Very
briefly also.

03:08:54.190 --> 03:08:56.950
Fiction and fantasy
and imagination offers

03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:59.980
so many different ways
of re-imagining spaces

03:08:59.980 --> 03:09:03.290
and as things are right now,
probably if you just take cut

03:09:03.290 --> 03:09:06.380
and dry the political
or commercial sector,

03:09:06.380 --> 03:09:08.020
you're not going to
really get that far.

03:09:08.020 --> 03:09:11.540
But if we start thinking and I
think the next panel will talk

03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:12.840
about this a lot too, right?

03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:17.030
If we start imagining different
ways of relating to each other,

03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:18.640
resonating and also knowing

03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:21.940
that consensus is not
necessarily possible

03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:24.360
and that we don't want to all
agree with each other that is

03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:29.280
through contestation that our
best efforts and explorations

03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:35.220
and discussions occur and
I think we can go at that

03:09:35.220 --> 03:09:37.820
and hopefully that will build
into something productive

03:09:37.820 --> 03:09:40.180
and generative and creative.

03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:44.600
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Any questions?

03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:47.410
Chanda.

03:09:47.410 --> 03:09:50.710
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
So I guess, you know,

03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:52.410
obviously I'm reading
things through the lens

03:09:52.410 --> 03:09:54.860
of the conversation we had on
the first panel this morning.

03:09:54.860 --> 03:10:00.460
And thinking a little bit
about vocabulary and, you know,

03:10:00.460 --> 03:10:05.600
the word "explore"
and I have been trying

03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:08.150
in just my every day life
to get away from, oh,

03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:12.160
I discovered this new
artist and say I've learned

03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:15.630
about a new artist because often
the artist existed before I

03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:16.930
discovered them.

03:10:16.930 --> 03:10:21.240
And so, I'm kind of wondering

03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:24.840
and maybe I'll put this question
particularly to Margaret

03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:27.330
because I think that this
falls along some of the things

03:10:27.330 --> 03:10:31.890
that you've been thinking
about and talking about.

03:10:31.890 --> 03:10:37.220
How does something a transition
like that shape the conversation

03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:40.190
that we have in terms of
thinking about learning

03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:43.830
about Mars versus
exploring Mars?

03:10:45.010 --> 03:10:49.100
&gt;&gt; Margaret Huettl: Are
you saying that like you--

03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:50.500
[ Inaudible ]

03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:56.880
OK. Yeah I think that I like
that shift to thinking not just

03:10:56.880 --> 03:10:59.640
by exploring but learning.

03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:05.620
And I don't-- I think part
of the reason why it's

03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:10.560
so important is because
language has power beyond just

03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:14.550
like the stories we tell but I
mean, I guess thinking about it

03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:17.010
from a legal perspective, again,

03:11:17.010 --> 03:11:19.310
the way that this
language gets embedded

03:11:19.310 --> 03:11:22.500
and in the legal system.

03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:26.590
Also, you know, shapes
peoples' lives

03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:29.210
on a day-to-day basis as well.

03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:31.260
So, I think that, yeah, I've--

03:11:31.260 --> 03:11:34.880
I mean I don't know what
language would be best but I

03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:41.280
like the idea using less
exploring more learning.

03:11:41.280 --> 03:11:44.150
Thinking about relationships.

03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:47.110
Yeah.

03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:48.410
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Questions?

03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:50.710
Anyone more?

03:11:52.770 --> 03:11:55.260
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, why Mars?

03:11:55.260 --> 03:11:57.150
Why not colonize the moon

03:11:57.150 --> 03:12:00.880
or some independent
free floating habitat?

03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:07.110
&gt;&gt; Nathalie Cabro: Well,
I'll go first then you guys.

03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:10.450
Well, I think we are
going back to the moon.

03:12:10.450 --> 03:12:14.720
And frankly as a scientist I
think this is an excellent idea.

03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:16.360
This is next to home.

03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:19.490
This is a place where we
can learn a lot about how

03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:22.490
to do things right which
basically we'll be messing

03:12:22.490 --> 03:12:25.110
up a lot before we learn
how to make things right

03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:27.690
but it's closer to home,
so maybe the repercussions

03:12:27.690 --> 03:12:29.930
of that will be lesser.

03:12:29.930 --> 03:12:34.700
And there are also different
layers to that question.

03:12:34.700 --> 03:12:37.800
I would say that the
moon makes a lot of sense

03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:43.130
to try technologies, habitat
and the number of things.

03:12:43.130 --> 03:12:46.730
As far as why Mars,
then you go back maybe

03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:48.460
astrobiology question.

03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:54.170
And Mars is really about,
you know, this connection

03:12:54.170 --> 03:13:00.010
that we seem to have, you
know, we have had for so long.

03:13:00.010 --> 03:13:02.780
Mars makes humanity dream.

03:13:02.780 --> 03:13:05.130
It was first, the
agreement which turn

03:13:05.130 --> 03:13:06.430
out they are not there.

03:13:06.430 --> 03:13:07.780
The [inaudible] of
Mars, et cetera.

03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:10.210
Why? Because when you are
looking at the landscape

03:13:10.210 --> 03:13:14.070
of Mars you don't need
to invent any vocabulary

03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:15.850
to describe the landscapes.

03:13:15.850 --> 03:13:17.150
You have mountains.

03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:18.450
You have sunset.

03:13:18.450 --> 03:13:19.750
You have sunrises.

03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:21.050
You have valleys.

03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:22.350
You have [inaudible]
and dunes and wind.

03:13:22.350 --> 03:13:24.520
This is how we describe Earth.

03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:28.130
It's Earth that's dry
now on and, you know,

03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:30.610
at least less alive than we are.

03:13:30.610 --> 03:13:33.310
We don't know if there is
life actually out there

03:13:33.310 --> 03:13:37.070
but the fact is that early
Mars was fairly close--

03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:38.620
was not the same
but fairly close

03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:40.300
to what we know early Earth was.

03:13:40.300 --> 03:13:46.450
And if there is life somewhere
in the Solar System that's close

03:13:46.450 --> 03:13:50.790
to what we are at least in
theory, Mars would be the place.

03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:52.790
And there is something
that I really like that,

03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:54.490
I repeat all the time.

03:13:54.490 --> 03:13:57.260
There is something
special about Mars.

03:13:57.260 --> 03:14:00.390
And I still, as an
astrobiologist,

03:14:00.390 --> 03:14:02.550
don't know if there
is really a transition

03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:06.420
between what we called prebiotic
chemistry or I mean a line

03:14:06.420 --> 03:14:08.240
between prebiotic
chemistry and life,

03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:10.170
I really think there
is a transition

03:14:10.170 --> 03:14:12.000
that could, you know, that can.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:17.320
But what I know is that
our planet is so dynamic

03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:21.370
that whatever habits between
those two states of matter

03:14:21.370 --> 03:14:25.510
and something else is not
recorded anymore on our planet.

03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:26.810
It's gone.

03:14:26.810 --> 03:14:29.940
Erosion, it's-- to
plate tectonics.

03:14:29.940 --> 03:14:33.170
This record is gone, which
means that if we want

03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:37.440
to understand how life
started, what's the process,

03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:41.720
we are not going to find it
necessarily in our own planet.

03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:44.260
So, now you have to imagine
being an orphan and trying

03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:46.540
to figure out who
your parents are.

03:14:46.540 --> 03:14:48.390
They are gone, all right?

03:14:48.390 --> 03:14:52.420
So, where you go to, you
go to your, next of kin,

03:14:52.420 --> 03:14:55.590
aunt and uncle or, you
know, somebody close to you.

03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:57.140
Mars is that.

03:14:57.140 --> 03:15:01.550
And there is another plate
tectonic, the erosion is less,

03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:05.080
geology collectivity
is lesser on Mars too.

03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:07.830
And there are very, very,
very old rocks on Mars

03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:10.010
and that was still
exposed at the surface.

03:15:10.010 --> 03:15:11.360
Just because of panspermia,

03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:14.000
because of planetary exchange
there is a good chance

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:17.520
that the same material
that created life

03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:20.640
on Earth maybe somewhere
on Mars.

03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:22.300
And it may be that Mars is going

03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:26.380
to be the place gives us a
response to, you know, how life,

03:15:26.380 --> 03:15:29.550
our own life formed, how
we got started, who we are.

03:15:29.550 --> 03:15:32.070
So, this is what's
special about Mars.

03:15:32.070 --> 03:15:33.590
This is the why behind Mars.

03:15:33.590 --> 03:15:38.490
This is the why beyond at least
the astrobiology part of it.

03:15:38.490 --> 03:15:42.370
As for the human part of
it, I think this is the--

03:15:42.370 --> 03:15:46.210
our old story of explaining
from going to, you know,

03:15:46.210 --> 03:15:47.780
a rock to the next rock,

03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:50.300
to the next continent
to the next ocean.

03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:54.200
It happens so that the next
rock is 50 million miles away

03:15:54.200 --> 03:15:55.500
from here.

03:15:55.500 --> 03:15:59.700
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: So I know
we probably have other questions

03:15:59.700 --> 03:16:02.660
but we have a break
in the afternoon

03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:05.310
and a reception following
this and I don't want

03:16:05.310 --> 03:16:07.270
to get us off track
but I want to thank all

03:16:07.270 --> 03:16:09.510
of are panelists again.

03:16:09.510 --> 03:40:40.730
[ Applause ]

03:40:40.730 --> 03:40:43.230
So, the overview of
this particular panel

03:40:43.230 --> 03:40:46.960
if you understand the program
is called alternative futurism.

03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:49.810
And this of-- as we
should probably be evident

03:40:49.810 --> 03:40:53.480
of by now is centered on science
fiction in the imagination.

03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:56.570
It has really has a power
to inspire and instruct us

03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:58.220
as we invention the future.

03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:02.190
But it's also long bit a vehicle
for myths of Manifest Destiny.

03:41:02.190 --> 03:41:05.060
And so, we wanted to start today
by talking about the view points

03:41:05.060 --> 03:41:08.140
of humanities future that
are alternative to some

03:41:08.140 --> 03:41:10.610
of these mainstream narratives

03:41:10.610 --> 03:41:12.900
and how we might
conceptualize life off world

03:41:12.900 --> 03:41:14.800
in radically different ways.

03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:16.940
And so, I'm going to
start by throwing this

03:41:16.940 --> 03:41:20.220
out to the entire panel probably
the central concern that came

03:41:20.220 --> 03:41:24.840
up in our pre-event call
which is alternative to what?

03:41:24.840 --> 03:41:27.140
So, if we could take a moment
to talk about distinctions

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:30.430
between kinds of science
fiction and how they interface

03:41:30.430 --> 03:41:36.370
with your work to whoever
wants to take it first.

03:41:36.370 --> 03:41:38.880
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone, I'm
so happy to be here.

03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:43.270
So, one of the things that
comes up for me in response

03:41:43.270 --> 03:41:45.460
to that question is I think

03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:48.590
about Bell Hooks
centering the margins.

03:41:48.590 --> 03:41:53.050
I also think about some
problems as I continue to teach

03:41:53.050 --> 03:41:56.780
that her text in
that particular one.

03:41:56.780 --> 03:42:00.970
The problems that I'm
beginning to have around the--

03:42:00.970 --> 03:42:07.680
even the term margin, and so
that's something where I think

03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:11.250
about what does that mean to be
centered or to center oneself,

03:42:11.250 --> 03:42:15.350
and what does it mean
to claim the margin

03:42:15.350 --> 03:42:18.410
or to reject that terminology?

03:42:18.410 --> 03:42:22.490
And so, for myself, I
really approach Afrofuturism

03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:28.150
and the teaching of it as a
kind of shape shifters art.

03:42:28.150 --> 03:42:31.210
And I think that that is also
something that draws people

03:42:31.210 --> 03:42:34.700
and students in particular
to my classes and to

03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:39.970
that particular approach, where
it offers a kind of inclusivity

03:42:39.970 --> 03:42:42.240
and space for people
who are coming

03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:46.960
from many different
backgrounds and ways of being

03:42:46.960 --> 03:42:52.010
and seeing themselves an
identity to enter into that

03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:56.410
and see it as a kind of radical
space for creative production.

03:42:58.390 --> 03:42:59.690
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
Thank you.

03:42:59.690 --> 03:43:06.930
I think there are a few kind of
cultural myths that Afrofuturism

03:43:06.930 --> 03:43:11.360
as some of the related works
they're trying to reject

03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:13.870
and specifically in regards
to science and technology,

03:43:13.870 --> 03:43:17.230
I think one of the most
prominent ones is that,

03:43:17.230 --> 03:43:21.890
you know, black folks are like
a modern outside of modernity

03:43:21.890 --> 03:43:25.540
that they exist in some sort
of primitive or above or beyond

03:43:25.540 --> 03:43:30.850
or like extrapolated away
from technology and science.

03:43:30.850 --> 03:43:33.790
And then the other thing
that I've encountered a lot

03:43:33.790 --> 03:43:37.410
in regards to my work is this
idea of being an anomaly.

03:43:37.410 --> 03:43:40.690
I found that when I perform,

03:43:40.690 --> 03:43:42.150
a lot of white folks
will approach me

03:43:42.150 --> 03:43:44.090
as though I'm an
anomaly and I'm saying--

03:43:44.090 --> 03:43:46.330
and a big part of what
I want to do is say--

03:43:46.330 --> 03:43:49.600
is express that this is
the perspective that a lot

03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:53.550
of black folks have, right,
that I'm not a unicorn,

03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:57.320
and so I think Afrofuturism
has helped me to figure out how

03:43:57.320 --> 03:43:59.230
to kind of work through
that, but that's one

03:43:59.230 --> 03:44:01.260
of the myths I think that
there can only be one

03:44:01.260 --> 03:44:05.010
or that there's-- we represent
one particular perspective

03:44:05.010 --> 03:44:14.180
or one group, when that's
not necessarily the case.

03:44:14.180 --> 03:44:15.480
&gt;&gt; Willi Lemper: Test.

03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:17.560
We're absolutely thinking on
what you said about Bell Hooks.

03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:19.060
I've been thinking a
lot about this book

03:44:19.060 --> 03:44:22.560
by Ngugi wa Thiong'o,
"Moving the Center".

03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:25.000
And similar to what's come
up a lot today about who's

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:28.740
in the center in a variety
of ways and who's not

03:44:28.740 --> 03:44:30.040
in the center, who's
at the margin,

03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:34.020
but also who's just not
there at all, who's absent.

03:44:34.020 --> 03:44:37.320
And that's harder to see
because it's not present

03:44:37.320 --> 03:44:39.920
and requires a critical eye.

03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:43.460
Another quote that comes
to mind that was written

03:44:43.460 --> 03:44:47.770
by Peter Gourevitch,
about the Rwandan genocide

03:44:47.770 --> 03:44:51.240
that I come back to a lot
around this question is

03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:53.520
that power largely
consist in the ability

03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:57.940
to make others inhabit your
story of their reality.

03:44:57.940 --> 03:45:02.240
I think that's powerful
and specially this panel,

03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:04.860
I think there is this
connection between creative work

03:45:04.860 --> 03:45:06.920
and scholarship, and there's
something that happens

03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:09.600
in that space that
doesn't happen

03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:12.550
in purely journal
articles alone.

03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:15.810
And that imagining the future
is very much about the image

03:45:15.810 --> 03:45:18.750
or some sort of engagement
that's not one way

03:45:18.750 --> 03:45:22.750
and through this very old
colonial structure is not

03:45:22.750 --> 03:45:24.210
as essential.

03:45:24.210 --> 03:45:26.510
Yeah.

03:45:27.880 --> 03:45:29.180
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: Hi.

03:45:29.180 --> 03:45:30.480
This is so exciting.

03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:32.710
I guess when I think about--

03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:36.200
whenever I talk about
Afrofuturism,

03:45:36.200 --> 03:45:41.010
I like to give sort of a ground
floor reference definition

03:45:41.010 --> 03:45:42.310
for it.

03:45:42.310 --> 03:45:45.880
One of the definitions I
often you don't use is to say

03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:48.160
that it's a way of
looking at their future

03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:52.530
or ultimate realities, but
through a black cultural ends.

03:45:52.530 --> 03:45:56.030
And then I have to define black,
you know, and say that that's,

03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:58.630
you know, people of the
African continent and, you know,

03:45:58.630 --> 03:46:01.240
people of the African Diaspora.

03:46:01.240 --> 03:46:05.560
And then I also say that it
intersects the imagination,

03:46:05.560 --> 03:46:08.070
technology, mysticism.

03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:12.090
I highlight mysticism,
because that separates it

03:46:12.090 --> 03:46:14.900
from the way we usually
talk about science fiction.

03:46:14.900 --> 03:46:19.840
And that it obviously
intersects black culture,

03:46:19.840 --> 03:46:24.290
but that there is a lot of
appreciation for the concept

03:46:24.290 --> 03:46:27.570
of the divine feminine,
a lot of women creators,

03:46:27.570 --> 03:46:31.570
but also this idea
of valuing intuition

03:46:31.570 --> 03:46:37.350
or the emotions is being a
valued space for information.

03:46:37.350 --> 03:46:40.330
Intuition is a valued space
for information in the same way

03:46:40.330 --> 03:46:43.590
that logic is and looking
at that as a balance.

03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:45.940
So, if you take something
like the oak, and you think

03:46:45.940 --> 03:46:49.920
about masculinity and femininity
in sort of these larger not

03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:54.280
in a binary space per se but
just sort of this concept

03:46:54.280 --> 03:46:57.540
that there are ideas we both
connect with and that express,

03:46:57.540 --> 03:47:00.040
you know, very much
these different ways

03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:02.060
that we can process information,

03:47:02.060 --> 03:47:04.060
and come to understand
ourselves.

03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:06.390
And then, you know, this
relationship with time,

03:47:06.390 --> 03:47:10.640
you know, with the future
and the past and the present,

03:47:10.640 --> 03:47:12.610
being various expressions
of what

03:47:12.610 --> 03:47:14.850
and these are all
concepts you see coming

03:47:14.850 --> 03:47:17.940
out of the Afrofuturism which
also overlap in a lot of ways

03:47:17.940 --> 03:47:19.570
with indigenous futurism.

03:47:19.570 --> 03:47:24.090
But what is interesting about
Afrofuturism which is different

03:47:24.090 --> 03:47:26.090
from how we kind of
talk about this sci-fi,

03:47:26.090 --> 03:47:28.690
this is why the whole
alternative futurism gets really

03:47:28.690 --> 03:47:31.940
interesting, Afrofuturism
at least acknowledges

03:47:31.940 --> 03:47:35.570
that it's a perspective, right?

03:47:35.570 --> 03:47:38.800
And so, we start talking
about this idea of,

03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:42.570
oh science fiction, and then
there is this general assumption

03:47:42.570 --> 03:47:45.080
that this is the way, right?

03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:46.950
And that there's
one approach to it,

03:47:46.950 --> 03:47:50.680
and a lot of times
it's very nationalistic

03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:53.950
or militaristic and, you know,
it might explore various things.

03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:56.740
So, I mean, I've been on
a science fiction panels

03:47:56.740 --> 03:47:58.310
and I just have to say,
"Look, I don't speak

03:47:58.310 --> 03:48:00.280
from a marginalized space."

03:48:00.280 --> 03:48:01.580
I don't know what that is.

03:48:01.580 --> 03:48:02.880
That's not my background.

03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:05.370
That's not my perspective,
and there was gasp.

03:48:05.370 --> 03:48:08.780
Like, oh my goodness, but that's
what you're here to inform us

03:48:08.780 --> 03:48:15.120
of in a psychology sorry, you
know, because I don't relate

03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:17.060
to that concept, right?

03:48:17.060 --> 03:48:19.720
And so generally
speaking, you know,

03:48:19.720 --> 03:48:23.980
this is the point I'm talking
about these perspectives is

03:48:23.980 --> 03:48:28.030
to integrate and share and look
at how we can integrate them,

03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:30.420
how we can overlap them and
how we can pull the best

03:48:30.420 --> 03:48:33.030
so you create this sort
of societies in the world

03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:36.270
that makes the most
sense for us.

03:48:36.270 --> 03:48:38.330
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
I wanted to kind of respond

03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:41.260
and just, you know, affirm
what you said in terms

03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:45.430
of to throwing this idea of
the black object and the need

03:48:45.430 --> 03:48:49.570
that people have where the
largest societies seems to have

03:48:49.570 --> 03:48:53.710
for depictions of
black objection.

03:48:53.710 --> 03:48:56.570
And so that, you know,
this idea that no,

03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:58.400
I'm not speaking from a margin.

03:48:58.400 --> 03:49:01.930
I'm-- you know, and I'm
speaking from a point of joy,

03:49:01.930 --> 03:49:07.320
of radical joy, which is
something that Wanuri Kahiu,

03:49:07.320 --> 03:49:11.950
a filmmaker who did Pumzi,
the film and many others,

03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:15.420
and Rafiki which is now
showing in Kenya, it was banned

03:49:15.420 --> 03:49:19.120
and now it's currently
showing which is awesome.

03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:25.410
But, you know, thinking about
depictions and how we are,

03:49:25.410 --> 03:49:29.490
you know, there's a sort of
consumption of black object.

03:49:29.490 --> 03:49:33.710
And so, the Afrofuturism
as a genre is the space

03:49:33.710 --> 03:49:38.610
where we can vary directly,
you know, go up against

03:49:38.610 --> 03:49:40.820
that in a sense, you
know, at the same time,

03:49:40.820 --> 03:49:45.700
I also reject the idea and this
is connected with, you know,

03:49:45.700 --> 03:49:50.070
in terms of definitions that
Afrofuturism is a response

03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:55.990
to whiteness in the same way
that black guards movement,

03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:58.770
authors, and practitioners
were saying, you know,

03:49:58.770 --> 03:50:01.720
basically Malcolm
was assassinated

03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:04.020
and Baraka [assumed spelling]
moved up North to Harlem

03:50:04.020 --> 03:50:06.760
and said, you know, this
basically, we are going

03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:09.150
to address ourselves, two black
people, four black people,

03:50:09.150 --> 03:50:11.030
about black people,
we are not going

03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:13.460
to be responding to whiteness.

03:50:13.460 --> 03:50:20.220
And so, it was art as action,
and so I really root my approach

03:50:20.220 --> 03:50:23.360
to Afrofuturism, very much
in the black guards movement

03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:26.800
in that time period I thought
about that for a long times,

03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:29.010
and I feel and very
connected with a number

03:50:29.010 --> 03:50:31.540
of the practitioners who
are still working today.

03:50:31.540 --> 03:50:35.380
And one of the things
I want to say too

03:50:35.380 --> 03:50:39.540
about the term Afrofuturism
is there's also and I guess,

03:50:39.540 --> 03:50:43.370
this is a little more detailed
in terms of the specifics

03:50:43.370 --> 03:50:47.670
of this-- the genre, but there
are sometimes arguments about,

03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:50.900
well, what should it be called
and the more Afrofuturism gets

03:50:50.900 --> 03:50:55.520
to be this phenomena, you
know, as the years go by.

03:50:55.520 --> 03:50:58.680
Some folks would say,
"Well, I don't want to--

03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:01.270
Afrofuturism, that term
was invented by white men.

03:51:01.270 --> 03:51:03.620
I don't want this to be
something that I'm using

03:51:03.620 --> 03:51:06.780
to define this radical
practice."

03:51:06.780 --> 03:51:09.100
Which I understand and I
think that's why I go back

03:51:09.100 --> 03:51:12.330
to shape shifting,
Afrofuturism, black sci-fi,

03:51:12.330 --> 03:51:16.690
a black speculative
science, you know,

03:51:16.690 --> 03:51:19.820
all of these terminologies
have space,

03:51:19.820 --> 03:51:22.500
and I think they're
all connected.

03:51:22.500 --> 03:51:25.890
One of the reasons I hold
to that term at least

03:51:25.890 --> 03:51:28.920
for the moment, giving myself
space to shape shift out of

03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:32.830
that if I should so desire
is there's an article

03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:35.920
by Mark Rockymore called
"What is Afrofuturism?"

03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:38.810
that really has moved
me over the years.

03:51:38.810 --> 03:51:41.390
And he talks about the afro.

03:51:41.390 --> 03:51:43.760
So for me it's kind
of two parts,

03:51:43.760 --> 03:51:45.820
one is the form of the afro.

03:51:45.820 --> 03:51:47.120
It can't be contained.

03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:50.610
It can't be constrained,
spirals, moving this way

03:51:50.610 --> 03:51:52.920
and that, you know,
of their own volition.

03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:56.420
And so, his beautiful poetic
description of the afro

03:51:56.420 --> 03:51:59.620
for me is what roots
the practice.

03:51:59.620 --> 03:52:03.380
And then also, thinking
about Malcolm rooted

03:52:03.380 --> 03:52:07.490
in Black Arts Movement as well,
and in that particular moment

03:52:07.490 --> 03:52:09.990
in time, where there
was a constant speaking

03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:12.460
to the Afro-American.

03:52:12.460 --> 03:52:15.030
And so something about
using the term Afro

03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:18.740
for me also roots
it in that moment.

03:52:18.740 --> 03:52:21.640
And so, I really, for myself
I think about Afrofuturism

03:52:21.640 --> 03:52:25.070
as an action, it's a practice.

03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:29.100
I describe it as a
methodology of black liberation.

03:52:29.100 --> 03:52:34.840
So it's definitely a space
where people can express

03:52:34.840 --> 03:52:37.400
and be creative, and all
of that is part of it.

03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:41.510
For me, I'm very invested
in it, it not necessarily

03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:44.680
to say political,
but just an action,

03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:47.590
a statement, a methodology.

03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:50.960
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
And I think leaping on that,

03:52:50.960 --> 03:52:55.990
just quickly in the anthology
Octavia's Brood distinction is

03:52:55.990 --> 03:53:00.310
made in the introduction between
sort of speculative fiction

03:53:00.310 --> 03:53:02.360
and visionary fiction
and this idea

03:53:02.360 --> 03:53:05.910
that this is explicitly rooted
in sort of social justice ideas,

03:53:05.910 --> 03:53:08.260
and that there's no
shying away from that,

03:53:08.260 --> 03:53:11.660
and sort of what you're
expressing around,

03:53:11.660 --> 03:53:14.840
the recognition of a
perspective, like acknowledging

03:53:14.840 --> 03:53:16.150
that is a big part of the work.

03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:18.970
Not saying that they
occupy the view from nowhere

03:53:18.970 --> 03:53:22.430
that there's an objective
perspective there, right,

03:53:22.430 --> 03:53:25.440
instead, that's a full part
of kind of visionary fictions,

03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:28.890
so I think-- and kind
of this distinction

03:53:28.890 --> 03:53:32.180
that you were talking about
around kind of the action of it

03:53:32.180 --> 03:53:35.970
that there's this social justice
framework for a lot of the work

03:53:35.970 --> 03:53:38.610
that falls in that category.

03:53:38.610 --> 03:53:39.910
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Willi,
I wonder if you could speak

03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:42.280
to this from the standpoint
of indigenous futurism

03:53:42.280 --> 03:53:43.580
and how it functions for you

03:53:43.580 --> 03:53:46.810
in the communities
that you work with.

03:53:46.810 --> 03:53:48.110
&gt;&gt; Willi Lemper: Yeah.

03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:51.470
I mean it operates in a very
practical way for people

03:53:51.470 --> 03:53:53.990
because in Australia,
for example, there is--

03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:57.360
there are no treaties
sort of as much

03:53:57.360 --> 03:54:00.270
as treaties have been
broken in North America.

03:54:00.270 --> 03:54:02.070
There are no treaties.

03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:05.640
[Inaudible] is established
that there were no people there

03:54:05.640 --> 03:54:10.120
and so it was considered moral.

03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:14.740
And so the way that citizens
imagine indigenous futures

03:54:14.740 --> 03:54:16.160
in Australia has a huge impact

03:54:16.160 --> 03:54:19.090
on whether communities
will be funded.

03:54:19.090 --> 03:54:22.510
There's a reason that for to
close half of all communities--

03:54:22.510 --> 03:54:24.120
aboriginal communities
in Australia.

03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:27.020
And it would have happen except
there was a public outcry.

03:54:27.020 --> 03:54:30.540
So a lot hangs on sort
of broader coalitions

03:54:30.540 --> 03:54:34.070
of people imagining that
there's a future for people,

03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:37.320
but it's very stark funding,
it was cut by 40% recently,

03:54:37.320 --> 03:54:41.260
and there's this larger
way, I think especially

03:54:41.260 --> 03:54:43.470
in indigenous futurisms
around temporality

03:54:43.470 --> 03:54:47.270
in which the past
becomes a place for--

03:54:47.270 --> 03:54:50.950
in which indigenous people are
slotted into the mythic at best,

03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:52.610
and then it gets
worse from there.

03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:55.590
Then the present is about
suffering in problems

03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:57.690
and the future is absent.

03:54:57.690 --> 03:54:59.110
And so there's this
way in which--

03:54:59.110 --> 03:55:01.060
there's this great books
"Silencing the Past"

03:55:01.060 --> 03:55:02.500
by Michel-Rolph Trouillot.

03:55:02.500 --> 03:55:04.940
He talks about how the past
is a bundle of silence.

03:55:04.940 --> 03:55:07.110
It's more than it
is anything else.

03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:10.620
And the future is also silenced,
that the future mostly has to do

03:55:10.620 --> 03:55:12.910
with things that
have been edited out.

03:55:12.910 --> 03:55:14.400
But we focused on the
things that are there

03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:17.160
because that makes sense to do,

03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:19.670
especially for indigenous
people.

03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:22.750
Western civilization is
dependent on them not existing

03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:28.060
and always has been in
Southern colonization.

03:55:28.060 --> 03:55:31.840
And so, I think temporality
becomes especially important

03:55:31.840 --> 03:55:35.060
in that case, yeah.

03:55:35.060 --> 03:55:36.750
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: You know
one of the things that came

03:55:36.750 --> 03:55:40.660
up in our pre-event call
was the potentiality

03:55:40.660 --> 03:55:42.510
of these frameworks
for transformation.

03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:46.680
And I think that's something,
even though you each work well,

03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:50.210
you use work in a variety of
different media, then different

03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:54.800
from each other and wide in
scope in each one of your work.

03:55:54.800 --> 03:55:58.090
And I wonder if you could
speak a little to the way

03:55:58.090 --> 03:56:01.290
that transformation
is realized during

03:56:01.290 --> 03:56:03.620
or at least implemented
in your work.

03:56:03.620 --> 03:56:08.190
So, I know Ytasha, you had done
a dance therapy workshop this

03:56:08.190 --> 03:56:09.490
summer, is that correct?

03:56:09.490 --> 03:56:10.790
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: Right.

03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:12.090
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Yeah.

03:56:12.090 --> 03:56:13.480
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: Yes,
very eventful program.

03:56:13.480 --> 03:56:16.970
I worked with teenage girls
which is always great.

03:56:16.970 --> 03:56:22.320
And the program was really based
on this concept of using dance

03:56:22.320 --> 03:56:28.610
as a way to connect people
with ideas about the future.

03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:34.060
And to connect them with more
of a historical grounding

03:56:34.060 --> 03:56:36.540
around identity in
culture and so forth,

03:56:36.540 --> 03:56:38.640
but more importantly
just to kind touch

03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:41.370
on all aspect of ourselves.

03:56:41.370 --> 03:56:46.520
So the course, it included
breathing exercises, meditation,

03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:48.120
but then they also
learned a little

03:56:48.120 --> 03:56:50.430
about different dances of--

03:56:50.430 --> 03:56:51.730
from different parts

03:56:51.730 --> 03:56:53.200
of the African continents
and Diasporas.

03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:56.330
So they learned West
African traditional dance,

03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:58.030
they're learning
Chicago style stepping,

03:56:58.030 --> 03:57:03.170
they're learning samba, salsa
and seeing the relationship

03:57:03.170 --> 03:57:05.890
between the music and
the rhythm patterns.

03:57:05.890 --> 03:57:08.940
But then also there would
be some essay writing.

03:57:08.940 --> 03:57:10.240
They would journal.

03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:11.540
Talk about themselves.

03:57:11.540 --> 03:57:13.100
We would do group exercises

03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:16.790
where they would pick a
celestial phenomenon and then do

03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:20.360
like a freestyle dance
movement thinking

03:57:20.360 --> 03:57:24.150
about Andromeda or
a particular star.

03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:27.430
And what it did over
time was they started

03:57:27.430 --> 03:57:30.820
to see a relationship between
themselves and the earth

03:57:30.820 --> 03:57:32.810
and then the larger universe.

03:57:32.810 --> 03:57:36.570
And with, you know, start
to speak in that way

03:57:36.570 --> 03:57:40.960
and they saw the value of art
in going to museums and thinking

03:57:40.960 --> 03:57:44.580
about dance and movement
as being art forms

03:57:44.580 --> 03:57:47.240
that had been preserved
in some respect

03:57:47.240 --> 03:57:49.020
for several thousand years.

03:57:49.020 --> 03:57:51.030
Looking at a dance
like samba and looking

03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:53.930
at how old it really is, so
some of the rhythms from--

03:57:53.930 --> 03:57:56.270
some of the music
from West African,

03:57:56.270 --> 03:57:58.690
the West African dances
they were learning.

03:57:58.690 --> 03:58:01.480
And seeing that, you
know, in different spaces,

03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:05.770
there was sometimes, they were
different symbolism with that.

03:58:05.770 --> 03:58:07.260
And then you say, "Well,
what does that have

03:58:07.260 --> 03:58:09.570
to do with the future?"

03:58:09.570 --> 03:58:13.150
Well they saw a relationship
between themselves,

03:58:13.150 --> 03:58:16.400
people in the past and
people in the future.

03:58:16.400 --> 03:58:19.900
And that the dances that they
were doing were connected

03:58:19.900 --> 03:58:22.470
to people who were doing
those dances before.

03:58:22.470 --> 03:58:25.940
And that the ideas and the
actions they were taking now

03:58:25.940 --> 03:58:28.840
were going to shape things
for people in the future

03:58:28.840 --> 03:58:32.540
and it also help them to feel
like they have more agency

03:58:32.540 --> 03:58:34.380
in part because of
the physical activity,

03:58:34.380 --> 03:58:37.820
they're pushing through,
you know, body limitations

03:58:37.820 --> 03:58:40.400
to do things they weren't
normally used to doing.

03:58:40.400 --> 03:58:44.010
And that made them think
more about their own futures.

03:58:44.010 --> 03:58:47.060
And so, it was, you know,
very holistic in that sense,

03:58:47.060 --> 03:58:50.910
but of course, you can imagine
certain things come up as well

03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:52.830
that kind of had
to be addressed.

03:58:52.830 --> 03:58:56.070
And so it was a very
transformative experience,

03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:59.750
but from me as a person who is a
writer and a dancer growing up,

03:58:59.750 --> 03:59:02.640
most people would think there
wasn't much of a relationship

03:59:02.640 --> 03:59:08.010
and to-- so-- but the
natural evolution of that is

03:59:08.010 --> 03:59:10.570
to see this logic connectivity.

03:59:10.570 --> 03:59:14.230
So I did do a film called a
"Love Letter to the Ancestors

03:59:14.230 --> 03:59:18.120
from Chicago" which also
dealt with dance as a kind

03:59:18.120 --> 03:59:24.800
of like the body as a-- the
body as a portal of sorts

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:28.300
between the future, the past
and the present specifically

03:59:28.300 --> 03:59:29.680
around kind of house music.

03:59:29.680 --> 03:59:33.040
I'm from Chicago and
I'm excited about that.

03:59:33.040 --> 03:59:36.370
But looking at freestyle
dances being part of the sort

03:59:36.370 --> 03:59:39.420
of interconnected way
of reminding ourselves

03:59:39.420 --> 03:59:42.130
that we have a relationship
with one another,

03:59:42.130 --> 03:59:45.660
with the universe
and with the earth.

03:59:45.660 --> 03:59:46.960
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Yeah, and I don't know

03:59:46.960 --> 03:59:48.990
if you all are familiar
with the dancer PhD contest

03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:51.680
or I guess it's a contest.

03:59:51.680 --> 03:59:57.490
So this was something that
started a number of years ago

03:59:57.490 --> 04:00:03.000
that I think, well, for lack
of less punny word embodies,

04:00:03.000 --> 04:00:05.740
a lot of the ways that people

04:00:05.740 --> 04:00:08.890
from scientific disciplines
think about the dialogue

04:00:08.890 --> 04:00:10.770
between the arts and sciences

04:00:10.770 --> 04:00:14.000
that it will be an
interpretive relationship.

04:00:14.000 --> 04:00:16.500
And I think one of the
things that's really missing

04:00:16.500 --> 04:00:20.520
from the way folks from the
science side, city arts is

04:00:20.520 --> 04:00:22.190
that they don't realize

04:00:22.190 --> 04:00:25.180
that there's this possible
relationship they can form just

04:00:25.180 --> 04:00:28.450
through movement
through from physicality.

04:00:28.450 --> 04:00:32.930
Yeah. I wonder and whoever
wants to take it first,

04:00:32.930 --> 04:00:35.180
if you can speak a little bit
about some of the projects

04:00:35.180 --> 04:00:39.080
that you've worked on and
their relationships to the sort

04:00:39.080 --> 04:00:41.960
of transformative
potentialities.

04:00:41.960 --> 04:00:47.440
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
I think touching

04:00:47.440 --> 04:00:50.450
on what Ytasha was
talking about.

04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:56.530
Actually my PhD work has helped
me in some regards in thinking

04:00:56.530 --> 04:01:00.480
about transformative potentials
of spaces and in myself

04:01:00.480 --> 04:01:05.560
and my community in a sense
that one of the areas of science

04:01:05.560 --> 04:01:08.930
and technology studies, it was
kind of history of technology,

04:01:08.930 --> 04:01:13.270
and broadening our definitions
of technology, broadening them

04:01:13.270 --> 04:01:17.410
to think less about kind of
discrete specific objects

04:01:17.410 --> 04:01:21.860
that often kind of thrive
or are tied in deeply

04:01:21.860 --> 04:01:24.150
to like masculinity or
particular, you know,

04:01:24.150 --> 04:01:27.670
constructs of power and instead
thinking more about, you know,

04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:29.740
"Monday in Technologies"
or even--

04:01:29.740 --> 04:01:33.360
not even technologies as objects
but as ways of doing things.

04:01:33.360 --> 04:01:35.740
And so opening up this idea

04:01:35.740 --> 04:01:39.810
that technology could be
something more, and that is part

04:01:39.810 --> 04:01:41.250
of a-- it only has meaning.

04:01:41.250 --> 04:01:44.590
And so far as the people around
it give it that meaning, it--

04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:45.970
I think as Ytasha
was saying, it gave--

04:01:45.970 --> 04:01:48.810
it felt like I had agency,
right, that the things

04:01:48.810 --> 04:01:51.170
that we do in our
actions were not just sort

04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:52.470
of dropped from the sky.

04:01:52.470 --> 04:01:53.770
There's a context.

04:01:53.770 --> 04:01:55.070
There's a broader history.

04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:56.380
There's a relationship
with other things

04:01:56.380 --> 04:01:57.680
that have happened before.

04:01:57.680 --> 04:02:01.170
And I think power functions
by cutting people off

04:02:01.170 --> 04:02:03.830
from their past, right, by
not allowing people to feel

04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:05.240
like there's a connection
and that the things

04:02:05.240 --> 04:02:07.070
that you do actually matter.

04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:08.990
And I think once I
started to recognize that,

04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:12.370
that's when I dug into my music.

04:02:12.370 --> 04:02:16.080
And explicitly talking about,
you know, hardships that I'd had

04:02:16.080 --> 04:02:18.760
but not in the sort of
like grand, you know,

04:02:18.760 --> 04:02:22.550
black suffering narrative
but instead this is a thing

04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:24.280
that I've dealt with
personally in my life.

04:02:24.280 --> 04:02:26.330
And let me share my
testimony with you.

04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:28.480
And in doing that, you know,
people have come up to me

04:02:28.480 --> 04:02:30.650
after shows and said, you know,
I started going to therapy

04:02:30.650 --> 04:02:32.400
because you started talking

04:02:32.400 --> 04:02:34.530
about the importance
of that in your life.

04:02:34.530 --> 04:02:36.480
Or I had a conversation
with my adviser

04:02:36.480 --> 04:02:38.020
that I have been
putting off for forever

04:02:38.020 --> 04:02:40.260
because we were talking
about the breakdown.

04:02:40.260 --> 04:02:43.790
And so, I think I started to
realized what I do matters,

04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:47.310
the music that I make matters
and the words that I put

04:02:47.310 --> 04:02:51.460
down should be well intention
because it reverberates.

04:02:51.460 --> 04:02:52.760
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
If I could ask,

04:02:52.760 --> 04:02:54.710
there's a quick follow
up to that.

04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:59.250
How often do you engage
with your students?

04:02:59.250 --> 04:03:00.980
So for example, you
just thought the science

04:03:00.980 --> 04:03:02.990
of feminism course at NYU.

04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:06.060
How often do you engage
with your students also

04:03:06.060 --> 04:03:07.970
through like a musical lens.

04:03:07.970 --> 04:03:10.830
Is that all what we've been
entering together for you or is

04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:14.860
that sort of different parts of
your life that you separate or?

04:03:14.860 --> 04:03:16.160
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
So I've kind

04:03:16.160 --> 04:03:18.180
of separated them
from my sanity.

04:03:18.180 --> 04:03:21.020
I've got my academic stuff over
here and then my musical self,

04:03:21.020 --> 04:03:23.530
but of course they sort of
bleed and it was really cool

04:03:23.530 --> 04:03:28.030
because one of my students at
the beginning of the class was

04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:30.800
like maybe this sounds
awkward, but are you a rapper?

04:03:30.800 --> 04:03:32.100
And I guess he had
done some research.

04:03:32.100 --> 04:03:36.250
And so it was cool, we got a
chance to have a conversation.

04:03:36.250 --> 04:03:38.800
We started taking my headphones
and other stuff and sort

04:03:38.800 --> 04:03:41.130
of opened up this,
this dialogue.

04:03:41.130 --> 04:03:44.840
But I still haven't figured out
how to weave it all together

04:03:44.840 --> 04:03:46.650
but I would like to because
I think that they are--

04:03:46.650 --> 04:03:49.610
they do speak to each other.

04:03:49.610 --> 04:03:50.980
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
I love that question

04:03:50.980 --> 04:03:53.600
because I think just
thinking about that as well.

04:03:53.600 --> 04:03:58.530
It's something that
I've been thinking how--

04:03:58.530 --> 04:03:59.830
what are the ways

04:03:59.830 --> 04:04:01.280
that I incorporate my
performative nature

04:04:01.280 --> 04:04:03.380
into my teaching practice.

04:04:03.380 --> 04:04:08.620
One if-- my kind of funny
story, there's a shaman,

04:04:08.620 --> 04:04:13.950
multiple PhD having a-- his
name is Malidoma Patrice Some,

04:04:13.950 --> 04:04:15.450
some of you may know him.

04:04:15.450 --> 04:04:17.900
He's a Dagara from Burkina Faso.

04:04:17.900 --> 04:04:20.350
And I've been studying his
work following what he does

04:04:20.350 --> 04:04:21.650
for many years.

04:04:21.650 --> 04:04:24.850
And I had the chance to do
divination with him last year

04:04:24.850 --> 04:04:26.960
which was deeply transformative.

04:04:26.960 --> 04:04:30.470
And one of the stories in his
book, Of Water and the Spirit,

04:04:30.470 --> 04:04:32.060
he talks about his grandfather--

04:04:32.060 --> 04:04:36.360
he was very close and how
grandfather would hypnotize

04:04:36.360 --> 04:04:37.660
small children.

04:04:37.660 --> 04:04:39.580
If you ever saw a
small child walking

04:04:39.580 --> 04:04:42.830
around the village just
wordlessly doing a task,

04:04:42.830 --> 04:04:44.130
you know, handling a task,

04:04:44.130 --> 04:04:47.750
you knew that they had been
hypnotized by grandfather.

04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:50.840
And so, I think about that in
the context of my teaching.

04:04:50.840 --> 04:04:54.930
You know, one of the ways that
I can sort of hypnotize and,

04:04:54.930 --> 04:04:56.590
you know-- and use the voice.

04:04:56.590 --> 04:05:00.230
And, you know, I'm trained as
a jazz singer and trained--

04:05:00.230 --> 04:05:03.610
My voice is my mother's voice
so I used it very much in terms

04:05:03.610 --> 04:05:06.890
of self soothing, my sister is
a speech pathologist, you know,

04:05:06.890 --> 04:05:08.770
she taught me about
my performance

04:05:08.770 --> 04:05:10.120
that I'll be doing later.

04:05:10.120 --> 04:05:14.660
So I'm really, really
interested in the use of voice,

04:05:14.660 --> 04:05:18.550
word force thinking
about Yoruba Oriki.

04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:21.840
The power of drawing forts,
the person's essential nature

04:05:21.840 --> 04:05:24.000
through the use of voice.

04:05:24.000 --> 04:05:26.480
And so that's something
that I think about a lot,

04:05:26.480 --> 04:05:30.650
and I do ritual engaging
ritual with students

04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:31.950
and that sort of thing.

04:05:31.950 --> 04:05:35.920
I also wanted to kind of,
you know, speak to, Willi,

04:05:35.920 --> 04:05:37.900
what you're talking
about in terms of Ongogi

04:05:37.900 --> 04:05:40.550
who actually was I
took a class with him

04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:41.910
as an undergrad at Smith.

04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:46.110
He was recently out of
prison and an exile.

04:05:46.110 --> 04:05:50.920
And he talks about the cultural
bomb in decolonizing the mind.

04:05:50.920 --> 04:05:55.390
And that has been deeply
meaningful to me in terms

04:05:55.390 --> 04:06:00.720
of this idea of how it destroys
the people's belief in terms

04:06:00.720 --> 04:06:05.610
of the colonial project in
their own culture, in their own.

04:06:05.610 --> 04:06:08.770
And so thinking about that
belief and one's performance,

04:06:08.770 --> 04:06:12.720
the belief in one's--
what one has to share.

04:06:12.720 --> 04:06:17.560
And one of the interesting
things is that years ago

04:06:17.560 --> 04:06:19.510
and I won't say the
exact year but I was--

04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:24.330
when I was at Smith I was chosen
for this Smithsonian Internship

04:06:24.330 --> 04:06:27.970
where they sent 12 students
per year to different museums

04:06:27.970 --> 04:06:31.370
at the Smithsonian and I was
stationed at the National Museum

04:06:31.370 --> 04:06:35.680
of African Art to work on
King Ajman [inaudible] cloth

04:06:35.680 --> 04:06:36.980
and exhibition.

04:06:36.980 --> 04:06:40.250
At that time doing an
interactive exhibit,

04:06:40.250 --> 04:06:44.120
having a play written about
Ajman [inaudible] life,

04:06:44.120 --> 04:06:48.000
having [inaudible] family that
come from Ghana doing libations

04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:51.430
and a procession, this was
radical for the Smithsonian,

04:06:51.430 --> 04:06:54.870
you know, all kinds of
permissions to have libations

04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:57.990
and processions and all of
that may still be, you know,

04:06:57.990 --> 04:07:00.290
but to come back
here now, you know,

04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:04.860
and I will say it almost
20 years after that,

04:07:04.860 --> 04:07:08.820
it really makes me think about
this idea of engaged practice.

04:07:08.820 --> 04:07:12.600
And one of the things that I was
writing about and interviewing

04:07:12.600 --> 04:07:16.810
and working with the museum was
how do you exhibit African art

04:07:16.810 --> 04:07:19.080
in the western museum context.

04:07:19.080 --> 04:07:23.410
And I had-- many of my
teachers were doing performances

04:07:23.410 --> 04:07:26.300
with works of art and
moving through the museum,

04:07:26.300 --> 04:07:30.940
dancing to the, you know,
exhibitions and all of that.

04:07:30.940 --> 04:07:33.430
And so, that was really
the foundation, you know,

04:07:33.430 --> 04:07:35.010
Andrea Hairston, Tony
Baka [assumed spelling]

04:07:35.010 --> 04:07:38.690
and so many others for my
understanding of what it means

04:07:38.690 --> 04:07:41.230
to activate not only a space.

04:07:41.230 --> 04:07:44.420
And so, I think of
myself a space sculptor.

04:07:44.420 --> 04:07:48.600
But to activate not just the
physical space but the space

04:07:48.600 --> 04:07:52.510
of your body thinking of our
bodies as vessels of liberation

04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:55.880
as much as the music
as a vessel,

04:07:55.880 --> 04:07:57.680
the mothership as a vessel.

04:07:57.680 --> 04:08:00.490
And so, what are the
ways that we use voice

04:08:00.490 --> 04:08:07.210
or we use other methodologies
to activate that individual

04:08:07.210 --> 04:08:10.450
and in response to works
of art or otherwise.

04:08:10.450 --> 04:08:14.180
So, that I think, you know,
for me the idea of immersion,

04:08:14.180 --> 04:08:21.120
interaction, performitivity,
the ritual practice

04:08:21.120 --> 04:08:25.740
within the space
of Afrofuturism.

04:08:25.740 --> 04:08:28.510
You know, for me, it's
all in my work it ends

04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:30.360
up being a really collage.

04:08:30.360 --> 04:08:33.730
And in that the same
time when I was at Smith,

04:08:33.730 --> 04:08:35.720
I remember having
a tarot reading.

04:08:35.720 --> 04:08:39.570
And I remember the woman
who read my cards said,

04:08:39.570 --> 04:08:42.460
"The thing that you're going
to end up doing doesn't exist.

04:08:42.460 --> 04:08:44.310
You're going to create it."

04:08:44.310 --> 04:08:48.110
And so now,, you know, it's--
that many years later, you know,

04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:49.970
I real-- and it can
be very scary

04:08:49.970 --> 04:08:54.170
because this performance style,
this collage style, this thing,

04:08:54.170 --> 04:08:55.580
this Afrofuturism thing,

04:08:55.580 --> 04:09:01.880
a lot of it hasn't existed till
what I've put out there and

04:09:01.880 --> 04:09:03.320
or that particular style.

04:09:03.320 --> 04:09:09.970
And so, you know, it's a sort of
continual evolution into being--

04:09:09.970 --> 04:09:11.950
into the being that
I already am I guess.

04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:14.690
Yeah.

04:09:14.690 --> 04:09:16.090
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Willi,
I wonder if you could speak

04:09:16.090 --> 04:09:20.310
to your process so-- you
refer yourself and what you do

04:09:20.310 --> 04:09:23.530
as collaborative film making
with indigenous communities.

04:09:23.530 --> 04:09:27.510
So, can you tell us a little
bit about how that process works

04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:31.210
and for you, for
them, for everyone?

04:09:31.210 --> 04:09:32.510
&gt;&gt; Willi Lemper: Yeah.

04:09:32.510 --> 04:09:35.350
Collaboration is a word
that's turned around a lot now

04:09:35.350 --> 04:09:38.260
and it can mean a lot of things.

04:09:38.260 --> 04:09:42.320
Some, you know, very
admirable, some, some not.

04:09:42.320 --> 04:09:43.800
So, I've tried to
think for collab--

04:09:43.800 --> 04:09:48.050
about collaboration for a long
time and what that really means.

04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:53.550
So, for me, it involves trying
to-- from the very beginning

04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:54.850
and through the very end,

04:09:54.850 --> 04:09:56.540
through the writing
process as well.

04:09:56.540 --> 04:09:59.870
Start off with not the question
of can I do this or anything

04:09:59.870 --> 04:10:03.630
like that, but would you like
to do something together?

04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:06.990
And at a sort of larger metal
level trying to create a dynamic

04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:10.700
in which to the extent that's
possible instead of studying

04:10:10.700 --> 04:10:14.160
of people or that sort of
history of anthropology

04:10:14.160 --> 04:10:16.670
of doing projects with people.

04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:20.880
Working on something and looking
the same direction together.

04:10:20.880 --> 04:10:25.300
And so, going-- asking if you
would like to work on a project.

04:10:25.300 --> 04:10:27.950
And if so, what would--
and the second step for me

04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:30.400
at least is what would be the
single most useful thing for me

04:10:30.400 --> 04:10:33.240
to do in this context.

04:10:33.240 --> 04:10:37.450
And then, and still leave out
the research, a complete list

04:10:37.450 --> 04:10:40.140
at that point then go
home, think about it.

04:10:40.140 --> 04:10:42.930
And then build a project
from that foundation

04:10:42.930 --> 04:10:45.920
so that the Venn diagram
of what your project is

04:10:45.920 --> 04:10:50.860
and what would be on a daily
level productive in their point

04:10:50.860 --> 04:10:54.220
of view are not in
conflict to extent possible.

04:10:54.220 --> 04:10:56.630
And then, build the
project from there.

04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:58.860
So, for me, I've been
following the social life

04:10:58.860 --> 04:11:00.160
with film projects.

04:11:00.160 --> 04:11:02.650
So, whatever was happening with
the project, I was just get

04:11:02.650 --> 04:11:06.080
in the land cruise
and off, we were.

04:11:06.080 --> 04:11:09.020
And the collaboration
is often discussed

04:11:09.020 --> 04:11:11.200
as a sort of ethical issue.

04:11:11.200 --> 04:11:15.270
And ethics is a very sort of
western mentality too because,

04:11:15.270 --> 04:11:18.770
of course, for addition
scholars, it's obligation.

04:11:18.770 --> 04:11:20.800
So, ethics present it
as a sort of option

04:11:20.800 --> 04:11:22.340
that you should feel good about.

04:11:22.340 --> 04:11:27.090
But beyond that as well, I think
it has profound implications

04:11:27.090 --> 04:11:30.890
as to what you find because I
was interested in futurism and,

04:11:30.890 --> 04:11:32.730
you know, speculative thinking

04:11:32.730 --> 04:11:34.630
from following native
science fiction

04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:37.190
from many years and those films.

04:11:37.190 --> 04:11:39.460
But what I also found is that
when you approach your project

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:42.900
to certain way, different
types of things come out.

04:11:42.900 --> 04:11:47.600
Whereas, generally, there's
assumption that anthropologist

04:11:47.600 --> 04:11:49.580
or why people in general
are always just trying

04:11:49.580 --> 04:11:52.190
to learn more dreaming
stories, song lines.

04:11:52.190 --> 04:11:56.580
But when things open up
to in a more options,

04:11:56.580 --> 04:11:59.500
people are very interested
in telling other stories.

04:11:59.500 --> 04:12:03.330
And what I found is people often
want you talk about the future

04:12:03.330 --> 04:12:04.630
which is something I think

04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:08.550
that they feel is perhaps
silence specially in Australia

04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:12.150
where people are sort of
symbolically understood

04:12:12.150 --> 04:12:16.660
to be the oldest living
societies, set of societies.

04:12:16.660 --> 04:12:21.670
And that is taken as being
sort of the window into a past

04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:23.200
and there's a long
history of that.

04:12:23.200 --> 04:12:28.130
So, I think engaging in the
future is also lot about process

04:12:28.130 --> 04:12:32.690
and understanding the history
of how things have often work

04:12:32.690 --> 04:12:34.700
and the research process.

04:12:34.700 --> 04:12:39.110
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: Do
you think that there's--

04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:43.250
and I think-- oh actually before
I ask this question, Denenge,

04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:45.050
I wondered if you
could talk a little bit

04:12:45.050 --> 04:12:48.700
to the Mars project just
building off of the sort

04:12:48.700 --> 04:12:51.410
of emerging theme of
education and collaboration.

04:12:51.410 --> 04:12:54.650
You are doing this
project with your students

04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:57.940
to envision competing to go

04:12:57.940 --> 04:13:01.650
or to be envisioned being
a person chosen to go Mars.

04:13:01.650 --> 04:13:06.560
And also, you have a new
course in the fall this year

04:13:06.560 --> 04:13:10.160
that I think we'd be interested
to hear about as well?

04:13:10.160 --> 04:13:11.520
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
So, this was--

04:13:11.520 --> 04:13:13.540
Thank you for that question.

04:13:13.540 --> 04:13:15.750
This was for Afrofuturism.

04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:18.340
I started teaching Afrofuturism

04:13:18.340 --> 04:13:21.890
at Columbia College
Chicago in 2010.

04:13:21.890 --> 04:13:25.040
I knew there were other
courses here and there about it.

04:13:25.040 --> 04:13:28.320
Many of them, I believe, tended
to be focus perhaps on music

04:13:28.320 --> 04:13:30.570
in particular or specific area.

04:13:30.570 --> 04:13:32.410
This was I think one
of the first courses

04:13:32.410 --> 04:13:38.160
that was looking really across
disciplinary at the subject.

04:13:38.160 --> 04:13:41.310
I had students in the class,

04:13:41.310 --> 04:13:47.260
13 different countries
represented 14 different majors

04:13:47.260 --> 04:13:48.940
across the college.

04:13:48.940 --> 04:13:53.490
So, it was really diverse as
far as classes, you know, go.

04:13:53.490 --> 04:13:56.110
It was a pretty diverse group.

04:13:56.110 --> 04:13:58.840
And this was-- there
was the announcement

04:13:58.840 --> 04:14:03.450
of Mars 1 planning
to settle by 2023.

04:14:03.450 --> 04:14:06.390
So, we were 10 years
out and I thought, "OK.

04:14:06.390 --> 04:14:08.730
Let's do-- we got to
something with this."

04:14:08.730 --> 04:14:11.640
And one of the big
points with Mars 1 is many

04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:13.890
of you probably know is
that they were doing a sort

04:14:13.890 --> 04:14:17.980
of reality TV style so you
could, you know, upload people

04:14:17.980 --> 04:14:19.280
from all over the world.

04:14:19.280 --> 04:14:21.840
And you could track the
demographics which I did

04:14:21.840 --> 04:14:24.870
because I want to see, you
know, how many Nigerians out.

04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:26.320
I'm very, you know,
being from Nigeria,

04:14:26.320 --> 04:14:28.410
I'm interested how many
Nigerians had actually,

04:14:28.410 --> 04:14:30.400
you know, submitted in
the application to go.

04:14:30.400 --> 04:14:32.420
But, you know, really
interested in kind

04:14:32.420 --> 04:14:34.420
of the data around that as well.

04:14:34.420 --> 04:14:37.880
Who is submitting
and why and what?

04:14:37.880 --> 04:14:44.010
So, anyway, we have all
these-- oh goodness, costuming.

04:14:44.010 --> 04:14:47.330
All of these individuals from
around the world who are--

04:14:47.330 --> 04:14:48.980
I think it was in the
hundreds of thousands

04:14:48.980 --> 04:14:50.280
of people who had submitted.

04:14:50.280 --> 04:14:52.370
So, I thought let's
do something similar.

04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:55.880
We didn't use the application
online but I wanted students

04:14:55.880 --> 04:14:58.860
to have the experience
of applying.

04:14:58.860 --> 04:15:00.160
I did a poll.

04:15:00.160 --> 04:15:02.700
I think there were 27
students in the class.

04:15:02.700 --> 04:15:07.860
And out of that number, only
two said they would actually go.

04:15:07.860 --> 04:15:10.720
So, this wasn't based on
the actual desire to travel

04:15:10.720 --> 04:15:14.380
to Mars just sort
of hypotheticals.

04:15:14.380 --> 04:15:16.940
And so, I created
an application.

04:15:16.940 --> 04:15:22.830
And every class session was
basically completing another

04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:24.870
step in that application.

04:15:24.870 --> 04:15:30.910
Part of that was discussing
your strengths and kind of--

04:15:30.910 --> 04:15:32.610
and it would be everything.

04:15:32.610 --> 04:15:34.470
Strengths, what do
you have to offer?

04:15:34.470 --> 04:15:39.030
So, one person in the class,
young man who's very tall.

04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:42.810
So, he said, "Well, my height,
you know, I can reach things."

04:15:42.810 --> 04:15:46.970
So, if I'm claiming out of
Mars, you know, a cavern,

04:15:46.970 --> 04:15:48.270
you know, I'd be useful.

04:15:48.270 --> 04:15:51.060
And then someone else said,
"I'm really, really short.

04:15:51.060 --> 04:15:53.490
I can fit into small spaces.

04:15:53.490 --> 04:15:56.390
So, if there's, you know,
technological things,

04:15:56.390 --> 04:15:58.630
things that need to be
fixed, I can get in there."

04:15:58.630 --> 04:16:01.040
So, they were really
thinking, you know,

04:16:01.040 --> 04:16:03.240
really practically
someone else--

04:16:03.240 --> 04:16:06.720
I'm just going to mention
some of the fun ones here.

04:16:06.720 --> 04:16:08.700
Someone said, you
know, hockey sack.

04:16:08.700 --> 04:16:10.270
You know, I'm really
good at that.

04:16:10.270 --> 04:16:14.340
It promotes community,
friendship and it's really good

04:16:14.340 --> 04:16:16.650
for exercise and
keeping the body limber

04:16:16.650 --> 04:16:17.950
when you're, you know.

04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:20.500
So, there were-- they were
really getting into it.

04:16:20.500 --> 04:16:24.510
And, but really, we read a lot.

04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:26.630
Of course, always in my
class is reading a lot

04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:30.150
for from a wide range of authors
and thinking about what some

04:16:30.150 --> 04:16:31.910
of the problems might be.

04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:36.580
And then, they created as part
of the application package,

04:16:36.580 --> 04:16:40.320
they developed a work of
art that would be included

04:16:40.320 --> 04:16:44.380
to be sent off to the committee.

04:16:44.380 --> 04:16:46.450
And so, everything,
I'll be sharing

04:16:46.450 --> 04:16:48.880
in the performance later.

04:16:48.880 --> 04:16:50.180
Kelsey came up.

04:16:50.180 --> 04:16:51.610
She's a vocal composition major.

04:16:51.610 --> 04:16:55.560
So, she created a Mars Anthem
complete with the salute.

04:16:55.560 --> 04:16:58.620
And we all sang and she
brought in a drummer.

04:16:58.620 --> 04:17:04.270
We had someone who was
combination of graphic design

04:17:04.270 --> 04:17:10.460
and also health food-- I'm not
sure exactly what her major was.

04:17:10.460 --> 04:17:12.820
So she researched
what astronauts eat,

04:17:12.820 --> 04:17:20.060
what some of the initiatives
were for Mars and growing plants

04:17:20.060 --> 04:17:21.360
and that sort of thing.

04:17:21.360 --> 04:17:22.980
So they were-- they
really just went

04:17:22.980 --> 04:17:24.370
into all their different areas.

04:17:24.370 --> 04:17:27.440
Some went out just really
about designing and recycling

04:17:27.440 --> 04:17:29.410
and just she said, you
know, rather than F up,

04:17:29.410 --> 04:17:33.230
Mars just that way we have
Earth, let's set up the system

04:17:33.230 --> 04:17:36.390
from the get go so that it's
already connected directly

04:17:36.390 --> 04:17:39.880
to your pad and when you need
something it comes to you

04:17:39.880 --> 04:17:41.760
and then when you need
to, you send it out

04:17:41.760 --> 04:17:43.060
and there's essential.

04:17:43.060 --> 04:17:46.040
So they all have these
amazing designs and ideas

04:17:46.040 --> 04:17:47.770
and it was just incredible.

04:17:47.770 --> 04:17:54.540
So that was exciting and then,
yeah, and then this fall,

04:17:54.540 --> 04:17:58.620
I'm teaching a course on Octavia
Butler's Parable of the Sower

04:17:58.620 --> 04:18:02.090
which is a prophetic text for
this moment in times especially

04:18:02.090 --> 04:18:06.020
down to whole "Make
America Great Again."

04:18:06.020 --> 04:18:11.630
Yeah. So basically we are--
it's a seminar studio.

04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:14.360
We're doing urban
foraging with Nance Klehm

04:18:14.360 --> 04:18:16.830
who is very well-known
especially in Chicago.

04:18:16.830 --> 04:18:22.100
We are meeting with Jessica
Charlesworth [assumed spelling]

04:18:22.100 --> 04:18:27.160
who teaches in the design
objects to do survival packs.

04:18:27.160 --> 04:18:32.210
So we are looking also at
disaster scenarios and thinking

04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:34.440
about what are the
ways that we want

04:18:34.440 --> 04:18:39.620
to develop these packs
based on current situations

04:18:39.620 --> 04:18:45.760
and what we envision to be our
ideas of what might be needed.

04:18:45.760 --> 04:18:49.030
So it's just a-- it's an
exciting class and it's a way

04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:52.720
to really kind of get it to
parable and think about future,

04:18:52.720 --> 04:18:57.840
past, present all in
this moment right now.

04:18:57.840 --> 04:18:59.140
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
Thank you.

04:18:59.140 --> 04:19:02.240
Ytasha, I wanted to ask
you since you [inaudible]

04:19:02.240 --> 04:19:05.200
for futures but you
literally wrote the book.

04:19:05.200 --> 04:19:08.870
And I wonder-- and you
touched on this a little bit

04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:11.530
at the beginning of the panel,
but I wonder if you can you talk

04:19:11.530 --> 04:19:17.490
about the way in which that as
a label functions for you both

04:19:17.490 --> 04:19:21.900
as something that can be
productive, but do you ever find

04:19:21.900 --> 04:19:26.910
that it's limiting or doesn't
allow you access to the spaces

04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:29.890
that you would like to have?

04:19:29.890 --> 04:19:31.190
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: No.

04:19:31.190 --> 04:19:32.490
I don't find it to
be limiting at all.

04:19:32.490 --> 04:19:37.480
As a matter of fact, it's been
very liberating in a lot of ways

04:19:37.480 --> 04:19:40.350
and there's something
about naming power

04:19:40.350 --> 04:19:46.150
that I think really opens
the door to helping people

04:19:46.150 --> 04:19:49.800
to recognize that what
they are doing exist

04:19:49.800 --> 04:19:54.620
or to really synergize
ideas of-- Denenge was--

04:19:54.620 --> 04:19:58.150
Denenge I think in a
conversation with Denenge

04:19:58.150 --> 04:20:01.310
and I put this in the book,
it was through a conversation

04:20:01.310 --> 04:20:05.120
with her that I remember first
hearing the term Afrofuturism.

04:20:05.120 --> 04:20:07.720
Now, in retrospect,
I heard it before

04:20:07.720 --> 04:20:11.110
but I-- it didn't click then.

04:20:11.110 --> 04:20:14.630
And hearing the term, you
know, I would research then--

04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:16.940
and talk to these people

04:20:16.940 --> 04:20:20.770
and what I realize was I've
been having conversations

04:20:20.770 --> 04:20:23.990
and engaging in Afrofuturism
in my entire life.

04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:27.400
It really synergize
for me when I was

04:20:27.400 --> 04:20:30.240
at Clark Atlanta University and
the Atlanta University Center

04:20:30.240 --> 04:20:33.130
because everyone was
creating this Afrofuturism.

04:20:33.130 --> 04:20:36.230
Art and work and contemplating
the future and really working

04:20:36.230 --> 04:20:40.450
with the concepts of-- we were
even reading some of the essays,

04:20:40.450 --> 04:20:43.290
but again the term just
did not really click.

04:20:43.290 --> 04:20:46.730
And so for-- so when I
had that conversation,

04:20:46.730 --> 04:20:50.570
and Denenge brought up the
term and then retroactively,

04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:54.690
you know, starting to
look at how they were--

04:20:54.690 --> 04:20:58.140
all these relationships in
music and science and the art

04:20:58.140 --> 04:21:01.950
that you'd see within a
culture and then in my own life,

04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:04.820
it really pushed my
storytelling ability--

04:21:04.820 --> 04:21:08.460
excuse me, my storytelling
ability's further

04:21:08.460 --> 04:21:13.230
and that I was primarily
doing a lot of nonfiction.

04:21:13.230 --> 04:21:15.770
And, you know, working as
a journalist and then some

04:21:15.770 --> 04:21:18.930
of the fiction I did
was very off the time.

04:21:18.930 --> 04:21:22.030
And I felt like that
was limiting.

04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:26.230
Something about these narratives
of talking about love found,

04:21:26.230 --> 04:21:28.640
love lost in the present,

04:21:28.640 --> 04:21:30.940
this didn't really make
a lot of sense to me.

04:21:30.940 --> 04:21:34.190
And when I started thing
about Afrofuturism,

04:21:34.190 --> 04:21:37.750
I felt very compelled
to tell a story,

04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:41.870
the first one is the Rayla 2212
story about a woman who lived

04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:43.830
in the distant planet.

04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:48.140
She's third generation deep on
this planet and asked to kind

04:21:48.140 --> 04:21:49.440
of reconnect with Earth.

04:21:49.440 --> 04:21:52.360
And find these missing
astronauts who got stuck

04:21:52.360 --> 04:21:54.700
in space in time trying to
travel with their minds.

04:21:54.700 --> 04:21:58.740
And for me, it really became
a deconstruction around a lot

04:21:58.740 --> 04:22:02.860
of assumptions about identity
because there's the question

04:22:02.860 --> 04:22:04.840
of are you-- you know,

04:22:04.840 --> 04:22:07.700
what perspective am I
writing about her from?

04:22:07.700 --> 04:22:10.960
You know, I can't say that she
is, you know, in my perspective

04:22:10.960 --> 04:22:13.230
of being African-American
are being the black woman,

04:22:13.230 --> 04:22:16.030
I can't entirely
project that onto her

04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:20.320
because those identities shift
when you're on another planet,

04:22:20.320 --> 04:22:25.020
in another solar system and
or another galaxy, you know.

04:22:25.020 --> 04:22:28.570
What does it mean to be a woman
in another galaxy, you know?

04:22:28.570 --> 04:22:34.120
What does it mean to-- is she
thinking in the default terms

04:22:34.120 --> 04:22:36.600
of being American in
the way that I would.

04:22:36.600 --> 04:22:41.050
Probably not, but how do you
recognize some of these concepts

04:22:41.050 --> 04:22:42.750
and how they might
shape her perspective?

04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:45.600
And then that became really
interesting, but then that goes

04:22:45.600 --> 04:22:48.850
into the whole time travel
dynamic of seeing relationships

04:22:48.850 --> 04:22:51.340
between the future,
the past, the present.

04:22:51.340 --> 04:22:55.080
You know, these names, names
of schools, names of months

04:22:55.080 --> 04:22:56.430
of the year and so forth.

04:22:56.430 --> 04:23:01.140
So for me Afrofuturism really
opened me up to doing a lot

04:23:01.140 --> 04:23:04.110
of writing and story
telling that it--

04:23:04.110 --> 04:23:07.020
I could have deemed as
being very nontraditional

04:23:07.020 --> 04:23:09.310
and kind of stuck myself.

04:23:09.310 --> 04:23:12.810
And I think that's one of the
beauties of the term itself is

04:23:12.810 --> 04:23:16.370
that it helps people to feel
comfortable creating stories

04:23:16.370 --> 04:23:21.710
and creating works that they
didn't feel working were

04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:25.100
validated in very
specific spaces.

04:23:25.100 --> 04:23:29.050
And that helps to really
free the imagination

04:23:29.050 --> 04:23:31.810
or in some cases
decolonize the mind.

04:23:31.810 --> 04:23:35.520
And that's when you can
start talking about futures.

04:23:35.520 --> 04:23:38.490
And people feel comfortable
looking at their own lives

04:23:38.490 --> 04:23:41.040
and their own ideas and
saying, "Hey, you know I think

04:23:41.040 --> 04:23:44.700
that these are ways that we
can really build together."

04:23:44.700 --> 04:23:47.990
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: And
Enongo, maybe you can add

04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:50.600
to this as well because I know
that this has been something

04:23:50.600 --> 04:23:52.930
that you've actively
adapted as a lens

04:23:52.930 --> 04:23:56.660
for your music career after,
you know, being kind of lumped

04:23:56.660 --> 04:23:58.560
in with the nerdcore thing

04:23:58.560 --> 04:23:59.860
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasong: Yeah.

04:23:59.860 --> 04:24:03.320
So I reference video
games and cartoons a lot

04:24:03.320 --> 04:24:04.620
because that's the
stuff that I love.

04:24:04.620 --> 04:24:07.610
That's what I grew up with
and that shaped my world view.

04:24:07.610 --> 04:24:12.500
And so I found that as an emcee
who does that quite a bit,

04:24:12.500 --> 04:24:16.660
my work started to be attached
to the subgenre called nerdcore

04:24:16.660 --> 04:24:21.390
which is basically a lot of
white guys who can't rap.

04:24:21.390 --> 04:24:25.520
And they, you know, and they'll
kind of have their references

04:24:25.520 --> 04:24:27.810
to Star Wars and
whatever-- whatever else.

04:24:27.810 --> 04:24:31.320
But I was-- I think very
offended by the fact

04:24:31.320 --> 04:24:32.690
that I didn't get to
shape that narrative.

04:24:32.690 --> 04:24:34.940
But I saw this term and
started to be associated

04:24:34.940 --> 04:24:37.690
with me I didn't even
know where it came from,

04:24:37.690 --> 04:24:39.440
but I would see nerdcore
rapper Samus.

04:24:39.440 --> 04:24:40.740
There's nerdcore artist.

04:24:40.740 --> 04:24:42.950
And so I think, at first I tried
to wrestle with it and say,

04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:44.430
"OK, maybe I can adopt it.

04:24:44.430 --> 04:24:48.330
Maybe-- black perspective
that I'm trying to assert

04:24:48.330 --> 04:24:51.310
through my work, it's not
just that I love video games

04:24:51.310 --> 04:24:52.750
and it's not just
that I'm a black girl

04:24:52.750 --> 04:24:54.860
who loves videos games, I
have a particular perspective,

04:24:54.860 --> 04:24:58.630
and I think that Afrofuturism
as a term for thinking

04:24:58.630 --> 04:25:02.480
about like repurposing was like
a really interesting way for me

04:25:02.480 --> 04:25:05.260
to engage with the idea of
repurposing this character.

04:25:05.260 --> 04:25:09.410
This character who's a white
blonde lady and putting my face

04:25:09.410 --> 04:25:11.940
in that, you know,
cybernetic power suit.

04:25:11.940 --> 04:25:14.490
And all of the work that I ended
up doing, I mean I've have had

04:25:14.490 --> 04:25:17.130
so many folks who have come
up to me and said, "You know,

04:25:17.130 --> 04:25:18.730
I didn't know who
Mae Jemison was

04:25:18.730 --> 04:25:20.500
but I did know what Metroid was.

04:25:20.500 --> 04:25:23.570
And so I listen to your album
and now I'm following her

04:25:23.570 --> 04:25:25.570
and then now I think she's
amazing and vice versa.

04:25:25.570 --> 04:25:27.990
You know, folks who are
interested black feminist

04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:30.230
thought or who are
interested in engaging with,

04:25:30.230 --> 04:25:31.530
you know, the academy.

04:25:31.530 --> 04:25:34.530
Who don't care about video
games or cartoons but they're--

04:25:34.530 --> 04:25:39.490
my favorite story from
this is a woman in Ithaca

04:25:39.490 --> 04:25:41.300
and she started playing
the video game Metroid

04:25:41.300 --> 04:25:44.260
with her daughter after her
daughter started asking,

04:25:44.260 --> 04:25:45.560
who's Samus?

04:25:45.560 --> 04:25:47.040
Like I see this rapper
and she looks like me.

04:25:47.040 --> 04:25:49.090
And I want to know more
about this video game.

04:25:49.090 --> 04:25:50.830
So now, they've started to play

04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:53.710
with that the kind
realities of that universe.

04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:58.920
So I think that the term
as Ytasha was saying it,

04:25:58.920 --> 04:26:01.260
I find that it's not
restrictive in the ways

04:26:01.260 --> 04:26:05.330
that that nerdcore was
to me because built

04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:09.100
in to the understanding of it
is this idea on reprocessing

04:26:09.100 --> 04:26:11.850
or shape shifting or a kind
of movement that it's not sort

04:26:11.850 --> 04:26:14.490
of a fluid or not
sort of a static thing

04:26:14.490 --> 04:26:18.100
and that fluid it is a part
of kind of essentially working

04:26:18.100 --> 04:26:19.860
with an Afrofuture's frameworks.

04:26:19.860 --> 04:26:23.420
So it was-- it allowed me to
reject this whole other part

04:26:23.420 --> 04:26:25.750
of music that I did not
feel like I wasn't making.

04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:30.130
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: You know,
I want to return to as something

04:26:30.130 --> 04:26:32.650
that I think has a reason
in different ways and each

04:26:32.650 --> 04:26:35.170
of the panels today which
is the relationship of time.

04:26:35.170 --> 04:26:38.750
And I believe you brought it up
at the beginning of this panel

04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:41.570
that outside of, you know, to--

04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:44.250
let's remove the
position from nowhere

04:26:44.250 --> 04:26:48.710
and call it white
western futurism.

04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:51.040
It seems like in a
indigenous and Afrofuturism,

04:26:51.040 --> 04:26:53.920
there is a much more
nonlinear relationship to time

04:26:53.920 --> 04:26:57.110
and much more of a
relationship to both deep time

04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:59.320
and history and into the future.

04:26:59.320 --> 04:27:02.390
And I wonder if you can
speak to that in the light

04:27:02.390 --> 04:27:06.950
of how we talk about,
well, now is the moment

04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:08.690
that we must go to space.

04:27:08.690 --> 04:27:11.550
Now is the moment that
humans must live off world.

04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:16.180
How do you think those two
ideas interact with each other?

04:27:16.180 --> 04:27:17.480
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: That's it.

04:27:17.480 --> 04:27:24.000
Well it's fascinating
because you can be in--

04:27:24.000 --> 04:27:31.290
you can be very present
and still be connected

04:27:31.290 --> 04:27:34.330
to what we call a
future or past.

04:27:34.330 --> 04:27:37.000
And it's being so present

04:27:37.000 --> 04:27:40.900
that you can really feel
how they're all interweave

04:27:40.900 --> 04:27:45.750
or interwoven rather into a
way to really express and be.

04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:52.380
And to see that these actions
of now can impact the future

04:27:52.380 --> 04:27:53.920
and the past and I think that's

04:27:53.920 --> 04:27:55.680
where it gets really
interesting.

04:27:55.680 --> 04:27:58.810
So when we usually talk about
the feature this is linear

04:27:58.810 --> 04:28:02.120
like now is the time
to move forward, right?

04:28:02.120 --> 04:28:06.180
But any action that you take
now at least in this way we talk

04:28:06.180 --> 04:28:09.330
about time it can impact
the so called feature

04:28:09.330 --> 04:28:11.850
and it can impact
the so called past.

04:28:11.850 --> 04:28:16.610
You know, it can be a healing
process in both directions.

04:28:16.610 --> 04:28:20.710
And that's where it gets really
intriguing because there's a--

04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:24.970
there's just-- it's
a holistic recog--

04:28:24.970 --> 04:28:27.710
it's a holistic way
of recognizing

04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:32.380
that your actions always
have some sort of impact.

04:28:32.380 --> 04:28:35.300
And so then now is the time I
think it's really fascinating

04:28:35.300 --> 04:28:39.230
because you can look, you know,
back in linear past you can say,

04:28:39.230 --> 04:28:43.620
"Well, now is always
the time, wasn't it?"

04:28:43.620 --> 04:28:47.380
You know, often times I
hear people, you know,

04:28:47.380 --> 04:28:50.570
they'll describe, you
know, if you're talking

04:28:50.570 --> 04:28:52.200
about the antebellum
south, right,

04:28:52.200 --> 04:28:55.480
and they'll describe someone
who's very noble figure

04:28:55.480 --> 04:28:59.130
supposedly and that they may
have a lot of isms attached

04:28:59.130 --> 04:29:01.020
to their philosophy
and they'll say, "Oh,

04:29:01.020 --> 04:29:03.090
he was a man of his time."

04:29:03.090 --> 04:29:07.240
It's like, yeah, but you also
had people who were fighting

04:29:07.240 --> 04:29:10.730
against slavery, people
who were advocating

04:29:10.730 --> 04:29:12.910
to protect native communities.

04:29:12.910 --> 04:29:15.510
So, you know, this
whole retroactive man

04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:18.230
of its time thing or woman
of its time, it's really,

04:29:18.230 --> 04:29:20.910
really interesting and I'm
starting to hear people say

04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:23.320
that around times that
I've lived in, you know.

04:29:23.320 --> 04:29:26.790
It's like, well, wait
a second, you know.

04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:32.620
They'll say, "Oh, well,
you can't indict the people

04:29:32.620 --> 04:29:37.440
of the '80s because
of their kind

04:29:37.440 --> 04:29:41.250
of their perspective
on sexuality."

04:29:41.250 --> 04:29:44.890
OK. Where are we going
with this at some point?

04:29:44.890 --> 04:29:48.280
You know, is this just always
going to be the conversation

04:29:48.280 --> 04:29:51.640
where we don't acknowledge that
there were always a variety

04:29:51.640 --> 04:29:54.960
of voices in the so
called linear past.

04:29:54.960 --> 04:29:56.580
And that gets into something

04:29:56.580 --> 04:29:58.690
that our previous
panelist mentioned,

04:29:58.690 --> 04:30:00.500
the gentlemen over here.

04:30:00.500 --> 04:30:04.400
My apologies for not remembering
your name exactly, but--

04:30:04.400 --> 04:30:08.610
and that was this whole concept
of the narrative, you know,

04:30:08.610 --> 04:30:12.620
what is the narrative around
going to Mars, you know,

04:30:12.620 --> 04:30:15.750
because it's the dominant
narrative that we seem

04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:19.760
to remember sometimes almost
more than the actual actions

04:30:19.760 --> 04:30:24.570
of people in the so called past
that gets really fascinating.

04:30:24.570 --> 04:30:27.550
So now is the time, now
is always been the time

04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:29.530
to do any number of things.

04:30:29.530 --> 04:30:33.660
But the narratives we
associate with that

04:30:33.660 --> 04:30:35.420
and then the actions
people taking,

04:30:35.420 --> 04:30:37.700
why they take those actions?

04:30:37.700 --> 04:30:42.400
Is-- it says more
about our belief

04:30:42.400 --> 04:30:45.330
around agency in our lives.

04:30:45.330 --> 04:30:47.540
And that's why it's so great
to talk about the future

04:30:47.540 --> 04:30:51.140
and to talk about Afrofuturism
and indigenous featurism

04:30:51.140 --> 04:30:54.220
and other-- and bringing
people to the table

04:30:54.220 --> 04:30:57.070
or making them feel
comfortable about who they are

04:30:57.070 --> 04:31:02.800
so that they can have agency
to make the now moment of--

04:31:02.800 --> 04:31:06.790
be the now moment and
create these holistic spaces

04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:11.950
that help all of us.

04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:13.250
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
Excuse me.

04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:14.550
[Inaudible] here.

04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:15.850
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

04:31:15.850 --> 04:31:20.220
In terms of the narrative,
I think one of the reasons

04:31:20.220 --> 04:31:24.510
that I love being in the
art history department

04:31:24.510 --> 04:31:28.800
which is a little strange but
also perfect and I kind of go

04:31:28.800 --> 04:31:31.530
in between art history and
sculpture and, you know.

04:31:31.530 --> 04:31:35.210
But thinking a lot of the work
that I do with students is

04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:37.550
around decolonizing the canon.

04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:40.360
And so thinking about
going back to the story,

04:31:40.360 --> 04:31:41.660
what are the narratives.

04:31:41.660 --> 04:31:45.030
That is a kind of
active reclamation

04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:50.140
that for me is I believe a kind
of time travel and a shifting

04:31:50.140 --> 04:31:52.860
because we are reframing
the narrative,

04:31:52.860 --> 04:31:55.690
we're reframing how
we see the center.

04:31:55.690 --> 04:31:59.280
And a lot of that is through the
action of students themselves.

04:31:59.280 --> 04:32:00.780
You know, we do projects
that just

04:32:00.780 --> 04:32:02.610
with the grad students
this summer.

04:32:02.610 --> 04:32:08.270
The final offering that we gave
to the other low rez students

04:32:08.270 --> 04:32:13.530
and to the library is who are
very amazing and receptive.

04:32:13.530 --> 04:32:16.440
Basically out of the 30 students

04:32:16.440 --> 04:32:21.670
in the class everyone brought
an artist that they felt needed

04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:23.420
to be included in the canon.

04:32:23.420 --> 04:32:26.570
We also unpack people
to find how, you know,

04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:28.620
how are you defining the canon

04:32:28.620 --> 04:32:33.180
and then created basically a
sheet with images and names

04:32:33.180 --> 04:32:36.590
and titles of books to be
given to the library to order,

04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:38.710
but just, you know,
small actions

04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:42.000
like that actually are not small
but thinking about this idea

04:32:42.000 --> 04:32:43.640
of a kind of a healing
of the past

04:32:43.640 --> 04:32:46.800
as you were mentioning
Ytasha, which is why I also go

04:32:46.800 --> 04:32:49.870
so much back to the
black guards movement

04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:51.300
in this idea of an action.

04:32:51.300 --> 04:32:54.240
What are the actions
that we're taking?

04:32:54.240 --> 04:32:58.240
I look also to Rasheedah
Phillips and Moor Mother

04:32:58.240 --> 04:33:01.540
and Philly, North Philly
with Black Quantum Futurism

04:33:01.540 --> 04:33:05.580
and not only with their
community future's lab

04:33:05.580 --> 04:33:10.140
that they've setup, which is
basically and now has been,

04:33:10.140 --> 04:33:11.690
you know, the work
that's come from that.

04:33:11.690 --> 04:33:15.730
It's being shown at, you
know, museums and everything.

04:33:15.730 --> 04:33:19.280
And so there's that sense of
agency that people have in terms

04:33:19.280 --> 04:33:20.580
of wait a minute,

04:33:20.580 --> 04:33:23.010
our neighborhood is
being rapidly gentrified.

04:33:23.010 --> 04:33:24.310
What can we do?

04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:28.120
And setting up almost like sun
runs bases the place, you know,

04:33:28.120 --> 04:33:31.020
that remember Spaceways
Incorporated that sort

04:33:31.020 --> 04:33:36.200
of storefront and having the
storefront and transforming it

04:33:36.200 --> 04:33:37.500
and saying, "Wait a minute.

04:33:37.500 --> 04:33:39.330
We can like claim."

04:33:39.330 --> 04:33:42.470
I also love-- I had the
fortune to experience one

04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:46.520
of Rasheedah's time travel
exercises that she does

04:33:46.520 --> 04:33:50.720
where she takes you through
the steps of imagining,

04:33:50.720 --> 04:33:55.390
taking your something from
the past physically, you know,

04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:57.320
just through her
instruction locating it

04:33:57.320 --> 04:34:01.030
in a different place, sending it
back, something from the future,

04:34:01.030 --> 04:34:04.200
putting it in the past and
through that sort of gesture

04:34:04.200 --> 04:34:08.330
of that exercise, what
was in the past and what's

04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:11.740
in the future-- it all of a
sudden it starts to shift.

04:34:11.740 --> 04:34:14.630
And your relationship
to it starts to shift.

04:34:14.630 --> 04:34:18.000
And the power that things
have start to shift.

04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:20.020
So even for instance
with the performance

04:34:20.020 --> 04:34:22.850
that I'll be doing
later, I was imagining it

04:34:22.850 --> 04:34:24.900
as having already occurred then

04:34:24.900 --> 04:34:26.770
and it's also something
that runners do.

04:34:26.770 --> 04:34:29.450
You know, in sports,
you know, you imagine--

04:34:29.450 --> 04:34:32.170
and this is related but,
you know, somewhat different

04:34:32.170 --> 04:34:37.490
but thinking about how we, where
we place information in our mind

04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:41.440
and in our energy field and
Wendy Walters in speaking

04:34:41.440 --> 04:34:44.290
about electronic
science in Detroit,

04:34:44.290 --> 04:34:47.390
city of past, present, future.

04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:50.400
She talks about this in
relationship to the creation

04:34:50.400 --> 04:34:55.090
of techno music and
traveling the digital pathways

04:34:55.090 --> 04:34:59.640
and how Detroit is sort
of situated, you know,

04:34:59.640 --> 04:35:03.990
at the simultaneously
in all of these moments

04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:08.690
and resisting a particular
location and time is nonlinear.

04:35:08.690 --> 04:35:11.540
And so there's so much in that
that I find very inspiring

04:35:11.540 --> 04:35:14.350
as to thinking about how
do we understand now.

04:35:14.350 --> 04:35:16.880
In Rasheedah's Black
Quantum Futurism,

04:35:16.880 --> 04:35:22.920
she posits that now is only
ever about three seconds.

04:35:22.920 --> 04:35:25.170
I mean there's much more to
it and much more in-depth,

04:35:25.170 --> 04:35:28.390
you know, which is
genius, but, you know,

04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:32.060
if we think about what's
now, I mean now is--

04:35:32.060 --> 04:35:34.670
it's already gone before you
can even say the word now.

04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:36.890
So things like that,
I like to just kind

04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:38.880
of play with that in my mind.

04:35:38.880 --> 04:35:42.070
I'm not a scientist but, yeah,

04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:43.440
that kind of stuff
gets me going.

04:35:43.440 --> 04:35:46.130
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
And just quickly to jump

04:35:46.130 --> 04:35:48.290
on some names that
were mentioned.

04:35:48.290 --> 04:35:50.660
So Moor Mother is
absolutely incredible.

04:35:50.660 --> 04:35:54.890
She-- I don't want to say
just musician because she's

04:35:54.890 --> 04:35:58.490
so much more than that
as M-O-O-R Mother.

04:35:58.490 --> 04:36:02.220
And one of the things that she
says and some of her experiences

04:36:02.220 --> 04:36:05.210
and I think this is drawing on
summer from sunrise that the end

04:36:05.210 --> 04:36:07.700
of the world has already
happened that we are

04:36:07.700 --> 04:36:11.510
in the post apocalypse--
post-apocalyptic times.

04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:13.700
And I think it's a really
interesting way to think

04:36:13.700 --> 04:36:15.980
about our existence because
on the one hand, you know,

04:36:15.980 --> 04:36:20.010
you could sort of frame it
through this sort of perspective

04:36:20.010 --> 04:36:22.120
where it's gloom and doom
but I think in other ways

04:36:22.120 --> 04:36:24.990
that invites us to do the
stuff that we would do

04:36:24.990 --> 04:36:28.100
in the post-apocalyptic time,
right, to kind of come together

04:36:28.100 --> 04:36:31.080
to figure out new
possibilities, to repurpose

04:36:31.080 --> 04:36:35.570
and to really see this as an
opportunity to reshape some

04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:36.870
of the existence of power

04:36:36.870 --> 04:36:39.020
that existed before
the apocalypse happen.

04:36:39.020 --> 04:36:41.960
So, I think I always love
coming back to this idea

04:36:41.960 --> 04:36:44.510
that the world has
already ended.

04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:47.920
&gt;&gt; Willi Lemper: And
relating to a lot

04:36:47.920 --> 04:36:51.100
of these topics including
the power of a term

04:36:51.100 --> 04:36:53.780
or its limitations, I
think indigenous futures

04:36:53.780 --> 04:36:56.240
since had that impact as well.

04:36:56.240 --> 04:37:00.030
It was developed by someone
Anishinaabe scholar named Grace

04:37:00.030 --> 04:37:02.060
Dillon who's at Portland
State University.

04:37:02.060 --> 04:37:05.170
She has this great book
called "Walking the Clouds."

04:37:05.170 --> 04:37:07.280
And what she essentially
did is take all this work

04:37:07.280 --> 04:37:10.370
that was indigenous futurist
and put it into conversation

04:37:10.370 --> 04:37:12.740
and theorized it and bring it
together around a certain issue

04:37:12.740 --> 04:37:15.540
so that people were part
of the conversation.

04:37:15.540 --> 04:37:19.200
It wasn't fringe,
something science fiction.

04:37:19.200 --> 04:37:22.340
And one of the themes that
she develops is this idea

04:37:22.340 --> 04:37:27.380
of slipstream which is this way
of thinking about how time works

04:37:27.380 --> 04:37:30.260
that strikes this
balance of honoring

04:37:30.260 --> 04:37:34.520
that time works differently in
a lot of indigenous societies

04:37:34.520 --> 04:37:38.840
but not uttering it in a
way that depoliticizes it

04:37:38.840 --> 04:37:42.140
which could be difficult
balance.

04:37:42.140 --> 04:37:46.420
Another thing that she talks
about is the native apocalypse

04:37:46.420 --> 04:37:50.530
and she says this powerful thing
in the intro that, you know,

04:37:50.530 --> 04:37:52.660
if contemplated seriously,

04:37:52.660 --> 04:37:55.450
the native apocalypse
has already happened.

04:37:55.450 --> 04:37:59.420
But it's a very nuance and
thoughtful discussion about--

04:37:59.420 --> 04:38:00.720
also how there's a difference

04:38:00.720 --> 04:38:03.050
between post-apocalyptic
and dystopian.

04:38:03.050 --> 04:38:05.000
All right, dystopian
is an end point.

04:38:05.000 --> 04:38:07.960
Post-apocalyptic is
a beginning point.

04:38:07.960 --> 04:38:11.170
Since that have kind of
considering through health stats

04:38:11.170 --> 04:38:14.300
and everything is equal, if
you start from a point of view

04:38:14.300 --> 04:38:15.990
in which communities are

04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:19.450
in a post apocalyptic
situation then it's like, well,

04:38:19.450 --> 04:38:23.150
communities are doing
really well in that way

04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:26.670
of changing the frame and
comparing them in all sorts

04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:28.860
of ways that stops making sense.

04:38:28.860 --> 04:38:32.820
And there's just a lot of
great, I think films coming back

04:38:32.820 --> 04:38:35.390
to the creative side of things
that they're doing this.

04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:38.970
Most related perhaps to this
discussion is the 6th World

04:38:38.970 --> 04:38:41.160
by Nanobah Becker who's Navajo.

04:38:41.160 --> 04:38:44.060
And you see some stills
on floating through.

04:38:44.060 --> 04:38:45.850
And I really recommend watching.

04:38:45.850 --> 04:38:48.480
It's called the 6th World,
it's streaming online.

04:38:48.480 --> 04:38:51.430
But long story short, it
centers the Navajo nation

04:38:51.430 --> 04:38:58.480
as the leading funder in
organizing kind of organization

04:38:58.480 --> 04:39:01.130
that is pushing for
this mission to Mars.

04:39:01.130 --> 04:39:06.470
And it stars scientist who is
Navajo woman who's an astronaut

04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:11.070
and the lead scientist and sort
to causing the question GMO

04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:18.020
and the way that what Mars
is becomes very different.

04:39:18.020 --> 04:39:25.030
If it's into the cosmology
of Navajo in broad strokes

04:39:25.030 --> 04:39:30.000
around the 6th World is
not just in an earth rock.

04:39:30.000 --> 04:39:33.380
And there's great
work that's been done

04:39:33.380 --> 04:39:37.120
on understanding
perspectives on the moon landing

04:39:37.120 --> 04:39:38.420
from indigenous communities

04:39:38.420 --> 04:39:42.050
where the moon is not just
some an earth rock either,

04:39:42.050 --> 04:39:45.380
it's a sacred space for a lot of
people in going there trampling

04:39:45.380 --> 04:39:47.970
on it, driving around,
taking things from it.

04:39:47.970 --> 04:39:51.160
For a lot of people is a
violation of something.

04:39:51.160 --> 04:39:54.100
And that's often, you know,
we had discussions about sort

04:39:54.100 --> 04:39:58.010
of personhood for
places and these kind

04:39:58.010 --> 04:40:01.670
of things are not even
in the discussion.

04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:02.970
And the other piece I wanted

04:40:02.970 --> 04:40:04.840
to mention very briefly
is Lisa Jackson.

04:40:04.840 --> 04:40:06.870
She has this short
called "The Visit"

04:40:06.870 --> 04:40:11.130
and it involves extraterrestrial
space saucer visiting earth.

04:40:11.130 --> 04:40:14.800
And they don't go to a
Kansas farm, they don't go

04:40:14.800 --> 04:40:19.920
to Washington D.C., they go
to a native reserve in Canada.

04:40:19.920 --> 04:40:22.340
And there's not a colonial
interaction and it's hard

04:40:22.340 --> 04:40:25.530
to think of extraterrestrial,
any narratives

04:40:25.530 --> 04:40:28.330
that don't have some sort
of colonial engagement.

04:40:28.330 --> 04:40:32.880
It's an engagement that's
spiritual, it's part of the sort

04:40:32.880 --> 04:40:36.890
of the coyote sign in the
sky and it's constellation.

04:40:36.890 --> 04:40:38.440
It's something else,
it's the sort

04:40:38.440 --> 04:40:41.400
of otherwise you've mentioned
and I think that's the power

04:40:41.400 --> 04:40:43.370
of a lot of the stuff
that it involves things

04:40:43.370 --> 04:40:47.510
that are not already
known sort of at the edge

04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:51.260
of what could can be imagined
which makes some people

04:40:51.260 --> 04:40:54.430
or some people have challenged
with because it's a ephemeral

04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:58.050
in a way but I think it's very
practical and politically,

04:40:58.050 --> 04:41:02.320
you know, potent especially
to creative endeavors.

04:41:02.320 --> 04:41:05.240
And that's where the edge of
what can be imagined comes

04:41:05.240 --> 04:41:09.580
into being even more so
than academic settings.

04:41:09.580 --> 04:41:10.880
Yeah.

04:41:10.880 --> 04:41:13.070
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz: So I
want to sure that we have time

04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:16.170
for audience questions but
first let's thank our panel.

04:41:16.170 --> 04:41:17.470
[ Applause ]

04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:25.270
And as before, we
have mic runners.

04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:33.530
So just raise your hand if
you'd like to ask a question.

04:41:34.600 --> 04:41:38.760
&gt;&gt; Chanda Prescod-Weinstein:
So, I guess I'm thinking

04:41:38.760 --> 04:41:41.230
about the discussion that we
had during the first panel

04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:44.260
about modernity and who's
allowed to be modern

04:41:44.260 --> 04:41:49.150
in this conversation
and Afrofuturisms.

04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:53.520
So I'd like to say isms because
I think I want to avoid the idea

04:41:53.520 --> 04:41:57.760
that we all have the same
sort of vision of the future.

04:41:57.760 --> 04:42:01.020
And so one of the things
that I think concerns me

04:42:01.020 --> 04:42:02.320
and I also think came

04:42:02.320 --> 04:42:04.990
out of Professor Child's
comments this morning is the

04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:06.430
idea that cultures--

04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:11.400
some cultures are forced into
a positionality of staticness.

04:42:11.400 --> 04:42:14.750
And so the moon will
always be a sacred place

04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:19.460
that we can never visit and
this static idea is then held

04:42:19.460 --> 04:42:23.390
as an excuse for
colonial activities.

04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:27.210
And so, I was kind of wondering
about how you all kind of think

04:42:27.210 --> 04:42:32.540
about the idea of indigeneity
as static and Afrofuturisms

04:42:32.540 --> 04:42:36.820
and indigenous futurisms
as kind of a way

04:42:36.820 --> 04:42:41.220
around that narrative about us.

04:42:44.350 --> 04:42:45.650
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
Thank you.

04:42:45.650 --> 04:42:46.950
I love that.

04:42:46.950 --> 04:42:50.390
I think that's why I
keep coming back to--

04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:55.510
I feel like my rule as
educator and in the classroom

04:42:55.510 --> 04:42:59.860
or in creating projects,
I guess, with students

04:42:59.860 --> 04:43:03.600
to explore their own
relationships, you know,

04:43:03.600 --> 04:43:07.460
so there's this kind of--
to keep that dynamic aspect

04:43:07.460 --> 04:43:11.630
and incorporating especially
for people who may not be--

04:43:11.630 --> 04:43:14.400
you know I don't teach in
the performance departments.

04:43:14.400 --> 04:43:16.000
So most of the people I get--

04:43:16.000 --> 04:43:18.460
you know, they might
becoming from, you know,

04:43:18.460 --> 04:43:20.920
who knows what department.

04:43:20.920 --> 04:43:29.150
And so to incorporate ritual or
preformative or-- yeah, that--

04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:31.550
because that's big issue,
you know, I teach African art

04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:34.420
as well and so that's
always this idea of--

04:43:34.420 --> 04:43:37.580
yes there's this static
pass that we're looking

04:43:37.580 --> 04:43:41.060
at versus understanding
it, the dynamism.

04:43:41.060 --> 04:43:47.120
So, I think for me and
it sort of in the action

04:43:47.120 --> 04:43:52.480
in the engagement and seeing
Afrofuturism as been and stating

04:43:52.480 --> 04:43:54.520
that it is a space
of shape shifting.

04:43:54.520 --> 04:43:56.770
We're really, really
clear about that.

04:43:56.770 --> 04:44:00.000
There has a lot of portals
and an entry points.

04:44:00.000 --> 04:44:03.710
That's that kind of how
I sort of deal with that.

04:44:03.710 --> 04:44:08.750
So a little more
general but yeah.

04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:12.870
&gt;&gt; Willi Lemper: Very
briefly, I think with a lot

04:44:12.870 --> 04:44:16.810
of indigenous futurist creative
filmmakers and writers talk

04:44:16.810 --> 04:44:20.070
about is that asserting
something in the future

04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:22.760
which is often silence is a way
of breaking out of this sort

04:44:22.760 --> 04:44:29.490
of endless binaries around
authenticity versus modernity

04:44:29.490 --> 04:44:32.800
that become-- unless they
reinscribe and they're so baked

04:44:32.800 --> 04:44:36.510
into the entire settler
colonial project and language.

04:44:36.510 --> 04:44:40.840
And so the future-- by imagining
and envisioning the future

04:44:40.840 --> 04:44:43.560
like in the 6th World,
it's envisioning a future

04:44:43.560 --> 04:44:47.560
that it's very Navajo and
it's very technological

04:44:47.560 --> 04:44:49.850
and like the white
people have to be saved.

04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:54.350
And their science is the one
that has limitations and it's--

04:44:54.350 --> 04:45:00.600
you know, the Navajo corn that
it is what works in the end.

04:45:00.600 --> 04:45:03.910
So, I think it's-- an
imaginative space that can

04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:06.420
to some extent break
out of things

04:45:06.420 --> 04:45:07.720
and Grace Dillon talks a lot

04:45:07.720 --> 04:45:10.030
about how the pluralist
is essential.

04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:15.050
The futurisms is important for
the reasons that you mentioned.

04:45:15.050 --> 04:45:17.590
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo:
I'm so sorry.

04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:20.490
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack:
No, go ahead.

04:45:20.490 --> 04:45:24.110
&gt;&gt; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo: So I
thinking in a teaching context,

04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:25.750
one of the questions--

04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:27.450
one of the things that
I always push back

04:45:27.450 --> 04:45:30.440
against with my students is
when we talk about progress.

04:45:30.440 --> 04:45:35.180
Always asking progress for
whom like forcing them to stick

04:45:35.180 --> 04:45:38.530
that in there because it
starts to dislodge all

04:45:38.530 --> 04:45:39.910
of these assumptions, I think,

04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:42.060
for them about exactly
what you're speaking

04:45:42.060 --> 04:45:43.830
about these ideas about
what modernity looks like

04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:46.640
or like I was saying earlier
what technology looks like,

04:45:46.640 --> 04:45:49.390
what technology means,
what science means.

04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:51.230
So always sticking
for whom, I think,

04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:53.090
at the end of their
statement is a way

04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:55.800
that I've been able
to trouble that.

04:45:55.800 --> 04:45:59.510
And then on my personal
work, I've started thinking

04:45:59.510 --> 04:46:04.890
about how I can cooperate ideas
around sort of cyborg feminism

04:46:04.890 --> 04:46:09.330
or the idea of sitting
in the discomfort

04:46:09.330 --> 04:46:12.970
between all these different
aspects of ourselves and knowing

04:46:12.970 --> 04:46:15.880
that those things can't be
reconciled and trying to figure

04:46:15.880 --> 04:46:19.620
out how to speak
to parts of myself

04:46:19.620 --> 04:46:23.700
that I'll later contradicts
and in other works and feeling

04:46:23.700 --> 04:46:26.300
like that's a part of
the work and that helps

04:46:26.300 --> 04:46:30.380
to reject this sort of static
ideas of what, you know,

04:46:30.380 --> 04:46:34.290
conscious rap looks
like or what, you know,

04:46:34.290 --> 04:46:38.380
rap from a black women
looks like or sounds like.

04:46:38.380 --> 04:46:41.750
And like always trying to
challenge myself in that regard

04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:43.960
but that's an awesome question,
something to think about.

04:46:43.960 --> 04:46:49.510
&gt;&gt; Ytasha L. Womack: Oh,
I was just going to note

04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:56.070
that even the way we talk about
the past, there's an assumption

04:46:56.070 --> 04:47:01.040
around technologies,
there's an assumption

04:47:01.040 --> 04:47:06.150
around how people function,
how they lived their lives.

04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:12.090
I mean so many records from so
many societies no longer exist.

04:47:12.090 --> 04:47:16.770
And many of the records that
do exist we're trying to put

04:47:16.770 --> 04:47:21.050
in a framework of who we think
they should have been as opposed

04:47:21.050 --> 04:47:22.780
to who they actually were.

04:47:22.780 --> 04:47:26.130
So we read all the time
about objects that are found

04:47:26.130 --> 04:47:27.580
and people don't know
what it is and they say

04:47:27.580 --> 04:47:30.550
"Oh must be a religious
symbol," you know,

04:47:30.550 --> 04:47:34.470
so if someone found a television
set, you know, 10,000 years

04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:37.240
from now and say "Oh it must
have been a religious symbol.

04:47:37.240 --> 04:47:38.540
Look at these pictures.

04:47:38.540 --> 04:47:40.130
They're all staring at it."

04:47:40.130 --> 04:47:44.960
Right? How to you explain
what a television was

04:47:44.960 --> 04:47:47.360
and the electricity and
plugging it into a wall

04:47:47.360 --> 04:47:50.000
of those systems don't
exist in the same ways.

04:47:50.000 --> 04:47:54.620
So, so I just always
question, you know,

04:47:54.620 --> 04:47:59.660
how we talk about the past
particularly because of some

04:47:59.660 --> 04:48:01.470
of the records that
we're working with

04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:04.140
and because we don't
always value oral histories

04:48:04.140 --> 04:48:06.370
in the same way.

04:48:06.370 --> 04:48:08.510
And, you know, the arguments

04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:10.730
that one can get
into about that.

04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:14.490
And when you start talking
about that kind of a past

04:48:14.490 --> 04:48:17.790
where there was more
technological advancement,

04:48:17.790 --> 04:48:20.930
then we really understand
even if it was just sometimes

04:48:20.930 --> 04:48:25.890
of how societies work that
sometimes mirrors the same sort

04:48:25.890 --> 04:48:28.660
of futures, we say that
we're working towards.

04:48:28.660 --> 04:48:32.200
And that's where the
storytelling gets fun

04:48:32.200 --> 04:48:35.930
because you can leap over
these traumatic moments

04:48:35.930 --> 04:48:40.710
and in cultural paradigms
and you can, in some ways,

04:48:40.710 --> 04:48:44.720
ague that you're intuitively
trying to tap into the ideas

04:48:44.720 --> 04:48:47.060
of what this other past
could be and you're

04:48:47.060 --> 04:48:49.320
at least putting
it into a story.

04:48:49.320 --> 04:48:52.590
And the fact that that's
challenge sometimes I think says

04:48:52.590 --> 04:48:57.970
a lot about what it
means to tell a story

04:48:57.970 --> 04:49:02.410
and how stories really
function for human beings

04:49:02.410 --> 04:49:06.210
and for our ideas of--
for how ideas are spread

04:49:06.210 --> 04:49:09.030
or what we think is
valuable to preserve.

04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:11.320
&gt;&gt; D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem:
On that note,

04:49:11.320 --> 04:49:15.320
I wanted to just quickly add
if I might about Malidoma

04:49:15.320 --> 04:49:18.110
in his introduction to
"Of Water and the Spirit".

04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:21.710
He actually talks about
introducing the elders

04:49:21.710 --> 04:49:25.330
in the village and
at Dagara in Dano

04:49:25.330 --> 04:49:27.980
where he is from to Star Trek.

04:49:27.980 --> 04:49:31.200
He was doing this as a kind of
an experiment just to understand

04:49:31.200 --> 04:49:36.200
because the Dagara people
don't have a word for fiction.

04:49:36.200 --> 04:49:37.940
They only have a
word "Yielbongura"

04:49:37.940 --> 04:49:41.270
which means the thing
that knowledge can't eat.

04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:44.070
So, if you know-- And again
this is a book that I share

04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:47.040
with every student, every person
that I-- because, you know,

04:49:47.040 --> 04:49:50.740
I think there's so much in
that, you know to shifting.

04:49:50.740 --> 04:49:53.970
And so, he showed them an
episode and the elders looked

04:49:53.970 --> 04:49:56.440
at that and they
said "Well, Spock,"

04:49:56.440 --> 04:50:01.160
is "kontombili" he's just too
tall but he's at, you know,

04:50:01.160 --> 04:50:02.580
the seventh dimension
kontombili.

04:50:02.580 --> 04:50:06.310
So they recognized, you
know, Spock as being someone

04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:11.200
who is part of their, you know,
world view and but then also

04:50:11.200 --> 04:50:14.420
with the teleportation
they thought

04:50:14.420 --> 04:50:19.760
that the Star Trek episode
was from a people in the past

04:50:19.760 --> 04:50:22.940
because they looked and they
said, "We do this without all

04:50:22.940 --> 04:50:25.410
of those [inaudible]"
then we don't need all

04:50:25.410 --> 04:50:28.240
that junk and it's so slow.

04:50:28.240 --> 04:50:30.030
You know, what is all of these?

04:50:30.030 --> 04:50:35.480
So in their eyes this was the
Star Trek as a future vision

04:50:35.480 --> 04:50:42.420
from the West was a vision
of past clanky process as far

04:50:42.420 --> 04:50:43.850
as they were concerned.

04:50:43.850 --> 04:50:46.160
And so stories like, you know,

04:50:46.160 --> 04:50:48.610
as far as storytelling
that's the kind of thing

04:50:48.610 --> 04:50:52.220
that I get really excited
about sharing and because it,

04:50:52.220 --> 04:50:56.570
you know, that kind of forced
shift around how do you--

04:50:56.570 --> 04:51:00.190
if people thinking about Africa
and it was idea of construction

04:51:00.190 --> 04:51:03.390
of Africa as a background
backward,

04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:08.630
but then we actually have ways
and methods and ideas that are

04:51:08.630 --> 04:51:12.950
so far beyond the clunkiness
of the West's future vision.

04:51:12.950 --> 04:51:15.420
&gt;&gt; Lucianne Walkowicz:
All right.

04:51:15.420 --> 04:51:19.800
We have now a longer break and
there will be a performance

04:51:19.800 --> 04:51:21.830
by D. Denenge immediately
following.

04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:23.770
So please stick around.

04:51:23.770 --> 04:51:26.110
There's refreshments
in the back.

04:51:26.110 --> 04:52:01.920
And let us thank our
wonderful panelist again.

04:52:01.920 --> 05:21:46.280
