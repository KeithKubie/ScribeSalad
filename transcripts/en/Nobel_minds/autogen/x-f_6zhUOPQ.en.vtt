one such simplification which has been

one such simplification which has been
very important in economics is the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790
very important in economics is the
 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.270
very important in economics is the
assumption that humans behave in a fully

assumption that humans behave in a fully
 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.640

from rationality are important enough

laureates who are awarded this year and
 

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.190
laureates who are awarded this year and
one of those last year and so forth but

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200
one of those last year and so forth but
 

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.520
one of those last year and so forth but
we are disappointed looking at in a

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:01.530
we are disappointed looking at in a
 

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.650
we are disappointed looking at in a
larger perspective that there aren't

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:03.660
larger perspective that there aren't
 

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.820

more women who have been awarded part of
 

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.310
more women who have been awarded part of
it is of course that we go back in time

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320
it is of course that we go back in time
 

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.910
it is of course that we go back in time
to identify the discoveries you we have

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:13.920
to identify the discoveries you we have
 

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.980
to identify the discoveries you we have
to wait until they have been verified

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:15.990
to wait until they have been verified
 

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.290
to wait until they have been verified
and validated before we can award the

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:18.300
and validated before we can award the
 

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.980
and validated before we can award the
prize and they were an even a larger

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:21.990
prize and they were an even a larger
 

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.380
prize and they were an even a larger
bias against women in terms of fewer

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:24.390
bias against women in terms of fewer

female scientists if you go back 20 or

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:27.270
female scientists if you go back 20 or
 

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.250
female scientists if you go back 20 or
30 years but I'm not sure that's the

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260
30 years but I'm not sure that's the
 

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.700
30 years but I'm not sure that's the
entire explanation we have taken

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.710
entire explanation we have taken
 

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.230
entire explanation we have taken
measures we and the other prize-awarding

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240
measures we and the other prize-awarding
 

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.000
measures we and the other prize-awarding
institutions if you look at the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.010
institutions if you look at the
 

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.720
institutions if you look at the
committee is now the Nobel committees

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:43.730
committee is now the Nobel committees
 

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:48.740
committee is now the Nobel committees
there are women chairing actually three

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:48.750
there are women chairing actually three
 

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.680
there are women chairing actually three
of the six committees there are female

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:53.690
of the six committees there are female
 

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.780
of the six committees there are female
scientists or equivalent on all the

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:56.790
scientists or equivalent on all the
 

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:03.740
scientists or equivalent on all the
committees so I don't I don't think

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:03.750
committees so I don't I don't think
 

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.230

there is an as any substantial male
chauvinist bias in the committees and we

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080
chauvinist bias in the committees and we
 

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.240
chauvinist bias in the committees and we
are also the committees have invited

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.250
are also the committees have invited
 

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.150

the prize
to a greater extent but it sorted this

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460
to a greater extent but it sorted this
 

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.370
to a greater extent but it sorted this
year because we are concerned that we

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380
year because we are concerned that we
 

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.270
year because we are concerned that we
may not get enough nominations of female

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:31.280
may not get enough nominations of female
 

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.350
may not get enough nominations of female
scientists we don't this we don't

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360

nominate ourselves we invite nominations
from the scientific community in the

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:41.850
from the scientific community in the
 

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:47.840
from the scientific community in the
world and I suspect that there are many

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:47.850
world and I suspect that there are many
 

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.500
world and I suspect that there are many
more women who are deserving to be

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:50.510
more women who are deserving to be
 

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.390
more women who are deserving to be
considered for the prize and therefore

what you said I think there are two
 

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.070
what you said I think there are two
important points one is that we are

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080
important points one is that we are
 

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.740
important points one is that we are
indeed awarding research that where the

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:00.750
indeed awarding research that where the
 

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.900
indeed awarding research that where the
discoveries were made let's say in the

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:02.910
discoveries were made let's say in the
 

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.170
discoveries were made let's say in the
70s 80s maybe early 90s during a time

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:06.180
70s 80s maybe early 90s during a time
 

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.250
70s 80s maybe early 90s during a time
when when we had much more of a gender

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260
when when we had much more of a gender
 

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.040

bias and economics as well as in other

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.050
bias and economics as well as in other
 

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.170
bias and economics as well as in other
many other sciences which basically

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:15.180
many other sciences which basically
 

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.380
many other sciences which basically
means that as time goes by the fraction

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:18.390
means that as time goes by the fraction
 

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.870

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880
of female or it's will increase I'm
 

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.730
of female or it's will increase I'm
certain of that and you can look at some

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740
certain of that and you can look at some
 

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.310
certain of that and you can look at some
of the prices that are given to more to

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320
of the prices that are given to more to
 

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.530
of the prices that are given to more to
younger economists you know some of the

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:27.540
younger economists you know some of the

younger economists you know some of the
top prices there the gender distribution

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:29.310
top prices there the gender distribution
 

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.690
top prices there the gender distribution
is much more even and the second thing

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700
is much more even and the second thing
 

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.820
is much more even and the second thing
is that that said this is something that

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:34.830
is that that said this is something that
 

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.410

suddenly rises they think that there is

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:31.100
suddenly rises they think that there is
 

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.610
suddenly rises they think that there is
a fair price for a product and even if

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:33.620
a fair price for a product and even if
 

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.570
a fair price for a product and even if
the company could sell the the product

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:37.580
the company could sell the the product
 

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.520
the company could sell the the product
at the higher price they don't think I

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:39.530
at the higher price they don't think I
 

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.710
at the higher price they don't think I
should so it's not a fair price that's

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720
should so it's not a fair price that's
 

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:48.070

and economic systems we all only think

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:49.820
and economic systems we all only think
 

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.880
and economic systems we all only think
about our own self-interest of course

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:51.890
about our own self-interest of course
 

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.620

you can say that our being fair being

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:53.630
you can say that our being fair being
