00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.150
Let us try to do a problem together on incremental concept learning.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.150
I'm going to give you a series of examples, and we will see what kind of

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.190
concept one can learn from it. I'll not tell you what the concept really is, for

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.730
the time being I'm just going to call it foo. Here is the first example.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.520
In this first example, there are four bricks. A brick at the bottom,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.040
horizontal brick at the bottom, or horizontal brick at the top. And two vertical

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.310
bricks on the side. Here is a second example. And this time I'll tell you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.980
that this particular example is not a positive instance of the concept foo.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.930
Once again, we have four bricks, a brick at the bottom, a brick at the top, and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.110
two bricks on the side. This time the two bricks aren't touching each other.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.118
Here's a third example of the concept foo. This is a positive example.

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:54.230
This is a foo. Again we have four blocks. This time they are two bricks,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.580
and instead of having two bricks, vertical bricks, we have two cylinders.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.379
They are not touching each other. So I showed you three examples of the concept

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.310
foo. And I'm sure, you learned some concept definition out of it.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.275
Now I'm going to show you another example and ask you,

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:20.510
does this example fit your current definition of concept foo, what do you think?
