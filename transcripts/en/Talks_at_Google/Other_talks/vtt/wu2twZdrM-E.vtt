00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:05.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
SPEAKER 1: So it's my pleasure
to introduce Professor Andy

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.820
Andres, who is a Senior
Lecturer of Natural Sciences

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.480
and Mathematics at
Boston University.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.350
He's taught a very
successful MOOC,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.130
online course, Sabermetrics
101: an Introduction

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.161
to Baseball Analytics, to
about 40,000 students on EdX.

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.910
He's formerly the lead
instructor and head

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.810
coach of the MIT Science
of Baseball Program,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.110
and is chairman of the
Educational Resources

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.160
Committee for the Society of
American Baseball Research.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.180
He's a data caster for
MLB.com at Fenway Park.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.450
He scored game 6 of
the 2013 World Series.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.640
And has a PhD in nutritional
biochemistry and physiology

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.140
from Tufts University.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.780
So apart from the sports
angle, I like this topic.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.980
I think it fits very
well into the Google

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.550
spirit of avoiding making
decisions from the gut,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.830
from intuition with all the
conscious and unconscious

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.900
biases that that represents,
and taking a much more

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.070
data-driven, rational approach.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.275
And as we see, that's a big win.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.860
So thank you.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.010
ANDY ANDRES: Thank you.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.860
Thank you.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.400
So this is my cover slide
for this talk, some contact

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200
information.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.610
But this image is from
the MOOC that we designed.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.540
And during this few
minutes we have together,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.480
I want to talk about basically
the quick introduction of what

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.280
I do, why it's important,
then a quick summary of why

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.780
sabermetrics has changed
the game of baseball,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.720
why analytical thinking is
changing the game of baseball,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
and then try to come up
to current technologies

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.620
and current data that's being
used to try to make decisions

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.550
in the game.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.626
And the talk is geared
towards the novice.

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:06.250
Certainly at the beginning, you
might be able to follow things.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.639
But if you're a baseball fan
or a sabermetrician yourself,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.430
maybe you'll appreciate
the current technology.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.920
So it's been my privilege
through the introduction

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.910
you heard-- I've sort of made
this transition from a bench

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.520
biochemist to a data scientist.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.510
And I do lots of work with data.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.610
And I'm an educator, so I spend
a lot of time teaching folks

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.370
how to think about
data, how to use

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.940
data to drive decision making,
how to think about modeling.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.390
So all these things
are part of what I do.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.450
But I've really made
this conscious effort

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.000
over my career to go
from the bench biologist

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.954
to the baseball scientist.

00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:51.620
And it's been a lot
of different phases.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.578
A lot of it actually has
to do with the physics

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:55.010
and biology of baseball.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.140
That actually was my entree
into the whole field,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.270
was doing anabolic
steroids in baseball,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.800
that kind of discussion
and that kind of research,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.690
and talks since 2001.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.830
But then it's transitioned into
sabermetrics and analytics.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.210
Quickly, this is a view
of my seat at Fenway Park.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.890
I get to score the games.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.179
I'm in the press box.

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.470
This is another view when
I'm looking down on the field

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.830
from my seat.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.080
And this is my score sheet.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.205
I have a different score
sheet than a lot of folks.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.220
But it has to do
with the work I do,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.240
which is to record every
event for all the technology.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.430
I record every pitch,
every play in a certain set

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.680
of code and language.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.280
And it's a very intense job.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.270
I make the claim all
the time that I'm

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.350
the only person in the pressbox
paying attention to the game,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.520
because everyone else is
paying attention to MLB

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.630
At Bat, which is what
my data generates.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.800
So I do all the paying
attention these days at Fenway.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.150
We generate the box
score at Fenway Park.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.520
That's just an
emergence of technology.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.280
The old school version of
this was baseball box scores

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.535
were written up by
the official scorer.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.660
They don't do that anymore.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.180
The official scorer just
calls the game itself.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.460
So that's one nice
role I have, but it's

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.470
transitioned to the
academic piece here

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.110
of teaching sabermetrics.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.510
And I designed the first
course in sabermetrics,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.600
just doing baseball
analytics at Tufts in 2004.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.790
And so we had this seminar
of many years teaching

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.060
Tufts students.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.190
But now we've gone
into the MOOC format.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.910
And one of the things
we did right away,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.370
in both formats,
either seminar or MOOC,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.790
was talk about the definition
of the term sabermetrics.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.870
Sabermetrics has a funny origin.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.240
Here's the origin.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.440
The origin comes
from SABR, which

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.670
is the Society for
American Baseball Research,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.830
and metrics is just a word to
say how to measure baseball.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.400
And so sabermetrics-- it's
only been a word since 1981.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
But Voltaire was
the first person

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.500
to do this-- those of you who
are philosophers or readers.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.877
Voltaire said first
define your terms.

00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:12.960
And it's really important.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.570
When you look at
this definition,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.850
I'd say this is incorrect.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.390
This is not what
sabermetrics is.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.600
Sabermetrics is not the
statistical analysis

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.900
of baseball data.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.180
That's way too
narrow a definition

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.340
for what sabermetrics is.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.740
And like a good
scientist, I just

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.100
want to show something and let
you see and think about this.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.480
This is slow motion of
a pitcher for the Red

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.800
Sox named Daniel Bard.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.740
This is from 2010.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.870
And I say Daniel Bard
the Good, because this

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.900
was a year where Daniel Bard
was pitching extremely well.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.980
For those of you who
are baseball fans,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.620
you may remember Daniel
Bard a few years ago

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.020
and how great a pitcher he was
that one season especially.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.600
Now, if you pay attention to
these two slow motion videos,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.850
this is the same inning
in the same game.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.740
These are like
two pitches apart.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.600
A pitch count-- well,
three pitches apart.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.650
You can see the pitch
count on the top screen.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.990
The first on the left
is the Derek Jeter.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.420
It's at Yankee Stadium.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.120
And it's a fastball.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.810
And even though the physics--
we all know the physics

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.480
say that the fastball
can't rise above gravity.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.390
If you appreciate
what's going on here,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.370
that fastball is defying gravity
by having a back spin put

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.480
on it by the pitcher going up.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.640
Now, it's hard to
appreciate, but just look

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.680
how straight the
left-hand image is.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.790
And then watch how much
curve the other pitch gets.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.300
Just appreciate the
curve on the one pitch

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.960
and the straightness
on the other.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.442
So like any trained
engineer scientist,

00:06:53.442 --> 00:06:54.900
you should be
observing this thing,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.680
and your natural curiosity
would drive questions.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.595
What's going on here?

00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:01.970
These are two different pitches
with two different grips.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.004
Both are thrown over
98 miles an hour.

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:06.920
Now, baseball fans might
know what that means,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.990
but these are
extremely fast pitches.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.510
One is rising against gravity.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.770
It's actually defying
gravity and going up.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.050
And the other is taking this
left to right turn so much so

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.040
that the catcher
can't even catch it.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.770
The point is this
is just the time

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.270
to observe and ask questions,
like any good investigation.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.270
Now, this is when Daniel
Bard was quite good.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.080
And he was getting people
out left and right.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.190
This pitch here to
the right was one

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.530
of those-- we call them Bugs
Bunny pitches in baseball.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.780
It references the old
"Bugs Bunny" cartoon

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.650
when you had crazy pitches.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.280
Now, this is real data.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.220
So here is a field of pitches
that are yellow triangles.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.520
You can sort of see them in
here behind the blue squares,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.760
which are the changeup.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.360
But this pitch right here--
these two pitches way over here

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.270
to the left side of
that screen where

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.650
the pitch was that pitch that
had that big break-- what

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.400
you're seeing here is data.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.020
You're acting like
the catcher here.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.020
And this is where all
the pitches move relative

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.090
to the bullet spin.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.960
The bullet spin is right in
the middle of the axis, right

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.540
in the middle of the
two big axes there.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.790
That would be the bullet spin.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.600
The ball is just going along
its trajectory with gravity.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.870
But then you add the
spin that the pitcher

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.750
can put on the ball, and you
get different types of pitches.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.870
So now, this is
Daniel Bard the good.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.730
This red cloud are his
fastballs that rise.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.820
The one you saw on the
left to Derek Jeter,

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.810
that's the red cloud.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.240
Then buried in there
is the yellow cloud

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.320
of triangles where he's
got that pitch that bends.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.090
Now, I'm going to show you--
this is when he's good.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.000
This Daniel Bard the good,
Daniel Bard the next year,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.040
and Daniel Bard the next year.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.908
And pretty much after
this, he's out of baseball.

00:09:09.908 --> 00:09:12.250
I'll at least scroll back.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.630
Daniel Bard the
good, Daniel Bard

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.119
the next year, his last year.

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:18.660
He's tried since
then, but he's never

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.220
made really any
appearances since then

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.830
in Major League Baseball.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.340
Now, if you follow the red
cloud, you'll see what I mean.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.480
This red cloud-- if
you can picture this,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.970
this is a catcher's orientation.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:36.970
This red cloud is balls that are
thrown by Daniel Bard that move

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.750
a lot from that center point.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.680
If you pick where
that red cloud is,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.710
the center of that
red cloud, you

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.770
can see it move as Daniel
Bard is going from good

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.430
to mediocre-ish to not so good.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.070
And then he's out of the game.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.120
The point is this
is datasets that we

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.620
can use to analyze
pitching performance,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.070
the movement of the baseball.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.810
So instead of just watching
video and making assessments

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.350
of how well balls move,
we can measure now

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.160
how the balls actually
move based on the spin put

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.050
on the ball by the pitcher.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.540
So this is driving the
analytics in baseball.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.470
The decision making
in baseball can be

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.910
based on this kind of data now.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.770
Now, this is older data--
older data as in 2007 and '8

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.670
is when this dataset emerges.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.780
And it's done by video.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.710
Two video cameras are
trained between the area

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.850
of the pitcher and the
catcher, and they basically

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.700
do a triangulation of the
ball by video analytics,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.080
and then they reconfigure
the whole trajectory

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.480
of the pitch, from the release
all the way to the catcher,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.820
just using video analytics.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.700
It's called PITCHf/x.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.680
Now, PITCHf/x is
really, really important

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.380
to baseball analytics.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.420
We've actually moved on.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.750
But let's go back.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.330
We've just gone through a
simple little couple minutes

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.330
exercise looking at Daniel Bard
the good, his actual video,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.820
some data showing how
his pitches might move,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.630
and how that might drive
some decision making.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.600
An objective look at
Daniel Bard's performance

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.110
is what we can see with
this kind of dataset.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.990
So this goes to the
definition again.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.810
Voltaire was the one who
said first define your terms.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.080
Well, sabermetrics to me--
and I think most people

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.360
who really are practitioners
would agree with this--

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.510
it's the study of
the game of baseball

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.390
through observation,
by looking carefully.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.130
Now, sometimes you
can do experiments,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.550
but usually you don't.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.450
It's more like
astronomy that way.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.246
You are observing
things and trying

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:49.620
to figure out what's happening
through your observations.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.050
That's much more
what sabermetrics is.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.340
And here's the definition I
start off with all my courses.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.120
This is the simplified
version of sabermetrics--

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.430
the scientific and
objective analysis

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.080
of baseball-- much
more broadly defined

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.270
than just looking at
the statistical analysis

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.930
of baseball data.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.660
So this is an important
part to start.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.300
Baseball can be treated as
an observational science.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.680
You can start thinking
about the game

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.340
and understanding it better.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.070
Now, what we've done
at BU and at edx.org

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.990
is develop our course
called Sabermetrics 101:

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.400
An Introduction to
Baseball Analytics.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.640
And this is one of
the big innovations

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.220
we had in our course.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.570
The course is very successful.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.230
I could go on about
all the data points

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.720
of why EdX loves this course,
and why BU loves this course,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.820
and why the students
have loved this course.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.920
But one of the innovations
I kept pushing for

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.030
was something called
the SQL Sandbox.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.796
One thing we do really well
is teach SQL to novices.

00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:53.680
And we do it through
the SQL Sandbox.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.400
We make it very simple to
play with SQL right away.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.170
And we really do it right
away in this course.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.701
We do it right away in my
courses in seminar format

00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:04.200
as well.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.620
We take all comers, English
majors, non-technical people,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.840
and we start doing SQL
queries using the SQL Sandbox.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.490
So it was an engineering
thing to build this little SQL

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.030
Sandbox.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.940
It wasn't tricky,
but it really had

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.410
to look right for the users.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.250
That was one of the
big innovations we had

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.280
in this MOOC in the EdX course.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.130
This is a-- if you can see
this, this is a simple query,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.120
and you can see
some of the results.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.700
You basically run a
query, and you get

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.250
a bunch of results in a table.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.460
And you can even push a button
to download the full results.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.110
In this case, this
query, I think,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.830
generated something
like 25,000 rows.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.490
These are different
sets of data for games

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.670
between 2000 and 2009.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.460
So this was one innovation
that we found worked very well

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.880
for our students.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.950
In addition, the thing
we innovated here

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.630
was something called tracks.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.950
We realized in Introduction
to Data Analytics,

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.000
we'd get some people who
were data scientists who

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.867
were curious about baseball.

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:09.450
We'd get some baseball
people who were

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.440
curious about data science.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.560
And we'd get different folks
with different interests coming

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.910
into this class.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.360
So we created tracks--
tracks of different topics.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.960
We created a sabermetrics track.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.360
It was a street baseball track.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.070
We created a
technical track, where

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.910
we worked through SQL and
R, but a lot of our students

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.910
already had that done, like
maybe many in this room.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.780
If they took this
course, they actually

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.370
wouldn't have to take
the technical track.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.580
We also had a history track.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.230
We also had a statistics track.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.470
This didn't pretend
to be Statistics 101,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.990
but it did cover the
statistics needed

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.070
to do basic analytics that
we required for the course.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.890
So the different tracks
was another innovation

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.560
that actually many other
introductory courses on EdX

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.170
have used since then.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.340
So that was a nice
innovation we also had.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.630
The last thing we had was
something called the Grader.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:09.190
We would take-- people would run
a SQL query for their problem

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.252
set and submit the
dataset as their answer.

00:15:12.252 --> 00:15:13.710
And we had it in
a whole algorithm.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.090
We developed an algorithm
to try to grade each answer.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.190
It involved the right
number of columns, rows,

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.620
the order of the
columns and the rows,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.350
and different criteria
to give different grades.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.550
But the Grader was another
innovation for the class.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.980
Now, in terms of baseball,
really, baseball--

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.850
when we talk about sabermetrics,
we're modeling the game.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.580
Just like modeling any
system you want to model,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.990
you observe it carefully, and
you try to think about it.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.320
So when you think
about baseball,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.560
you try to understand
the game's about winning,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.880
but how do you win the game.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.540
You win the game with runs.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.180
So essentially, when you talk
about baseball analytics,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.360
you're talking about
analyzing runs.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.000
How are runs created?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.220
How are runs prevented?

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.630
And that's the model.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.130
And that's the key--
that's the standard

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.850
you develop as you build all
these models for baseball.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.650
Now, fundamentally, when
you think about runs--

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.930
and baseball fans know this--
you think about great players.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.890
And they're going
to create runs.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.450
David Ortiz is a
great player, and he's

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.170
got a great batting average
and lots of home runs.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.900
Well, very early on-- and I'm
talking a century ago-- very

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.060
early on, people realized
the standard metrics

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.392
for batting performance, batting
average, weren't working.

00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:36.100
There was a problem
with batting average,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.650
and people recognized
this a long time ago.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:44.070
This is a correlation
between team runs

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.770
scored for a whole season.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.970
So you basically
take a team, you

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.440
measure their runs
scored for that season,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.990
and you correlate it with
all their batting averages.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.250
Now, batting average
was the standard metric

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.540
for hitting performance
for the longest time.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.802
But even 100 years ago, people
said this isn't good enough.

00:17:02.802 --> 00:17:06.900
And it actually has a
fairly low correlation.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.290
Not as bad as this graph.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.240
This is the graph I always
show when I do these talks,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.470
because it's got no correlation.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.250
Same x-axis-- team runs scored.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.560
Take any given team in a
season, count their runs scored.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.390
But then you try to plot it
against the number of outs

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.872
they record on defense.

00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:27.900
Now, these should
not be correlated,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.170
because one is offense-- scoring
runs-- and one is defense,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.730
preventing runs.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.330
Now, if you do it
different ways,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.080
you can find correlations
with these data,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.660
but I chose it this way--
very low correlation.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.720
But I'll show you
the final graph.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.040
This is a higher correlation
for offensive performance.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.850
Now, this is a fundamental
concept in sabermetrics.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.310
This is what you do.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.820
You look at the game.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.650
You observe the game.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.200
You think about how
to model run scoring.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.330
Instead of using standard
metrics like batting average,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.670
you can take this very simple
metric-- this is actually

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.710
quite a simple formula.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.990
This is just hits added
to walks, H plus BB.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.190
So just measure the team
hits and the team walks.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.530
You multiply it by
another component,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.080
which is total bases, which
adds up singles, doubles,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.010
triples, home runs,
a little formula,

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:30.560
divided by the number
of at bats by walks.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.530
So this is a really
simple formula.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.100
But look how well it
correlates with run scoring.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.130
So this simple formula was
developed in the early '80s,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.120
'70s.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:49.070
And it really changed the
nature of baseball analytics.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.011
Because the analysts who
figured this out just

00:18:51.011 --> 00:18:52.260
did what I've just showed you.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.070
They said people for years have
been saying batting average is

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.560
not a good metric for
offensive performance,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.340
for modeling the game,
for understanding

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.630
the offensive
performance in baseball.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.270
But this is.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.630
Now, they kept saying
this over and over again

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.670
since the early '80s,
and nothing changed.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:16.650
These were outsiders who had no
access to the actual clubhouse,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.180
to the decision makers.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.180
The decision makers weren't
listening to the folks

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.630
telling everybody
there's a better way

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.220
to model the game of baseball.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.110
And you can imagine the
market inefficiency.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.810
Instead of modeling your team
on the best batting average,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.990
the players with the
best batting average,

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.870
you can start modeling
your team on the player

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.180
with-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.140
Sorry for the flashing slides.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.810
You can model your
team on the player who

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.010
gets harder hit balls,
which is measured

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.090
by the TB here, home runs
and triples and doubles,

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.330
and get walks.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.460
Walks are added here.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.720
So this formula-- this really,
really simple formula--

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.820
gets at another
level of modeling

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.100
the game more accurately.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.010
And the market
inefficiency now is

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.580
taking care of people who
hit home runs and triples

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.360
and doubles and take walks.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.120
Now, this market inefficiency
is completely closed today.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.050
But before the publication
of "Moneyball,"

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.359
this market inefficiency
was wide open.

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:23.650
It was first described, like
I said, in the early '80s.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.660
But it took two
decades-- two decades--

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.060
before you got that
little crack in the door

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.332
into the clubhouse
to convince people

00:20:35.332 --> 00:20:37.540
that this is the way to
think about the game, the way

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.050
to model the game.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.990
Now, today, fast forward another
decade since "Moneyball,"

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:49.270
there are 150 analysts
on 30 teams who--

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.990
this is what they grew up on.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.610
This is fundamental.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.320
This is like 2 plus 2 equals
4 to these 150 analysts.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.930
We're talking about a dramatic
paradigm shift in an industry.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.500
Now, this is just entertainment.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.710
We understand that.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.590
But it's a dramatic paradigm
shift in this industry.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.160
This is the importance
of baseball analytics

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.900
as an emerging-- discipline
may be too strong,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.800
but it's certainly an emerging
area of study for folks

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.770
who want to do
this kind of work.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.560
It's essentially
interesting data science

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.760
around entertainment.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.850
So let's go back to
another set of data.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.470
Another set of data
emerged in 2008.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.747
This is Jon Lester
from 2007 to 2014.

00:21:38.747 --> 00:21:39.830
These are all his pitches.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.750
Now, remember what
this is again.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.090
I'm going to try to
describe this carefully.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.430
This is the catcher view.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.640
You're the catcher.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.982
So Jon Lester is the pitcher.

00:21:48.982 --> 00:21:50.940
And he's throwing-- he's
a left-handed pitcher,

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.720
and he's throwing pitches
to you, the catcher.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.780
And he's got five
different pitches.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.140
The four seam
fastball is the one

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.430
that's going to rise the most.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.860
So that cloud of black
circles is the one

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.120
that's the highest velocity.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.280
That's the fastest pitch.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.100
Now, you can see he's got
balls that-- the sinker,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.039
this gray cloud
here, that actually

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.830
moves a little different
than the fastball.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.780
These are the two pitches
you saw by Daniel Bard.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.410
The fastball was the one
on the left to Derek Jeter

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.360
by Daniel Bard, and the
sinker was the one that

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.130
curved so much left to right.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.200
Now, for Jon Lester, he's
a left-handed pitcher.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.120
It's going to curve
the other way.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.830
It's going to curve from right
to left, because he's lefty.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.710
So when he throws his
two-seamed sinker,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.490
it's going to move this way.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.430
Now, he's got three
other pitches.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.830
He's got his curveball,
which is going to spin down.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.510
And that's the
yellow cloud here.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.950
He's got the changeup, which is
a whole other pitch altogether.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.280
It's meant to slow down.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.120
You can see how it's
lower on the graph.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.850
It's a lower velocity pitch.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.547
So he grips it differently, and
it's actually a slower pitch.

00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:05.630
And then he's got another
pitch that he's spinning

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.470
the other way from the sinker.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.170
He calls it a cutter, a slider.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.850
These are different names
for very similar pitches

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.800
that go the different way
than the classic sinker pitch.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.360
The point is-- if you don't
know baseball, that's fine.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.950
The point is there's a pitcher
grabbing a baseball that's

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.970
going to spin in air, and
he's doing this on purpose.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.160
So we can collect all these
data and look at Jon Lester.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.210
Now, one data point of one
pitcher doesn't matter much.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.510
But if we compare Jon
Lester now to another?

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.530
This is another
left-handed pitcher

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.860
with the same
five-pitch repertoire.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.020
This is Jose Quintana.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.090
Now, what I've done is
I've manipulated the images

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.440
so the scales are the same.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.940
And I'm going to
go back and forth.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.410
Now, you should understand
that one pitcher is throwing it

00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:01.620
faster, and one pitcher is
throwing it with more movement.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.950
And this is the way now
to measure pitching.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.010
We're not going to
measure ERA anymore,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.200
which is a fundamental measure
of pitching performance.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.280
Now we can take these data and
say who moves the ball better.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.260
Who moves the ball faster?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.450
Now, there's a key piece missing
here in this dataset right

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.054
here, which is how
accurately they can throw it,

00:24:24.054 --> 00:24:26.220
their placement of the
pitches over the strike zone.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.690
But just on the skill set
of these two pitchers here,

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.620
Lester has more velocity and
more movement of these pitches.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.720
These scales are
exactly the same.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.840
And so now this is
just to show you

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.490
we have another way to
measure pitching performance

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.900
using technology and new data.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.630
So this is using to
PITCHf/x dataset,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.220
and understanding the
different pitch types,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.210
and understanding how these
pitches move as a measurement

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.270
of value of pitchers.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.480
Now, I throw this one in
here just because it's fun.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.870
Has anyone ever
seen this before?

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.920
This is Todd Frazier.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.650
Todd Frazier now actually plays
for the Chicago White Sox.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.700
This is when he was on the Reds.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.320
If anyone is from
New Jersey, he's

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.400
from Point Pleasant, New Jersey.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.450
New Jersey Shore?

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.319
No one?

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:16.860
Jersey Shore?

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.500
OK, fine.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.430
But watch.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.160
If you look carefully, it's
pretty obvious his right hand--

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.790
watch his right hand-- is off
the bat at bat-ball contact.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.810
But if you look carefully,
his left hand is, too.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:38.210
He has essentially thrown
the bat at the ball.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.100
He's throwing the
bat at the ball.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.870
Now, if you've ever
played baseball,

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.036
the coach would never
tell you to do this.

00:25:46.036 --> 00:25:49.230
This is not classic baseball.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.110
But what's really interesting
here is the physics.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.890
We can use this as
a physics example

00:25:54.890 --> 00:26:00.080
of understanding bat-ball
contact, the mechanics of this.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.750
But beyond that,
this was a home run.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.180
He hit this ball
about-- over 400 feet.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.730
So he's throwing the bat at
the ball, and it goes 400 feet.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.290
So this is the introduction to
understanding a little bit more

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.590
about home runs.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.690
So here is a list of
all the different teams

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.770
and their ballparks.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.920
It would probably
surprise you if you're

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.600
a baseball fan-- if
you understand this

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.150
and you're a baseball
fan, it would probably

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.410
surprise you to
see that last year,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:40.330
the most home runs were hit by
the games played in Baltimore

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:41.910
at Orioles Park.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.390
Most people who
are baseball fans

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.940
might say oh,
that's Coors Field.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.190
That's where there's
a high altitude

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.720
and balls just travel farther.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.390
But no.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.860
Most home runs were
hit in Baltimore.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:59.030
The least home runs were
hit in San Francisco.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.460
Now, this is just a rank
order listing of the home runs

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.400
that occurred in every park.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.550
But as we start understanding
home runs, as we transition

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.930
into understanding
this, this is one data

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.140
set that we can
start thinking about.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.750
Now, here's another dataset.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.730
This is actually
really interesting.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:21.420
This is using-- this
is by Greg Rybarcyzk.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.810
He's actually a Red
Sox analyst now.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:28.650
What he did is took video of
every home run ever played.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.940
He had a package, and he could
watch videos of all games.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.946
And he would find every video
of a home run since 2006.

00:27:37.946 --> 00:27:39.570
So this is yeoman
work, because there's

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.390
about 5,000 home runs a year.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.350
And he would find where
it landed in the ballpark.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.100
And he had 3D reconstructions
digitally, reconstructions

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.770
of all ballparks.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.360
And he would time on his
video bat-ball contact

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.950
and then where it landed.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:04.620
So he has a time in the air,
a position where it landed.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.190
And he actually got more
sophisticated near the end

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.150
and put in weather in there,
and he put in wind in there.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.030
He talked to the physicists
about batted ball flight,

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.400
understood better about
the potential batted ball

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.850
flight moves here that are
typical for righty lefty, lefty

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.150
righty stuff.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.770
And he modeled
various components.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.760
So this dataset is just
looking at home runs in 2009.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.340
So this is the cloud of all home
runs graphing their batted ball

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.160
velocity, how hard
the ball was hit.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.660
Now, Greg calculated this.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.140
He calculated the
batted ball velocity

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.340
based on hang time in
the air and the distance

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.480
and a few other parameters.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.810
He also determined
the launch angle.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:59.130
So he is estimating both launch
angle and batted ball velocity

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.750
just by looking at video.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.410
Lot of work, but
probably a big error

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.410
bar around the precision
of what this actually

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.170
is, because he's doing
a lot of formulation

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.250
to get these two
sets of numbers.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.600
But clearly, it should
show you something.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.290
What's the average?

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.040
He's not too far off.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.380
This is pretty good modeling.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.130
But it tells you the
average batted ball velocity

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:30.680
for a home run is about
103.6 miles per hour.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.240
Off the bat, home
runs average this.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.290
Now, there's a big range.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.730
You can see some home runs
were pretty weakly hit.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.670
Those are probably
things like pop ups

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.990
at Fenway Park that scrape
the foul pole or something.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.590
So it's a weak hit that
might just be a home run.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.800
But some were hit quite hard.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.247
You can see the
outliers on both sides.

00:29:53.247 --> 00:29:54.830
And then you can see
the launch angle.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.810
Most people, when they
think about trajectories

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.460
that you learn in
Mechanics 101, you

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.140
think 45 degrees is the best.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.090
Well, in baseball, it's not.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:08.100
Data clearly shows you here
the launch angle is about 28.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:14.190
Now, the range is anywhere
from 43 down to 18 or 19.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.730
When you're hitting an
18 or 19 launch angle,

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.000
that's a line drive.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.970
That's a low trajectory.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.430
And then, of course, you've
got the almost 45-degree

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.610
trajectories.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.562
But the typical home run is
much more like 30 degrees.

00:30:28.562 --> 00:30:30.270
Now, this makes sense
when you understand

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.290
the physics in the
backspin of a baseball

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:37.620
and how balls move
in the fluid of air.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.560
So you can explain this
by looking at the science

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.050
quite easily.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.130
But this was an important
little dataset to understand.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.470
Most people wouldn't
get this right away.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.660
Now, also in 2009, we
have another data set

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.570
that looks at all
batted ball events.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.630
This is just April 2009.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.320
But it's another technology
just using video analytics.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.330
Remember that video
analytics of PITCHf/x

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.640
where you basically
reconstruct the trajectory

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.250
of the pitch with
high speed cameras

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.660
in this area between the
pitcher's mound and home plate?

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.850
You can do the same thing
with the batted ball.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.820
When the ball is hit, you
can watch the trajectory

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.710
through those camera areas.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.020
Now, it wasn't a
great technology.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.030
It actually had lots of errors.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.820
But this dataset tells
us a very similar thing.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.060
What we're showing here
in different colors

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.370
is a fly out, which is
a ball hit in the air.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.090
That's different
than a pop up, which

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.650
is a ball hit in
the air which is

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.580
closer to where the batter is.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.100
Then there's line outs and
ground outs and singles,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.290
doubles, and triples.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:48.870
For those of you
who know the game,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.700
you understand these clearly.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.590
But you can see where
these clouds are.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.065
I've reduced this cloud
into different points,

00:31:57.065 --> 00:32:00.380
the average points for
each of those eight events.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.000
These are the outs-- the pop
out, the fly out, the line out.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.510
And if you understand
the graph here looking

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.220
at the velocity versus
the launch angle, which

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.010
is what we showed before
with the other dataset,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.590
you can see why
that might curve.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.640
You understand the game, what
a liner is, what a pop up is.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.900
You see why they might
have different batted ball

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.360
velocities and trajectories.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.380
But this is the single.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.950
The double and the
triple are very close.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.270
They're actually very similar
batted ball projectiles

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.170
off the bat.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.790
But then here's the home run.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.320
The home run is
singularly different.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.450
You've got to hit it
harder, and you've

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.135
got to hit it at
the right launch

00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:46.700
angle, the right trajectory,
the right angle off the bat.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.650
So this is another
data set showing

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.470
a very similar thing,
another completely different

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.880
technology.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.330
Instead of looking
at video, which

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.520
is what Greg did, seeing
where the ball landed

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.560
and the time in the air, this is
looking at video reconstruction

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.320
of a high-speed camera
of the initial flight

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.840
path of the ball.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.030
Now we can go to
another dataset.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.870
We have a third dataset.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.360
This is actually not
the third dataset yet.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.940
Greg's dataset looking at
the trajectory, flight time,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:26.500
and landing spot gets
this data set for 2015.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.320
So you can see
it's very similar.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.170
It's about 30 degrees launch
angle, and it's about 104,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.650
103 miles per hour off the bat.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.730
These are home runs
again, very specific hits,

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.790
and they fill the same cloud.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.570
So we're getting a sense now
of what a home run looks like.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.860
So if you could read the
initial batted ball velocity

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.740
and you see over 100,
and you see a launch

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:58.370
angle in the area 20 to 35,
40, you could say home run.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.530
You're probably going
to be pretty close.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.400
This is definitely what a
home run requires-- the ball

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.200
to be hit over the fence.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.590
So there's new data now,
and it's using radar.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.449
Instead of using video,
there's radar in the stadiums.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:16.790
This is radar data.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.840
Now, this is a little different.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.460
It's not the same axes anymore.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.520
But what we have on the bottom
is batted ball velocities,

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.880
but these are average.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.320
Each of these points
represents one player

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.480
in 2015, just one player.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.639
And these are the top
150 or so players.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.670
And I chose 150 mainly
because I wanted

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.030
to get the full-time players.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.400
Players who played
the most would

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.250
be determined by
their management

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.239
to be the best players,
the best players performing

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.630
to great runs.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.530
This is all the
different players.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.070
So we've got their average
batted ball velocity.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.030
It turns out when you
take the top 150 players,

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.720
you get 300 events.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.200
So this is an aggregation.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.430
Each of these points is an
aggregation of 300 batted ball

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:20.780
events during the year 2015--
so the top 150 batters,

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.620
300 batted ball events-- in
other words, they hit the ball.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.650
Now, when you take
the average velocity,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.480
you get this huge range.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.430
The average ranges from about
82 all the way up to 94, 95.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.940
That is a big range of
batted ball velocities.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.450
This is a distinguishing
characteristic of a batter.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.980
It really is a distinguishing
characteristic of a batter.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.470
You can really determine
what's an average player who's

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.460
playing full time.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.390
These are full-time players.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.600
You can pick that group in
the middle, the average.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.860
And you can pick the
group at the bottom,

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.160
and you can call them
the weaker hitters.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.370
And the ones at the top
are the stronger hitters.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.240
Now, who's a baseball
fan in the audience who

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:10.140
wants to take a guess at
who might be a weaker hitter

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.470
and who might be
a stronger hitter?

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.670
Anybody a baseball fan
enough to want to guess that?

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.294
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:36:17.294 --> 00:36:20.205
Weaker hitter is Billy
Hamilton, and stronger

00:36:20.205 --> 00:36:21.580
is Giancarlo Stanton.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.255
ANDY ANDRES: Stanton
and Hamilton, good.

00:36:23.255 --> 00:36:25.502
Good guesses.

00:36:25.502 --> 00:36:26.470
Yikes.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.720
That was just the home runs.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.320
Any other guesses?

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.404
Any other baseball fans
that want to hazard a guess?

00:36:34.404 --> 00:36:37.091
AUDIENCE: Jose
Iglesias, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:38.090
ANDY ANDRES: Good, good.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.590
Actually, you're not hitting
any of the leaders, by the way,

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.735
or the followers,
the bottom group.

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:44.610
Let me just show you.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.914
Now, the other part of this
here is batted ball distance.

00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.580
You can see how there's a slight
correlation between batted ball

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.790
velocity and distances.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.990
There's something there.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.710
You can sort of see that the
weaker hitters don't hit it

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.160
as far.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.630
Now, so who's the cluster
at the bottom there?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.370
The cluster at the bottom
are four players-- Burns

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:12.255
from Oakland A's, Ben Revere,
Ichiro Suzuki, and Dee Gordon.

00:37:12.255 --> 00:37:15.960
And Dee Gordon-- I don't know
if you follow this stuff like I

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.760
do, but Dee Gordon
just got suspended

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.920
for anabolic
steroid usage, which

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.760
is-- he's way at the bottom.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.590
I don't know what's
going on there.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.440
It's doesn't seem
to be-- hitting

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.450
the ball hard is not part of
the equation for Dee Godron.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.650
But on the other
side, these top five

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:36.270
are Trumbo, Bautista, Cruz,
Ortiz, and Miguel Cabrera.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.940
Now, very close-- I'm sure
Mike Trout is very close.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.570
I'm sure Stanton is very close
to the top of this group here.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.350
And I'm sure the others you
mentioned are at the bottom.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.140
The point is this is now--
I'm going to go out on a limb

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.520
and say this is the right way
to think about batting power.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.750
And one of the key things-- this
is 2015-- you're a smart GM.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.130
You might say look at
that list at the top.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:06.200
One of those things is not
like the other-- Mark Trumbo.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.630
Mark Trumbo was a free agent,
and one very smart team

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.450
signed Mark Trumbo.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.740
And Mark Trumbo is having
a great year this year.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.510
Now, small sample size.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.300
There's not necessarily
a cause and effect here.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.680
But the point is this might be
a new way to really understand

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.880
the value of batters.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.160
Remember what these
points represent.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.960
For Mark Trumbo, that's
over 300 batted ball events.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.610
And he hit it harder than
everybody in baseball

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:45.250
except four, four guys who
anybody would list as a power

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.390
hitter who hits it hard-- Miguel
Cabrera, David Ortiz, Nelson

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.060
Cruz.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.550
These guys hit the ball hard.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.240
We all see it.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.590
You can observe it.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.750
Now, you see Mark
Trumbo hit it hard, too,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:01.670
but it might be a surprise to
see him that high on the list.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.662
Question?

00:39:02.662 --> 00:39:06.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] on the
right side of [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.610
ANDY ANDRES: Probably,
yes, I agree.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.030
The observation was
Wily Mo Pena probably

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.690
would fit on the right
side of these graphs.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.630
This dataset doesn't
encompass Wily Mo Pena.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.870
This is 2015, 2016.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.820
This is when we put radar
now in all baseball parks.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.282
AUDIENCE: Let's say
Trumbo [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:34.206
The smart GM would sign Trumbo.

00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:36.611
The looser GM would sign Pena.

00:39:36.611 --> 00:39:39.007
But there wasn't any evidence
to indicate [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.250
ANDY ANDRES: Fair point.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:50.170
But I think there's more to
it than just this, for sure.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.240
So this isn't the
end of the story

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.270
or the whole story for sure.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:40:00.320
But this is a real new look
at the performance of players,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.830
a new look at
performance of players

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.282
that we didn't have
before last year.

00:40:04.282 --> 00:40:05.490
These data are now available.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.800
We can look at that.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.827
Now--

00:40:07.827 --> 00:40:09.201
AUDIENCE: Is this
going to be all

00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:11.193
available-- this
is all open source,

00:40:11.193 --> 00:40:15.179
and I can go and download
all of this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.470
ANDY ANDRES: If you ask nicely.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.540
The question was is the
data publicly available.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.390
The answer is yes.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.710
If you ask nicely, I can
tell you where to find it.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:26.900
It's not hard to find.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.070
Just Google stat cast,
and you'll find it.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:33.230
But this is the radar.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.680
And if you go to
Fenway Park any time,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.820
just look behind home plate.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.970
Mounted on the press box, look
for this little box right here.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:45.020
This is the radar that
covers the whole field that's

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:50.617
measuring the pitch, measuring
the trajectory of the pitch

00:40:50.617 --> 00:40:56.230
at 40,000 times a second.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.220
And it gets the
actual release point.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.730
It actually can determine the
three-dimensional components

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.100
of the actual release
point of the pitcher--

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.590
not just guess it with
the previous technology

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.990
of extrapolating data points
through video analytics.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.240
Radar gets the release
point, the exact spot

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.400
where it's released.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.440
It can measure seams
on the baseball.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.100
It's that precise.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.320
And it can obviously see
the pitch trajectory,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.060
recreate that.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.460
Now it can also recreate
the hit trajectory,

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.070
and that's where we're
getting these datasets from--

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:32.910
the velocity of the hit,
and the distance of the hit,

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.630
and the trajectory of the
hit, and the spin of the hit,

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.120
and the spin of the pitch
all measurable now because

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.020
of radar.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.500
Now, we also get
every throw made.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.650
So you bat the ball into play.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.610
The fielder gets it, and they
throw it to another player.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:54.090
All those throws
are now measurable.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:57.250
You can measure the trajectory
of every single throw

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.300
with this technology.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:06.300
So we are at the leading edge
of a whole new set of analytics

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.590
like this.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.180
Now, there was a
great question about

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.070
is this the be all and end all.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.090
Is Miguel Cabrera the
best hitter in baseball?

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:14.950
He's one of them.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.860
He's not the best.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.860
But when you model the game,
when you model run scoring,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.820
when you're the
objective analyst now,

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.470
you have to take this
data into account.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:32.120
You've got to start adding this
new technology to your model

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.610
to better understand
offensive performance,

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.740
to better understand
where runs come from,

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.660
to leap beyond the
idea of understanding

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.770
just what batting
average is contributing

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.230
to offensive performance
and run scoring.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.887
So radar is key.

00:42:47.887 --> 00:42:49.470
There's another
component here though,

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:52.680
too, which is really important.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.220
These are six cameras.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.770
And I took a photo
at Fenway Park.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.770
Just wandered around
and took this picture.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.370
Each of the sides
has three cameras.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:05.740
The right-hand image is
three black rectangles

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.440
next to a white-- that
is actually a radar gun

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.340
to measure pitch velocity.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.800
But that's three cameras there.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.190
And on the other left side there
are three cameras mounted three

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.880
on top of one another.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.240
If you go to any ball
Major League ball park,

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.010
it might be fun to-- since
you're technology oriented,

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.420
you might try to find the radar
system and the six cameras.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.410
Because they're in every
Major League ballpark.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.740
They're actually in a lot
of minor league ballparks.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.940
Because what teams have
found out now is it's

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.770
not just measuring
the Major Leagues.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.750
You want to do with
the minor leagues, too.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.780
You want to install
these systems

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.650
so you can see which
batter is hitting

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:48.880
it the hardest in the minors
to either trade for them

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.740
or to promote them.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.930
It really is getting
more and more pervasive,

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.270
this set of technology.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.870
The cameras here
measure player movement.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.920
That's not measuring
ball movement.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.630
If you've ever followed
football, soccer,

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:09.500
or other moving sports--
if you watch the World Cup,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.409
you see how they track players.

00:44:11.409 --> 00:44:12.950
And they track
players through video.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.040
They don't need little trackers
in their shoes or anything

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.130
like that.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.990
You can just watch.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:22.010
You can determine where the
player is by video analytics.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.630
ChyronHego is a European company
that does this very well.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.540
Sports Vision is an American
company trying to do it.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.930
But ChyronHego was hired
to do it for baseball.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.010
And the technology
tracks the movement

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.250
of all the umpires, all the
coaches, all the players,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:39.000
all the runners, the batter.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.780
Everybody moving
on the field is now

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.290
tracked through video analytics.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.480
So now we have another set of
data measuring player movement

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.900
all over the field.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.920
And this is important
now, too, obviously,

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.830
if you want to measure
defense and if you

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.660
want to measure offensive
performance baserunning

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.320
or batter times to first.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.870
These are all things that
are important to measure

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.960
if I want to better understand
offensive or defensive

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:10.890
performance in the game-- so
merging now our big datasets

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.800
to help us better
understand the value of each

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.080
and every player in
the game of baseball.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.600
Now, when they
announced this in 2014

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.460
that this was going to be
coming to Major League Baseball,

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.760
they also made the announcement
that this is seven terabytes

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.064
of data every game.

00:45:29.064 --> 00:45:30.520
Now, that's a lot of data.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.180
Now, Google laughts at that.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.330
They're like, seven terabytes,
I use that in my hip pocket

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.501
in the morning.

00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:37.250
But you know what?

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.950
This is actually a big
dataset for baseball.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.790
Relative to what other data
sets we've had in the past,

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:47.120
even though baseball was
considered data rich,

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.260
this is actually really
emerging into bigger analytics

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.240
of big datasets.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.200
And so a lot of time has been
spent by the very smartest,

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.310
cutting edge teams to
parse through these data

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.090
to get the right data they need.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.600
A lot of time has been spent
also by Major League Baseball

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.219
to help teams do this.

00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:06.510
There's a lot of folks working
in Major League Baseball

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.220
to get through these
data to boil it down

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.690
to really important information
that the teams can use,

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.900
and that also might be useful
for the fans of the game.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.260
It might be fun for fans to
see these different things.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.600
So let's move on
to other things.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.460
Let's move on to another
way to use these data sets.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.940
I only have a
couple more slides.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.110
But this is interesting.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.170
This is David Ortiz in 2015.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:37.104
What's shown here is his
batted ball location.

00:46:37.104 --> 00:46:38.520
Most people probably
wouldn't have

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.830
guessed that David Ortiz--
most of his batted balls

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.380
go right center field.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.960
If you're a fan, everyone
is shifting on David Ortiz.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.060
But David Ortiz is hitting it
straight up the middle mostly.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.850
So you look at the heat
map, and that's mostly

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.170
where his hits are landing.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.230
Now, if you look
at Jose Bautista,

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.260
if you know anything about
Jose Bautista, you can see him.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.130
He's a pull hitter.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.590
You look at his heat map.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.410
He's a right-handed batter.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.040
This is a demonstration
of the field,

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.240
and you can see that most
of his hits are pulled.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.800
Here's another graphic of
Jose Bautista, 2008 to 2015,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.710
all his home runs.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:19.880
He's a pull hitter.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.570
If you understand
the game of baseball,

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.920
he's pulling everything
to left field.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.160
This is Ryan Howard.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.480
Now, he's a left-handed hitter.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.400
He pulls the ball.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.310
Now, those of you
who are Red Sox fans

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.595
might know who
Zander Bogarts is.

00:47:36.595 --> 00:47:39.010
Zander Bogarts-- I see
some heads nodding.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.290
Zander Bogarts is the
shortstop for the Red Sox,

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.810
and he doesn't hit a
whole lot of home runs.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.200
But he's got an
interesting profile here.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.810
And this actually goes
along with your observation.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:57.200
If you watch a lot
of baseball, you'll

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.240
see Zander Bogarts is much
different than Jose Bautista.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.580
They're both
right-handed hitters.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.930
These are many
batted ball events.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:07.570
This is not just one data point.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.880
These are a lot of data points
of where their ball lands

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.380
when they hit it.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.010
Compare this heat map.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.530
And look-- one big thing to
compare is how close it is.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.730
He doesn't hit it far.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:26.380
It's closer to home plate,
which is the bottom of those two

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.110
black lines.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.780
Here's Jose Bautista.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.680
Jose Bautista-- his heat
map extends a lot further,

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.650
and it's certainly pulled
towards third base,

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:42.490
left field compared
to Zander Bogarts.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.350
He's hitting it opposite field.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.549
So a very interesting
set of heat maps.

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:51.090
The last thing-- I'm going to
run through these slides quick.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.640
If you care, there is something
called catcher framing.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.375
But what people don't understand
is batters have a strike zone.

00:48:57.375 --> 00:49:04.235
In other words, you might
understand that batters have--

00:49:04.235 --> 00:49:05.360
umpires have a strike zone.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.690
Some umpires, if
you know the game,

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.060
might have a wider strike zone.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.080
Some umpires might be tighter.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.360
What people don't
understand as fans

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.076
is that batters
have a strike zone.

00:49:15.076 --> 00:49:15.700
They really do.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.840
When you understand the
strike zone-- baseball

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.620
analysts who study
the strike zone

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.730
know there's four parts
to the strike zone.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.270
Each pitcher has a strike zone.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.860
Each batter has a strike zone.

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.790
Each umpire has a strike
zone, and each catcher

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.890
has a strike zone.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.530
They all impact
that called pitch

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.580
being either a ball or a strike.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.390
Let's do this.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:41.420
This is Jose Bautista.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.700
He's a right-handed hitter.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.590
Let's compare him to Mike Trout,
another right-handed hitter.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:54.320
These are all data
from 2014 through 2016.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.070
So this is Bautista.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.644
Here's Trout.

00:49:57.644 --> 00:49:59.490
Bautista, Trout.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.280
So these are two different
guys with two different strike

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.180
zones.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.106
You can appreciate the
difference in the red field.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.320
Now let's go to a left hander.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.310
This is David Ortiz.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.750
This is his strike zone.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.580
Bryce Harper, another
left-handed hitter,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.400
another great left-haded hitter.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.050
Look at the difference.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:25.770
There is differences here.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:26.880
And this is subtle.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.850
This is a subtle
difference between batters

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:35.650
that impact the strike zone--
so cutting edge analytics that

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.910
aren't really being
published, even in the public.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.760
But what the teams are
doing-- what they're doing

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.010
is they're better understanding
each batter strike

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.510
zone, each umpire strike
zone, each pitcher strike

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.610
zone, each catcher strike zone.

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:52.900
And they're emerging now, like
who's pitching, catching today.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.090
Who's the umpire today?

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.160
And they can actually make this
part of the scouting report

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.830
to help inform either
pitchers, catchers,

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:05.960
or batters what
advantages there might be

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.950
to winning the game that day.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:14.020
So this is the kind
of thing that's new.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:19.650
Old was this idea of
let's value walks.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:21.480
Let's value the home run.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.570
New is using technology and
data to drive decision making

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.610
in real time to understand
better small advantages that

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.810
might help you win games.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:36.720
So look-- I understand
this is entertainment.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.060
I understand this
is fun and games.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.530
But this is an
analogy, in a way,

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.190
to a lot of things going
on in real industry,

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:49.770
real decision making in real
business and real things that

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.280
might matter a lot
more than baseball.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.940
So we can talk about
this baseball story

00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:03.130
and how it relates to this
emerging study of anything

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.410
we observe, anything.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:07.150
And I use anything
literally, because we've

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:08.750
done it with baseball.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:14.420
So anything can suffer
a close observation,

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:20.850
thoughtful questioning, trying
to understand it better,

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:24.030
gathering data to be
objective about what

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:26.550
you're trying to answer.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.130
So we've done that
with baseball.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.030
I think it can be
done with anything.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.290
And I thank you for your time.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.290
If you have any questions,
I'll be glad to answer them.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:36.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:40.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.970
Thank you very much.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.730
What are some of
the teams that you

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.105
think are the most cutting
edge in this stuff?

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:57.360
ANDY ANDRES: Cubs, Rays,
Red Sox, Nationals.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.980
Yankees are pretty good.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.250
I would say Astros.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.200
I forgot the Astros.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.110
Yes.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.068
AUDIENCE: Is that a
culture of how much they're

00:53:07.068 --> 00:53:08.817
willing to spend or
the actual people they

00:53:08.817 --> 00:53:11.860
have doing the analysis that
produces the better results?

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.240
ANDY ANDRES: Some it's
spending, and some it's people.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.660
Astros, it's actually people.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.480
Rays, it's people.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.840
Red Sox, it's a combination
of people and money.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.320
Cubs, it's mostly money,
but a lot of good people.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.029
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like observationally,

00:53:32.029 --> 00:53:34.320
watching a game, whenever
anybody really hits a triple,

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.550
it always seems like they hit
a double and the fielder really

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.360
screwed up, but it wasn't
close enough to really

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.340
be called an error.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.710
And given what your
chart showed earlier,

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.334
they're basically
the same kind of hit.

00:53:42.334 --> 00:53:44.212
Is that your observation
as a scorer, too?

00:53:44.212 --> 00:53:44.920
ANDY ANDRES: Yes.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.830
I don't make the
hit-error decisions.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.860
I just record everything
when I'm working at MLB.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.320
But I agree with you.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.830
From what I see, these
are hard-hit balls that

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:00.840
rattle around outfield fences.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.490
And you just can't call
errors on certain plays.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:12.050
If they're making ordinary
effort and they screw up,

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.300
that's when you give an error.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.210
But if it's some crazy
thing that happened,

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.362
that's-- you can't
give errors to that.

00:54:18.362 --> 00:54:19.820
AUDIENCE: Even when
they fall over.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.880
But they fell over not within
five feet of the ball, so--

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.890
ANDY ANDRES: This
is being recorded,

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:28.460
so I better watch what I say.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.410
But I have a lot of stories
about how the sausage is

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.780
made in official scoring.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.380
AUDIENCE: The data you were
talking about collecting,

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.180
is that available to
all the teams equally,

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.680
or do some of them
have private data

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.628
that they're adding into this?

00:54:45.628 --> 00:54:49.430
ANDY ANDRES: This dataset
is for every team.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.560
Every team has access to it.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.060
But that doesn't
mean other teams

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.720
aren't adding their own data.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.470
There's other data
providers out there

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:58.910
that are trying to
sell data to teams.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.210
And some teams buy it.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:05.970
Some teams are thinking about
data a little differently.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.270
They're gathering data.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:08.760
They're spending
money to get data

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.860
in low minors and
other places, too.

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.900
So each team is a
little different.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.540
But this dataset using
radar and video analytics

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.850
is open to all 30 teams.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.840
AUDIENCE: So when
academics discover things,

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.250
they publish them.

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:31.180
In this case, finding a new
metric that works really

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:35.710
well is probably something
you want to keep proprietary.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.660
Do you guys lean more
towards that or more

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.360
towards sharing with each other?

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.990
ANDY ANDRES: I think
the industry is always

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:46.180
looking for the
market inefficiency

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.660
and for that advantage.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.370
Now, this isn't a
clear cut advantage

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:53.850
as some other industries.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:56.710
If you make a better widget
and you cut the price in half,

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.580
you will make more money.

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.942
That's a measure of that system.

00:56:00.942 --> 00:56:02.900
In this system, you want
to measure it by, say,

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.890
World Series victories.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:10.880
Getting more value from your
players because of some metric

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.980
about how hard
they hit the ball,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.430
that doesn't guarantee
a World Series victory.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:21.456
But it certainly would
be a slight improvement.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.390
And it is a market inefficiency.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.400
In terms of academics
and publishing,

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.719
I think there is
the outside world--

00:56:31.719 --> 00:56:33.760
and I'm actually part of
the outside world, where

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.600
we actually look
at data and we try

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.630
to analyze it and publish it on
the web so everyone can see it.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:43.110
Then there's other data
involved and better models

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:46.530
involved because of the
richer datasets in the clubs.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.720
And that's not something
we're privy to.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.190
The outside doesn't see that.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.390
It's very proprietary.

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:54.970
There's some cross-talk
between teams, but not much.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:57:00.750
They usually hold information
pretty close to the vest.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.940
But I'm on the outside.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:10.096
So I just try to look at data
that I can find and analyze it.

00:57:15.084 --> 00:57:16.500
AUDIENCE: Two
questions, actually.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.310
So at the player level,
how much are teams

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:24.840
sharing any data points?

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.570
So one thing that
stood out was you

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.570
said they put the
shift for Ortiz,

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:31.280
but he hits to the middle.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.840
Do they share that with
their players at all

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.820
and say, hey, you shouldn't
necessarily shift,

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.490
and build in a
player-by-player strategy?

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.400
Are teams doing that?

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.510
ANDY ANDRES: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.080
If you watch baseball
a lot, you'll

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.110
see how every at bat
shifts the defense.

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:53.580
Every new batter
coming up, they'll

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.020
always have a different move.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.327
Even within pitch
counts, they'll shift.

00:57:57.327 --> 00:57:59.160
They'll move players
around in pitch counts.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.590
And so they understand
the different pitch counts

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.310
and the batters impact where
you should be on defense.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:04.810
It's that.

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:07.726
Granular.

00:58:07.726 --> 00:58:08.700
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.005
That's pretty interesting.

00:58:10.005 --> 00:58:10.880
ANDY ANDRES: I agree.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.600
AUDIENCE: And then
the other question I

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.560
had was it seems
like this would be

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.750
pretty good information for
video game developers to have.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.820
I'm curious if you
share a lot of this

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:25.330
and if they incorporate
it well or not well.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.672
ANDY ANDRES: The data I
have is freely available.

00:58:28.672 --> 00:58:30.630
Now, I'm not the best
web scraper in the world.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.916
If one of you want to
have a cup of coffee,

00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:34.540
I have a couple web
scraping questions.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.750
I'd love to-- I have a couple of
things I need to get better at.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:44.110
But I don't know of any
game developers using this,

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.240
but it's freely available.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.430
In other words, they
can find these datasets

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:53.220
to better do whatever
gaming they're designing.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.070
It's out there.

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:55.460
And I would agree with you.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.220
If I were a game
designer, I'd really

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.350
want to model the
game a lot better.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.135
And these data are out there.

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:10.600
AUDIENCE: When I saw the graphs
about Daniel Bard's pitching,

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.517
two things jumped out
at me, and I wasn't sure

00:59:12.517 --> 00:59:13.724
if you had a comment on them.

00:59:13.724 --> 00:59:15.675
One, there's this old
thought that command

00:59:15.675 --> 00:59:18.109
is everything for a pitcher.

00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:19.650
If you don't have
command, it doesn't

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.400
matter how fast you throw,
and if you have command,

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.066
you can do well.

00:59:22.066 --> 00:59:24.080
And then there's
the other one, which

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.340
is that it's all about
variance-- so if you lose

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.232
fastball velocity
but your changeup

00:59:30.232 --> 00:59:32.690
can still be overpowering if
your changeup also slows down,

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.090
like Keith Foulke
or Trevor Hoffman.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:39.010
But when I look at that graph,
one thing seems to hold up,

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:40.320
and the other one doesn't.

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.460
And I'm not sure if you
had a comment on that.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:43.960
Because he--

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.940
ANDY ANDRES: On Daniel Bard?

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:45.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:47.320
Because he seemed to
retain a lot of variance

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:51.686
from 2009 to 2011, but he
clearly lost almost all

00:59:51.686 --> 00:59:52.310
of his command.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.230
ANDY ANDRES: The observation
is he lost his command.

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:59.840
If you watch what he did, he
just started walking batters

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.660
everywhere.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.280
But that's not what this
dataset actually shows.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.930
So what this is
trying to represent

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:07.790
is the movement of the pitches.

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.300
And that's his
ability to spin it.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.870
AUDIENCE: But command is--
when you're a pitcher,

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.040
you're expecting the ball
to behave a certain way.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.630
When I look at a graph like
this and I see a tight cluster,

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.280
it means that the
pitch is predictable.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.650
And so the pitcher
can command the pitch

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.490
by assuming that it's
going to go a certain way.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:27.840
And then if you go
two slides ahead,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.800
as the fastball graphs
start to spread out,

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.460
it means that he's
walking players.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.630
He's lost command.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.520
But he still has a
lot of variation.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.440
His slider is actually breaking
even more than it was before.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.580
ANDY ANDRES: I think
this is not representing

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.320
the strike zone and command.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.010
I could do another graph
which shows you how well he's

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.450
hitting his spots.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:53.340
This is a measure of
movement of the pitch.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.120
So we're not really getting
is he hitting his spots.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.260
So you're right.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.070
If I were getting at
command another way,

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.360
I'd look at how
well he's clustering

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:07.020
around a certain band where
I want the pitches to go.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.550
But you mentioned
something really important.

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.590
You mentioned this
idea of sequencing,

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:16.290
the idea of not
being consistent, not

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.270
showing the same thing.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:23.110
Advanced analytics today--
and there's real teams who

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:27.190
understand this that
others don't-- this idea

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:30.680
of sequencing, this
idea of understanding

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.560
a pitcher-catcher-- being
in sync about a certain set

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.250
of pitches, different kinds
of pitches, different pitches,

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.460
different locations to different
batters and how that's working.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.020
So sequencing is really
important-- really,

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.270
really important.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.800
This graph is showing more
his ability to spin the pitch.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.890
Something happened to
Daniel Bard after 2010.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.920
And it's sort of a mystery,
because he had such talent.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.090
It wasn't age.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.400
It wasn't injury.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.410
Something happened where he
just couldn't spin it as well.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.020
He couldn't spin
the pitches as well.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.940
ANDY ANDRES: Yes, 2012
he started to start.

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.850
But it was actually his choice.

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:15.680
If you go back and look
it up, he wanted to start.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.200
Very interesting scenario here.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.270
Daniel Bard is--
someone is going

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.780
to write a great book
about Daniel Bard someday.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.830
Maybe one of you.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.610
AUDIENCE: So you showed a huge
difference between the stadiums

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:32.879
and the number of runs.

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:34.670
Do you have any idea
what's going on there?

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.239
Are these smaller stadiums?

01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:38.530
ANDY ANDRES: Smaller stadiums,
but their biggest effect

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:41.894
is the players they have.

01:02:41.894 --> 01:02:42.560
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.090
AUDIENCE: Toronto was
number four on that list.

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:45.240
ANDY ANDRES: Yeah.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.100
Toronto was up there.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.058
Baltimore was up there.

01:02:47.058 --> 01:02:49.480
These guys-- they have players
who hit a lot of home runs.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.199
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:51.740
ANDY ANDRES: But it
is also the park.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.710
Trust me.

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:57.050
Fences in, altitude
up, more home runs.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:59.590
But the players you have
also determine that.

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:01.360
One of the lower
teams was Atlanta.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.880
Atlanta is-- I don't know
if anyone is Braves fan,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.509
but Atlanta is in--
this is a season where

01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:08.300
they're rebuilding.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.730
They have weaker hitters than
they would like, I'm sure.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:19.234
And so they have low home
rates at their home park.

01:03:19.234 --> 01:03:20.650
AUDIENCE: Do you
know if anyone is

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.024
trying to design a ballpark
so that it would be more home

01:03:23.024 --> 01:03:23.700
runs?

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.291
Is that allowed in the sport?

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.790
ANDY ANDRES: I think
people do that.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:27.456
I think they do.

01:03:27.456 --> 01:03:33.370
Because there was a famous
advertisement by two pitchers,

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:36.210
Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine from Billerica.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:41.940
And the advertisement was that
their pitchers and all the fans

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.780
were appreciating all
the home run hitters.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.630
So the phrase was everyone
loves the fly ball.

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:55.410
So home runs and
runs, I think people

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:58.820
thought that was a way
to bring fans back,

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.330
more interesting fans.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.790
Thank you for your attention.

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.840
[APPLAUSE]
