00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:02.396
- [Voiceover] Let's get some
practice interpreting graphs

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:04.509
of proportional relationships.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.458
This says the proportion
relationship between the distance

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:10.786
driven and the amount of time driving

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:13.549
shown in the following graph,
so we have the distance driven

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.591
on the vertical axis, it's
measured in kilometers,

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.447
then we have the time driving
and it's measured in hours

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:21.606
along the horizontal axis.

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:24.137
We can tell just visually
that this, indeed,

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:27.109
is a proportional relationship,
how do we know that?

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.139
Well, the point (0, 0) is on this graph,

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:32.113
the graph goes through the origin.

00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:35.930
If we have zero time, then we
have zero distance, and we can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.536
also see that it's a line, then
it's a linear relationship.

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:40.569
If you have a linear
relationship that goes through

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.538
the origin, you're dealing with
a proportional relationship.

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.411
You could also see that by
taking out some points here.

00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:49.189
Let's see, I'm just eyeballing,
so I'm gonna look at where

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:52.510
does the graph kind of hit
a very well-defined point.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.331
Actually, point A right
over here, we see that when

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.787
our time is five hours,

00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:03.191
our distance travelled or driven

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.042
is 400 km.

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:12.799
Then if we look at time,
this point right over here,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.233
when our time is 2.5,

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.683
we see that our distance driven is 200 km.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:23.248
And notice, the ratio
between these variables

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:25.912
at any one of these points is the same.

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:30.028
400 divided by five is 80,

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:33.410
and 200 divided by 2.5
is also going to be 80.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.705
Or if you wanna go the other way around,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.285
to go from time to distance,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:44.173
we're always multiplying by 80.

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:48.004
In fact, we can say that
distance divided by time,

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:52.366
our proportionality
constant is going to be 80.

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.183
Or if we wanted to
include the units there,

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:56.040
it might be a little
more obvious than dealing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.616
with the rate, distance is in
kilometers, time is in hours,

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:03.537
80 km per hour,

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:05.673
this is the rate at which we are driving.

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:09.016
We are going at this
speed, 80 km per hour.

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:13.031
This is also the proportionality constant.

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.398
Anyway, with all of that out of the way,

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.540
let's actually answer the questions.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.738
Which statements about the graph are true?

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.131
Select all that apply.

00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:23.879
The vertical coordinate
of point A represents

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.850
the distance driven in four hours.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.938
The vertical coordinate.

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:33.820
So point A is at the coordinate (5, 400).

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.968
The vertical coordinate
tells us how high to go up,

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.802
how far to move in the vertical direction.

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:41.683
That's gonna be the second
coordinate right over here,

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.796
so this is the vertical coordinate.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.838
This right over here tells
us the distance we've driven

00:02:46.838 --> 00:02:49.996
in four hours, so yes, the
vertical coordinate of point A

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:52.527
represents the distance
driven in four hours.

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:56.656
We've driven 400 km, I like
that one, I'll check that one.

00:02:56.656 --> 00:03:00.698
The distance driven in one hour is 80 km.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.553
When you just try to eyeball
it off of the graph here,

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.978
I see, after one hour, it
looks like it's a little bit

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:13.217
at more than 75, so yeah, 80
seems like a reasonable one.

00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:14.918
But we see it even more
clearly when we look

00:03:14.918 --> 00:03:16.560
at the calculation that we did.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.491
If you take a distance,
any one of these distance,

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.996
400 km over five hours,

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:29.219
tells you that your rate

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.329
is 80 km per hour,

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.079
and you know this is going
to happen for any point

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.447
on this line, they tell us it's
a proportional relationship,

00:03:36.447 --> 00:03:39.101
and we can tell, visually, it's
a proportional relationship.

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.385
It goes through the
origin and it is a line.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.598
So the distance travelled in
one hour is going to be 80 km

00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:50.339
'cause we're going 80 km per hour.

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:53.411
So in one hour, we're gonna go 80 km.

00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.058
So I like that choice as
well, of course, I won't pick

00:03:56.058 --> 00:03:59.541
none of the above because I
found two choices that I liked.

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:02.235
Let's do another one
of these, this is fun.

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:05.475
A grocery story sells cashews.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.763
The relationship between
weight and cost of cashews

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:11.575
is shown in the following
graph, and once again,

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:13.357
we see it is a proportional relationship.

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.096
It goes through the
origin, and it is a line.

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:19.579
Which statements about the graph are true?

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.762
Select all that apply.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.416
The point (0, 0) shows the cost.

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.783
It's $0 for 0 kg of cashews.

00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:30.758
Yeah, 0 kg of cashews, it's $0.

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:32.702
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:36.208
The point (2, 60), that's
this point right over here,

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:40.371
shows the cost is $2 for 60 kg

00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:44.784
of cashews, the cost is
$2 for 60 kg of cashews.

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:49.586
No, this is showing us
that the cost is $60

00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:52.396
the cost is $60

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:56.563
for 2 kg of cashews.

00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:00.213
This axis right over here is
weight, actually, if you're

00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:02.694
measuring kilograms, you're
really talking about mass,

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:05.504
but I don't wanna get too particular here.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:09.550
You have a mass of 2 kg,
I guess you could say

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.035
the horizontal coordinate
tells you the mass.

00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:16.127
The vertical coordinate tells
you the cost, and that is $60.

00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:19.908
So it's $60 for 2 kg, not $2 for 60 kg.

00:05:19.908 --> 00:05:23.328
That would be a deal, if you could get,

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:26.743
this is what a medium-sized grown man

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.772
would weigh 60 kg, and
$2 for that much cashews,

00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:32.254
that would be an incredible deal.

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:33.996
So you definitely wanna rule that one out.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.970
And I'm not gonna pick none
of the above because I already

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.963
figured that I liked the
first choice up there.

00:05:39.963 --> 00:05:42.680
Let's just do one more,
just for good measure.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.652
An employee earns an hourly
wage shown in the graph below.

00:05:45.652 --> 00:05:48.325
Find the hourly wage.

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.921
We see here in the horizontal
axis, we have hours worked,

00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.964
and in the vertical axis, earnings.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:57.686
We see it's a proportional relationship.

00:05:57.686 --> 00:06:00.237
And that makes sense, the ratio
between earnings and hours

00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:02.280
should always be constant,
if we're earning money

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.227
at a constant rate, we see it visually,

00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:07.341
we go through the origin and
we're dealing with a line.

00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.647
So there's a bunch of ways
that we could look at it.

00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:12.185
We could say hours,

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:17.961
hours, then dollars.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.707
After one hour, we've made $40.

00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:22.346
And just the fact, visually, that we know

00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:24.219
it's a proportional
relationship says we're making

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.994
$40 per hour.

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.156
If we take dollars divided by hours,

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.442
I'll write out the units,

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:35.705
40 dollars divided by one hour.

00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:40.261
This right over here
is 40 dollars per hour.

00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:43.917
You could view this as our
proportionality constant,

00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:46.004
or you could use the rate in
which we're earning money,

00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:48.070
$40 per hour, and you see that.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.622
Two hours, $80.

00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:54.246
80 divided by two is 40.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:57.706
Three hours, $120.

00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:00.210
120 divided by three is 40.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.648
Our proportionality constant is 40.

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:06.050
That your earnings

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.444
divided by hours

00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:12.909
is always going to be equal to 40,

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.434
or you could say that your earnings

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.194
is equal to, if you multiply
both sides by hours,

00:07:21.194 --> 00:07:24.561
is going to be equal
to 40 times your hours.

00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:26.760
Your earnings in dollars
is going to be equal

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.517
to 40 times your hours.
