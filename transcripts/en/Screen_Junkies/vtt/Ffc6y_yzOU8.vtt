00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.800
After Ant Man, asked the question: "You ever watch Iron Man? But small?"

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.180
Marvel's latest solo movie invites you to ask another:

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.920
"You ever watch Iron Man, on weed?"

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.440
DOCTOR STRANGE

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.400
Experience the grand illusion (that you haven't seen this movie before), as you sit through the heroic origins of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.000
a cocky but capable, super rich, wise-cracking, workaholic with a weird goatee,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.900
in-love with a red-headed subordinate, learning to be less selfish, played by a famous Sherlock Holmes actor.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
Its like Iron Man! But, actually that's it. Its pretty much JUST like Iron Man.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.820
Magic has come to the Marvel universe, and not that it's just science b.s. that Thor went on about.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.140
"Your ancestors called it magic, and you call it science."

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.440
We're talking acid trips, 70's blacklight  poster magic that bends space and time in new plot-breaking ways.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.720
And uses mind-blowing effects to distract you from the fact that the action is still 90% punching

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.440
Umm... shouldn't that hurt his hands?

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.040
You cringed when he tried to do a Southern accent

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.040
"The power d-d-didn't go out... u-uh I forgot to set the clock... u-uh I'm sorry mom"

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.280
You weren't sure if he was serious when he attempted a Boston one

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.400
"You know what John.. Good to see you doing so well."

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.960
Now, Benedict Cumberbatch will sound like an English man, pretending to be a German man, pretending to be an American

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.540
In a featured length tribute to Hans Gruber's accent in Die Hard when he gets caught by Bruce Willis.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.860
"Please God, no you're one of them aren't you?"

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.040
"You care so much! Don't you?"

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.080
Benny, Bobby. Your natural voice is perfect, use it.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.660
Joining the titular strange on his journey from Act 1 protagonist, to Act 3 protagonist.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.820
Are side characters and villains (who are up to the usual Marvel standard).

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.960
Chiwetel Ejiofor, who's just kind of there to explain things.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.900
"Temporal manipulations can create branches in time."

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.440
"This is a relic. The sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the sanctums."

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.100
Mads Mikkelsen, playing a bad guy with weird eyes, for the third time in his career.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.040
Who's entire plan revolves around successfully ripping some pages out of a book,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.560
To summon a malevolent demon who he hopes will enslave the human race.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.820
"Not a great plan."

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.920
Tilda Swinton, a being of immense power.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.600
Bravely guarding the marvel cinematic universe from Asian actors.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.640
"She's Celtic"

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.340
And this cloak with more personality than any of the human beings.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.180
Ah-waghh *thud*

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.000
"Stop"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.020
Man, I want to see that cloak crossover with the rug in Aladdin so bad.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.180
Enjoy a visual masterpiece that has to be seen in 3-D on a giant screen to be fully appreciated.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.160
Because when you watch it on a laptop, you realize just how much of it is medical mumbo-jumbo.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.240
"You need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy."

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.740
"Look, I'm fusing transected
spinal cords, I'm
stimulating neurogenesis in
the central nervous system."

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.100
"Pass the stent down the
brachial artery into the radial artery."

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.020
"To complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury."

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.820
With a heaping side order of magic mumbo-jumbo.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.860
"The Dark Dimension makes
them more powerful in
the Mirror Dimension."

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.100
"I saw the rituals in
the book of Cagliostro."

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.340
"I pushed
your astral form out of your physical form."

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.500
"The Wand of Watoomb."

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.600
"The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr."

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.300
"The pages that Kaecilius stole."

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.500
"A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension."

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.700
Winguardian Levios-suck me sideways this is unnecessary.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.480
Just shoot laser beams out of your wand and be done with it.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.340
So enjoy a film that despite it's faults,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.340
doesn't fall into the third act trap

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
of battling a CGI army and a sky beam.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.020
Saves money by playing the same scene thirteen times in a row.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.980
"Dormammu! I've come to bargain."

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.460
And sends a powerful message to the children.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.960
Modern medicine can't be trusted.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960
"My spirit deepened, and somehow..."

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.120
"- Your body healed."

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.700
"- Yes."

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.530
And don't text and drive.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.260
*tires screech, crash*

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Because you might end up turning into a wizard.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.160
"I'm not sure what to do with my hands" - Ricky Bobby

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.060
So Cumberbatch did the motion capture for Dormammu himself.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.960
Man, he really likes to goof around in leotards huh.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.320
"Nonnnne, can stop me!"

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.300
*pants*

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.920
*hisses*

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.900

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.340
And please stop yelling at us about aluminum.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.400
We get it.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.701
"Dormammu I've come to bargain."

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:13.500
*repeats for about 5 times*
