Hey citizens of Earth, Trace here.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.149
Most climate scientists agree that climate
change is happening and that humans are to

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.220
blame.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.660
Greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and
methane that we’ve been pumping into the

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.180
atmosphere have been capturing heat from the
sun’s rays, and average annual temperatures

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.110
have been on the rise since the industrial
revolution.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.430
The common wisdom is we need to drastically
cut back the amount of greenhouse gasses we

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.830
emit, but what if instead we just reduced
the amount of sunlight we receive so greenhouse

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.820
gasses can’t soak up as much heat?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.890
If that sounds crazy to you, it’s probably
because it kind of is.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.760
Projects that would accomplish that would
require engineering feats on a global scale,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.180
hence why it’s called “geoengineering.”

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.600
Geoengineering ideas to fight climate change
stretch all the way back to 1965 when science

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.690
advisors to President Lyndon B Johnson proposed
covering 13 millions square kilometers of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.899
ocean with reflective particles to bounce
1% of the sun’s rays back into space.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.829
As you can tell by how un-fabulous our oceans
are right now, we never ended up glitter bombing

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:01.829
the Pacific.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.900
But geoengineering ideas still crop up from
time to time, lurking at the fringe of the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
climate change discussion.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.260
They run the gamut from painting everyone’s
roof white, to drone ships that make ocean

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.670
clouds brighter, to launching a giant mirror
into space.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.040
All of these plans have one thing in common
though: They’re all trying to increase the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.330
Earth’s albedo, which is a measure of how
much light we reflect back into space, as

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.330
well as the name of my hispanic alter ego.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.410
There are a lot of reasons none of these ideas
have gained any ground though.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.790
First, as you might imagine, intentionally
changing the entire world would be kind of

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.790
expensive.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.140
And in a time when the scientific community
is STILL trying to convince the powers that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.250
be that climate change is both a real and
serious threat, it’s going to be hard to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.909
get those same powers to shell out funding
for something crazy like a mirror in space.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.400
Ironically, the cost of these projects will
likely be relatively small compared to fixing

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.120
the damage caused by climate change in the
long run.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.190
Second, these ideas may have side effects
that would change the world in unintended

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.190
ways.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.070
One of the most popular and realistic geoengineering
proposals is to release sulfate particles

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.669
into the air, which would combine with water
vapor to form aerosols that reflect sunlight.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.200
Large volcanic eruptions do the same thing
and cause temperatures to dip for a few years.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.049
Unfortunately, these sulfates also react with
chlorine in the atmosphere, converting it

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.349
to a form that destroys the ozone layer.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.930
Basically these geoengineering projects might
be like that time you tried to fix your car

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.620
yourself, and it worked for a bit until it
broke in a more expensive way.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.220
But the biggest reason geoengineering still
isn’t considered the solution to climate

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.079
change is because it doesn’t solve the root
of the problem, if anything it encourages

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.099
us to never actually fix it.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.109
We have a hard enough time changing our lifestyles
now, and if people learned that we could spray

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.459
sulfates in the atmosphere every few years
and we could keep burning coal, oil, and natural

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.199
gas, why would anyone change?

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.669
And if we don’t curb the rate we put greenhouse
gasses into the atmosphere, then the problem

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.920
will only get worse, and the situations we’ll
have to engineer our way out of will get more

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920
extreme.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.529
Another ambitious geoengineering idea sprung
up lately: replenishing arctic ice with millions

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.629
of windmills.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.739
Jules gets into the details here.

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.319
So knowing the risks and rewards of geoengineering,
are you on board or do you think we should

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.219
focus on cutting emissions.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.980
Let us know in the comments and come back
here every day for more.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.459
Thanks for watching!
