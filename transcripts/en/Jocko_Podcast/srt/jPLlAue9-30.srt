1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,780
Jocko.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,920
Have you ever had a person you couldn't
get through to someone that you couldn't

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,880
manipulate? Then what? What do
you do when you can't get through?

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,820
Well, yeah, of course. Um,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,880
I've had people that I could not get
through to and generally speaking,

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,090
these people, I like level 12 arrogance.
That's what they are. Giant ego.

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,170
That's what causes this.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,580
There was quite a few seal
leaders that I dealt with.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,500
I shouldn't say quite a few.

10
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,680
There were several seal leaders that I
dealt with that were like that and have

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,720
several business leaders that I've
dealt with that I would like that.

12
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,210
In podcast number five,
I read that counseling letter,

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,260
corrective measures to a guy that was
really arrogant and despite that letter,

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,990
he did not change and he got fired.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,120
So what do you do when you got someone
that you can't get through to you?

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,610
You fire them. What if they're, if,

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,640
and here's what you gotta do is what
makes that tricky is that some people,

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,120
and this May this,
this make people freak out.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,470
There's some people that is such good
performers that even though they're

20
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:15,471
slightly negative on maybe
their team participation,

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,550
but they're so good that that
offsets their negativity, right?

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,290
And that happens. It happens. You
know what happens with sales people,

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,390
sales people are, are in order to be in
a sales position, you gotta be confident.

24
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,790
You gotta be aggressive. You've
got to be somewhat arrogant, right?

25
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,200
You got to believe in yourself.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,190
And so some salespeople take that to
the extreme where they're just like,

27
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:37,890
I don't need to listen to what you're
telling me. The new procedures are,

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,770
screw that. I'm the one that's
doing the big dollars over here.

29
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,460
How much you follow my procedures,
boys, right? So, so that happens.

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,520
Well then what you gotta do
is you've got to look, does,

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,760
is this guy producing so now that can
create problems within their team.

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,780
And you have to balance those
things. Is this guy, uh,

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,120
is the negative media,

34
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:01,980
is creating offset by the awesome
productivity that he's doing.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,170
And furthermore, if the
guys that good, hey,

36
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,380
maybe we should be modeling some things
after them. I got no problem with that.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,140
If you're the best performer,
cool. I want to imitate you.

38
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,820
I want to get my people to imitate you.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,660
So that happens at the other
place where you might see it.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,750
A similar situation is a leader that
does really good with their relationships

41
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:25,170
down the chain of command,
for instance,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,430
but really has bad relations up
the chain of command. So again,

43
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,590
you've got to ask yourself,
okay, if I fire this leader,

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,080
how many of these people that he has great
relationships are now going to leave?

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
And what kind of detriment
is that to the team?

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,160
The that can also happen with someone
that's doesn't debt tweets their people

47
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,940
like crap, but up the chain of command,
everyone thinks he's great and end.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,210
He's getting the mission done by the way,
right?

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,130
He's a slave driver and he's creating
total animosity between him and his team,

50
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,490
but he's accomplishing the mission.
So now what do you do? There's risk.

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,460
Everyone could quit,
there's rescue could fire them,

52
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:00,910
and now you don't accomplish
the mission anymore.

53
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,270
This is why leadership is hard and this
is why you have to balance everything.

54
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,130
You have to balance those things,
but talked about it a bunch of times.

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,700
If you get someone, you coach them, you
mentor them, you do everything you can,

56
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,550
you have flank them, you do
Jujitsu, mental Jujitsu on them,

57
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,500
you try and get them squared
away and eventually if you can't,

58
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,000
you weigh against, you know, how
it's gonna affect the situation.

59
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,060
And then in many cases you got to
let them go. And we fired, you know,

60
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,330
we fired five,
saw plenty of seals,

61
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,230
get fired from leadership
positions. Um, and,

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,890
and same thing with, you know, obviously
you work with consulting businesses.

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,280
We see all kinds of people getting fired
because they're either not capable of

64
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,100
doing their job,

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,240
they're too arrogant and
they don't recognize that
things are going sideways and

66
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,160
they're just thinking that they're
doing everything perfectly. No,

67
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,720
that's not gonna work out well
for you. Hmm. Yeah. What did,

68
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,250
um, I think his life, he said no,

69
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,350
someone asked him, uh, you
know, when do you know, when's
that line where it's like,

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,500
when it's time to fire someone.
And he was like, in a nutshell,

71
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:13,140
there's a lot to it, but in
a nutshell, which I thought
was dope. Um, he said it's,

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,540
you know, you're at that point when
we were, you fire someone when, um,

73
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,600
when you don't feel bad about it,
right? So it's like, yeah, you,

74
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,340
you every tried everything. And,
and there's also people boots,

75
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,900
there's some validity to this that say
the first time you think you should fire

76
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,590
someone, you should fire them. That's
the other end of the spectrum, right?

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,820
And what that means is when you're looking
at someone and you're going, man, okay,

78
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,970
I can save them, I can help them. That's
the kind of advice you'd give to someone.

79
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,590
That's, that's a, that's got
a maternal instinct, right?

80
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,150
That you meet someone,
Hey,

81
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,150
I know what this guy is just a good guy
and everyone on my team is great and

82
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,140
everyone's going to do a great job.

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,940
You can't tell that person what
Lafe and I normally tell people,

84
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,560
which is when you feel good about it,

85
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,950
you should fire him because that person
will never feel good about firing

86
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,950
anybody just to ball. Okay. See what I'm
saying? Cause he just said, done this guy.

87
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,540
I know he's going to make it. He's, no,
he's going to come around, you know I,

88
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,490
and then they, then they start playing
the, the extreme ownership game, which is,

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,590
you know, if I would've given
echo a better direction,

90
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,210
he would have been able to do this.
It's my fault.

91
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,550
I've given an echo 17 re iterations of
this and he still didn't complete it

92
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,370
correctly. He's fired. That's the
way it works, right? There's, yeah.

93
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,740
So the balance, so that
spectrum of, of, you know,

94
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,850
being within the confines of
being justified, firing somebody,

95
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,020
a certain type of person, you got to say
when you don't feel bad about it. Right,

96
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,340
right. I mean, that's like a
fire heavy type dude. Right.
But there's also someone,

97
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,660
the reason you shouldn't feel bad about
it is because I've done everything I can

98
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,340
do to help you, which takes work.
It takes effort. It takes tact.

99
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,440
It takes hard conversations because
it's hard for me to go and say, Echo,

100
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:56,380
you know, I've been, I've been looking
at your videos lately and they're,

101
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,610
they're not really what we're looking for,
right?

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,490
And I don't want to say that to
you. You know, it's uncomfortable.

103
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,760
And we're kind of like, you know, we, we,
we want to get along. So instead I'm like,

104
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,070
yeah, I called that. That video
was good, man. Yeah, it's good,

105
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,620
but I'm not telling you the truth.
And then over time,

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,070
our videos are looking good enough. And
eventually I said, you know what? No,

107
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,460
we're not.

108
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,300
No one's buying our videos anymore
and we haven't gotten a new contracts.

109
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,440
So guess what? I'm going to have to
let you go. And you're like, well,

110
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,600
you're talking about, you said all
the videos I made were good. No,

111
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,620
you're firing me. Maybe you
need to be able to become a
better salesperson. Right?

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,760
Whereas if I had the hard conversation
early and said, hey, echo, you know,

113
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:33,770
I know you're creative
and I appreciate that,

114
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,060
but we also need to get the
message across for our clients. Um,

115
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,400
obviously fabricating of business
where we're making videos for clients,

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,650
which I know we don't really do a lot
of anymore. Occasionally you do. But uh,

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,370
but yeah, you got to, you got to, um,

118
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
have the harder conversations earlier.

119
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,610
If I'm the type of person that doesn't
like to have the hard conversations,

120
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,730
once again, I never feel good
about it because I never,

121
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,470
I never gave you any advice. So it always
feels bad for me to fire someone. Yeah.

122
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,010
But if you're following
good leadership tactics,

123
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,180
then absolutely true. When you get to
a point where you gotta fire somebody,

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,880
you won't feel bad about it because you
know, you've done everything you can,

125
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,391
you know,

126
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:18,020
you've coached and mentored them and
you know that if you keep them on board,

127
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,350
you are negatively impacting
your team, which is bad. Yeah.

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,330
And then go down to the other side of
the spectrum still within the confines of

129
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,310
being justified in firing somebody,
by the way.

130
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,710
But on the other side of the spectrum,
you get how you say that,

131
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:35,190
what do you call the month
maternal instinct type of
person. The person who can,

132
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:39,000
like, they're just super hard on
themselves maybe, or they're, you know,

133
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,700
like I even if you did do
everything you can, you still like,

134
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,570
I could have done more,
you know, so it's my fault,

135
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:47,550
not his kind of feel like I let them
down as a leader gave them 17 counseling

136
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:52,200
chits. Yeah. You know, they don't belong
here. They can't do their job stop. Yeah.

137
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,870
Meanwhile they're going home laughing
at you or whatever. But yeah,

138
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,970
you get that kind of personality.
So it's kind of like how you say,

139
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:59,640
you got to balance it. You gotta be
like, okay, you gotta recognize, okay,

140
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,740
what kind of person am I,
you know?

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Or what kind of person is this
other person kind of thing.

142
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,040
And if they're those maternal instinct
jewel for lack of better way of putting

143
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:08,880
it a person,

144
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,180
then what was it the first time
you feel like you should fire him,

145
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,970
you should fire him. You hang out on that
side of the spectrum. You've got it. Yup.

146
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,750
Yeah.
Yup.
