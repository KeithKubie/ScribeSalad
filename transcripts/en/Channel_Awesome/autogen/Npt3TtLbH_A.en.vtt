00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
characters and through a way that they
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.470
characters and through a way that they
haven't really done yet so in some

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
haven't really done yet so in some
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.869
haven't really done yet so in some
respects it's exactly what we wanted but

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.210
real problem is it's not an experience
it's a sequel to an experience trying to

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220
it's a sequel to an experience trying to
 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.490
it's a sequel to an experience trying to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500
clearly be better and in some cases it
 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.469
clearly be better and in some cases it
is but because we've already seen a lot

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479
is but because we've already seen a lot
 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.050
is but because we've already seen a lot
of this before it's not as much blowing

us away but it's still a lot of fun I
 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.250
us away but it's still a lot of fun I
definitely recommend it doesn't have

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260
definitely recommend it doesn't have
 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.779
definitely recommend it doesn't have
stuff that doesn't make sense are there

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789
stuff that doesn't make sense are there

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280
one I don't think this is the
 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.100
one I don't think this is the
groundbreaking sequel they were hoping

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110
groundbreaking sequel they were hoping
 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.500
groundbreaking sequel they were hoping
for but at the same time we didn't get a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.990
for but at the same time we didn't get a
bad film by any means I think if they

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000
bad film by any means I think if they
 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.700
bad film by any means I think if they
did want to blow us away they would

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710
did want to blow us away they would
 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.680
did want to blow us away they would

this is happening in Hollywood is pretty

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
this is happening in Hollywood is pretty
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.909
this is happening in Hollywood is pretty
amazing so maybe they couldn't pull it

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919
amazing so maybe they couldn't pull it
 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.890
amazing so maybe they couldn't pull it
off but that's the reason people weren't

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900
off but that's the reason people weren't
 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.469
off but that's the reason people weren't
as blown away they wanted a lot more and

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
as blown away they wanted a lot more and
 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.870
as blown away they wanted a lot more and
instead they got a little more in many

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880
instead they got a little more in many
 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.580
instead they got a little more in many

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789
first one hell I probably prefer
 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.820
first one hell I probably prefer
watching this one to the first one but

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830
watching this one to the first one but
 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.469
watching this one to the first one but
it's not the groundbreaking follow-up

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479
it's not the groundbreaking follow-up
