Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. When will it snap back? I mean it's coming. Trump. That's what Trump's press. What that is. He's Gunna win again. He's going to win again or the WHO can beat him. They're not going to beat it. There's no one who can write. He's going to win again. He's going to win again because of shit like this. The more shit like this happens. There's a then what's after chunk down. Then there's another four years son Donald Jr Donald J. Donald Jr was a with a friend of a friend of mine. His name is crispy and he, he's a disabled veteran or a shit. He's very able, I should say, but he's a wounded veteran. He's, he was missing, he had his leg amputated, Burns over most of his body. Super positive attitude. Great Guy. Anyways, he doesn't get political online. He took a picture with Donald Trump jr right, and Instagram took it down for violating their terms of service.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's just a photo picture of just photo with hesitant son. Yeah. Photo with him at Trump jr standing there and they took the picture down. What that, what are you doing? Yeah, maybe that's say hitch. Did they ever, when they do that that it gives you a reason or they just do what they want? Well, he posted it on his, he sent me a direct message about it too. I asked, I actually reached out to him, cause a on follow him and he follows me and I was like, this is this shit real. And he's like, Yup. And he's super positive about it. I mean this is the guy who served our country too and he's, he's a great guy. Like his, his, his, his, his uh, Instagram handle is crispy 11 B. Okay. Yeah. And he just put it up there and they said that they got him for terms of service and they took it down and he put it back up again.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Good. Good for him. So this is the photo right here. I'm going to say when asked to Instagram says that they didn't do it so they didn't do it, but who took it down that said, however, an Instagram spoke first and told Fox News. The post was reviewed but was not deleted by the company after I found the post did not violate their standards. But that's not true because it's missing. Spokesperson said that there are a number of reasons at post may no longer be available, including the account holder deletes either the account or the post. He's saying he didn't do that, so it could have been something else. Mm. I mean you can't prove it. Yeah. I don't know. Well this dude is not an attention whore. You wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that in lie about it. That's ridiculous. I mean, Twitter, Instagram could be lying and I just never really could be a glitch too.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Yeah. You know, sometimes it's a for two at as glitch. That looks like a massive conspiracy. Yeah, but he said they'd send them notice. It said it violated the terms of services. So if he said that, okay. Yeah, that's what was said back to me. Pretty sure that's the screenshot you'll want to make sure that's what he says. You violated something. Yeah. That's what you want. I mean, it's just so weird what's going on now. This is, everything just seemed so fucking preposterous. Yeah. Just like on Facebook, Twitter, all that stuff. If I get, if it's something negative, I just, you know, that's gone. I don't, I don't let, I don't let people just start bashing me on that stuff. I just, okay, here it is. Once I landed, I opened up Instagram and got a message that your post was taken down for violating Instagram guidelines,

Speaker 2:          03:07          so yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Did he post that? Yes, he did. Oh, there you go. Wait a minute. Let me see what it did.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:15          yeah. He posted a thing saying it. Okay. Here's what he posted. Yeah. It said wounded veteran violated community standards by posting with Donald Trump jr he didn't post the actual notification, but he probably didn't even save it. Right. Why would you, yeah. He's, I believe him. I believe him. I just somebody, you're right. It is a sad, I think you also have overzealous employees. I think there's that too. Yeah. I think there's probably a huge company. Yeah. I mean, you, anybody can go row, get a minute and just do what the what the what the where they want. You think the reading Dick Pics and kind of just been fucking with them on the other way. The other way around. Someone could've just flagged it via a bunch of bots. It's just made up disappear. Oh right. To get a reaction like this. Yeah. That's all. It could be simple as that. Can you do that? Sure. So if you just had a bot to do it right, I could do it right now. Instagram review it manually before they delete it. No, cause I can just be taken down. It happens on other accounts for that doesn't get reviewed that way and it just got taken down because it got flagged so many times. I don't know.
