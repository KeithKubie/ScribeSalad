00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.190
But the neat thing about electrons is that
we can manipulate them,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.270
as we saw with those magnets.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.730
We can speed them up and slow them down. We
can change direction.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.880
We can change the wavelength of the electron
beam.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.350
And if we make it small enough, we can use
electrons to see very small things.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.470
We can make an electron microscope.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.410
An electron microscope sort of on this bench
here.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.310
We could use that to take pictures down towards
the level of molecules.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.070
Let's see what we do.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.910
So here is a picture of a pin head that's
been taken with an electron microscope.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
It's still recognisable to you as a pin.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
And if we go in and look in more detail, you
can see bacteria on the surface of the pin.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.960
You can also see the grooves in the pin where
it's been ground.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.530
And let's go in still further.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.980
Well here they begin to look like fish fingers.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.550
We haven't yet got to the level of molecules.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.850
Now with more sophisticated versions similar
to this sort of device

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120
nowadays we can take pictures like this,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.010
right the way down to the level of atoms.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.540
And here we have, what looks like a mountain
canyon.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.950
Sheer cliffs. Those cliffs are probably hundreds
of atoms high.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.380
So if you were an atomic mountaineer you could
climb up and down them.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.880
But what's really wonderful is that now we
can take movie images and zoom in.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.159
We can pretend that we've got atomic spectacles

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.670
and we're going to go on an atomic plane ride.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.820
And travel around and see this is a sheet
of copper seen from above

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.210
with atomic spectacles.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.270
Let's see what shows up on our plane ride.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.600
So we start gradually moving in and we see
these canyons flying beneath the plane.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.310
You can see marks on the surface,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.280
but for the moment let's concentrate on those
huge cliffs.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.409
Just like the Grand Canyon.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.870
Now away from the cliffs, what to our eye
appear to be smooth surface,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.690
we see here there are atoms on there and gradations.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.310
It looks somewhat like flying around above
the clouds in a regular plane.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.000
And this thing coming up looks like the vortex
of a tornado

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.130
but it's just where one or two atoms are missing.
That sort of thing.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.940
So you're seeing here the surface of what
to your eye appears to be smooth

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.500
but with atomic spectacles you see has got
incredible structure.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.170
Now the real power is that once you can see
individual atoms like this,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.340
it gives you the possibility to move them
around,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.390
put them in special places where you want
to.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.200
And here some scientists at IBM in the States
have gathered together some iron atoms

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.810
and put them one by one in a circle.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.980
But what's really interesting in this picture
is what's going on in the of that circle.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680
What we're looking at here is the surface
of copper.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.400
Now copper is a conductor, the electrons swim
around freely.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.560
But once they're trapped inside this circle
and can't get out, they form waves.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.209
Just like if you filled up a plastic or styrofoam
cup with coffee

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.630
and dragged it across the floor, it would
set up waves on the surface.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.730
They're called crispations one of the words
I've used in doing these lectures.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.230
This is the analogue at the atomic level.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.500
You're seeing electron waves set up in this
ring of iron atoms.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.620
And that's the key. These are the electron
waves.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.140
By manipulating the electrons, we can change
the length of those waves.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.150
We can make them smaller and smaller.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170
And go and see smaller and smaller things.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.560
The only thing that limits us is how much
energy we put in to those electron beams.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.220
To make the waves smaller and smaller.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.750
All I have to do is make a larger electron
microscope.
