years ago when I was working in Korea
where it was really at the early stages

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
where it was really at the early stages
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.150

of convergence so putting things

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160
of convergence so putting things
 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.699
of convergence so putting things
together and saying let's take a phone

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
together and saying let's take a phone
 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.590
together and saying let's take a phone
and let's put a camera basically

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
and let's put a camera basically
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.930
and let's put a camera basically
together with it and that was like the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940
together with it and that was like the
 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.620
together with it and that was like the
first camera phone some years ago and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
first camera phone some years ago and
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.090

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.170
why because consumers didn't really see
a need for them and also because they

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180
a need for them and also because they
 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.140
a need for them and also because they
