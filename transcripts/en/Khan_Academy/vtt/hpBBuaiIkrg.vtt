00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.150
Which function increases as
x increases toward infinity

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.010
and decreases as x decreases
toward negative infinity?

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.430
So let's think about each
of these constraints.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.550
So, first, which function
increases as x increases?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.670
So as x increases
toward infinity.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.270
So x is going in that direction.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.270
So first let's look
at f of x over here.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.100
So f of x, as we get beyond this
minimum point right over here,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.790
as we increase our x, f of
x seems to be increasing.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.620
So f of x seems to make
the first constraint.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.610
Now let's think about g of x.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.270
Once we get past this minimum
point right over here,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.470
as x gets larger and
larger and larger,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.060
as it approaches
infinity, g of x

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.790
seems to be getting larger
and larger and larger.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.340
g of x is moving up.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.410
So g of x also seems to
make this first constraint.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.980
Now let's think about h of x.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.400
As x moves towards
infinity, as x

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.515
moves towards positive infinity,
h of x seems to be decreasing.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.500
So h of x does not even
make the first constraint.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.480
So our only two possibilities
are now g of x and f of x.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.650
So which of these
decrease as x decreases

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.870
toward negative infinity?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.350
So let's think about
that, x decreasing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690
toward negative infinity.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.150
We're going to be going
in that direction.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.070
So first let's look at f of x.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.360
So f of x, it kind of
goes up and down here.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.340
But after we hit this
little local maximum

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.390
point-- this was a local
minimum point over here,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.240
not at a global one--
as we move to the left

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.160
of this local maximum point,
as we get smaller and smaller

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.970
x's, we see that the
function is decreasing.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.200
So it does seem to meet
the second constraint.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
It decreases as x decreases
toward negative infinity.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980
So it meets that constraint.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.380
Now, what about g of x?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.070
After we have this
minimum point--

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.700
and actually it looks like
a global minimum point--

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.330
after we hit this minimum point
right over here, as x decreases

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.870
toward negative infinity, g
of x seems to be increasing,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.270
not decreasing.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.330
So g of x does not meet
the second constraint.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.590
So the only function that
met both constraints seems

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.069
to be f of x.
