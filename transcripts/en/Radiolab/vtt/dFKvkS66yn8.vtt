1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.420
I should wait.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.690
<v 1>You're listening to radio,</v>

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.770
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.170
[inaudible],

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.050
<v 0>c n n p. R.</v>

6
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.280
Everyone Jad here from radio lab. This is radio lab, the podcast,

7
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.270
something of the different this week and we're not going to do science.

8
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:26.950
No big ideas today. Actually, I want to introduce you to an amazing musician.

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.030
Can you do like a loop loop so I can just make sure that that's getting, yeah.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.113
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.040
<v 1>if you happen to catch our war,</v>

12
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.640
the world shows was our live show that we did in Minnesota.

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.390
You may have noticed some really beautiful,

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.340
lush Chillo textures threaded all throughout that hour.

15
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:52.090
All those textures were played live by Mrs Zoe Keating.

16
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.160
Who is right here next to me. Hello?

17
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.930
<v 0>Hello Chad. How are you? I'm great. And we're sitting in San Francisco,</v>

18
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.420
so this is a bit of a of a, of an excursion,

19
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.810
but lucky enough I get to sit here and listen to you play because during the

20
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.230
performance there was a point where we actually stopped chatting and you just

21
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.560
played for people and it was amazing. People loved it,

22
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.660
but it was only people in the audience that got to hear it.

23
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:19.880
So this gives everybody else a chance to hear it too. So, uh,

24
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
maybe you could start by explaining all of these blinking lights that are near

25
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.070
you. Like you're sitting here with, uh, with, uh,

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.140
a gorgeous kind of Mahogany colored cello, but then behind you are,

27
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.530
is a laptop and some computer electronic type stuff. So what,

28
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.090
what exactly is all this? Um, well,

29
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.580
I'm basically doing layered tello by,

30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.230
I'm playing cello and then using a combination of a foot controller and a

31
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:49.650
computer to record each layer and then play it back for the audience. So, um,

32
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.450
what I might do is, uh,

33
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.820
I'll just sort of play a loop and then you can see how it happens for mind your

34
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:57.760
way here with different girls. Okay. So I basically,

35
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:01.970
I got this foot pedal and I'm going to record a single line like this.

36
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.883
<v 3>Eh,</v>

37
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.180
<v 1>sometimes you get a little artifacts in there, but it's kind of Nice.</v>

38
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.230
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] then I might add another one.</v>

39
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.293
[inaudible] [inaudible]

40
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.553
[inaudible]

41
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.690
<v 1>so that can just play and I can wander off,</v>

42
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.850
<v 0>chat with the audience or have a drink.</v>

43
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.010
It's like little bits of you from the past. Keep coming into the present. Yeah,

44
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.860
yeah. It is like that. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes you know,

45
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.230
hearing your past over and over again can get a little boring.

46
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.180
So you might want to start changing it.

47
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.613
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

48
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.783
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

49
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.220
<v 4>I might take them away. I think that it's,</v>

50
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.950
no,

51
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.950
<v 0>so essentially it's like you can create multiples of you and then sort of just</v>

52
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:38.130
using your feet.

53
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.350
You can make some of you go away and then some of you come back. Yep. So,

54
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.500
so w when, when we're, when we're listening to these pieces,

55
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.010
you're hearing these giant washes built and suddenly they drop out and you hear

56
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:52.650
just one of the lines and then all of a sudden they're back.

57
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.830
There's a sort of a, a bode baseline.

58
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.700
All that is sort of be crafted with your right foot. Yep. Okay. It's pretty,

59
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.900
you know, it's pretty simple. It's, yes. It's,

60
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.570
it's neat to see that you're funneling this just slightly passive version of

61
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:11.340
yourself into the present over in Dover. It's Kinda quantum in a weird way,

62
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.320
you know, I never thought of it that way. But you are

63
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.550
[inaudible] for better or for worse because if you make a mistake,

64
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.690
like I make lots of mistakes,

65
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.640
then that mistake is repeated over and over and over and over again. Yeah.

66
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.470
We supposed to make you very comfortable with your own mistakes.

67
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:31.950
At a certain point it does. You can't do this and be afraid of failure.

68
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.750
So you were in a band called recipe Tina. Tell me a little bit about that.

69
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:40.910
How do you go from being a classically trained cellist to a rock, rock star,

70
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.400
EAD kind of cellist? Like what does that, what is that transition like?

71
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.270
I didn't ever see it as a transition. It just seemed completely natural. Yeah.

72
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.010
I mean, I like rock music and, um, I think probably if I played guitar or bass,

73
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.980
I'd probably be playing guitar bass, but I just happened to play cello.

74
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.470
Well before we talk too much, what are you going to play his first? Uh, well,

75
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.030
I'm going to attempt to play a new piece, which, um,

76
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.570
that doesn't have a name. Okay. Um, it's, it's going to be on my new record.

77
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.820
Well, whenever you're ready.

78
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.050
<v 5>Um,</v>

79
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.400
<v 6>eh.</v>

80
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.553
[inaudible] [inaudible]

[inaudible] [inaudible]

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.793
[inaudible] [inaudible]

90
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.213
[inaudible].

91
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.270
<v 0>Wow. That's kind of how that works. Okay. Lord, let me just,</v>

92
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:44.510
before I fond too much, let me just plug this in. Wow. That didn't,

93
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.560
it's so much more fun when you can have all these layers and you can control

94
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:50.260
them. Yeah. I'm just curious about,

95
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.590
you said you didn't have a title for that piece that we just, yeah.

96
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.080
What does a title really do for a piece like that?

97
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.970
Like I guess what I'm asking is where,

98
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.080
what do you see or feel or where does a piece like that begin?

99
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:06.310
Does it begin as just a purely musical line or is it a picture in your head or a

100
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.040
feeling? It's a feeling. It's all really abstract.

101
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.200
That's why I have a really hard time coming up with titles because, um,

102
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.540
I don't like to assign specific meaning. It's cause it's, it's, it's a,

103
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.040
they mean everything and they mean nothing.

104
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.170
And so as soon as you put a title on something that gives it a meaning.

105
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:26.650
And so sometimes I like to make up words or have something completely random,

106
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.620
kind of like the madlibs version of making song titles,

107
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.920
but it usually starts as an idea. And, um,

108
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.360
so there'll be some sort of like emotion about it and I just try to keep that

109
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:42.190
emotion and see where it goes in a song. And that's all it is really. Yeah, no,

110
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.570
you were doing all kinds of things.

111
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:48.120
I didn't actually catch all of it because I closed my eyes and just sorta like,

112
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.100
I just sort of got taken with all the wash of sound.

113
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:55.870
But you're doing all kinds of things that were not strictly a traditional cello,

114
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.640
Boeing or you were hitting the chelates.

115
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.170
Can you explain to you how you were making all those sounds? Well, um,

116
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.500
I only have one cello and I like to make rhythms, so, so I might do that.

117
00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:06.310
Somebody like, which is like hitting the bone,

118
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.100
the side of the cello or I might use my palms and go like this.

119
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.420
And um, things like that. And then also I might, um,

120
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.600
do a little tapping things like, you know,

121
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.190
or I might, um, do little like things like that.

122
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.200
And it's, I'm taking sort of, um,

123
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.690
I like to think of it as like a DJ scratch approach to the teller. And, um,

124
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.240
you know, you make all these like little electronic sounds,

125
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:39.160
but I like to see how many kinds of electronic sounds I can make using a 17th

126
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:39.994
century instrument.

127
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.150
At first I wanted to get a whole orchestra to play this music.

128
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.460
And I actually got, like, when I first started doing this, um, I,

129
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.560
I started working with a couple other musicians to see if I could like translate

130
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.470
the ideas. And I was like, how do you write this? You know, like,

131
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.200
how do you write? Like, okay, take the back of your instrument,

132
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:59.050
turn it around and hit it with your, how do you write that?

133
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.130
And then how do you write like, like this, like Boeing, the,

134
00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:06.610
the wood directly. What's the notation for that?

135
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:08.650
I guess I could make something up, but, um,

136
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.010
I like the immediacy of having a computer. Like if I have some sort of idea,

137
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.200
I can just do it. I don't have to explain it.

138
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.340
Like you asked me what my music is about. Yeah.

139
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.350
I have to try to put into words some abstract feeling and then it's already

140
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.430
like, it's removed. Yeah.

141
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.820
Tell me about some of the projects that you're involved in right now.

142
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:26.680
Cause you're, you're, you're on your own,

143
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:29.140
you're doing your own stuff and releasing those and,

144
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.890
but you're also what mostly I'm working in film right now,

145
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.810
like just writing music for, um, film scores and something I really like doing.

146
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.950
Um, so I'm finishing up a documentary right now. It's called ghost bird.

147
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.980
This is about the woodpecker. Yeah. Oh, every filled with picker. And, uh,

148
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.010
and then last year I did, I got into horror,

149
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.120
which is very strange for me cause I,

150
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.960
I'm a very sensitive person and I can't actually watch her, but, um,

151
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.420
what sorts of cello gestures would picking? We'd end up in a horror film like a,

152
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.353
you know,

153
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.130
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

154
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.750
<v 0>oh suddenly can you hear it? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Or like really detuned</v>

155
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.103
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.950
<v 0>Ooh, was that Carrie? Yeah, that was piggy that squeak at the end.</v>

157
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.090
But isn't it amazing that you can just do that? Like the, the,

158
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.510
that was what was really interesting about your show with the, um,

159
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.470
more of the worlds thing.

160
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.430
Like you could just add like one note and then add another note to it and

161
00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:40.200
suddenly it's ominous. Can I hear another? Sure. Sure.

162
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.560
Um, I could do, let's see.

163
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.660
Does anything really listen to you? Tell me, um, I'll, I'll get out of your way,

164
00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:51.290
but if you could introduce it just, and tell me what, sure.

165
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.940
What you think you're going to play. Um, let's see.

166
00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:58.620
Let me think about it for a minute. First can, I mean, I can make a request,

167
00:15:58.621 --> 00:16:03.060
but I don't know if it's one you've prepared for sure. Um, album number two,

168
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.320
Sun, the sun will set some saying, yeah, this one was that, is that,

169
00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:09.990
is that something that's easy for you to plan? Extremely easy. Oh,

170
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.290
I love that son. Sure. Okay. I'm going to just give me one second. All right.

171
00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:15.900
So to introduce it, uh, this piece is called, it has a name.

172
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.720
It's called that the sun will set pretty well.

173
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.263
<v 8>Woo.</v>

174
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.580

<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

197
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.530
<v 0>that piece is just beautiful. It's just so pretty. It's really fun to play.</v>

198
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.600
Yeah, I have, I love that piece. Um, when did you start on the cello?

199
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.550
When I was eight. You're eight? Yep. And when you started, was it, I mean,

200
00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:55.410
you certainly weren't looping and doing all these kinds of things.

201
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.490
How was it at the beginning? Uh, I really liked the sound of it. You know, like,

202
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.070
I don't know if this will come through on the, on the microphone,

203
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:03.240
but I went to see this.

204
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.610
<v 3>I am</v>

205
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.810
[inaudible] [inaudible]

206
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.850
<v 0>I have two notes playing together, but they make a shape.</v>

207
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.820
They make this sort of like wave policy shape and I would just,

208
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.880
I would just like get lost in that for a long time. Play the fifth. Yeah.

209
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.070
How did you begin? I mean, what,

210
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:29.480
what sorts of cello stuff were you doing at the beginning when you play?

211
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.970
Were you a classically trained musician? Yeah, I did all the standard things,

212
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:35.400
you know, play some Bach play in an orchestra. But, um,

213
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.860
I suffered from really debilitating state of fight to the point where I couldn't

214
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:43.880
play in public at all. I would never, I would always think it'd be fine,

215
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.690
you know, and then I would get up there and, um, I couldn't hold the bow.

216
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.780
Like I couldn't remember how to play the cello. It's like I wouldn't,

217
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.560
I wouldn't be able to do it. Like, I actually did have a concert once where I,

218
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.220
um, I got up there and, um, my,

219
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.490
my hand is shaking with seeking so much that I just,

220
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.390
I couldn't even get it on the strings. I mean,

221
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.220
and then I just dropped it just dropped the ball, dropped the bow, my fingers.

222
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:10.490
That didn't make any sense. It was just really, really, really difficult for me.

223
00:23:10.491 --> 00:23:11.630
And so it was like my,

224
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.380
the more I progressed as a musician and it became just the stick,

225
00:23:15.381 --> 00:23:18.440
terrible nightmare. Um, so I decided not to,

226
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.340
not to pursue classical music as a career and I instead went to study liberal

227
00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:24.560
arts. Um, but in college,

228
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.520
all my friends were filmmakers and dancers and so it was just inevitable.

229
00:23:28.521 --> 00:23:33.470
I would start playing the cello in all their little films or I would, you know,

230
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.890
be like the piano would company meant to the dancers. Okay. And so I would,

231
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.580
I would just improvise and they would dance. And that new,

232
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.940
that new version of yourself where you're just playing improvised stuff and it's

233
00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:46.700
dancing. And this film developed that easier. Yeah. I never,

234
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:50.000
I've never had stage fright doing that. Like, if I can play my own music,

235
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.240
I'm fine. Huh. So, and that's the difference.

236
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.770
It's if it's the notes coming out of your head versus out of Beethoven said,

237
00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.110
yeah, there is something about, um, it's not me.

238
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.540
It's like I have to recreate something that is,

239
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.240
that already exists and supposed to be a certain way.

240
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.960
And there obviously is some part of me that just rebels against that.

241
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.930
So w w when did you get this idea? [inaudible] I mean,

242
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.170
the idea to take a cello and run it through computer and loop it and all that.

243
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.460
Well, I lived, um, you know, I always live with musicians and um,

244
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.150
most of them would be rock musicians or electronic musicians and they'd always

245
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:28.880
have like little pieces of gear lying around. And I'd be like, oh,

246
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:29.661
I'll try that, you know,

247
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:33.350
let's try the Ceelo through this delay or let's try the Telo through this.

248
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.560
Vocoder you know, and I would, I think I spent,

249
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:40.880
I don't know how many hours doing that, just just like me, you know, me.

250
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.400
The, wow. What was the, well exactly was it that you were with, you know,

251
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:49.520
it was, it was that um, the cello is such a linear instrument.

252
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.560
Like pianists can play all these nuts at once,

253
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.040
but with cello I can play like two notes at once and um,

254
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.540
with the looping pedal you can play some notes and then you can play notes on

255
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.374
top of it.

256
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.370
So it's like you were playing more than one instrument and I could also hear all

257
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:06.860
the things I was doing badly. That was really interesting.

258
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.420
I imagine it must have been interesting because you mean because of the stage

259
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:15.650
fright, you know, to hear the things that you didn't do right.

260
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:19.760
Come back and then come back, come back. Yeah, but they didn't bother me.

261
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.980
It's interesting because you really,

262
00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:24.110
you never get to fix your mistakes from the past.

263
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.780
Like very rarely happens when it does. It's great moment.

264
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.560
But with living you do, because say you record something and it's a mistake,

265
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.880
you might be able to add something to it that might make it sound right. Ah,

266
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.670
it's like that thing I've heard jazz players say where they say like,

267
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.050
if you make a mistake, do it twice.

268
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.000
That's interesting. Have you ever heard that? I haven't,

269
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:48.130
but that makes total sense though. Can I hear another? Sure, sure. Um,

270
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.720
let me switch that fence again. Can you introduce this piece? Uh,

271
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.810
this piece is called, um, legions war.

272
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.883

[inaudible]

283
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.240
<v 0>well, wow. Thank you. So that, that was a,</v>

284
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.720
tell me the name of that piece one more time. Um, legions were legions were,

285
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:54.580
and that was on your second CD, right? Is there a third coming out? Yeah.

286
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.720
Um, I'm trying to finish it in between finishing up these movies, but I really,

287
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.840
really hope to have it out this summer. So,

288
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.140
and if people want to know more about you and hear more of your music,

289
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.230
where can they do that? The best place is probably my website,

290
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.390
which is Zoe keating.com.

291
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.260
Or if you just type Zoe and cello into Google,

292
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:17.710
I think I'm the first thing that comes up. No kidding. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

293
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.770
And we'll also link to you@radiolab.org and, uh,

294
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.020
and maybe put some clips up if that's okay with you. That'd be great. Thanks.

295
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:27.580
Okay. So can you, can you take us out with something? Uh, just improvise.

296
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.830
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Improvise.

297
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.173
