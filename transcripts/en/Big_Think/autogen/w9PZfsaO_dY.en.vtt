number of reasons why education is poor

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579
number of reasons why education is poor
 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.780
number of reasons why education is poor
in America and part of it I think is a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790
in America and part of it I think is a
 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.549
in America and part of it I think is a
result of some parents not putting

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559
result of some parents not putting
 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.470
result of some parents not putting
enough emphasis on education in their

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480
enough emphasis on education in their
 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.600
enough emphasis on education in their
own homes I grew up in a family where

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610
own homes I grew up in a family where
 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.110
own homes I grew up in a family where
education was was hyper important but I

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120
education was was hyper important but I
 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.310
education was was hyper important but I
think there are a lot of families that

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320
think there are a lot of families that
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.539
think there are a lot of families that
don't stress it as much as they should

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549
don't stress it as much as they should
 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.730
don't stress it as much as they should
and so part of the responsibility lies

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740
and so part of the responsibility lies
 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.880
and so part of the responsibility lies
with the parents but overall I think as

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
with the parents but overall I think as
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.569
with the parents but overall I think as
a society we have we have made education

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579
a society we have we have made education
 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.590
a society we have we have made education
too much of a free market system where

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600
too much of a free market system where
 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.300
too much of a free market system where
if you have money if you have resources

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310
if you have money if you have resources
 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.199
if you have money if you have resources
your kids are going to get a good

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209
your kids are going to get a good
 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.389
your kids are going to get a good
education if you don't then they

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399
education if you don't then they
 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.269
education if you don't then they
probably won't and as long as that's the

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279
probably won't and as long as that's the
 

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.269
probably won't and as long as that's the
case then there can't be equality of

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:28.279
case then there can't be equality of
 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:30.730
case then there can't be equality of
opportunity because certain kids are

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
opportunity because certain kids are
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.019
opportunity because certain kids are
just not going to have the opportunities

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029
just not going to have the opportunities
 

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.999
just not going to have the opportunities
that they should in order to even up the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009
that they should in order to even up the
 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.519
that they should in order to even up the
playing field for them to maximize their

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:36.529
playing field for them to maximize their
 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:41.489
playing field for them to maximize their
potential and we need that and then

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499
potential and we need that and then
 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.440
potential and we need that and then
there's also many factors I think that

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
there's also many factors I think that
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.279
there's also many factors I think that
that play into it and in the black

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289
that play into it and in the black
 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.739
that play into it and in the black
community especially black men there's I

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749
community especially black men there's I
 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.139
community especially black men there's I
think there's a certain level of despair

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149
think there's a certain level of despair
 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.330
think there's a certain level of despair
nihilism that they don't have the belief

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340
nihilism that they don't have the belief
 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.089
nihilism that they don't have the belief
that education is going to pay off for

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099
that education is going to pay off for
 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.589
that education is going to pay off for
them and I think there's enough of that

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599
them and I think there's enough of that
 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.020
them and I think there's enough of that
that encourages them to find other ways

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
that encourages them to find other ways
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.630
that encourages them to find other ways
to make money and crime often ends up

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
to make money and crime often ends up
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.570
to make money and crime often ends up
being one of those ways and because they

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
being one of those ways and because they
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.860
being one of those ways and because they
don't see the light at the end of the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
don't see the light at the end of the
 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.370
don't see the light at the end of the
tunnel because they don't have the optic

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
tunnel because they don't have the optic
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.290
tunnel because they don't have the optic
ism to believe that they can do

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
ism to believe that they can do
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.180
ism to believe that they can do
something legitimately and legally and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
something legitimately and legally and
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250
something legitimately and legally and
be successful then they resort to other

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
be successful then they resort to other
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.580
be successful then they resort to other
means and drug trade and all these

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
means and drug trade and all these
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.090
means and drug trade and all these
things that are certain young man get

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
things that are certain young man get
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220
things that are certain young man get
caught up and a lot of it as a result of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
caught up and a lot of it as a result of
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.670
caught up and a lot of it as a result of
unemployment despair and and and just a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
unemployment despair and and and just a
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.650
unemployment despair and and and just a
lack of optimism in their communities

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660
lack of optimism in their communities
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.080
lack of optimism in their communities
and I think education will go a long way

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
and I think education will go a long way
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300
and I think education will go a long way
toward helping address that but there's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
toward helping address that but there's
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.560
toward helping address that but there's
a myriad number of cultural issues that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
a myriad number of cultural issues that
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.510
a myriad number of cultural issues that
we have to deal with as well and part of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
we have to deal with as well and part of
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720
