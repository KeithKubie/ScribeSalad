F.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.474 align:start position:0%
- Check.

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:09.742 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Mate.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:11.077 align:start position:0%
- [chuckles]

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.612
- Hello.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm Rich Fulcher,

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.682
and today we're gonna talk
about Bobby Fischer,

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:20.520
King of the Chess People.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.189 line:0%
<i> It's 1972.</i>

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:26.225 line:0%
<i> Bobby Fischer is, like,
 29 years old,</i>

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:30.196
<i> and at the time, he had won
 the U.S. Open Championship</i>

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.666
<i> and was
 an International Grandmaster.</i>

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.402
<i> But he wasn't just
 a normal chess player.</i>

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:41.074
<i> He was going,
put, put, put, put, put, check!</i>

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.509
<i> Woot, woot, woot, checkmate!</i>

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.546
That was when he felt
most comfortable in life.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.249
And yet, Russia had won
the World Championship

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.351
for the last 24 years.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:57.090
<i> Like, Russia, Russia,
 Russia, Russia,</i>

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.292
<i> can--Russia!</i>

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.862
And Russia used that
as sort of a PR campaign,

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.198
<i> like, we are the kings.</i>

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.166
<i> We are not only Communists,</i>

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:09.402
<i> but we are
 the intellectuals of the world</i>

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.171
<i> because we do chess.</i>

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:15.441 line:0%
<i> The World Championships
 are in Iceland,</i>

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:19.545 line:0%
<i> and Boris Spassky, backed by
 the Russian government,</i>

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:24.183 line:0%
<i> was like, Bobby Fischer
 is too young and inexperienced</i>

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:29.188 line:0%
<i> for someone like me,
 the World Champion.</i>

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.725
<i> Here's the thing,
 Fischer hated Russians,</i>

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:36.496
<i> and he called them
 filthy pigs.</i>

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.866
<i> So it was much more
 than just a chess match.</i>

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.503
<i> The Cold War is happening.</i>

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.240
Life<i> Magazine called it
 the match of the century,</i>

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:50.710
and in the retrospect it was,

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.247 line:0%
because it was the match
of the century.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.416 line:0%
<i> And then
 Fischer didn't show up.</i>

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.353 line:0%
<i> He was still in,
 uh, New York, and he said,</i>

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.488 line:0%
<i> I don't want to play
 in this match</i>

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.291
<i> 'cause it's not enough
 prize money.</i>

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:06.626
<i> It's not enough!</i>

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.461
<i> He was all talk.</i>

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:11.697
<i> He wasn't, like,
 ready to perform</i>

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.833
<i> for, like, magic people.</i>

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:19.705 line:0%
<i> But he gets a phone call
 from Henry [bleep] Kissinger,</i>

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.575 line:0%
<i> the Secretary of State,
 and he said,</i>

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:26.846 line:0%
<i> uh...hi, this is Ken--</i>

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.549
<i> This is Henry Kissinger</i>

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:34.754
<i> saying that you need to get
 your butt over to Iceland now.</i>

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.623
<i> So he finally shows up
 in Iceland,</i>

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:42.461
<i> and Spassky's like, fine,
 great, let's get started.</i>

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:47.633
<i> But Fischer was like,
 there's too many cameras.</i>

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:51.237
<i> There's, uh--
 the audience is too close.</i>

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.906
<i> The chess board is too shiny.</i>

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.342
<i> The lights are shiny.</i>

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.412
<i> But Fischer
 finally agreed to play,</i>

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.848 line:0%
<i> and in America
 it was shown on bars</i>

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:04.750 line:0%
<i> throughout the country.</i>

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:07.286
<i> So you would go
 into a bar,</i>

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.557
you'd see chess and not
the New York Mets,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.729
not the...Klondike...Bars.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.532
- But what would you do
for a Klondike?

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.835
- I would do anything
for a Klondike Bar,

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:27.673
except Wikipedia my dingus.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.610
- [laughs]

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.979
- And so,
the World Championship

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.881
<i> was a best out of 24 match.</i>

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.617 line:0%
<i> The first game was weird</i>

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.019 line:0%
<i> because there's
 cameras everywhere.</i>

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:43.956
[whimpering gibberish]

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.858
<i> It was like,
 they're too close!</i>

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.461
<i> And Fischer made
 a rookie move,</i>

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.897
<i> like, he went and got
 an outlier pawn</i>

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.532
<i> with his bishop,</i>

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:57.370
<i> and Spassky surrounded it
 with his bishops.</i>

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.704
<i> Whoa.</i>

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.674
<i> And he lost big time.</i>

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:06.045 line:0%
<i> The second match came around,
 and Spassky was there,</i>

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.414
<i> and he goes, where is he?</i>

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:11.717
<i> Fischer was staying
 in his room and saying,</i>

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.055
<i> I will not go out
 unless the cameras change.</i>

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.691
<i> And he was thinking
 that they would do it,</i>

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.960
<i> but they didn't.</i>

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:25.731
<i> And then Fischer
 forfeits the match.</i>

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:27.033
<i> Hrrump!</i>

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.901
<i> That's how they did it.</i>

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:32.438
And he's down two-nothing,

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:37.543
<i> which is pretty [bleep] bad.</i>

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:38.811
Pfft-pfft-pfft.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.949 align:end position:100%
- Why is all the ice gone?
Where did all the ice go?

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:45.551 align:start position:0%
- I just want some free flowers.
What?

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.521 align:end position:100%
- All the ice was put
into the cooler.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.323 align:start position:0%
- Let me tell you
about the ice.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.459 size:78% position:39%
You just gotta mix it up!

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:54.760 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Jeez.

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.729
- Here's the thing.

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:58.764
The thing is--
- Here's the thing.

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:01.801
- No, but what
the thing is, is, um,

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.704
I have a flaming dick disease.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.872
[laughter]

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:10.443
No, I was trying to say
that to be behind two-nothing

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.912
is a big deal
in these matches.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.614
<i> And then finally
 for the third game</i>

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:18.617
<i> Fischer said, look,
 let's go to a back room</i>

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.820
<i> with no cameras, please.</i>

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.922
<i> And Spassky said yes.</i>

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:26.592 line:0%
<i> Fischer felt comfortable
 and won.</i>

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.461 line:0%
<i> He won!</i>

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.797
<i> The first time he'd ever
 beaten Fas--Fassko--</i>

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.733
<i> no, Spassky.</i>

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.569
Once he won,
it just changed.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:37.903
<i> It's like a turnaround.</i>

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:40.906
<i> It's like
 a blip, blah, aghhhh.</i>

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.508
<i> It's like a shhh.</i>

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.577
<i> It's like a pup.
 It's like a poosh.</i>

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.580
<i> It's like a boo-laah!</i>

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.849
<i> <00:05:47.813><c>Li</c><00:05:47.846><c>ke</c><00:05:47.880><c> a</c><00:05:47.913><c> p</c><00:05:47.947><c>ut</c><00:05:47.980><c>-c</c><00:05:48.013><c>hi</c><00:05:48.047><c>-s</c><00:05:48.080><c>ha</c><00:05:48.113><c>-s</c><00:05:48.147><c>ha</c><00:05:48.180><c>-s</c><00:05:48.213><c>no</c><00:05:48.247><c>ot</c><00:05:48.280><c>!</c></i>

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.450
<i> It happened.</i>

00:05:51.483 --> 00:05:54.019 line:0%
<i> So Fischer won
 the third game,</i>

00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:56.122 line:0%
<i> the fifth game,
 the sixth game,</i>

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.724 line:0%
<i> the eighth game,
 the tenth game.</i>

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:00.593 line:0%
It was so brilliant,

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.862
Spassky actually stood up,

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.030
<i> he gave a standing ovation.</i>

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:06.899
<i> Thank you, thank you.</i>

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:09.101
<i> And after the 13th game,</i>

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.604
<i> the Soviets were like,
 what do we do?</i>

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.073
<i> They went to the officials
 and said,</i>

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:18.711
<i> Bobby Fischer is using
 electronic devices</i>

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:22.114
<i> to wane Spassky's energy</i>

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:24.884
<i> through electronic
 zappage.</i>

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:29.588
<i> So the Reykjavik police
 from Iceland</i>

00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:31.857
<i> came in and took apart
 everything.</i>

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.860
<i> They took apart
 Bobby Fischer's chair,</i>

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:37.563
<i> Bobby Fischer's, uh...</i>

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.999
<i> peanuts.</i>

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:41.500
<i> Peanuts.</i>

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:42.802
<i> And they were thinking,</i>

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.804
<i> oh, this is gonna
 fluster Fischer,</i>

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:48.040
<i> because Fischer's very,
 you know, tumultuous.</i>

00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:50.009
<i> It didn't at all.</i>

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.577 line:0%
<i> He loved it.</i>

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.979 line:0%
<i> And he won after that,</i>

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:55.681 line:0%
<i> and won and won,</i>

00:06:55.714 --> 00:06:59.552 line:0%
<i> and pretty much
 after the 21st match,</i>

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.188 line:0%
<i> it became
 mathematically impossible</i>

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.089 line:0%
<i> for Spassky to win.</i>

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:07.493
<i> And it was like, oh, my God!</i>

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:09.862
<i> Fischer wins!
 Fischer wins!</i>

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:11.497
<i> And it's--he--</i>

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.532 line:0%
<i> he's, like,
 the World Chess Champion,</i>

00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:15.234 line:0%
<i> and he's from the U.S.</i>

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.169 line:0%
<i> He walks out in Reykjavik,</i>

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:18.938
<i> there's people everywhere.</i>

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:19.939
<i> He's mobbed.</i>

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:22.541
<i> Fischer was huge,</i>

00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:24.977
<i> and he became
 a Cold War hero,</i>

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.012
<i> and he felt like...</i>

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:30.950
[making guttural noises]

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:32.918
Tell me more,

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.054
<i> you sucking pig!</i>

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:37.089
<i> Suck!</i>

00:07:37.122 --> 00:07:40.693 line:92%
<i> Suck!</i>

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.229
That's that.
