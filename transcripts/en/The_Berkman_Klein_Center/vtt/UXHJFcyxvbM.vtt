00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:18.090
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.930
You will recall, I hope, that
when discussing welfare theory

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.420
I identified five ways
in which a government can

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
seek to offset the under
production of public goods,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.150
such as literature, art,
and scientific innovations.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.710
To review, those five
strategies are-- first,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.950
the government can provide
the public good itself,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.190
as it does with respect to
navigation, AIDS, and space research.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.160
Second, the government
can select and subsidize

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.380
private innovators, as it does with
respect to much research involving

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.250
health related sciences.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.630
Third, the government can offer
prizes to successful innovators

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.590
an increasingly popular approach.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.900
Fourth, the government can adopt laws
that reinforce innovator's self help

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.020
strategies, such laws include
protections for trade secrets,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.605
and the kind of ant-circumvention
rules I mentioned a minute ago

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:18.580
and that we will examine
in more detail next week.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.520
Fifth, and not least, the government can
protect producers against competition

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.120
in the reproduction, distribution,
and performance of their works.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.160
As you know by now, copyright law
is an example of the fifth approach.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.820
The topic for today is cultural
theory, not welfare theory,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.300
but the same five options are
relevant when we cast about

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.920
for ways to advance the kinds of
society commended by cultural theory.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.630
Some might be more efficacious than
reforming copyright law itself.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.760
For example, if we believe that this
set of cultural products being produced

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.040
today is too thin to
sustain the kind of culture

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.460
and the set of opportunities
for artists that we want,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.760
we could, as we've done in the
previous segment of this lecture,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.009
tried to tune the copyright system.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.570
Or instead, we could
supplement the incentives

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.460
created by copyright
protection with government

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.170
subsidies for the type of work at issue.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.370
Several European countries already
do this with respect to cinema.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.180
European national governments and
some regional governments offer

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.420
grants to filmmakers, typically new
filmmakers or filmmakers pursuing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.040
unconventional projects, that
supplement the revenues they

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.240
can make by selling or
exhibiting copies of their films.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.140
Where does the money come from?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.940
Typically from taxes, either general
tax revenues or taxes on other forms

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.630
of entertainment.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.360
The result is increased diversity
in the films available to consumers.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.270
Whether the net result
is unbalance attractive

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.990
is perhaps a good test of
the merits of this approach.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.939
 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.730
An even more radical
possibility is the one

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.540
I considered briefly
in lecture number four.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.230
If we despaired of relying
on the copyright system

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.660
to compensate fairly the creators
of musical compositions and films,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.260
we might consider replacing
the copyright system altogether

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.450
with respect to online distribution
of sound recordings and films

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.050
with an alternative compensation system.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.590
The gist of such a
system, you'll recall,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.600
is that fees would be collected,
directly or indirectly, from businesses

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.550
that capitalize upon consumers
demand for digital recordings,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.250
but currently pay nothing to the
creators of those recordings.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.520
Such businesses include
internet service providers,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.620
manufacturers of consumer
electronic equipment,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.590
and media related application programs.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.600
 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.190
The funds collected in this manner would
then be distributed to the creators.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.040
The formulas by which
they were distributed

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.000
would likely vary by country.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.010
In the United States, where
suspicion of government is intense,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.160
the money would likely be parceled out
among copyright owners in proportion

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.220
to the relative
popularity of their works.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.490
In Europe as Philippe
Aigrain has argued,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.040
relative popularity would likely
be alloyed with other criteria

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.490
when determining how
the money is divided.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.810
Once such a system were in
place, online distribution

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.070
of movies and recorded
music would be legalized.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.504
 

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:36.420
Viewed from the standpoint
of cultural theory,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.270
such a system would have two main
advantages over our current regime.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.230
First, it not only would
provide consumers lawful access

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.085
to many more cultural
products at low cost,

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:51.270
it would free them legally to modify
and redistribute those artifacts,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.710
thus enhancing semiotic democracy.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.180
No longer would YouTube's copyright
sniffing software suppress mash-ups

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.700
that happen to contain snippets
of other people's material.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.280
Incidentally, YouTube's software
has balked at some of the lectures

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.820
in this series, forcing us to appeal
those rejections on the grounds

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.430
that the snippets that I employ
are shielded by fair use.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.560
Whether such appeals, however well
founded, will continue to work

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.670
remains to be seen.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.790
Back to main story.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.080
Second, by enabling artists
to earn good incomes

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.780
by providing their works
directly to the public,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.840
such an alternative compensation
system would sharply increase access

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.400
to the variant of the good life
associated with the creation of art.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.370
As we've seen, an alternative
compensation system

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.970
would not be perfect.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.185
Its disadvantages are cataloged on the
map, but it would have great strengths.

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:52.520
 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.820
One of the most difficult issues
currently confronting lawmakers

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.360
throughout the world is
how, if at all, to shield

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.810
so-called "traditional knowledge"
against unauthorized uses.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.470
Roughly speaking, the
term traditional knowledge

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.400
refers to cultural products
developed over long periods of time,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.510
typically by the members
of indigenous groups.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.780
Examples include traditional music,
dances, fabrics, costumes, folklore,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.330
and religious icons.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.350
Such things do not fit well
the template of copyright law.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.120
In part because the
authors of such things

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.500
are usually collective, hard
to identify, and long dead.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.750
In addition, the concerns
of the groups who

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.630
object to the non-permissive use of
traditional cultural expressions--

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.120
sometimes abbreviated
as TCEs-- are usually

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.980
quite different from the combination
of economic and personhood interests

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.300
implicated by most copyrighted works.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.030
If copyright law doesn't work well in
this setting, what would work better?

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.130
That's far from clear.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.760
Countries continue to experiment
with a wide variety of models.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.970
Various insight into those possible ways
of dealing with traditional knowledge

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.400
might be derived from the cultural
theory we have outlined here.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.100
Unfortunately, those insights conflict.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.990
Cultural theory is thus
arguably helpful in identifying

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.450
some things we should strive
to achieve or protect,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.769
but not particularly helpful
in telling us how to do so.

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:30.685
Here are some of the
competing considerations.

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:33.380
 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.700
The use or performance or
TCEs is one of the ways

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.160
in which some communities
define and sustain themselves.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.390
Because preservation
of communities is one

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.630
of the things commended
by cultural theory,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.510
we should strive if possible
to protect these practices

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.985
from corrosion or dissipation.

00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:54.210
 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.150
Protecting TCEs from
appropriation by persons or firms

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.280
outside the indigenous groups
that created and sustained

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.880
them would also promote
cultural diversity

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.285
by helping to resist the trend towards
global cultural homogenization.

00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:10.350
 

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.220
Allowing indigenous groups
to charge, or otherwise

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.290
be compensated for uses of their
TCEs, would also provide them

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.910
a source of funds that would
mitigate their impoverishment

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.080
and promote distributive justice.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.610
Note however, that this
third consideration

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.490
is in some tension with
the first and second,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.520
which seemed to presume that
the TCEs would not spread.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.289
 

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.400
On the other side of the ledger,
protections for traditional knowledge

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.880
are hard to reconcile with the
value of semiotic democracy.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.050
The merit of enabling all persons,
both members of an outsider's

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:54.830
to the indigenous groups, to refashion
cultural artifacts of all sorts.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.710
Such protections are also hard to
reconcile with the value of autonomy,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.220
of enabling all persons to choose
for themselves the cultural forms

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.160
through which they
will define themselves.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.500
More broadly, the impulse to
protect TCEs against unauthorized

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.060
used or modification, seems rooted
in a static conception of identity

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.000
that diverges from the more
dynamic conception of identity

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.190
that figures in the conception
of the good life offered here.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.360
So what's the right approach?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.450
It's very hard to say.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.372
That question seems best
left to the seminars that

00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:32.830
will accompany this lecture series.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:37.000
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.120
All copyright theories have
weaknesses, sore points.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.870
The theory I've outlined today
is no exception in this regard.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.800
Cultural theory has two main
weaknesses, both of which

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.740
are likely apparent by now.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.130
The first is commonly referred
to as the perils of paternalism,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.150
or as it's sometimes called parentalism.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.950
Whichever term you prefer, it
means efforts by governments

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.460
to limit people's freedom or
otherwise channel their behavior, not

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.360
to protect the interests of
others, but for their own good.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.270
Legal rules of this
sort are not unknown.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:20.290
Familiar examples are rules requiring
motorcyclists to wear helmets,

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.200
rules forbidding people to sell
organs, bans on self enslavement,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.070
prohibitions on the
use of certain drugs,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.050
and the non-waivable
character of the implied

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.440
warranty of habitability
in landlord tenant law.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.780
Nevertheless, such efforts are
hazardous and controversial.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.630
 

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.670
The reason why the
specter of paternalism

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.430
arises in the present context is
that the vision of the good life,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.870
upon which this variant of
cultural theory is founded,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:57.060
does not align exactly with what most
people currently subjectively desire.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.615
Thus to the extent the theory commends
modifications of copyright law

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:06.000
that will afford people more
access to a life of the sort,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.810
and seeks to stimulate their
appreciation of such a life,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:16.390
it does not defer entirely to people's
own assessment of their best interests.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.660
But instead, pushes them in
directions they might not

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.170
be inclined to go for their own good.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.580
 

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.730
Three factors mitigate the troubling
implications of that admission.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.930
The first, is that the gap
between the vision outlined

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.900
in the first segment of this lecture
and people's subjective desires

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.442
is not as large as one might think.

00:11:40.442 --> 00:11:42.650
The findings of the group
of scholars sometimes known

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.900
as the Princeton Group concerning
the ways in which people

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.050
assess their own well
being are reassuring.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.660
In particular, the so-called
day reconstruction method,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.290
pioneered by this group and applied
to the members of many classes

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.470
and to the residents of
many countries, reveals

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.060
that people take more pleasure
in some of the things commended

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.330
by the good life, such as
intimacy and friendship,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.610
and less pleasure in consumption
and the trappings of status

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.790
than has traditionally been assumed.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.170
Second, none of the
possible reforms I've

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.810
outlined force people to do anything.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.650
You're not coercive.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.190
Instead, they're designed
to alter incentives

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.940
in an effort to invite or nudge,
to use the term popularized

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:36.080
by Thaler and Sunstein,
people into better lives.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.890
Third, it's not the case that
adoption of these proposals

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:44.820
would introduce paternalism into
copyright law for the first time.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.680
As we've seen, extent
copyright law already

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.430
contains some even more
coercive rules that

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.270
constrain people's freedom
for their own good.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.760
The clearest examples are the
non waivable termination rights

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.600
in sections 203 and
304 of the US statute,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.420
which I discussed in lecture number six.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.020
Why are those rights non waivable?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.190
Because we wish to prevent artists
from signing away their entitlements

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.390
foolishly.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.370
In other words, we disable
them from acting in ways

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.850
that we think are not in
their own best interests.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.640
 

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.520
These three factors in combination
may assuage our unease somewhat,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.020
but not entirely.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:34.380
Two arguments against initiatives of
this general sort remain worrisome.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.390
The first is the fundamental argument
made by liberal political theorist

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.070
and leaders, the government's
aught to remain neutral

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.480
concerning alternative
theories of the good.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.280
The second, is a
prudential consideration.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.620
Even if paternalistic rules are
not objectionable in principle,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.670
it's foolhardy to entrust
government officials with the power

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.810
to override people's own
conceptions of their best interests.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.700
 

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.570
This brings us to the second of the two
major sore points and cultural theory.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.790
It would increase the degree to
which the shape of our culture

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.810
is determined by government officials.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.630
The risks associated with
that strategy are familiar.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.370
Bureaucrats are not famous for wisdom.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.060
The persons and firms
who stand to gain or lose

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.800
from the decisions of the bureaucrats
would dissipate scarce social assets,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.440
trying to persuade those bureaucrats
to take one tack or another.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.270
In the worst case scenario,
the official's decisions

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.850
might be corrupt, either in the
strong sense of being purchased

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.810
by the affected parties, or the softer
sense of being motivated by a desire

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.320
to please the parties upon whose favor,
and donations, the officials depend.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.890
 

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.300
These risks can be reduced by carefully
selecting the officials in whose hands

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.140
power is placed or by instituting
checks on their authority,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.190
but they cannot be
eliminated altogether.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:11.040
Whether they are fatal to this
enterprise, I leave to you.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.907
