00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.930
So the example of the bank we've
been studying, we're

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.500
actually kind of doing
it in real time.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.510
And I was doing this
on the fly.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.530
We actually showed
how this bank got

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.320
quote-unquote bailed out.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.390
And it got bailed out by the
sovereign wealth fund.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.160
Because when this last piece of
debt came due, it couldn't

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.850
sell its CDOs for enough money
to pay off that debt.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.880
So they just kind of held fast
and didn't sell their CDOs.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.700
They couldn't get any other
loans to pay off this loan.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.880
But what they were able to do is
to convince some foreigners

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.290
who were enamored by the brand
of this institution of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.690
American capitalism.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.560
So they were willing to buy some
shares in this company

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.700
and essentially bail it out.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.770
So in the example, we used to
have 500 million shares.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.390
The company issued another
2 billion shares.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.730
Sold them at $1.50 per share.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.830
And they got $3 billion
for it.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.400
And so then you had $3
billion in cash.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.640
We had $1 billion before, so
now we had $4 billion.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.615
We could pay off the loan with
$3 billion of the cash and

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.040
then we're left with
$1 billion.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.380
And now this company would have,
if you have $1 billion

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.370
in cash and $4 billion of CDOs,
it would think that it

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.090
has $5 billion of assets.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.990
If these are really
worth $4 billion.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.860
It has no liabilities, so it
has $5 billion of equity.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.320
Notice the equity
doesn't change.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.980
When you take some of your
assets and you get the value

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.680
of the assets that you think
they're worth and you pay off

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.820
some liabilities, it
doesn't change the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.050
value of your equity.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.520
But what's happened now?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.740
This is just to get comfortable
with some of this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.590
terminology.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.800
This company now is completely
delevered.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.720
Because it has no liabilities,
it has no debt, and its assets

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.190
are equal to its equity.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.970
And you'll find that lot of
companies that are startups

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.030
and technology companies,
a lot of those

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.020
have very little debt.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.160
And so they're completely
delevered.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.360
Anyway, that was
just an aside.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.330
But this was an example
of how a company

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.850
could get bailed out.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.120
And who lost here?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.240
Well the shareholders lost.
Because before, there was only

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.860
500 million shares that
split up the equity.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.330
And now there's 2.5 billion
shares to split this equity.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.650
So the book value of the shares,
if you eve believe

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.870
that these are really worth
$4 billion, they

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.150
went from $4 to $2.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.200
And I think this is an
important aside here.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.830
Because I've mentioned before
that the market price when you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.590
buy or sell a share, it's just
transacting between another

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070
person who used to be
holding that share.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.910
So how does it affect
the company?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.220
Well it affects the company
when the company needs to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.580
raise more money.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.530
And that's what happened
in this example.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.470
The company had to
raise more money.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.800
It had to go to, maybe it was
the government of Singapore's

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.790
sovereign wealth fund.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.810
And they say, government of
Singapore, please invest in

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.590
us, buy some of our shares.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.600
And when the government of
Singapore, or any investor,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.570
wants to buy new shares, they
use the market value, what

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.160
that stock is trading at, as a
good reference point for what

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.040
you might have to pay
for those shares.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.820
Oftentimes if it's kind of a
desperate situation and this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.260
person is kind of saving
you, they'll pay

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.180
below the market price.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.280
But sometimes, if they say,
oh, this is a lucky

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.160
opportunity to get such a large
number of shares and

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.850
essentially take control of
the company, I might be a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.250
little premium over it.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.780
So I'll pay $2 per share,
which is a little bit of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.350
premium over the market value
at the time, which was $1.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.980
But anyway, that's why the
market price of something in

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.890
the secondary markets, where a
share is just trading between

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.350
people who aren't
related to the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.870
company, why that's important.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.280
Because when the company needs
to raise money, that is used

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.790
as kind of the fair market value
of a company's shares.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.390
But anyway, this was the
situation where the company

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.510
gets bailed out.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.430
But what happens in a situation
where it doesn't get

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.350
bailed out?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.900
Let's do that.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.336
Let's say that the sovereign
wealth fund never happened.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:41.590
Let me clear this.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.645
So the assets, we had
$1 billion in cash.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.870
And we have these $4
billion of CDOs.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.795
For a total of $5 billion.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:10.320
The liabilities, we
had Loan C, it's

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.150
coming due for $3 billion.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.790
And then you had the equity,
which is essentially the total

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.860
assets minus the liability.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.220
So that's $2 billion.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.740
And that's split amongst
500 million shares.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.100
And that tells you that the book
value per share is $4.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.490
We're not going to worry right
now what the market value of

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.410
the shares are.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.830
So let's say they shop
everything around.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.940
All of these sovereign wealth
funds, they've got burned,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.500
because they invested in
Citibank last year and the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.675
stock just continued
to plummet.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:53.820
They invested in Merrill Lynch,
all of these they

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.460
invested in and it just
continued to plummet.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.540
So they've been burned.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.870
They don't want to be the last
guy holding the potato.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.940
So there's no-one who's willing
to invest equity.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.130
So it just forces the issue.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.670
These people, Loan C, they say,
we're not going to give

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.120
you a new loan, you can't pay
this loan, because even if you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.690
sold these CDOs, you're only
getting a $1 for them.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.710
So we are going to force
you into bankruptcy.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.530
And that's how bankruptcy
happens.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.940
When you break one of the-- they
call it the covenants--

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.990
with one of the people
who lent you money.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.410
The covenants say, if you don't
pay a loan within this

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.700
amount of time or some other
thing happens to your

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.990
financials, you are then
declared insolvent and you go

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.330
into bankruptcy.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
And what happens
in bankruptcy?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.770
Well, in bankruptcy, the
bankruptcy courts takes

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.485
receivership of all
of your assets.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.400
They just say, OK this
is what you own.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.740
And we're not going to go
into the details now.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.530
Maybe I'll do a whole series
of videos on the details of

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.240
bankruptcy.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.100
You might get some type of
loan that helps you just

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.220
continue to do business.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.430
Because people have to figure
out, are they just going to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.420
restructure your liabilities?

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.570
Or are they just going
to dissolve you?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.220
Because you're not a viable
entity anymore.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.860
But anyway, the bankruptcy court
will take hold of you.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.820
And let's assume that they're
going to dissolve you.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.700
They will then split you amongst
the stakeholders, the

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.030
people who you owe money to.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.560
Actually, let's not say that
they dissolve you.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.420
Let's say that everyone
agrees that this

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.900
brand is worth a lot.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.180
Whatever we call it, Goldman
Lynch or Lehman Sachs.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.870
Whatever our brand is,
it's worth a lot.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.940
No-one wants to see
it disappear.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.330
So what happens when you
go into bankruptcy?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.090
Well, the creditors get first
dibs on everything.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.010
So one way to think of
it is Loan C gets

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.690
first dibs on the assets.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.580
And then anything that's
left over goes

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.610
to the equity holders.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.440
So let's say the Loan C guys,
they say we want to keep this

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.240
bank as an ongoing entity.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.430
But what we want to do is we
just want to dump these CDOs.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.320
So the bankruptcy court, OK
we'll liquidate these CDOs

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.390
just because everyone agrees
that they're really shady.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.910
So they sell them and they only
get $1 billion for them.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.826
So now we have $2 billion
of assets.

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:16.700
It's essentially $2
billion in cash.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.060
That's all that there is.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.640
Plus there's probably some
buildings in all that.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.550
Which we're not listing here.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.040
But there's the brand
and all that.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.050
So this guy is owed
$3 billion.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.970
So he says, OK fine, you know
what I'm going to do?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.410
I'm going to keep this
company running.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.110
I'm owed $2 billion.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.310
I'm going to keep that
$2 billion in there.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.560
But what I get is essentially
all of the new

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.750
shares of the company.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.760
So what essentially the
bankruptcy court is going to

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.820
do, they're going to create
a new corporate entity.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.900
They're going to put all of
these assets into it.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.610
And then issue another
100 million shares.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.910
So they essentially create a
new entity, where the new

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:04.640
entity has $2 billion of assets,
$2 billion of cash.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.900
And let's say it has no debt.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.410
Or actually maybe these people,
they say we'll even

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.700
give you some money-- no, I
don't want to confuse things.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.370
So let's say that you
have no debt.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.750
So you have $2 billion
of equity.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.740
And let's say that there
are 100 million shares.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.080
So the book value of the new
shares is $20 per share.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.919
And you might say,
wow that's great.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.700
Someone could have gotten these
shares for whatever I

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.970
said they were trading
for before.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.680
They could've gotten them for $1
per share before, now they

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.039
are worth $20 per share.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.580
But no, that's not the case.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.850
It's actually horrible.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.920
These shares, the shares
of the old

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.620
company are worth zero.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.940
Because when you liquidated the
company, or at least when

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.250
you tried to value
the company, we

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.930
didn't liquidate it.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.225
Because we're saying we still
want the company to continue

00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:00.420
its operations.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.470
But we're saying that the value
of the company is only

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.440
$2 billion.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.970
This guy is owed $3 billion.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.580
So he says, you know what?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.990
I should get the
whole company.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.960
And I'm still getting not
everything that I deserve.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.480
But I'm going to get
the whole company.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.020
So essentially, whoever lent
Loan C, all of these shares

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.640
are now their shares.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.940
And the equity holders
get wiped out,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.020
the old equity holders.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.120
So those shares go to zero.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.580
So this is an interesting
example, because I've seen

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.730
people on CNBC say, oh what a
great deal, I could buy shares

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.780
of Lehman Brothers for $1.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.010
But that's not the case.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.870
They'll say Lehman Brothers has
all of these assets and

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.420
it's never going to completely
disappear.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.260
That might be true
to some degree.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.710
But Lehman Brothers' assets
might be greater than its

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.970
liabilities, which means
that its equity is

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.200
actually worth negative.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.110
So that $1 isn't a great deal.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.210
If you really thought that
Lehman Brothers in the long

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.510
term was going to come back,
what you might want to do is

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.640
somehow try to become one
of its bondholders.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.330
And then when it goes through
bankruptcy, on the other side

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.100
of the bankruptcy you might end
up in shares of the new

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.820
bank, whatever it's called.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.810
Goldman Brothers or whatever.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.510
Anyway, I realize
I'm out of time.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.220
In the next video I'm going to
put it all together and show

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.940
you, one, why our financial
system is freezing.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.670
And, two, what the government's
bailout is

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.860
attempting to do.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.700
See you in the next video.
