professor to Shawn's Ansan you're a

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790
professor to Shawn's Ansan you're a
 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.120
professor to Shawn's Ansan you're a
member of the Nobel Committee for

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
member of the Nobel Committee for
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.030
member of the Nobel Committee for
physics and you just presented in about

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
physics and you just presented in about
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.270
physics and you just presented in about
price this year it is about exotic

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
price this year it is about exotic
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.600
price this year it is about exotic
matter in the quantum the world so my

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
matter in the quantum the world so my
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.689
matter in the quantum the world so my
first question would be what is this

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699
 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.939
exotic is not a precise scientific term

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949
exotic is not a precise scientific term
 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.250
exotic is not a precise scientific term
exotic is something that expresses our

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
exotic is something that expresses our
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.890
exotic is something that expresses our
wonders I'll wander in front of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
wonders I'll wander in front of
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.100
wonders I'll wander in front of
something that is very unusual very hard

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
something that is very unusual very hard
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.010
something that is very unusual very hard
to understand and I think also that has

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
to understand and I think also that has
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.930
to understand and I think also that has
to be seen historically but it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
to be seen historically but it's
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540
to be seen historically but it's
exciting exciting for us now might not

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
exciting exciting for us now might not
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.290
exciting exciting for us now might not
be so exotic in 20 or 30 years I guess

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
be so exotic in 20 or 30 years I guess
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600
be so exotic in 20 or 30 years I guess
you know electricity was very exotic

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
you know electricity was very exotic
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910
you know electricity was very exotic
when it first came around it's not so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
when it first came around it's not so
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.310
when it first came around it's not so
exotic and longer but today the basis of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
exotic and longer but today the basis of
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220
exotic and longer but today the basis of
matter I guess we come to that that is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
matter I guess we come to that that is
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020
matter I guess we come to that that is
at the basis of this year's price is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
at the basis of this year's price is
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.030
at the basis of this year's price is
really exotic yes so where is this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
really exotic yes so where is this
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.310
really exotic yes so where is this
possible world is in a sense all around

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
possible world is in a sense all around
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.820
possible world is in a sense all around
us but quantum effects are not always

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
us but quantum effects are not always
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820
us but quantum effects are not always
very obvious to see but when you cool

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
very obvious to see but when you cool
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.789
very obvious to see but when you cool
down materials to very low temperature

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
down materials to very low temperature
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.450
down materials to very low temperature
then in many cases quantum effects

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
then in many cases quantum effects
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.280
then in many cases quantum effects
becomes very much more visible more

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
becomes very much more visible more
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.990
becomes very much more visible more
apparent another exotic question perhaps

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
apparent another exotic question perhaps
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.260
apparent another exotic question perhaps
we have this bagel and you had also a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
we have this bagel and you had also a
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.310
we have this bagel and you had also a
cinema well they they are actually there

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
cinema well they they are actually there
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319

to illustrate something and to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
to illustrate something and to
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330
to illustrate something and to
illustrate that is not sufficient to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
illustrate that is not sufficient to
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.899
illustrate that is not sufficient to
just show the bagel but I anticipated

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
just show the bagel but I anticipated
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850
just show the bagel but I anticipated
these questions I brought also the bond

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
these questions I brought also the bond
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.120
these questions I brought also the bond
you see when you put the bond and you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
you see when you put the bond and you
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.609
you see when you put the bond and you
have the bagel then you can see that the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
have the bagel then you can see that the
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.490
have the bagel then you can see that the
difference is that the bagel has a hole

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
difference is that the bagel has a hole
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980
difference is that the bagel has a hole
and the bond doesn't and the important

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
and the bond doesn't and the important
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.109
and the bond doesn't and the important
be the hole is that all the things like

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
be the hole is that all the things like
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449
be the hole is that all the things like

later and it took much more advanced
