00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.460
Before we can add wearable features to
the sample, or any other code you might

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.150
have already, we need to get things
ready to make sure it works properly.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.290
Firstly, make sure you're compiling
against the V4 support library.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.780
Let's open up our build upgrader file,
which is contained here.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.220
And if we scroll down,
it's important that you use this library

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.880
because many notification features
such as action buttons, large icons,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.000
and Android Wear and auto support have
been added to the framework since then.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.170
And most developers need
to support older devices.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.950
The next thing we need to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.360
do is make sure our notifications
are issued correctly.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.980
We open up the main activity,
and go down to the bottom here.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.100
It's important that we replace
the use of notification manager

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.300
with notification manager compact.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.093
If you try to use notification manager
while supporting older API devices,

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:47.595
they'll lose any special
wearable extensions.

00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:49.661
So this is the code
change to implement this.

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.180
We hit Alt + Enter to add
dependencies and then we're done
