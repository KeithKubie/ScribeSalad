00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.823
So you can find entire books, entire courses on how to go about analyzing and optimizing code.

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:13.394
The real point is simply that you should have a systematic optimization process.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:17.645
So I'm going to introduce one systematic optimization process called APOD.

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:23.958
APOD stands for Analyze, Parallelize, Optimize, and Deploy.

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.277
And the real point to this process is that it's a cycle.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.274
There's nothing really new here. This is just good software engineering discipline.

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:35.194
But the point is that we want to break down the process of optimization into several steps

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:38.941
and to remember not to short-circuit the really important one,

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:43.231
which is to actually deploy the optimizations that you've made into the real world,

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:48.254
get some feedback, see how they're performing on real-world data sets.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:54.277
It's too easy to spend all your time circling around these 2 steps

00:00:54.277 --> 00:01:00.508
and optimize in a vacuum, forgetting that actually you might be able to get a bigger speedup

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:04.471
by doing a better job of thinking about what you're trying to accomplish

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:09.083
or by going out and taking a partial optimization into the real world

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:12.349
and seeing how it performs and getting guidance from that.

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:16.112
So this is really nothing more than good software engineering discipline.

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:17.950
Let's take these steps 1 at a time.
