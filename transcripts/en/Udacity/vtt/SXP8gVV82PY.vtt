00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.210
A route hijack is an attack on origin

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.000
authentication because in a, in a route hijack,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.660
the AS that is advertising the prefix is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.490
actually not the rightful owner of that prefix. In

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.720
addition to control plan security, we also have

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.600
to worry about data plan security or determining

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.270
whether data is traveling to the intended locations.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.990
In general, it can be extremely hard to verify

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.430
that packets or traffic is traveling

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.480
along the intended route to the destination.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.030
Or that it, in fact, even reaches the intended destination in the first place.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.460
Guaranteeing that traffic actually traverses the advertised

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.860
route remains an important open problem in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.960
internet security. So how do these attacks on routing happen in the first place?
