00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For this problem, we ask about the missing step in garbled circuits as covered in Unit 7.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
At the end of the garbled circuit protocol, the evaluator has the output wire labels

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
x1 through xn.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The generator knows the corresponding semantic values.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For notation x10  is the wire label corresponding to a semantic value of 0 for wire 1

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and x11 is the wire label corresponding to semantic value of 1 for wire 1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Suppose the generator want to reveal the result to the evaluator

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
without revealing any other wire labels.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Which of these five options would allow the evaluator to correctly determine

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the semantic value of the were label x1 and not reveal the other output wire label?

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
