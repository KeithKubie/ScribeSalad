Okay, so here's your chance to demonstrate what you've learned

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:06.730
thus far. You know, my computer science professor in college

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.670
used to say, if you truly want to learn something,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.970
teach it to someone else. And that's what we are doing

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.810
to do in this exercise. We want you to find

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.630
a friend or a colleague that does not know much

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.610
about computer programming at all. And then we want you

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.140
to teach this program that we've written together to that individual.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.740
Now, while you're doing that, we want you to use

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.240
your phone or a video camera to record a video of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.510
your conversation with that friend. Capture their reactions and then

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.800
you can share that video with us on our discussion forum.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.450
Now, if you don't have access to a video camera,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.170
you can also share with us photos or some text describing

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.670
your friend's reaction while you were teaching them this piece of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.490
code. The next video we'll showcase how to share videos and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.860
photos on our discussion forum.
