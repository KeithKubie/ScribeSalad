1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,130
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
This is radio lab, the podcast. Okay,

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,610
so Robert, here's the question
that I've been puzzling over, uh,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,390
for a long time. All right. Okay. What
is the fruitiest fruit that you know,

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,220
my fruitiest fruit is a
plum. Well, no, I mean that,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,520
well that's yours and I'm not, I don't
want to take that away from you. No,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,780
you shouldn't. But when you
ask most people that question,

7
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:24,740
they say apple or orange.
No, I mean it's true.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,500
Scientists have figured out that when
you make a category in your mind,

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:32,120
you're not doing it based on like a
set list of traits. You're like you.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,390
What you do is you call to mind the
prototypical example of that category and

11
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:40,790
then you measure this new thing
against it. And for fruits,

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,560
prototype is the gala. Apple. If you
ask me the red, shiny, waxy apple,

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,010
you say there's somebody who's decided
that an apple is the fruity fruit.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,830
They've, they've done experiments,
we've done experiments.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,590
You'd bananas out poll
apples for consumption.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,130
Maybe that's not what makes a
fruitiest fruit of fruity fruit.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,310
It's a more about like how well
it represents the category.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,640
That's what it's about. Are we
talking about this though? Well,

19
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:08,590
because I'd been wanting to explore
this in story form forever. Forever.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,620
But you never have a story so it's
like a, you never find a story,

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,920
but I got one now. You did what? It's
not about fruit though. What is it about?

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,963
It's about this.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,020
What is the, what are you talking
about? Let me explain. Hey.

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,420
Okay, so we met this Guy Andrew Morantz.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,400
I work at the New Yorker as an editor and
I write stuff occasionally wandered in

26
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,640
here one day by mistake I think.
Super interesting guy, great reporter.

27
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,250
And he ended up talking
with us about this story.

28
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,680
He was reporting for the
New Yorker, but hip hop,

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,800
there are all kinds of rappers who are
trying to sing and how hip hop might be

30
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,690
changing because as we all know,

31
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:52,640
this was a genre of music that began
really specific time and place. Bronx,

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,740
seventies black and Latino kids.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,070
But it's since expanded so much.

34
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,410
The DS, inevitable questions pop
up, you know, to really simplify it.

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,450
The more white people come to the
party, the more you kind of start going,

36
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,590
okay, at what point is it?
It's clearly a, it can clearly,

37
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,160
it's clearly okay if everyone in the room
is black and it's okay if everyone is

38
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,550
black except for one guy. You
know, if Rick Rubin's at the party,

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,410
but it's still, you know,

40
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,700
black people at the tunnel in
1989 or whatever, it's still okay,

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,800
but at what point, okay, we have
fits 50% white if it's 75% white,

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,440
if all the people who own
the record labels are white,

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,710
if a majority of the popular rappers
are white, like at what point,

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,470
and that's just the racial thing.
Then there's also that sonically,

45
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,310
the way it sounds,

46
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,610
there's the way the production is kind
of merged with other forms of music.

47
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,280
So then all of a sudden you're at a point
where you get the sense that there is

48
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:51,281
somehow inherently that there's
something being replaced or taken over.

49
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,530
You start to have this dilemma,

50
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,520
which is, you know,
who owns the music now?

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,910
And the dilemma is obviously heightened
by the fact everyone knew this was

52
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,020
coming like it.

53
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,610
There's never been a form of American
popular music as far as I know that wasn't

54
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,590
invented by black people and corrupted
by white people and Andrew in his piece

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,330
and in this story a focuses on a guy
who sits right at the heart of that

56
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:18,690
dilemma. One of the most
influential Djs in hip hop today,

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,150
Peter Rosenberg is his name.
Yeah. Yeah. So tell me,

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,230
tell me how you came to him.

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,420
I mean the first thing was
the most important hip hop
radio station in the world

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,450
listening to hot 97 because I like rap
and I want to know what is popular.

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,740
And I was listening and I heard this
guy who they kept calling Rosenberg

62
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,560
and I was like, is that Rosenberg? Is
that like Whoopi Goldberg Rosenberg?

63
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,580
Like what does that mean? And then
I looked him up and I was like, no,

64
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:54,690
it's just a guy named Peter Rosenberg.
One, two, one two, one two, one, two.

65
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,150
I mean listen, doing NPR is already
pretty soft. You know what I'm saying?

66
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,370
He actually works just
down the block from us.

67
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,330
This is going to hurt your credit and
some you know, positively. So He's a guy.

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm born in 1979 he grew up in, I
grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,510
The C h. Yes it is. Peter says when
he was about nine, his brother,

70
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,040
my brother's name is Nick Rosenberg,

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,140
his brother started staying
up late and making tape,

72
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,660
DJ, DJ red alert Marley Marl.

73
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,940
He would start taping
those guys on the radio

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,540
boy,

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,110
1987 98 and here in New York they were
the only two people playing hip hop and

76
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:29,980
it was late at night

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,720
and at the time I didn't consider
myself a music person. I was only eight,

78
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,850
but I really was like, oh,
music's okay, but I'm really,

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,750
I just obsessed with sports and then
at some point I was like, oh no, no,

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,540
I love this.

81
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,710
It was punk. It was rebellious. It
was interesting. It was just cool.

82
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,900
You know now too, to be honest, it's
almost cliched when people say that, like,

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,600
who would ever guess you'd
be into hip hop? I'm like,

84
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,530
I don't know I would because I know a
million white kids who are into hip hop.

85
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,230
At that time though it was not common.

86
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,140
It was very much something that was a
badge of honor for both of us that we

87
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:09,770
really, really loved it. And I was
extra cool cause I was super young.

88
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,230
I remember one day,

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,090
here's a great thing I
traded Javan my poison tape.

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,380
I had poisons album on tape.
Every rose has a store, an album.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,450
I traded that poison tape
for his Bismarck key thing.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,770
I was like this is the best trade ever.

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,450
It was business going off
like it's a classic album.

94
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
And then, and then at some
point my dad went out,

95
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,220
he was coming home from work one
day and he said he stopped at,

96
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,510
nobody beats the Wiz.

97
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,250
He asked the guy behind the counter what
like the good rap albums where and the

98
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,550
kid actually gave him a pretty good
recommendation and he bought me a tape

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,980
called girls. I got him
locked by Super Lover C and

100
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
Cason override.

101
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,170
Oh am I going to make a
jump sit through my beat.

102
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,700
On a one minute father you have,

103
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,180
I know he told me you're
stupid until you entertain.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,550
Of course the new [inaudible] plus a
super in rocky point without doing the

105
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,713
chains.

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,200
So my knowledge base was
always very high, very early.

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,320
I had some friends in elementary school
and we would talk about rap a little bit

108
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,840
but quickly I exceeded them

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,030
and then I got to high school and I

110
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,530
really took seriously being the rap guy.

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,540
When I heard the passion in public
enemy like that resonated with me.

112
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,120
Like I say, NWA scared me,

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,320
made me interested. I just thought
this is crazy. I was like, Yo,

114
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,190
these guys are killing people.
Like this is really happening.

115
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,640
I was really happening. Are you
going to the movies in song form?

116
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,610
I was going to the movies but
to me I didn't know the lines.

117
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,173
Chemistry.

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay. So Peter goes off to college,
mid nineties did college radio,

119
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,380
hip hop show and then as he gets out
decides he wants to do this for real.

120
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,570
He secretly, you know,

121
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,330
wanted to be a hip hop DJ but people
were not taking him seriously. You know,

122
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,070
white kid from the suburbs didn't compute.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,070
He couldn't get on what was
then called urban radio.

124
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,340
So I ended up doing a year on the Howard
stern station and he was doing like

125
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,790
talk radio, you know, HFS, which I
was part time, whatever kind of radio.

126
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,030
So he kept calling hot 97 and the program
director then was a white guy from

127
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:35,170
Utah. I gave him my schpeel. I was like,
I'm super passionate about hip hop.

128
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm super honest.

129
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,930
I don't think there's ever been someone
who looks like me and is from my

130
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:44,310
background who has his honest
and loud voices. Me. I,

131
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,780
I really think I'll be something
different. And he basically said,

132
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:49,660
I don't doubt you, but no,
what are you talking about?

133
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,740
I mean they had token white
people on various shows,

134
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,070
but it was either your
super white, like Lisa g,

135
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,480
she was on the morning
show for a little while.

136
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,450
I remember that she was super white
and that was kind of the joke.

137
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,800
Or you are Bobby Konders

138
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,120
who does the Sunday night radio reggae
show who you would never know if his wife

139
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,720
busted me. Feminine love of kindness,
Java, the whole [inaudible], Kingston,

140
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:13,500
Jamaica Duffel flex because he just talks
like he's Jamaican and he only plays

141
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,240
to make music. He only hangs
out with your making. People

142
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,530
would be one of those two things where
you denied your whiteness or you just

143
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,750
were like, I'm going to, I'm
going to be the butt of the joke.

144
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,490
White bosses have often been like,
you're really talented, but I don't know.

145
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,560
When people really like you like we don't,

146
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,540
they talk to me the way we're talking
right now and think if I'm able to relate

147
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,920
to you this way, why would our
audience relate to you? If I say yes,

148
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,080
then why would my audience
say yes with me? Because,

149
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:44,200
because they assume their audience
is so different than them,

150
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,770
which might've been true for a while
and then 2007 Ebro Darden took over Ebro

151
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,590
Darden in the building. What's up man?
How you doing sir? I'm doing great man.

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,100
This is him on air. Ebro, half

153
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,690
black, half Jewish guy from Oakland
and he got it. Did hip hop had changed?

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,190
It's no longer so small and simple and
provincial that we can go on pretending

155
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,810
this is only a black and Latino thing.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,410
So when Peter came to the station
and gave him the pitch, Hey I'm PMD,

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,040
which was my old name back then, cause
I'm P P for Peter and MD from Maryland.

158
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,340
You can call me PMD and Ebro
was like, no, you're Rosenberg.

159
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,220
Ebro gave me my parents
name. I'm more or less,

160
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,940
he was like the the hook
is that, that's your name.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,660
Hot 97 Peter Rosenberg and summer
jam 2007 there's a video on,

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
on youtube of a, it's
called Eddie [inaudible].

163
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Peter Rosenberg does summer jam 2007
and it was my first day on the job.

164
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Summer Jam is the biggest event of the
year at hot 97 it's this big show at

165
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,470
giant stadium. All the top
acts I showed up there.

166
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,810
And so my first day was just
walking in a giant stadium,

167
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,370
parking my car by myself,

168
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,750
getting the backstage pass and being given
a mic flag that says hot 97 the place

169
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,640
I've always wanted to work and being told,

170
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,870
go up to all the famous artists who
are here and just getting into it.

171
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,130
Got It. Hat run.

172
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,190
And if you go back and watch that video
and see how much of an ass I make of

173
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:06,670
myself, I say to t I think I go,

174
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,660
is this your first summer jam for CIA?
Have you done a summer down before?

175
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,090
And he looks at whoever he's with
and they both start laughing.

176
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm asking, have you done many summer
jams? Today's your first day on the job.

177
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,920
My first day on the job you pack it
sail and I cannot believe in retrospect.

178
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:28,921
I survived to this day for the sounds
in Rosenberg show with Kay Fox on hot 97

179
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,081
not only survived,

180
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:37,081
he became the host of two shows on hot
97 a late night underground show and also

181
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,560
the big weekday morning show and
Rosenberg's brand is all about realness.

182
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,940
So the realness,

183
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,050
his segment in the morning is called
the realness is late night show,

184
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,690
Sunday night to Monday morning. Wait,

185
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,710
it's called real late with Peter
Rosenberg. It's all real, real, real.

186
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,220
It's going to be real. Really
Real. Keeping it real. Is it real?

187
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:03,990
Because that's the, that's the central
question. Can I be a real hip hop guy

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,330
even though I'm Peter Rosenberg from
suburban Maryland? I think you're,

189
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,860
I think you're raising
an interesting point.

190
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,810
Most outsiders rarely become insiders.

191
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,290
The Peter says the key to understanding
him is that he's kind of both.

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,350
Like on the one hand he is this
suburban white kid from Maryland.

193
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,990
He doesn't pretend to be anything
but, but on the other hand,

194
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,190
I mean a big part of Rosenberg's job is
to go to shows and blogs and get tapes

195
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:30,440
from people and find the new thing.

196
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:35,441
So he has a stable of like
20 or 30 underground artists
who are making tapes and

197
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,860
you know, trying to pass around beats
and what's more in salary than that.

198
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,110
Plus he is like a purist.

199
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,260
I've always liked there's a
certain pure form of hip hop.

200
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,910
And because you know in the kind of rap
nerd community they talk about certain

201
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,130
things that are like lyrics and listening

202
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,800
for the metaphors and the
intricacies of the music.

203
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,870
They talk about boom bap beats,
you'll get in the trade up.

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,630
That'll be big sounding. Drum wise.

205
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,740
It's boom bap like of kicks
it off yet original raps.

206
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,470
It's just a feeling of sound
of energy. This is Ali,

207
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,960
Ali Shaheed Muhammad, a
tribe called [inaudible].

208
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,350
We called him up because he is the DJ
and producer for a tribe called quest and

209
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,370
for Peter tribe they're the
prototype. I was obsessed with them.

210
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,550
They were, they are like
that shiny red apple.

211
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,140
They defined the category and in fact
I guess up until my wedding weekend,

212
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,100
best weekend of his life he says,

213
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,450
or I guess now it would be his
second best was when he was,

214
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,810
I was 14 you went to a tribe show. It was

215
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,160
everything I ever dreamed a hip
hop concert experience would be.

216
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,850
He says he spent the whole time at the
front of the stage waving this hat around

217
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,370
that said dog's d a w g S.

218
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,550
Cause one of the lead rappers is named
fife dog and I held up my dog's hat so

219
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:02,861
much at the concert that eventually fife
the five the five dog acknowledged me

220
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,980
the same way I would do now if I was
hosting and someone kept doing it.

221
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,730
He just gave me the hand like I got
it. You can put the hat down on that.

222
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,300
This was a weird moment for hip hop,

223
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,010
not just for Peter but
for hip hop in general,

224
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:21,240
like the early nineties this was a
moment when you had stations like hot 97

225
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:24,570
converting to all hip hop
formats, playing, you know, NWA,

226
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,640
public enemy tribe called quest groups,

227
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,700
you know that were suddenly attracting
loads of white suburban fans.

228
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,490
Yet if you listen to their lyrics,
nope, everybody for bottom line,

229
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,540
some of them at least
they were about stuff.

230
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,280
Those fans could have never experienced

231
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,560
struggle, depression, lack of
opportunities in the ghettos.

232
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,830
The fact that you have young
black teenagers who are
living in a society where

233
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,120
they're told that they will never amount
to anything and that their lives have

234
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:00,630
no value, no worth.
That to me becomes the,

235
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,150
the angsty and the
frustration and the rage,

236
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,940
which is the embodiment
of the music. Music.

237
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,600
I wanted to be a part of this of
black culture. Like I felt, I, I,

238
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,930
I've always been very interested in
loving things that required defense.

239
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,630
And Hip hop is definitely
that from the beginning.

240
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,280
It was initially shunned by black radio
because it was thought being decent.

241
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,730
Then you had the whole Tipper Gore
thing. I love things like that.

242
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:29,421
I don't know why.

243
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:34,421
And I think I do always see hip hop in
that sort of light in the way that it

244
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:38,510
needs defense. Can we talk about,
um, your, your frack is with, um,

245
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,810
Nikki Minaj? Of course.
That's my paragraph two. If,

246
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,550
God forbid I drop dead tomorrow,

247
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,190
it's Peter Rosenberg is on
holiday seven involve law.

248
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,160
The next paragraph in 2012,

249
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,950
Nicki Minaj,

250
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,640
um, is this rapper from
Queens, hugely talented rapper.

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,970
She, she's not the one on
American idol, is she? Oh, okay.

252
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,390
Now I have a face for
the name. [inaudible]

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,420
and she kind of blew everyone away on
this Kanya song called monster. You know,

254
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:13,280
she was with all these big rappers
and Jay z was on the song and she blew

255
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,090
everyone out of the water.
Those things each year,

256
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,970
the number start blocking
called t cause that's what

257
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,550
I thought. She was really good.

258
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,750
I thought she was a
natural and a beautiful,

259
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,100
like I thought she was a
total package. In fact,

260
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,080
the year before it all happened,

261
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,340
2011 I pulled her aside at
summer jam and I said, Hey,

262
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,210
I think you could be the greatest
female artist of all time,

263
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,740
the greatest female rap
artists of all time.

264
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,790
And I just want you to know that in
thinking that I'm going to hold you to a

265
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,180
high standard. So I probably will say
things about you. You said all of that.

266
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah, in a really quick moment
too. It was really brief.

267
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,320
She probably would even
remember it, but it happened.

268
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,840
We'd remember that if
someone said that, I said,

269
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,490
I think you could be the greatest. She
had all this underground credit. Right?

270
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,990
And, and then how did she
spend that credit? Well,

271
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,160
she started making poppier and poppier
records culminating in the following

272
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,960
song, which if you are me,

273
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,400
you've not been able to get out
of your head for a week. And

274
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,910
she made this song called
starships, let's go to the beach,

275
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,400
let's go get away. Starships
is a blatant pop song.

276
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,380
Lowest common denominators. I didn't,

277
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:33,950
I didn't like the song you listened to
that song and you cannot tell that it's

278
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,230
not a song by Katie Perry or
pink or it could be anyone

279
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,090
[inaudible]

280
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,750
so all of a sudden who is
the underground cred cop?

281
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,860
SciFest sounds in Rosenberg show,

282
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,870
but Peter Rosenberg and I know for a
second several mornings for his segment

283
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,960
called the realness. He would get on
there and play. I play a clip of starship,

284
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,610
check out this hip hop.

285
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,073
Oh

286
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,240
that's hardcore hip hop.

287
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,750
That would this song be considered
another hardcore hip hop song?

288
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,140
No, stop it.

289
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,010
That's not fair. That's not
fair. Maybe she's just, you know,

290
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,650
there is a real question being
asked at the center of this,

291
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:28,210
which is what is this music?

292
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,370
Where are the boundaries are and
also is this where hip hop is going?

293
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,330
Is it just let me cash in and just
follow the trends of what white music is

294
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:41,540
doing? It would be too strong to
call it like you felt betrayed as a,

295
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,850
as a music fan. Yeah. It felt like,

296
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:48,530
come on we I it just in the moment it
felt like you're, you're a hip hop star.

297
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,010
Why would you, why would you do

298
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,020
this? This is a, and this is not for us.

299
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,250
When core hip hop artists make pop songs,

300
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
it upsets me because it's,

301
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,570
it can be a moment that
blurs and messes up hip hop.

302
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
To be frank, this song right here,

303
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,310
starship is literally one of the most
sellout songs in hip hop history.

304
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,400
Just to put that comment in a little
tiny bit more context for just a second.

305
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,290
Now we mentioned of
course the history, right?

306
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,910
That so many forms of popular music had
been invented by black people opted by

307
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,330
white people, Jazz, blues,
Rock. We all know the store. No.

308
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,680
According to Frannie Kelly,

309
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,130
one of the hosts of a podcast
called microphone check,

310
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,940
which is a hip hop podcast kind of
NPR music according to her 2013,

311
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:39,330
was the first year that no black
artists had a number one song.

312
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:43,200
And since 1958 since they
started the hot 100 charts,

313
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:46,170
this is the first year where no black
artists have made it to number one.

314
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,240
Now this may be a blip, may not be,

315
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,790
but what's clear is that
there is a new force in town,

316
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,320
a style of music called
e. D m BDM is, is uh,

317
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,580
a meaningless acronym that stands for
electronic dance music. And it's like,

318
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,840
you know, more like speech

319
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,633
than a bap

320
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,133
[inaudible].

321
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,860
It's sort of an amalgam of Synthy
Dancy, techno, euro poppy stuff.

322
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,600
And it has taken over.

323
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,170
What happened with EDM was
just so glaring and fast.

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,550
And then to see that sort of start to
creep into hip hop was scary for people

325
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,590
because according to Frantic
Kelly would scary. Is it?

326
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,760
EDM is a style of music that's meant to
work on any dance floor with any crowd.

327
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,970
So in a way it's like a music
without history on purpose.

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,840
A lot of the criticism of like
EDM is that it is all about money.

329
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:38,580
It is the corporatization of
genre with a long history.

330
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,610
So in some ways I think the root of the
protest is don't sell our stuff to the

331
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,004
highest better.

332
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,730
So a little context. So anyhow,

333
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,430
after one of the most sellout
songs in hip hop history,

334
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,100
listen to it. After Peter Trash
talks, Nicki Minaj to star ships,

335
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,780
we arrive at that year's summer jam 2012
and that year Nikki Minaj was going to

336
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:08,650
be one of the big headliners plan was
for her to perform on the main stage

337
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,790
inside giant stadium.

338
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,260
But outside the stadium in the parking
lot earlier in the day there was the

339
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:13,981
festival stage,

340
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,910
which is where the underground backpack
kids hang out and that's Rosenberg's

341
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,450
zone. So he's introducing
the acts on that stage.

342
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,970
Now hold on, before I get to
the real hip hop of the day,

343
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,620
cause I see the real hip hop heads
sprinkled in here. I see him. I said,

344
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,440
in trying to hype up this crowd,

345
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,440
I know there's some chicks here
waiting to single star ships later.

346
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,320
I'm not talking to y'all
right now. That bull crap.

347
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,470
I know it goes Ooh. And she a
little bit like there's a cheer.

348
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,040
Nothing crazy though. Just irregular
cheer. It's not like I didn't,

349
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,220
a bomb was dropped.

350
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,050
I forgot that

351
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,800
not only was the festival
stage live streaming,

352
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,050
but it was live streaming on
her website and her core fans,

353
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,440
her barbs as they're known,
are 13 year old girls.

354
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,770
And when they see Peter
say that they go wild

355
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,260
and they go out on the Internet
saying, Oh, who is this Rosenberg guy?

356
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,970
What is his deal? And he says,

357
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:18,410
within minutes it got back to Nicki and
her people before she went on stage,

358
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
before she went on stage.
This is interesting.

359
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:23,990
So then there's this backstage
conversation, Rosenberg. Basically,

360
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,810
as soon as he gets off stage,
his boss, my boss comes out,

361
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,580
pokes his head around
the curtain and goes,

362
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,400
did you say something about Nicki
Minaj? I was like, ah. And I,

363
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,780
I legit didn't remember.
I'm like, Oh yeah, I did.

364
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,170
And he's like, yeah, well she just
canceled the show so she's not coming.

365
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,470
And I was like, I was like, oh.

366
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,670
And I looked at my phone and I go
to Twitter sitting on the stage,

367
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:48,600
the crowd's all out there.

368
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:53,410
I'm at giant stadium and I look on
Twitter and I go to trends and on the main

369
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:57,730
trend page it just says Peter
Rosenberg and I was like,

370
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,690
oh wow, this is nuts.

371
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,230
It is a Sunday afternoon
at like five o'clock.

372
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,770
And I was like the third
most trending right,

373
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,980
being in the world [inaudible]

374
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,400
I was just watching my name
get bigger in a moment.

375
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,840
97 CJ, Peter Rosenberg, one of the
big dramas that happen in New York.

376
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,570
I was reading just my name
over and over and over again.

377
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,680
The dual roles and Vernon dual
from high 37 Peter Rosenberg.

378
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,300
All these people saying, I
don't know who this guy is,

379
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,790
but he's dissing my favorite artists.

380
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,570
I'm just really disappointed and I
don't understand how she, I was reading,

381
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:39,820
who is this guy? What he said, starship
songs not hitting out here Rosenberg.

382
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,180
Man That's not real hip hop.

383
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,280
He was the one man say one thing and
everybody stopped was four then he must've

384
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,660
gotten some serious
credit from this. He, yes.

385
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,250
Not only was his name getting out there,

386
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:52,040
but it was getting out there as I'm
the gatekeeper. I'm the defender.

387
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,610
I'm the defender of the real,

388
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,843
the realness.

389
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,270
I couldn't appreciate it at first because
I didn't know if I was maybe going to

390
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:02,810
get fired for messing up summer jam
because Nikki's ain't beefing with the

391
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:06,470
station. Yeah, come on. Your state
will even say something to my,

392
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,470
she's calling in, you know,

393
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,370
mad at the station of apologizing.

394
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:14,000
Nikki Busta rhymes gets involved trying
to broker a deal on master flex gets

395
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,950
involved, change some emails.

396
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,010
They're trying to reach a day time now
it becomes a month long process. That's

397
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,980
nuts. If they say unanimously, no,
you were wrong about that song.

398
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:29,150
This is our song. We included
in our map of what's going on.

399
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,820
Stop trying to draw the map. What do
you say to that in your inside of you?

400
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,080
I think my gut reaction
is you know nothing.

401
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,580
You don't draw the map,

402
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,640
you need people like us to draw the map
or there's nothing or what is there if

403
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,560
if we don't get to determine
certain things, who, who does,

404
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:55,040
we should leave that to the crazy 13 year
olds who may not even like this artist

405
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,790
and two years as well

406
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,110
woman hearing that. It's to Kelly again,

407
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,100
this idea that young girls
will hear starships and say,

408
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,160
oh that's hip hop. That's
what I want to hear.

409
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:11,750
That's what I'm going to judge everything
against is wildly unfair to the

410
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,460
intelligence of young girls.

411
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,890
Freddie says they can figure out the
difference between hip hop and pop.

412
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,200
They don't need help. It's
insulting. And furthermore,

413
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,170
when he chose starships to single out,

414
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,770
it felt revealing of another layer to
this debate that people weren't saying out

415
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:31,040
loud, which is when people refer
to things as quote real hip hop,

416
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,720
that's usually code for aggressive
street, masculine, authentic.

417
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,380
Whereas when they say pop,
that's usually code for feminine,

418
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,210
which is a perversion of the music
period. And so there is this idea that,

419
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,090
you know, people make
songs for the ladies,

420
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,870
which implies that all the rest of them
are songs that we can't hear or God

421
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,110
forbid understand.

422
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,181
Okay.

423
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:58,181
So all of this was swirling around
months go by and then fast forward to the

424
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,810
week before the next summer jam.
This is 2014, 2013 in 2013. Yeah,

425
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,420
the food is still going at this point.
It's a year later. But going to Andrew,

426
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,160
Nikki decides it's time to settle,

427
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,460
maybe because she wanted to perform
it that year. Summer jam or so.

428
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Nicki Minaj sits down with radio station
hot 97 to clear the air with DJ Peter

429
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,530
Rosenberg. She comes to the station

430
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,890
summer jam to make her peace and they do
this whole interview with Rosenberg and

431
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:29,420
Nicki Minaj and Ebro the
boss is moderating on the
air on the air. Rosenberg.

432
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:33,230
So this is all you sir. Um, where
would you like this interview to go?

433
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,053
[inaudible]

434
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,980
um, I dunno, I'm excited. I'm
excited to see Nikki because uh,

435
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:41,590
it's very odd to have someone
that you don't know very well,

436
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:45,070
who's become like such a fixture in
your life. Like I've always wondered,

437
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:45,611
I was always like,

438
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:50,611
I wonder if Nikki knows that she's come
up every day in my life for 350 days,

439
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:55,390
like point that where starships got
played on my wedding and it was like the

440
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:58,990
biggest deal at my wedding was starships
playing at my wedding after some

441
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,530
opening remarks, Peter
basically apologizes.

442
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,150
I am sorry that things
went as left as they did.

443
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,260
I never had ill feelings about you
as a human being ever basically says,

444
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:12,490
I have nothing against you as a person
beyond my sort of distaste for that song.

445
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,630
That's cool. It's one onto the
branch. Do you mean that? Yeah,

446
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,680
I mean she then goes out of her way to
apologize to her fans for skipping out on

447
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,680
the Gig. But um, then the
gloves come off. You know what?

448
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,380
Like I get it. Like that's
what you do, I guess. To me,

449
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,410
I just don't know your resume.
You know what I'm saying?

450
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:37,130
So I never found you funny. I
never found you entertaining.

451
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,210
I never found you smart.

452
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,190
I just found you annoying because
you know I grew up in New York.

453
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,530
I've grown up on hot 97 like I know Angie
and I know flex and Mr c and all these

454
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:52,170
people, whether they like me
or whether or not we get along,

455
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:55,290
I just know their resume. But
like with you, I was just like,

456
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
who are you [inaudible]

457
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,870
I don't recognize you as an
authority on what's authentic

458
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,940
to me. You don't have enough of
a resume to make those comments.

459
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,260
Who are you to tell me what to do?

460
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,800
What people don't understand is that
when I came, when I was doing this,

461
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,390
I took a lot from people from men.

462
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,080
She was like my whole career,

463
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:22,081
they've just been random men who have
like been in a position to stop me and

464
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,740
tell me why I'm not good enough.

465
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,770
I just did. I just don't want
a lot of stuff from guys.

466
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,820
And here you are. I don't know
you. You're just some random man.

467
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,660
And then Ebro jumps in and
kind of jokingly trying to
lighten the mood goes and

468
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,670
you white. I didn't even say that.

469
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,370
I never should ever implied
anything about white.

470
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:42,370
She plugged them and then she jumps
in and goes, no, no, no. That too.

471
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,340
Being white also struck a chord with me
if I'm being honest, because I was like,

472
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:52,170
Yo, he's on a black station
dissing black people. Like I don't,

473
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,320
I don't. I just didn't
like the feel of it.

474
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,630
Did you get back to that idea,

475
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,680
that category idea that like when you
don't have that like set list of criteria

476
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:05,680
to help you figure out
who's in and who's out.

477
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,310
It's all about a gut feeling into Nicki
Minaj that moment have a white guy from

478
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:15,120
the suburbs tell her a black woman from
Queens that she's not hip hop enough.

479
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,220
[inaudible]

480
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,950
just felt wrong. But then Ali Shahi
Muhammad from tribe called quest,

481
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:23,890
put it this way, maybe it feels wrong,
but maybe this is actually evolution.

482
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,220
40 years into it, that's
what it's supposed to be.

483
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:31,221
At some point we're all going to be so
far removed from the origin that no one

484
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,510
would then qualify really.

485
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,170
But if you're going to be the
person to carry the torch,

486
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,150
I guess so be the gatekeeper and
at some point what qualifies you?

487
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,490
It's your heart miss that feeling.

488
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,230
You could be Bill Gates kid is still
understand the struggle enough to be like,

489
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:53,700
Yo, I'm riding with that. Yeah
and I want to fight for that.

490
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,290
I was like, Yo, he's on a black
station. Distinct black people.

491
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:03,070
Like I don't, I don't, I just
didn't like the feel of it.

492
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,150
Who am I going to dis if not black
people. I'm on a hip hop station.

493
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:09,060
I have to just blind people
sometimes I if I just wipe up slowly.

494
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,820
Now you watch your mouth, sir. You
only want me to go with Mac Miller.

495
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:15,240
I mean who am I going to do Macklemore's
am actually plenty of artists now.

496
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,910
I used to only just white rappers,
but as I've gotten further along,

497
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:21,210
I felt I earned the right to
dis all things I didn't like.

498
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,830
I was like, no, we

499
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,823
can wait.

500
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,590
Rosenberg to this day takes credit for
her summer jam saying my next project is

501
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,520
going to be a US hardcore hip hop
album. When her album's awesome,

502
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:40,740
you will see me take lots of
credit for it. Absolutely.

503
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,450
She called me the other day and
I was half asleep and she's like,

504
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,920
hello, I know you're thinking,
why is this bitch calling me?

505
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,610
And I was like not at all what's going on?

506
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,310
And she wanted to ask me about her new
song and the amazing thing was she wanted

507
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,000
to ask me an opinion on something and it
makes me feel ultimately super special.

508
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,360
So we s Peter Legs. So what does that
mean? Like if you are now a gatekeeper,

509
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:08,350
you white guy from suburban Maryland.
I am very commercial radio station.

510
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:09,670
What does that mean for hip hop?

511
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,820
Does that mean that hip hop
has by default been co-opted?

512
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,530
Cause like here you are. I don't know.

513
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I mean I feel like hip hop is in a better
place now than before I started doing

514
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,690
this. I would break it
down on paper and go,

515
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,780
let me tell you where we were when I
started my underground show in 2007.

516
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,440
And let me tell you where I think we are
in 2014 and let me show you how many of

517
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,680
those artists I broke in support it and
worked hard with and talked to the label

518
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,920
about and pushed and how many
I had an involvement with.

519
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,920
I think you'd see a really
high percentage. So that
was part of his answer.

520
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,210
We asked Andrew the same question.
It's complicated. I mean, I, look, I,

521
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,570
I don't think that hip hop is
dead. There was some quote, um,

522
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,500
Frank Zappa I think said jazz
isn't dead. It just smells funny.

523
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,410
Like, I don't think hip
hop is wonderful. Yeah.

524
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,800
I mean, that's should be our title
up. Isn't that funny? But I do think,

525
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,540
I think hip hop isn't
dead. It just smells funny.

526
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,130
It would always smells a little funky.

527
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,113
[inaudible]

528
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,850
huge thanks to Andrew Moranz, uh,

529
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,210
and the New Yorker magazine for
letting us borrow Andrew for a beat.

530
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,200
Definitely check out his story
in, uh, The New Yorker magazine.

531
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:30,750
It's called an old school.
It's a great story.

532
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,630
It goes into way more detail
than we can get into here. Also,

533
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:37,640
big thanks to Frannie Kelly
and Alicia, Ede Muhammad, uh,

534
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,190
who together they cohost the NPR podcast.

535
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,140
Microphone check and a well, I'm
Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.

536
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,570
Thank you for listening. Oh, and
before we go, just one last thing.

537
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,530
So lest you think that like hip
hop has arrived at this new, um,

538
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,830
like quote, post racial
situation, which, you know,

539
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,860
we for a second we were like, maybe
we're just thinking out loud with Peter.

540
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,020
He was like, no way. No. Got It.

541
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,200
If there's one thing I could
demand that air during this piece,

542
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,520
it would be this statement right here.

543
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,680
Nothing has driven me more crazy over
the course of my time in hip hop than

544
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,230
white people who come up
to me and go, you know,

545
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:18,410
and it used to be really bad
when he first came out. You know,

546
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,400
m and m is just so talented. I
don't even listen to hip hop,

547
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:27,070
but M&M I mean, now he's good. Well,

548
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,790
if you don't listen to hip hop,
why the hell should I care?

549
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:35,360
What your thoughts on m and m are and
how do you know that he's good? No,

550
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,190
you know that he's white. You know
that he's white and is M&M Good?

551
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,600
Yes. It just so happens that he's as
good as you as you're guessing he is.

552
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,500
But that's random. You don't even
know that m and m could be any,

553
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,260
could've been one of the dudes for Milli
Vanilli and you would've thought it was

554
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,830
great and that drives me nuts.
And so anytime I think about, oh,

555
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:55,670
we're post racial,

556
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,330
just look at what m and m concerts
look like and what the sales look like.

557
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
And you can be instantly reminded that
even though m and m has no experience

558
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:08,750
that average suburban white America could
ever identify with, I mean culturally,

559
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:12,680
the experience he went through is much
more common with someone who went with,

560
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,280
went through a black struggle than any
sort of regular white suburban life.

561
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,140
And this is the guy who came up in a
rough situation in a million ways, um,

562
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,580
was the odd man out all the time,
never had anything, and then makes it,

563
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,930
and all of a sudden the fact that
people like, oh, I so identify with him.

564
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,220
What is it? Why do I identify with
a guy who's from a trailer park?

565
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,140
I'm from a history of drug abuse,

566
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,670
who raps about things that I'd be
terrified of if a black man was saying it.

567
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,950
But I identify with him so much.

568
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,510
And then m and m cause he's
amazing raps about this same thing.

569
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,320
He does a song called Dear White
