00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.930
RANDY: Woke up in a bit
of a mood this morning.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.170
Bit of a poor me
situation going on.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.870
I just-- you know, it's
been going back and forth

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.600
and back and forth now.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.930
But I think today I
really hit a wall.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.200
[music playing]

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.770
So I'm going to go out
and do some fishing

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.230
and see if I can feel better.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.130
It's really snowing.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.100
[music playing]

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.970
There's no fish.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.630
They're just not there anymore.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.670
They were there, and then all
of a sudden, they weren't.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.030
There's been a direct
correlation between temperature

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.530
and food production.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.970
It was like something that
just happened overnight.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.930
One second there was tons
of food, and then the next,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.100
wasn't anymore.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.830
At this point, it's
been about a week

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.230
since I've caught any
fish, and no grouse.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.030
The greens are wilted, and I'm
not seeing deer scat or a sign

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.630
around.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.070
So I'm absolutely feeling
anxious, just not knowing where

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.230
my next meal is coming from.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.570
[music playing]

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.530
Five weeks I walked here.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.600
Walked all up and
down my territory.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.130
In solitude.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.900
Eating only what
the land provided.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.030
Lack of food and lack of
companionship at this point

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.070
is really sort of
taking its toll on me.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.330
And in all honesty,
I'm struggling.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.470
No matter where I'm at, I
actively search out community.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.970
I think that that's one
of the things that's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.000
been so hard for me
out here is that I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.370
have no sense of community.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.930
With community, comes
a sense of place.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.830
Without community, there's
a huge part of my world

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.230
that's missing.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.930
And I wish that I could pull
it from the environment.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.300
In some ways, I
have been, but it's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.770
a temporary fix, like putting
a Band-Aid on a bullet hole.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.700
I was looking forward to pushing
myself past that barrier.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.500
I want to continue going.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.600
[music playing]

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.470
I just don't want to do
it without anybody else.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.770
This is Randy.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.930
I'm officially tapping out.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.530
I'm ready to go home.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.930
[music playing]

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.530
What's going on?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.500
I haven't been able to
produce really any food.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.570
And set up a lot
of traps, and those

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.230
weren't producing as well.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.600
But there's a whole other aspect
to me that's not being fed up

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.400
here, and that is my lack of
social interaction with people

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.470
and my lack of community.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.230
It's difficult.
It's been difficult.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.970
You know, I've reached the end
of my time here in Mongolia.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.170
[music playing]

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.770
In a lot of ways, this
place has pulled me in

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.400
and made me feel at home.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.000
Kept me warm, fairly well-fed
for the first couple of weeks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.470
Kept me company.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.030
When I left Vancouver,
I felt like I didn't

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.170
fully do what I wanted to do.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.030
This feels like it's
time and feels right.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.870
Going beyond 21 days was
in some way a goal for me.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.470
I wanted to last longer
than I lasted in Vancouver,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.070
and so I feel like this
was a redemption for me.
