00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.830
OLGA RUSSAKOVSKY: AI4ALL grew
out of my passion and also

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.510
my Ph.D. adviser's passion
for diversity and inclusion.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.390
Computer science

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.760
is a very, very
male-dominated field.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.939
And for a while, I sort
of handled that by saying,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.980
you know, this doesn't
matter, and sort of gender

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.855
doesn't matter, and
diversity doesn't matter.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.610
And actually, it
makes a big difference

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.520
to have people
that look like you

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.570
and have sort of similar
experiences to you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.100
and that can relate to you.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.580
So I started sort of
appreciating the need for more

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.340
diversity at all levels.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.240
If we have people who only come
from certain perspectives, who

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.730
were shaped by certain
particular cultures,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.210
that's inevitably going to
propagate into the AI models

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.100
that we're actually building.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.300
DENNIS KWARTENG:

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.970
ADITHI RAGHAVAN: I go to a
humanities-based school,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.740
and so we do a lot of work
with philosophy and psychology.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.500
And I guess I'm
looking to combine

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
my passion for
mental health with AI

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.230
and hopefully create
a project that

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.130
can help others who are dealing
disorders like depression, bipolar

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.760
disorder.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.030
I just want to be able to
make it easier for people who

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.920
struggle with things like that.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.610
OLGA RUSSAKOVSKY: We really try to
emphasize AI for social good --

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.640
AI in health care,
AI in education,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
AI for accessibility,
AI for disaster relief,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.950
AI for solving all of these
various challenges and problems

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.280
that we face in the world.
