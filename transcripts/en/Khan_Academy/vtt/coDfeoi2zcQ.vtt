00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.300
Voiceover:These are
vectors A and B, all right?

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.333
That's vector A, that's vector B.

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.366
Which of the following describes a valid

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:11.766
way of obtaining vector A minus vector B?

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.800
So let's look at our
choices right over here.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.633
Here they just depicted
vector B, just like it's

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.300
depicted here, it's maybe
shifted over a little bit.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.700
And then over here,
they depicted vector A,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.100
the negative of vector
A, and it looks like

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.633
they're taking the negative of vector A,

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.566
and to that they're adding
vector B, and then they're

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:36.266
claiming that this magenta
vector is A minus B.

00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:40.100
If we ignore what they
wrote over here, what

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.433
they've done is they've
added negative A to B.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:48.366
So this is the negative
of vector A plus vector B.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.833
Or we could think of it as
vector B minus vector A.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.900
So this one right over here is not right.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.133
If we swap the signs,
if this was a negative,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.433
if we put negative A plus
B, then we'd say okay,

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.300
this is accurate, but
they want us to figure out

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.100
valid ways of obtaining A
minus B and this isn't that.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.767
This is B minus A.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.333
Let's look at the other choice.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.166
You have vector A.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.833
Let's start at the tail of vector A,

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.566
get to the head of vector A.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.633
Over here we have the tail
of the negative of vector B,

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.900
so they essentially flipped
it over when you take the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.366
negative of it, and so we're
adding negative B to A.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.166
If we take the tail of
where we started to the head

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.633
of where we ended, yes,
this would be vector A

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.500
plus negative vector B,
which is the same thing

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.100
as vector A minus vector
B, so that one is right.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.733
That's a valid way of obtaining
vector A minus vector B.
