00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.120
Hello everyone.

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:12.000
We will start now with our
second set of panelists.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.120
They told me--

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.880
each of them came up to me
independently actually and said,

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.400
"Well, we heard part of the first panel

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.960
and I feel like we're going
to be a little bit redundant."

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.560
But as I told them

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:28.400
you will hear their insights
through a different set of lenses

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.200
and a different set of perspectives
as tenured faculty.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.400
These three distinguished faculty

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:39.400
have contributed a great deal
to this institution, but only to--

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.240
also to their fields.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.800
And I will introduce them in the order
in which they will be speaking

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.400
and they will each have
ten minutes for remarks

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.400
and we hope plenty of time
for questions at the end.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.800
Gary King, to my immediate right,

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:59.400
is the newly Albert J. Weatherhead III
University Professor

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.600
at Harvard University.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.800
As you may know,

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:06.840
university professors are
unique here at Harvard.

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.080
There are only 22 such titles,

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.640
and Gary King

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:17.440
is an individual who
well deserves it.

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.640
He is presently based

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.720
in the Department of Government in
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:26.040
and serves as Director of the Institute
for Quantitative Social Science.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
Dr. King develops and applies
empirical methods

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.120
in many areas of social
science research

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:34.080
focusing on innovations
that span the range

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.200
from statistical theory
to practical application.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.480
Gary has been elected fellow of the
American Statistical Association.

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.760
Fellow of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science,

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.560

and President of the Society for
Political Methodology,

00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:00.560
and Vice President of the American
Political Science Association.

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.560
He has done a great
deal of service to,

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.160
not just the Harvard community,

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.840
but to his profession.

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:08.440
Dr. King received his B.A.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.800
from SUNY New Paltz

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.520
and his PhD. from the
University of Wisconsin, Madison.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.800
Professor Michele Lamont

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.480
is the Robert I. Goldman
professor of European Studies

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:22.200
and Professor of
Sociology and of African

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.680

as well as the Senior
Advisor on Faculty Development

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:31.040
and Diversity for the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:35.360
Dr. Lamont is a fellow of the Canadian
Institute for Advanced Research

00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:39.120
and is the co-director of its research
program on successful societies.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.720
Michele's scholarly interests
center on shared concepts

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.720
of worth and their
impact on hierarchies

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:47.480
in a number
of social domains.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.080
She has written on how
culture contributes to ethno-racial

00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:52.400
and class inequality

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.040
and on the evaluation of
excellence in higher education.

00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.280
She was born in
Toronto and received her B.A.

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.680
and her Masters in Political
Theory at Ottawa University,

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:06.960
before pursuing her doctoral
research in sociology

00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:09.160
at the University of Paris

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.840
where she graduated in 1983.

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.000
She held a post-doctoral
fellowship at Stanford University

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:18.480
and took her first faculty position
at the University of Texas, Austin;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.160
soon after leaving
for Princeton University

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.680
where she was granted
tenure there in 1993

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.280
and to the rank of
full professor in 2000.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.520
We were very privileged

00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:36.240
and certainly honored
that she and her husband

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.360
came here to Harvard
University in 2003

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:40.640
where she was appointed

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:43.920
Robert I. Goldman Professor
of European Studies in 2006.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560
She,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.640
as some of you may know,

00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:52.480
is the partner of Frank Dobbin
also in the Department of Sociology

00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.200
and they have three children:
Gabriel, Pierre, and Chloe.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.920
And finally,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.920
Professor David Thomas is the
H. Naylor Fitzhugh Professor

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:03.360
of Business Administration,

00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:05.520
as well as being the unit head

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.560
in Organizational Behavior at
the Harvard Business School.

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.600
He joined the HBS faculty in 1990

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:14.200
and became a tenured
professor in 1998.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920
From 2005 to 2008,

00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.760
he served as Senior Associate Dean

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.560
and Director of Faculty Recruitment.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.920
David is a recognized thought leader

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.760
in the area of strategic
human resource management.

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:29.160
His research addresses issues
related to executive development,

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:31.740
cultural diversity and organizations, 

00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:34.041
leadership and organizational change.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.680
His book Breaking Through:
The Making of Minority Executives

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:38.840
in Corporate America

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.520
has met with critical acclaim and
reviews by academics and journalists,

00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.040
and is the recipient of the
Academy of Management's

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:49.440
George R. Terry Book Award
for outstanding contribution

00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.680
to the advancement of
management knowledge.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.320
Professor Thomas received
his Bachelor of Arts,

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:56.400
his Master of Philosophy,

00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.280
and his Doctor of Philosophy Degrees

00:04:58.281 --> 00:04:59.640
from Yale University.

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:03.160
He also holds a Master of
Arts in Organizational Psychology

00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.800
from Columbia University.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.200
Actually, the three of us
would appreciate it

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:11.560
if you just keep going
on for a while.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.920
[Laughter]

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.200
You could just tell tales.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.240
I heard the last panel

00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:23.400
said something about
the lack of ego involvement.

00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.440
[Laughter]

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.800
Okay. So I have three
things I want to say.

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.920
The first one is

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.120
that you should ignore
what we have to say.

00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:35.360
And the reason why

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:39.680
is that being an academic
involves cutting your own path.

00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:41.320
And so if you did exactly

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.800
what the three of us-what any
one of the three of us did,

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.280
well, we already did it

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:46.920
so you wouldn't get as
much credit for it.

00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:47.920
So, you know,

00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:49.880
take the advice that we have as,

00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.480
you know, good guesses but

00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.120
you need to do it yourself.

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:56.080
I mean your goal is the creation,

00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.400
dissemination, and preservation of knowledge

00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:02.840
so that's my summary of
what the University is about.

00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.560
And so go find something
in one of those categories

00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.040
and come back and show us.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.320
But remember, I mean,

00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.600
there's more academics
within walking distance

00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:16.440
of where we're sitting now
than at any place on the planet

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:17.560
in the history of the world.

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:19.800
I mean it's an
extraordinary place.

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.840
Not only do your folksâ€¦

00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:24.440
Not only are your
folks really happy that

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.520
they have a Professor at Harvard,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.320
but actually it's
really cool to be here.

00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:33.880
I mean if you
eliminated all the faculty

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:35.240
and students from this place,

00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.200
like all the faculty and students,

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:39.760
this would still be a
spectacular place.

00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.840
It would still have the
best collection of minds

00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.520
that you'd see almost anywhere.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.120
And then if you eliminated
all the rest of the people at Harvard,

00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:48.000
we have second-rate
universities

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:50.280
like M.I.T. [Laughter]

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.800
around the corner.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.320
I mean it's extraâ€¦
it's really extraordinary.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.040
Harvard is an enormousâ€¦

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.720
even just Harvard is
an enormous place.

00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:01.640
So go out and take
advantage of it.

00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.680
You could spend the next
10 or 20 or 50 years

00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:06.680
in your office - hopefully 50 years -

00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:09.360
in your office not seeing anybody.

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.320
But go out and find people

00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:13.360
in other parts of the University.

00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:13.960
It's not that hard.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.880
You know, doing things that
you don't know anything about

00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.400
that you could bring
in ideas to your field.

00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:20.240
It's a really great thing.

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.080
So anyway,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.364
ignore what I have to say
except all the things I say.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.640
So the second point is,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.480
a little closer to the topic is that

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.560
you're now a public figure, okay?

00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.520
So this is really like going
from a graduate student

00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:34.760
to being a faculty.

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:36.800
This is really something to get used to.

00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:38.680
So just like a politician
or a movie star,

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:39.600
you're a public figure.

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:41.640
Not as many people are
going to listen to you sing

00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:43.960
but you really are a public figure.

00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:44.520
In other words,

00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:45.640
you have an audience

00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.280
that's much larger
than you could know

00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:49.360
on a one-on-one basis, okay?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.520
So, you know, be public.

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:52.480
Get a website.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.920
Distribute everything that you write

00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.200
that you want people to see

00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:59.720
in as wide a range as possible.

00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:01.080
Figure out who your audience is,

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:03.000
and the senior faculty
in your department

00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:04.800
are not your audience, right?

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:05.800
When you come up for tenure,

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:08.080
it's not them that you
need to make happy -

00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.400
it's everybody-it's everybody
outside of Harvard, right?

00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:13.120
So it's your subfield
that's your audience.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.920
When you give a talk,

00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:18.680
I notice the three of us-

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.200
hold up-three of us prepare.

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.320
MICHELE:
We prepared.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.080
So a lot of people on
conference presentations,

00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:28.320
they view conferences
as commitment devices

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:29.720
to get themselves to work.

00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:30.680
So they sign up for a conference

00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.760
when they haven't
written a paper yet,

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.320
and that causes them to work

00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:35.240
and they know that it
causes them to work.

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.920
And so then they'll-

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.920
finish the draft just
before the conference -

00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:41.040
the draft, the first
draft of their paper.

00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.840
And then when they're
appearing before people,

00:08:42.841 --> 00:08:45.360
they'll sort of have a
lame version of the paper.

00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.520
Don't just--don't do that.

00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:48.400
Don't give a talk
at the first conference.

00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.400
You just skip the first conference
of your whole career,

00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:52.440
and then from then on,

00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:55.040
give a talk about the paper
that was finished

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:56.240
four months before

00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:57.480
and you have the final version.

00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.480
And so every subsequent conference
across the rest of your career

00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:02.920
you'll give the final--it doesn't
have to be the final paper.

00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:04.600
You can change it if
you get some good ideas.

00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:07.000
But it's a much more
professional paper.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.442
In fact, if you write--if you get the
article accepted in the journal

00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:13.680
and it's published in the
leading journal of your field,

00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:14.960
it could be the case that

00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:18.440
the total number of people
that read that is zero, right?

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:19.440
It could be the case.

00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.360
It would not be-it will not
even be that big a surprise, okay?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.520
But if you appear before
20 or 30 people and you talk,

00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.880
they will remember who you are.

00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:29.680
They will pay attention
for at least 10%

00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:31.240
of what you're saying-
what you're talking about.

00:09:31.241 --> 00:09:32.520
[Laughter]

00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.080
Okay. So, also under
being a public figure,

00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.640
you have to follow the rules

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.560
in a way that you've never
really had to follow the rules before.

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.560
Before, and as like a citizen,

00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:45.320
you have to follow the
rules by making sure that,

00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:47.640
like, you know what the law is and
you stay on the right side of the law,

00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:49.920
okay? But that's not the rule here.

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.960
The rule as a public figure is

00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.920
could there be an evil
reporter from The Boston Globe

00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:57.440
who would write an article
about you and your research

00:09:57.441 --> 00:09:59.240
that would ruin your career, okay?

00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:01.080
And when they
come to you and say,

00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:02.320
"Why did you do that?"

00:10:02.321 --> 00:10:04.600
You had to have followed
all the rules, right?

00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:06.080
So even if you know

00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:08.360
that you don't have to go to
the institutional review board

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.000
to verify that your
human subjects research

00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:14.480
is okay because you've done
this before and it's really okay -

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.840
if you didn't actually do it

00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.040
and have the paper
trail that you did it,

00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:19.520
then you can't say to the reporter

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:21.200
that you followed Harvard's rules.

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.360
So you have to do more.

00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:25.080
It's actually the
appearance of impropriety

00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.200
rather than impropriety.

00:10:26.201 --> 00:10:28.480
And you have to be a
little obsessive about this.

00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:30.000
Probably nothing's
going to happen

00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:32.520
but to one of us
in this room it may,

00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:33.760
so just be really careful.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.160
You can have a blog

00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:38.840
and you can--
I have a Twitter account,

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:43.040
kinggary, that's my Twitter.

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.480
And I tweet all the time.

00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:47.760
You can find new papers
and new software that I write,

00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:50.440
and you can even find out
about my mountain biking escapades.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:53.120
But you're not going to
hear me arguing with my mom

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.960
or anything else I'm
not going to talk about.

00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:58.160
So you just have to be careful.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.160
And finally, in the second category,

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.760
don't let the fact

00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:06.600
that you're a public figure
cause you to be unproductive.

00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.720
I mean don't let the fact
that when you write something

00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:11.440
and everybody - like, you know,

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:13.600
hundreds of people or
maybe thousands of people

00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:15.240
and maybe even tens
of thousands of people

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.600
sometimes will see it -
don't let that stop you.

00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.320
I mean you can learn in print

00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:22.800
as much as you
can learn not in print.

00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.000
You can learn even more in print

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.360
because people will come and
be in your face about things,

00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:29.000
and you'll get feedback from a
much larger group of people.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.120
So there's a syndrome

00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:35.400
which I think of as the
dissertation award syndrome.

00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.280
But it's probably
half of the people here

00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.200
won an award for
the best dissertation.

00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:41.240
And I'm always worried
about those people

00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:44.840
because they think--
and I've seen this a lot,

00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:46.920
they think that their next projectâ€¦

00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.880
I mean they just won the dissertation
award like of all the people,

00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:51.920
of all the graduate students
in the whole country

00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:53.000
and they got a job at Harvard.

00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:55.240
The next project had better be really good.

00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:58.320
So they're going to keep it
for a really long time, okay?

00:11:58.321 --> 00:12:01.800
So that's the biggest mistake
you could possibly make, okay?

00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:05.400
So it's much easier to correct
the problems in your paper

00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:07.520
instead of--or your next work -

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:10.000
instead of by working on it
and working on it and working on it,

00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:11.160
just do it, publish it.

00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:12.720
And then choose the next project

00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.920
so it doesn't have those
problems to begin with, right?

00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:15.920
And then choose the next project.

00:12:15.921 --> 00:12:17.720
The more chances you
have to do is the better.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.400
Okay. Last point is

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.840
you have to organize your life, right?

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.920
You all realize that
compared to graduate school,

00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:27.600
your income has now tripled

00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:30.320
and your expenses
have quadrupled.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.640
And so you have
to figure that out.

00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:37.200
But you also have to
figure out the fact that

00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:41.360
tenure--the joke is that
tenure is one-third teaching

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.200
and one-third service
and one-third research,

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:44.760
but really only the
last third counts.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.040
But this is deeply not true.

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:50.400
And my point is not

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:52.000
"You should go put all your effort

00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:53.560
into doing things
that aren't going to help you."

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:56.200
The point is that the people
who really figure out the system

00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.280
are the ones who make all
three parts incentive compatible.

00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:01.520
They make their teaching
compatible with their research.

00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:03.640
They make service
to the University,

00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:04.960
to the departments, or centers,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.400
or events like this
relevant to what they're doing.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.960
It's not easy but
that's really the goal.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.400
I mean research is just a
measure of how you figured it out.

00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:18.600
You have to teach.
You have to do some service.

00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:20.720
You have to figure
out how to make that

00:13:20.721 --> 00:13:22.360
serve your purposes

00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:24.600
and at the same time serve
everybody else's purposes

00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:26.320
because that's sort of, what
we're in the business of doing.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.800
Psychologists say that
it takes 10,000 hours

00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:33.480
of effortful study
to be the expert in a field.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.920
And that takes a
lot of time obviously,

00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:37.600
an enormous amount of time.

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:39.440
And so you just have
to look for synergies

00:13:39.441 --> 00:13:41.320
and twofers and

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.400
making everyday life
into research projects.

00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:44.840
You're also allowed
to have a life but

00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:47.080
don't tell anybody
that we told you that.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.520
So just two examples.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.960
My speech to undergraduates
is that 99% of the faculty

00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:56.600
don't actually come here
because they love teaching.

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:58.880
They may actually love teaching

00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:01.400
but they're here because
research just wakes them up

00:14:01.401 --> 00:14:03.640
every morning and
drives them to the office,

00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.080
and makes them really
pursue new knowledge.

00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:09.360
And it's just really the most
exciting thing on the planet.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.600
And that's not a bad thing.

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:15.160
That's not bad that
we have this feeling.

00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:18.480
I think instead of just saying
that that takes away from teaching,

00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:19.640
we should just explain to students

00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:21.640
that this is the most
exciting thing in the universe,

00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:23.280
and get them involved
in your research.

00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:24.440
So then it becomesâ€¦

00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:27.160
It's just an example of how it
becomes incentive-compatible.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.560
It's a travesty if a student
goes through four years

00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:33.680
at Harvard University

00:14:33.681 --> 00:14:36.640
and only learns about
discoveries in The Gazette, right?

00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:38.440
That just should
never happen, right?

00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:39.880
And you can change it.

00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:42.000
You can change the
life of undergraduates,

00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:43.240
which is a pretty cool thing to do,

00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.320
and at the same time,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.360
it can actually
help your research.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.120
And it's the same for service,

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.320
the same for finding ways of

00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:55.160
contributing to the centers
or to your departments or whatever.

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.880
But most importantly,

00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.160
there's a lot of stress
and it's really hard

00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:00.920
but it's a whole lot of fun.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.720
So don't forget that part.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.920
Okay. So

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.520
I guess I was going to first start

00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:12.640
talking to you a little
bit about my trajectory

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:16.000
to tell you that I'm a
very unlikely person

00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:17.280
to have ended up here.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.120
But I think that if you
were to go around Harvard

00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.800
and interview the faculty,

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:25.320
many people would tell
you exactly the same thing.

00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:27.960
I think many, many people
end up being very surprised.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.480
All this to say don't be
surprised that you're here.

00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:33.240
Don't think that it's a university

00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:36.760
that is more homogenous
than it is in reality.

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:39.040
As Gary said, we're
all here because in fact

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.920
we did things that were surprising.

00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:43.040
The first

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:46.120
which means that what I did is
not generalizable in any way,

00:15:46.121 --> 00:15:49.240
and you should indeed just
figure out your own path.

00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:51.880
So I'm going to share a
few reflections with you

00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:54.000
that are based on three things.

00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:57.640
Since I started in my
role as a senior advisor

00:15:57.641 --> 00:15:59.360
to Faculty Development Diversity,

00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:02.520
I've been serving on the
Committee on Appointment,

00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:03.880
Promotion, and FAS,

00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:06.800
which means that all
the files that, are being

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.680
considered for tenure I have seen.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.160
And I've learned a
lot about doing this,

00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:14.040
and I've also in
the last few months

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:16.480
been very busy creating
a new mentoring program

00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:18.640
for the junior faculty in FAS

00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:20.680
which will be rolled out
in the next few weeks.

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:22.040
And you're going to
hear a lot about this.

00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:23.440
So I've been thinking
about mentoring.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.040
And finally,

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:25.560
I published last a year

00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:27.440
a book entitled How Professors Think:

00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.720
Inside the Curious
World of Academic Judgment,

00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:32.280
which is the sociology of people

00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:35.320
who sit on peer review panels

00:16:35.321 --> 00:16:38.200
and how they go about
deciding who should be funded.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.840
So really the question of the
legitimacy of our evaluation,

00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:44.960
how we combine different criteria.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.320
Those of you who feel very anxious

00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:48.520
about the book should read it.

00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:52.160
I think it would help
alleviate your concern.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.200
So a few general lessons about--

00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:57.360
that I've gained from my experience

00:16:57.361 --> 00:16:59.440
in those various contexts.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.200
The first one

00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:01.600
which is a concept

00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:04.280
that I had a problem
grasping the first time

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.400
I heard it when I was
Assistant Professor

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.040
at University of Texas at Austin,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.640
a place where I felt
I didn't fit very well.

00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:14.160
Nice thing about Harvard is
people like me who have accents;

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:16.360
everyone has an accent
here so it's really easy.

00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:18.200
It's more cosmopolitan.

00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:21.120
So first concept: Less is more.

00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:22.800
Don't do too much, you know.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.040
The people who get tenure
I think are people who develop

00:17:26.041 --> 00:17:27.880
a distinct agenda-setting,

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.400
corpus of work

00:17:29.401 --> 00:17:30.960
on a topic and a subfield.

00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:33.360
So it's not about the
multiplication of papers

00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:35.440
but it's about placing key papers

00:17:35.441 --> 00:17:37.320
in places where they
can have an impact.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.280
So from day one,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.920
it's not Harvard that
gives you tenure -

00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:43.840
it's the profession
that gives you tenure.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.000
So you have to basically
not give them a choice

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.760
that I think is your point of departure -

00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:52.600
you have to produce
so much good work

00:17:52.601 --> 00:17:53.960
that even your worst enemies

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.640
will have problem writing
letters that are lukewarm.

00:17:57.641 --> 00:18:00.240
They will look simply
foolish if they do it.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.360
So all along, you have to engage

00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:04.880
in conversation with
colleagues around the country

00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:06.760
and beyond,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.640
those who share your
intellectual concerns.

00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:12.240
So you never should not
work for networking sake.

00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:14.280
People hate that. It looks cheap.

00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:16.040
What you should do is network

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:18.680
in such a way that you
follow your curiosity

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.280
and your need to engage
with people who share your interest.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.720
And it's far more important I think

00:18:23.721 --> 00:18:25.200
to be cosmopolitan than local;

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.400
that is it's far more important
to get people like UCLA

00:18:28.401 --> 00:18:30.560
and Wisconsin to
know what you're doing

00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:32.520
than your Fellow down the hall.

00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:33.560
On the other hand,

00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:36.520
the tenure process
requires all faculty members

00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:40.440
in your department to
write a confidential letter,

00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.240
at least that's how it works in FAS,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.680
to your dean explaining
what they think of your work.

00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:49.640
And that's a process where they
can qualify the yes/no vote

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.400
that they expressed
publicly in their department.

00:18:52.401 --> 00:18:54.280
And, you know, these
letters are sometimes

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.960
five pages long so there's a
lot of room for qualifying.

00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:00.800
So it's very important
in the seven years

00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:02.760
that you're going to
share the life of this person,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.880
that you give them
enough information

00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:08.480
about the work that you
do that they can actually

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.920
write a letter that
is very well informed.

00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:15.040
So that you kind
of help frame this letter,

00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:20.080
not leave it to the three
days before the deadline

00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:22.200
where he's going to sit
and discover your work.

00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:25.160
All along you need to
engage your colleagues

00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:26.400
in conversation about your work.

00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.120
And not only
conversation about your work;

00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:30.200
about their work.

00:19:30.201 --> 00:19:32.760
People hate colleagues
who only care about themselves

00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:34.800
so you really need to show,

00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:37.800
and you need not only
to show but to be curious,

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.560
engage in other people's work.

00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:42.200
Show that actually you're a
fun person to be around

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.720
as opposed to someone
who's very, very selfish

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.480
and not very
interested in others.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.600
Now, what are the
contexts in which

00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:53.200
you might want to
connect with others?

00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:56.000
Luckily, Harvard
has so many resources

00:19:56.001 --> 00:19:57.680
that it gets all of us exhausted.

00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:01.800
Those of us who do work
in various areas of the world,

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:04.080
you have research
centers that organize--

00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:07.120
that have resources for
you to organize colloquium,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.680
to organize conferences.

00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:11.560
You engage in conversation

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.600
by being involved in such things.

00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:14.880
If you do international work,

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:17.160
the Weatherhead Center
has wonderful grants

00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:19.120
that they make
available to junior people

00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:21.480
so that you can bring to campus

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.600
experts in your field that will
discuss your book manuscript.

00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:26.720
The junior faculty

00:20:26.721 --> 00:20:29.640
with whom I've developed
relationships over the years

00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:31.960
are people who have organized

00:20:31.961 --> 00:20:35.280
symposiums where they've
asked me to participate.

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:37.280
And then I became more
aware of what they were doing

00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:38.720
and then there was
a panel on their book

00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:39.840
where I was asked to serve.

00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:45.045
So really conversations that
develop over several years.

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:47.360
There are resources at Radcliffe.

00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:49.560
I mean of course we
face a financial crisis

00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:54.440
but the graduate
school offers small grants,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.120
$2000, $3000 for
graduate students

00:20:57.121 --> 00:21:00.160
to organize ongoing seminars,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.560
and they generally have a faculty member

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.080
that initiates those things.

00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:06.960
So this is money
that is extremely easy

00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:10.000
to obtain and

00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.120
it's a way to assemble
around new graduate students

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.240
and to invite people
from campus to give talks.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.560
Another piece of advice
would be something like

00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:24.400
be local

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:27.000
but to the extent that
you want to enjoy Harvard.

00:21:27.001 --> 00:21:28.880
It is simply an extraordinary place.

00:21:28.881 --> 00:21:30.560
I mean we're all maniacs.

00:21:30.561 --> 00:21:31.600
No one has time.

00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:33.560
But you kind of
have to make time

00:21:33.561 --> 00:21:36.600
to enjoy the people
that share your interest.

00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:38.200
Truly it's a source of pleasure

00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:41.560
so you want to think of
Harvard not only as a source of stress

00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:45.000
but also as offering
so many temptation

00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:47.960
that you can barely
contain yourself.

00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:49.160
Teaching is important

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.280
but it's a necessary but
insufficient condition for tenure.

00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.680
And I think, you know, that's reallyâ€¦

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.720
it's very important
to keep this in mind.

00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:00.560
You don't want to
over invest in teaching

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.520
to the extent that it will take
time away from your research.

00:22:05.521 --> 00:22:07.160
You want to do it well

00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:09.440
but you should absolutely
not over invest in it.

00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:10.920
That's a mistake.

00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:13.840
Service is very important

00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:15.720
to the extent that it's a context

00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:17.400
in which to develop bonds

00:22:17.401 --> 00:22:20.520
and learn about the
organizational culture.

00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:22.440
It also gives you a buffer

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.920
when you get tired
of your department,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.880
when you get tired of the
politics of your department.

00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:29.600
So don't be a prisoner of
your departmental politics.

00:22:29.601 --> 00:22:30.960
Don't think about it too much.

00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:32.920
There's not much
you can do about it

00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:36.320
So keep your nose clean,
deliver the merchandise,

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.720
and develop ties

00:22:38.721 --> 00:22:42.640
across all the units that are
relevant for your work

00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.800
whether within FAS or beyond.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.880
And most importantly,
don't forget to get your work done.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.560
That's the most
important thing of all.

00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:53.840
There's a recent book
titled How to Write A Lot,

00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:57.480
which I'm giving to
my graduate students

00:22:57.481 --> 00:23:00.560
when they get the book
they know they're in trouble.

00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:01.080
[Laughter]

00:23:01.081 --> 00:23:04.440
You can get it for $8 on Amazon.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.960
And what it
recommends is simply

00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:08.840
schedule regular writing time.

00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:10.360
I'll give you one to exercise.

00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:12.360
You don't want to
deliberate every morning

00:23:12.361 --> 00:23:14.840
"Am I going to get on my--

00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:18.080
am I going to exercise
this morning or not"

00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:19.480
You just get up and do it.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.400
Same thing with writing.

00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:22.680
Do not give yourself a context

00:23:22.681 --> 00:23:25.000
where you have to
deliberate about it each time.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.880
You just have to create
automatism and do it in a veryâ€¦

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.360
And finally, last
point - be resilient.

00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:35.600
It's a worldâ€¦

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.240
One of the previous
speakers was mentioning

00:23:38.241 --> 00:23:40.320
that she's a former
competitive athlete,

00:23:40.321 --> 00:23:42.200
and I was talking
recently with someone

00:23:42.201 --> 00:23:43.640
who got tenure In FAS this year.

00:23:43.641 --> 00:23:46.160
And she was telling me "The one
thing that served me best

00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:48.920
is that I used to be a

00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:51.880
competitive soccer
player at the national level."

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.680
You just have to be able

00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:56.440
to prepare yourself to
absorb all the shocks.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.360
I mean there's not
a single person

00:23:58.361 --> 00:24:00.440
who's here within
the tenured rank

00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:03.640
who's not awfully
resilient emotionally.

00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:06.160
And, you know, indeed
we've all had rejections.

00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:08.680
You can crawl in a corner and cry

00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:11.040
or you can regroup yourself.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:13.280
You know, people who
specialize in mental health

00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.160
show having social
support is crucial.

00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:18.600
One of the pieces of the

00:24:18.601 --> 00:24:22.560
developmental networks
that we're going to--

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.160
the mentoring initiative
that we're about to roll out

00:24:26.161 --> 00:24:28.720
is peer to peer mentoring.

00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:30.560
Create a network of people

00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:32.080
with whom you can commiserate

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.680
and get advice on how to deal
with the difficult graduate students.

00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:39.160
Once you figure
out in your department

00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:41.280
"Everyone thinks
this person is difficult,"

00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:42.600
it makes your life much easier.

00:24:42.601 --> 00:24:46.080
So the circulation of information
is absolutely important.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.160
And also don't spread
yourself too thin.

00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:50.840
To conclude, less is more.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.840
Think very strategically about
how you're going to use this

00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:56.640
unbelievable-the more-the
scarcest resource at Harvard

00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:58.520
is time

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.480
and you have to think very carefully
about how you're going to invest it.

00:25:01.481 --> 00:25:02.680
So that's it.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.160
Okay.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.360
Well, it'sâ€¦

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.520
I was happy when
I got this invitation

00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:11.560
because I'm now
in my 20th year here.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.080
And I think every seven years

00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:17.960
I get invited to speak
on this side of the river.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.520
And I'm always scared
I won't get invited back

00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:22.560
[Laughter]

00:25:22.561 --> 00:25:25.640
because the myth is that
all the brilliant people

00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:26.680
are on this side of the river.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.800
So as I thought
about my remarks,

00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:35.840
I realized that my
remarks are relevant

00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:39.840
perhaps to only a minority
of those of you in the room.

00:25:39.841 --> 00:25:42.960
But you're an important minority,
you're one that I belong to,

00:25:42.961 --> 00:25:46.640
and that is those of us who
are not natural geniuses.

00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:47.641
[Laughter]

00:25:47.642 --> 00:25:55.200
Okay? Those of us who wind
up here by dint of some combination of

00:25:55.201 --> 00:26:01.280
passion, hard work, finding
that one thing in the world

00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:04.320
that we do seem to be

00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:06.320
sort of a bit more
gifted than others.

00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:08.560
But we know it's not just pure genius,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.760
all right, because the geniuses,

00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:14.960
you know, they will go and
they'll look at what Gary's done

00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:16.520
and they'll just create
their version of it.

00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:19.680
They don't have to think about it,
right, and they'll be successful.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.840
But others of us

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.080
have to actually build careers.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.280
And so my advice is aimed
toward that set of you.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.520
And, you know, and I
was thinking about advice

00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:38.640
that I've gotten over
the course of my career,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.840
and I remember

00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:45.440
one piece of advice that I found
totally useless and intimidating,

00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:47.080
and that was when I sat down

00:26:47.081 --> 00:26:49.480
with the guy who

00:26:49.481 --> 00:26:52.840
was the Senior Associate
dean for recruiting like I was.

00:26:52.841 --> 00:26:54.040
And he says to me, "You know,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.760
we like research with impact."

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.080
He read my mind and he said,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.560
"I can't tell you what it looks like

00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.200
but I can tell you we know
it when we see it". He told me this.

00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:07.760
Another piece of advice I got

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.440
that actually was
sort of, like a parable

00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:14.400
that I've actually said
to junior faculty

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.920
at the Business School and
I just say just meditate on it.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.840
And it was that "The
secret to getting ahead

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.560
at the Harvard Business School

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.920
is to create a game--

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.280
make up the rules so that
you can teach them to other people,

00:27:33.281 --> 00:27:35.120
so that when they apply the rules,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.720
they arrive at the conclusion
that you are the best person

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.280
playing that game and that
it is a game worth playing."

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.320
So he says this
to me and, you know,

00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:48.680
it's kind of like a parable, like
"What are you talking about?"

00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:51.160
[Laughter]

00:27:51.161 --> 00:27:53.000
But, if you--

00:27:53.001 --> 00:27:58.000
I thought about it and as I've
said it to other junior faculty

00:27:58.001 --> 00:27:59.360
and I said "Just think about it."

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.880
A number of times
people have come to me

00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:03.760
after their Associate's promotion or

00:28:03.761 --> 00:28:05.360
just as they're coming
up for tenure and they said

00:28:05.361 --> 00:28:06.520
"I finally got it".

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.000
And what it is about
is creating a game,

00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:14.760
which means sort of
figuring out what it is

00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:15.720
that you're doing

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.040
and where it fits in the world

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.680
and what the rules
are that you're playing by,

00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:22.920
but the requirement is

00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:25.120
that you have to be able to
teach them to other people

00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:27.280
so they know what
game you're playing.

00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:30.480
If you're playing by a game

00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:33.360
governed by a set of rules that
nobody else can understand,

00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:34.720
the likelihood

00:28:34.721 --> 00:28:38.160
that you'll be able to
be judged and deemed

00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.600
as meeting the criteria that,

00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:43.680
I think, we want you to
meet here at Harvard

00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:46.520
or at least in the context of
Harvard that I'm familiar with -

00:28:46.521 --> 00:28:49.040
which is that you're
doing something

00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:51.680
that is worthy of being done

00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:54.240
in the world and we can
all agree that that's worthy.

00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:56.560
And oftentimes though
when you started,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.520
we don't actually know what
the game is you're playing.

00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:01.120
Right? And you've got
to figure that out,

00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:04.920
sort of what the purpose
is that your work is serving

00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:06.680
and why it's important.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.040
And then at the end of the day,

00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:11.640
you have to be okay with the fact

00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:15.120
that other people are
going to apply those rules

00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:16.280
and arrive at the conclusion

00:29:16.281 --> 00:29:18.800
whether or not you're the
best person in the world playing it.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.200
I think it's alsoâ€¦

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.800
And that also speaks to the
fact that it does start with the work.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.160
And the points that
Gary and Michele made

00:29:31.161 --> 00:29:33.840
that were very specific about
things to do to advance the work,

00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:35.160
I think, are right on the money.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.560
The thing I also think is important

00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:45.760
is that at some point in your
career as you're engaging

00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:48.920
in this process - and I used
the term sort of "playing this game,"

00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:50.640
not in a pejorative sense

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.160
of the game that we're
somehow being dishonest

00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:57.080
but that this is our life

00:29:57.081 --> 00:29:58.480
but it's not all of our life a

00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:00.240
nd we should be enjoying it -

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.720
is to make sure that

00:30:02.721 --> 00:30:05.320
your work gives
you a chance to win

00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:06.840
in this environment

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.200
on terms that you value.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.720
And by winning what I mean is

00:30:12.721 --> 00:30:15.160
that you can fulfill your purpose

00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:17.360
and also have a
successful career here.

00:30:17.361 --> 00:30:20.560
When I talk to junior faculty

00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.720
who sort of complain about
some of the things you have to do

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.360
to be successful, I kind of say,

00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:27.600
"Well, you have to
decide whether or not

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.720
you can do what you want to do

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.600
on the terms that are required

00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:36.640
and still have the
possibility of winning."

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.000
So it starts with the work

00:30:41.001 --> 00:30:43.080
and those are the comments
I would say about the work.

00:30:43.081 --> 00:30:45.360
I would also underscore

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.320
that if it starts with the work

00:30:48.321 --> 00:30:50.840
then the next most
important thing is the relationships.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.000
And Michele talked about
the efforts that are underway

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.880
to make mentoring more accessible,

00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:01.256
and more visible and
transparent in the environment.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.680
I talk about that both
in my work as well as,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.120
in my academic work as well as

00:31:09.121 --> 00:31:11.280
my work as a Department Chair

00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:14.200
from the vantage point of
creating a developmental network.

00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:16.000
And we use this
term "network," right,

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:17.520
and it can mean lots of things.

00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:19.840
But what I would

00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.280
ask you think about is

00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:24.280
do you have a
developmental network?

00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:26.320
Which means a set of people

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.000
with whom your interactions

00:31:29.001 --> 00:31:31.480
prepare you for
the next opportunities

00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.600
that you can't see.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.120
And a network that allows you

00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:41.720
to find ways to connect
who you are with what you do.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.600
And I'll give you an example of

00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:49.120
that connection from my own.

00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:50.800
I started my career
at the Wharton School.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.480
Senior faculty would
come and see me teach

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.320
when we first get there--

00:31:55.321 --> 00:31:58.000
make sure you're not doing
damage to the tuition paying clients.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.440
And they come back
and they give me advice,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.920
and they pulled backâ€¦
This is back when we had overheads.

00:32:04.921 --> 00:32:07.000
Pulled back the projector,
take up the entire screen,

00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:08.440
walk around the room.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.200
And if they had come
back a week or two later

00:32:13.201 --> 00:32:17.480
they would never have predicted
that I would be where I am today,

00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:20.240
seen as a relatively
competent teacher,

00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:21.280
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.120
Because I was getting
all these great advice

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.840
but executing that advice,

00:32:26.841 --> 00:32:28.880
given who I was
standing in that classroom

00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:29.881
was extremely difficult, right?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.240
And I developed a
relationship with one person

00:32:36.241 --> 00:32:37.800
who I could talk to about

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.240
what it was like to be me

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.440
trying to execute on that advice.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.040
The experience,
not just the what, right?

00:32:47.041 --> 00:32:48.440
Like you can go and
you ask people what to do,

00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:49.400
they tell you what to do,
you walk out and you say

00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:50.440
"I can never do that."

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.600
But you need some
people to whom you can say

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.360
"I feel like I could never do that"

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.200
who will support you in
the experiment of doing it.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.360
Because the way we
learn professional roles

00:33:07.361 --> 00:33:09.440
is through experimentation.

00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:13.674
None of us were born professors, right?

00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:16.280
So we've got to create
a set of experiments

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.080
to figure out how I can
successfully take on that role.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.320
If you don't have a set of
people with whom you can talk about

00:33:23.321 --> 00:33:24.600
those experiments,

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.240
then when you feel
like you're failing,

00:33:27.241 --> 00:33:29.480
you will start to fall.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.520
And the fear
shouldn't be of failing -

00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:34.240
the fear should be of falling.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.200
By falling, what I mean
is you just feel down

00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:40.080
and it becomes hard to get up

00:33:40.081 --> 00:33:41.680
and suddenly you're not visible.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.560
Third thing.
So relationships is two.

00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:47.920
The third thing that I would say

00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:51.600
is important is figuring out
how to manage your time

00:33:51.601 --> 00:33:52.760
and create leverage.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.160
I think the first piece of
managing your time effectively

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.200
is what Gary referred to,

00:33:59.201 --> 00:34:01.000
is what I would call
creating the synergy

00:34:01.001 --> 00:34:03.080
between these
requirements of teaching

00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:04.240
and research and service.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.320
I also think figuring out how to,

00:34:08.321 --> 00:34:09.880
early in your career,

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:14.960
how to use resources that
are available - research assistants.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.640
At Harvard Business
School were lucky.

00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:21.480
We can supply people
research assistants

00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:23.800
relatively early on and they
don't have to go get an NIH grant

00:34:23.801 --> 00:34:25.760
or anything like that
before they can have one.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.880
I see junior faculty
become Associate Professors

00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:33.720
before they actually learn
how to leverage that resource.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.240
And figuring out likewise
with library resources,

00:34:39.241 --> 00:34:41.640
and sort of figuring
out how over time

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.120
you are always
applying your time

00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:46.200
to the places where
you add the most value.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.480
And some of that
requires letting go.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.000
Like you don't have
to code all the data

00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:54.760
like you did when you
were a graduate student.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.720
Part of it, you know,
connecting to undergrads

00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:01.080
in the way that Gary described,

00:35:01.081 --> 00:35:04.880
is that things that are no longer
actually value added for you to do,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.280
it's real value added
for undergrads,

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.600
or your students who you
might work with who feel,

00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:14.240
get invested in the process
of creating the discovery.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.080
And also I think
figuring out how to create

00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:23.160
mutually beneficial relationships

00:35:23.161 --> 00:35:25.360
with doctoral students
that are not exploitive,

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.600
because if you
become an exploiter

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080
that becomes known.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.120
And sooner or later

00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.400
you pay a price
for it, in my view.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.120
And sadly enough

00:35:40.121 --> 00:35:42.720
there are people who
have exploitive relationships

00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.440
with doctoral students.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.200
In some departments,
it's part of the culture.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.560
So if it was done to
you, don't repeat it.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.840
The last thingâ€¦

00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:58.440
Sorry if my talk is
sounding like a downer.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.320
[Laughter]

00:36:00.321 --> 00:36:01.280
But Gary had us all laughing

00:36:01.281 --> 00:36:03.880
and now I'm looking at people's
faces and they're like "Damn."

00:36:03.881 --> 00:36:05.960
[Laughter]

00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:06.680
Okay.

00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:09.320
So in which case, here's
the up one, final thing -

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.680
I think it's important to
focus on your mental health.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.720
The place is stressful.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.280
I love the comment that the
woman on the last panel said

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:25.120
her parents ask her
"What do you have to do?"

00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:26.600
and she says, "You've
just got to be great."

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.720
There's some truth to that sense.

00:36:31.721 --> 00:36:33.240
You just have to be great.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.600
And you look around
and you see people who,

00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:41.320
God damn it, they look great.

00:36:41.321 --> 00:36:44.920
[Laughter]

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.920
I was sitting here and Eliza was
reading Gary's bio and I was thinking,

00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.480
"Damn, I'm glad I'm on the
other side of the river.

00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:55.720
I'd hate to see him every day."

00:36:55.721 --> 00:37:04.280
[Laughter]

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.696
So don't deny the stress.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.040
But again I think to this
point of our relationships,

00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:13.520
you need some places where
you can admit to it and let it go.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.760
I also think it's important to
develop some life beyond your work -

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.960
some things you do that you
value that are rejuvenating,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.200
Otherwise, the only
measure of yourself

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.960
is the measure that's
made of you here.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.840
And again, this is for
those of you like me

00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.960
who are not geniuses:

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.280
I can tell you there are
many days when the measure

00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:48.080
of me here is much shorter
than I think I should be.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.880
And being able
to go somewhere else

00:37:51.881 --> 00:37:54.440
where there are things
that remind me

00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:56.320
that this is not the only measure

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.560
is important to
keeping that balance

00:38:00.561 --> 00:38:03.600
and reconnecting in a way

00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:07.800
that allows me to rise to the
measure that I think I can rise to.

00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.840
And then the final thing I think is

00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:12.120
it's very important to
keep your priorities clear

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.680
and to understand that
how you allocate your time

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.400
usually does not
reflect your priorities.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.480
So there's no question in my mind

00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:25.920
that my family is my first priority.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.080
But my wife and I
would argue about this -

00:38:30.081 --> 00:38:35.840
I would say that I allocate
about 80/20 work, family, my time.

00:38:35.841 --> 00:38:39.240
She would probably say
that 20 is a bit high.

00:38:39.241 --> 00:38:41.680
[Laughter]

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.600
But I'm clear about the priorities.

00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:45.760
And I think it's often important

00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:47.360
to create some rules

00:38:47.361 --> 00:38:49.360
that allow you to
force those choices.

00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:53.040
And I'll just end with
one story about myself,

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.640
and that is when I was
coming up for tenure

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.080
I made one promise to myself,

00:38:58.081 --> 00:38:59.760
and that is that

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.800
to get tenure

00:39:01.801 --> 00:39:06.920
I would not refuse
to do anything

00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:10.480
that if after the decision
was made and it was negative,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.280
I would regret
having not done that

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.600
because I paid a price for something
that ultimately I didn't get.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.000
And having made that rule,

00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:22.400
you know, when it
was easy to make it

00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:23.760
because I didn't
have any forced choices

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.560
and everybody was on board -

00:39:25.561 --> 00:39:27.480
even my daughter
was editing my book.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.280
She was only six years old,
she'd come in at nightâ€¦

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.800
Everybody was on board
for me to be 90% at work.

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:39.080
"You have a six-year-old
daughter and Michele,

00:39:39.081 --> 00:39:40.880
they're like six years old
and this guy gets tenure?"

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.040
But anyway, yes,
she's brilliant.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.440
But anyway,
my mother was coming.

00:39:47.441 --> 00:39:50.160
My mother usually
comes for Mother's Day.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.360
And my wife said
"Tell your mother don't come

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.200
because you're right in the
middle of writing this book,"

00:39:58.201 --> 00:40:01.000
and it turned out that I had
to turn this book around

00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:02.640
really quick to make the deadline.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.720
And I decided no,

00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:07.000
I'm going to have my
mother come because

00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:09.320
if my mother - if something
were to happen,

00:40:09.321 --> 00:40:10.840
my mother wouldn't be there

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.040
and I didn't get tenured,
I would regret it.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.920
But having thoseâ€¦
And mind you,

00:40:18.921 --> 00:40:21.160
what happened was
my mother came,

00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:22.640
we had a great time,
gave me the energy,

00:40:22.641 --> 00:40:23.640
I finished the book.

00:40:23.641 --> 00:40:25.640
But it's like having those things

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.440
that force you in some way

00:40:27.441 --> 00:40:30.000
to keep your priorities clear,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.800
because your time
won't always reflect

00:40:32.801 --> 00:40:34.280
them so you can lose them

00:40:34.281 --> 00:40:37.400
I think becomes key as
part of this sort of

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:40.080
keeping your mental
health and your balance.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.040
So I'll end there.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.400
You guys got any jokes
so I can get theâ€¦

00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:47.000
[Laughter]
