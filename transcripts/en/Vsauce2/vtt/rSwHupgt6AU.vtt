00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.049
Lift off first thing in the morning next to
your rocket launcher alarm clock.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.980
And watch as it flies majestically alongside
this remote control eagle.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.099
Because it’s episode #51 of LÜT.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.060
Hook up your optical device with your smartphone
using the HookUpz Universal Adapter.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.820
That allows you to record and share everything
you see with your monoculars, binoculars,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.180
telescopes, microscopes, night vision or spotting
scopes.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.940
Spot liars after hooking them up to the Digital
USB Polygraph.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.080
A lie detector test that uses digital sensors
to measure skin response and pulse - the same

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.260
data in real lie detector sets.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.140
Set your Salvador Dali watch to half past
mustache.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.530
And if you mustache how dinosaurs loved their
dogs - there’s a book for that.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.810
And if you want to fix busted cables there’s
a plastic welder for that.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.920
Bondic is the world’s first liquid plastic
welder.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.890
It’s not a glue - it won’t dry out and
can be used on plastic, fabric, metal and

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.890
even wood.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.670
Would you like a lawn sculpture?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.650
Like Dragon and Chimp and Bat on a branch.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.240
Mermaid, Octopus, nothing rhymes with branch.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.240
Nothing.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
Nothing rhymes with branch.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.970
Nothing.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.900
Branch out from just eating ice cream and
make your own in the ice cream ball.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.210
Simply add ice and rock salt in one end and
ice cream mix in the other and roll it around

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.440
for twenty minutes.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.470
Caution DO NOT KICK OR THROW.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.060
This carabiner grappling hook to help guide
falling trees or help you climb stuff.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.190
Then put your stuff down on a foosball coffee
table which allows you to finally play foosball

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.690
in front of your couch.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.700
Swap out your old couch for some ridiculously
fancy seats from elite home theater seating.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.010
They allow you to fully customize everything
from the arm rest, and back rest to whether

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.070
you prefer the material to be made out of
red silk leather or grape cinesuede.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.040
Which sounds grape but if you really love
yourself you’ll give yourself hickies.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.790
A no-tie shoelace replacement lacing system
which features a responsive design that moves

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.790
with your feet.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.169
So you can stop bothering with tying your
shoes and spend some quality time with your

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.700
bag of mangled mimes.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.629
I hope you don’t mime morbidity because
here’s some skeleton playing cards that

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.819
showcase fifty four skeletons found at the
Museum of Osteology.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.939
Including everything from the Harpy Eagle
to the Pacman Frog whose clearly hopped his

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.370
last hop.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.799
Foam your hops using the sonic hour portable
beer foam head generator.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.809
Simply turn on the device, touch it to a glass
of beer and watch ultrasonic waves create

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.079
a foam head.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.599
Whack your boss in the head after completely
customizing your own whac-a-mole game.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.019
Video Amusement offers total graphic customization
from the backlit panels and cabinet side art

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.650
to the mole heads themselves - just in case
you’ve ever wanted to whac-a-manhole.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.790
Fill the hovercraft-sized hole in your heart
by dropping $190,000 on the flying hovercraft.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.980
Then don’t be perplexed about what to do
next.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.139
The Perplexus Warp is a spherical octahedron
maze that’s sure to keep you busy conquering

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.959
its eighty challenging events.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.569
So stay optimistic because technically, the
glass is always full.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.669
And as always - thanks for watching!
