00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.920
Acetylsalicylic acid is one of the most famous
compounds in modern medicine…

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.120
It's claimed to treat, pain, inflammation,
fever and may even prevent heart attacks…

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:19.210
But is the drug known as "Aspirin" really
the wonder drug we were promised?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.430
Around 400 BCE, Hippocrates' writings claimed
the bark of the willow tree could be ground

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.660
into a powder and used to heal headaches,
pains and fevers.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.059
He was the father of modern medicine, and
his remedy worked, and was used for many hundreds

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.170
of years.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.890
It wasn't until 1829, that scientists discovered
a compound in the bark called salicin was

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.290
the true medical culprit.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.870
Salicin DOES cure the headache, but is REALLY
hard on the stomach, and can cause bleeding

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.570
in the digestive tract.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.570
Not a great trade-off.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.180
Allegedly, a French chemist found when mixed
with sodium and acetyl chloride the resulting

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.020
acetylsalicylic acid was soft on the tummy
AND fixed the swelling…

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.670
Based on historical records uncovered by BMJ,
it was then later re-tested and sold as "Aspirin"

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.759
by F Bayer &amp; Co, but it wasn't until the 1970s
that British scientists figured out WHY acetylsalicylic

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.840
acid works; which won them the Nobel Prize.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.869
Acetylsalicylic acid is a simple compound
C-nine H-eight O-four.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.560
It reduces pain by messing with the body's
production of prostaglandins; a hormone-like

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.530
lipid compound formed by enzymes in the body.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.469
Pain is a confounding thing for scientists
because it's so subjective, but physically,

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.060
tissue releases called chemicals like prostaglandins,
which tell your brain to trigger [[BLEEEP]].

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.560
Soooo, when you take acetylsalicylic acid
(ASA) it binds with the enzyme COX-2.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.939
Without the COX-2 the production of prostaglandin
drops and BOOM, no more headaches, or inflammation

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.530
based aches and pains.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.929
The problem is, prostaglandin isn't a one-off.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.500
It has a number of other uses as well, an
enzyme called COX-1 also binds with ASA -- and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.679
COX-1 has the rather important job of keeping
your stomach lining thick.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.459
I don't know about you, but I'd rather my
stomach acid didn't eat me -- just my lunch.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.230
Prostaglandins also affect how well platelets
initiate blood clotting, and ASA somehow has

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.400
an effect on the hypothalamus region of the
brain, responsible for controlling body temperature

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.530
-- which is how it can bring down a fever.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.760
So after all this, it makes a lot more sense
how ASA can help with things like heart attacks.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.239
Blood platelets that don't clot well, don't
cause blockages!

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.719
When the body's fever is reduced, we feel
less sick, and moving joints is kind of the

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.719
best around.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.200
And studies are exploring how ASA can be recruited
to do a lot of other things.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.510
In 2014, the Queen Mary University of London
found people who took low doses of ASA daily

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.260
could reduce their risks of death by some
cancers by 35 to 50 percent.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.870
Though, that increases risk of stomach bleeding
by about 3 percent, and you'd have to take

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.220
it every day for a decade to see a benefit!

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.599
And a new 2015 study in PLOS ONE found ASA
might bind to another enzyme called GAPDH

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.050
which causes our cells to die, on purpose.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.340
By inhibiting cell death, the thinking is,
it might be able to stop Alzheimer's, Huntington's,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.480
or Parkinson's in their tracks.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.650
The thing is, even though it can do a lot
for the human condition, treating it as a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.090
miracle wonder-drug is a vast oversimplification.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.519
Children should not ingest ASA, it's part
of a family of drugs which can cause fatal

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.720
liver failure.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.909
And while it can reduce the risk of a SECOND
heart attack, the FDA says very specifically

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.319
it will not prevent stroke or heart attack
for people with no history of either issue.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.870
And for those required to take aspirin daily:
safety, coated or enteric aspirin is coated

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.019
to keep the ASA from releasing into your stomach
and thinning the lining.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.180
But, it's not a super solution.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.750
The coating releases the drug further into
your digestive tract, potentially causing

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.750
bleeding in the small intestine instead and
then in the stomach once the ASA hits your

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.750
bloodstream.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.750
There's no escaping science.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.459
In the end, this willow-bark derivative sure
is amazing, hat-tip Hippocrates, but it ain't

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.469
magic.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:16.570
Because of it's age, the effects of acetylsalicylic
acid have been explored by scientists the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.700
world over in thousands of studies.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.520
Is more research needed?

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.660
Of course!

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.940
ALWAYS, but then again, if you're trying to
prove it's a cure-all, maybe save your pennies.
