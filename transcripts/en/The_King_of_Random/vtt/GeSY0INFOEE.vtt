Quick reminder guys check the description for a link to our self-made seminar!

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.060
It's a three day hands-on training event where we are going to teach you how to make a living making videos at home

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.519
Hey guys. I'm Nate welcome back to the lab today

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.649
We've got a very fun experiment where we see what happens if we put liquid propane into liquid, nitrogen

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.070
now liquid propane usually will freeze at

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.980
306 degrees Fahrenheit below zero

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.890
liquid nitrogen is about

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.299
321 degrees Fahrenheit below zero so it should in theory be cold enough to freeze our propane into a solid

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
I want to see what happens and I bet you do too in a previous video

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.479
We showed you a little hack for how to get propane out of your canister in a liquid form rather than a gas

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.509
We're going to be using that hack to partially fill a water bottle and then lowering that water bottle into our liquid nitrogen to see

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
If we can actually get our propane to solidify as a part of this experiment

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.349
I have this mixture of propane and butane in this can it's usually used as a camp stove fuel we're gonna try the same thing

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.099
Putting some of this into a bottle and then freezing it and see what happens especially if it'll light on fire now

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.019
I don't want to fill the house with the fumes of propane and butane and I also don't want everything to light on fire in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.860
here
So we're gonna move this outside

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.439
Our first step is gonna be to pour off some of our liquid propane into our water bottle

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.609
So I'll just turn the nozzle upside down put it in the bottle and then open it up as far as it'll go

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.410
See after a couple seconds of cooling down it starts just dripping out

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.740
Snow, it's very strongly propane

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.630
Propane usually boils and turns to a gas at about 45 degrees below zero and that's pretty cold

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.029
But it's not nearly as cold as liquid, nitrogen

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.379
All right you go. We can see that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.130
We've got liquid propane about two this first line in the water bottle

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.070
hard to see through just because it is pretty cold and a lot of frost starts forming on the outside of it, but

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.630
See how much we've got so now. We've got a very cold liquid in the bottle

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.949
Let's take our very cold liquid and put it in an extremely cold liquid

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.570
Here goes I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.689
Think I can probably just kind of let it sit there the propane will be dense enough

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.740
To submerge a little bit into the liquid, nitrogen

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.369
But the air on top of the propane of course is much less dense, so it just sort of hold itself floating

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.080
With the propane under the liquid nitrogen and the rest of the bottle above it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.089
I can see some vapors forming inside the bottle. I don't know for sure what that is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.080
I assume it's condensed propane, but it could be water condensing on the inside of the bottle as well in the form of water vapor

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.119
It's only been a few seconds, but let's check nope still liquid

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.798
But I keep going water freezes at about 32 degrees Fahrenheit propane freezing below

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.030
300 degrees below zero so it has to get really really cold before it starts to solidify

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.239
Little liquid it almost has to get down to the temperature of the liquid, nitrogen

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.239
Help insulate the bottle so it really keeps all of the cold in and to help keep some of our liquid nitrogen from dissipating

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.239
I'm just can take some paper towel

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.759
Push it in the sides just to maybe save ourselves from losing a little bit of liquid, nitrogen

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.659
Can't tell for sure but it does look like there is something going on in there, so I'll pull it out really quickly

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.839
Let's look at what's happening. Oh, man

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.679
I think I ruined it by pulling it out it started like clouding up a ton in the liquid it looked like it

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.549
Maybe had a little bit of freezing just starting to go

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.819
and I

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.019
Should just let it go

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.138
Definitely see something happening in there little bits moving around

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.819
I think we're actually getting a little bit of freezing on the surface of the propane

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.070
well our propane in the bottle has now been sitting in this nitrogen for quite a while probably at least half an hour and I

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.880
Think we might have gotten a little bit of a slush, but it's certainly not frozen solid. It's possible

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880
I would just need to leave it in for much longer

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.000
You know ice in a freezer takes up to three hours to freeze some times

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.059
So it's possible that I would need to do the same thing with the propane

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.560
Because I'm not that patient I'm gonna try taking it out now and see what happens if I just pour it out

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.919
I'm hoping we have a little bit of a slush thing going on

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.409
It's hard to tell while it's still in the container either way after I pour it out. I'm gonna light it on fire

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720
Here's our bottle

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760
and that still looks

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.239
Pretty runny. It does look like it's somehow separated like there's another layer I

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.859
wonder if liquid oxygen has formed on top of the propane or something doesn't really look the right color but

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.799
There's more liquid in here than when I started

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
So it has to have come from somewhere

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.169
Let's pour it out and see what happens

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.939
Whoo the bottle got too cold all right

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.009
It is a beautifully dense white smoke and

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.849
It looks like we've got liquid propane

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.969
very very cold liquid propane

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.330
This may be very dumb. I'm going to try and light it on fire

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.889
Maybe not so dumb. Well. It's on fire the wind is kicking up a little bit getting more air in there

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.489
About what I thought would happen the propane just dissipates so quickly

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.050
Well, and now it's gone

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.050
once you pour it out it just

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.599
disappears almost entirely and immediately

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.099
Well that didn't work very well

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:20.539
I was really hoping for some frozen propane, but I'm not sure how long that would take to really get to a solid chunk, so

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.899
Now I'm going to try pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen into a cup and then pouring some of our propane

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.659
Into the liquid nitrogen there's no bottle in the way

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.619
You've got a couple seconds to cool down and then it should start dripping

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.729
All right, there's a nitrogen with the propane

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.590
That is about the thickest densest white smoke, I've ever seen come out from here. It's not smoke vapor

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.900
Wow

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900
Definitely was not expecting that

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.950
Wow okay something about the propane and the liquid, nitrogen

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.250
Made it pop. I don't know what did that?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.960
There's just sort of a bubble of propane floating on the surface of the nitrogen

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.909
Huh lighting it up with a laser. You can see a little propane blob

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.580
floating on the liquid, nitrogen

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.360
And I am amazed that is not started to solidify

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.579
Just it is just in liquid nitrogen. It's touching the liquid nitrogen, but it's doing really nothing, and if anyone's curious

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.539
No the laser is not actually affecting the movement it moves exactly the same way with or without the laser beam on it

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.749
Doesn't run away from the laser doesn't run to the laser

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.960
All right, I do still have the butane and propane mixture and butane freezes at only

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:54.909
220 degrees Fahrenheit below zero so it's possible that the mixture will freeze in the liquid nitrogen better than the straight propane dip

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.220
Let's find out

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.669
And this nozzle is great that went way faster than the propane one

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.169
Okay, propane butane mixture lower this down into our liquid, nitrogen which has

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.900
lowered itself quite a bit down

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.350
Used up a fair amount of liquid, nitrogen or let's experiment

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.709
We've got some sort of vapor climbing up out of the bottle not really sure what that is could be

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.339
Condensed air it could be the propane in butane

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.880
While I've been waiting, it's gotten a little colder out here, so you'll notice

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
I'm now wearing a jacket

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:41.309
But I think we've made good progress our butane propane mixture seems to have started to solidify on the inside of our water bottle

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.440
I'm not sure if it's a slushy consistency

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.310
Or a solid one my plan as well take the water bottle out

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.830
Cut it open just above where it's frozen, and then either try and pop it all out if it's solid

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.729
And if it's not solid then I'll try and scoop it out with this popsicle stick and then either way

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.730
I'm gonna light it on fire

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:07.289
There you go, okay, it's still very easy to squish so I doubt it's frozen completely solid

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.520
Yeah, look at that. It's like propane butane soup

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.379
Some kind. That's that's a weird. Oh, it's melting. It's melting

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.899
That stuff melted

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:34.479
Almost instantly once that stuff wasn't surrounded by liquid nitrogen anymore. It started melting immediately how fast

00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:45.819
Got on my hands just a little bit

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440
Didn't melt the glove

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600
Definitely no injury from it

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:59.499
And now it's gone. Just just warmth really startling warmth not dangerous warmth

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:06.879
To be clear a little piece of bottle I tossed it through the flames and it still had propane and butane

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.620
Residue all over it so it caught on fire and then just shrunk down

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.459
We just have the very bottom of the bottle now. There's actually even still some

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.890
Frozen stuff in there. I don't know if that's propane and butane I think that it might just be ice

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.009
I think there was a little bit of water residue inside the bottle because it's not

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:29.140
Evaporating all that fast or melting as fast as the propane and butane did so pretty just just ice

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.649
There you go our experiment was to see if we could freeze

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:38.889
propane and while I think we might have had to get a little bit slushy after sitting in our liquid nitrogen in a bottle for

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.569
About 30 to 40 minutes it definitely never got solid, and if it was slushy

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.929
It immediately turned back to a liquid after it was poured out the propane and butane mixture did work considerably better

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:55.959
I think that's because the butane has a higher freezing temperature so the two mixed we were able to get a very dense

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.519
Slush, I think it might have even turned solid eventually if we had just left it in for longer

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:08.019
it's also possible though that the butane was freezing and the propane was not and we wouldn't have really achieved a solid block unless we've

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:14.739
Left it in there for hours, if at all either way once we scoop that thick paste out. It immediately started melting soon

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.839
We just had a puddle of a mixture of butane and propane in our little pot that was fun to light on fire

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.839
But it wasn't really anything spectacular

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:29.079
Overall I would say that butane and propane are best left in liquid or gaseous form they're much more useful that way

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.820
Freezing them is very difficult, and it doesn't get any sort of flash burning the way that gasoline does when you're freezing liquid, nitrogen

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.090
Thanks for joining us for this video today and remember to come grab some hats shirts or other merch at the king of random calm

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.100
Sea there

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.390
It looks alive

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.040
like an amoeba

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.939
Bottom of this pot is extremely cold, and the top is also cold. It's just cold everywhere even though. It's unfair. Oh this spots warm

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.860
