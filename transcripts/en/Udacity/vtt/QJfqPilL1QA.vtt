00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.050
There may be cases where you want a
notification to only appear on a phone,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.370
and you don't want it to be synchronized
over to your wearable devices.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.570
An example might be a notification
showing that there is an upload in

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.490
progress on the phone.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.770
But it's not a notification that a user
needs to be notified on their wearable.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.870
The NotificationCompat.Builder class
contains a method called setLocalOnly.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.440
You can use this to insure
notifications only appear on the phone.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.640
If you want to make a notification
that only appears on a wearable and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.490
not the phone, you'll need to
wait until the next lesson

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.119
to learn more about how to do this.
