Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and today we are talking about the placebo effect and the power of suggestion. We're looking at a lot of new research. I don't know. It was new research we've, we've done well. It is new research, but the problem has been with us for centuries, even at the very beginning of the age of reason. Let me take you back. 18th Century. The enlightenment was in full swing. There was change in the air. Voltaire was denouncing the church. Ben Franklin was flying. Kite live was Yang, was inventing chemistry. It was the beginning of modern times. Modern Science, you might say reason inquiry. People were reexamining the big questions. How does the world work? What possibly could hold everything together and this was new.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Well, you have to understand that in earlier historical moments, the unification of the universe was not a problem because it was God that unified everything and everything was a manifestation of God. That's it. Colin talking about God, he's a, he's starring you. But if God isn't the glue that holds the universe together, then what does hold the world

Speaker 1:          01:11          together? Enter End Twan. Mesmer and who? Antwan Mesmeric. Have you ever said a, you mesmerize me my dolling feel to that said the word Mesmer. I'm as mesmerization comes from Anton Mesmer was a real historical figure. So he's part of our narrative. Yeah, I'll get out on my way home to tell the rest of the story. So in 1778 he moves to Paris and he has a theory, he believed that the world was filled with a kind of fluid that moved through all living things and he gave it his own kind of sexy name, animal magnetism, or as they say in the French magnetism and he married it, right? And as this force flowed through all of life, occasionally it would get stuck like in a traffic jam, it would bunch up.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Right? And that is also the bunching up can also be a cause of a problem. That's what he thought. Being sick was blocking the flow. I restrictions in the flow of animal magnetism in the organism. I mean not that dissimilar to the way that we understand traditional Chinese medicine.

Speaker 1:          02:10          She with the needles and the, and the acupuncture. A Mesmer thought this life was when it got stuck, could be released with a little help from needles. You don't know. This is a, there's a lot more theatrical.

Speaker 2:          02:20          He created a kind of salon. I actually think of it as um, a prototype for the, the idea of a happening in the 60s that's the way I like to think of it. You know, it's sort of like everybody kind of came in and there was this like music,

Speaker 3:          02:35          there was like dim light

Speaker 2:          02:37          and he would walk around in his lovely purple suit and, and he had to let her pull. Yeah, I think he was a, a lilac was a belief that actually lifts the shade that

Speaker 3:          02:47          report it and then he would go over to a particular client. Usually it was a women, most of his clients were women and he would madame sit across from them and their knees would touch your magnetism or it is, how do say all pushy and then to unblock this flow, he would stare into her eyes stare. Right? [inaudible] if he, if he jammed you, how would you know? Oh okay,

Speaker 4:          03:15          cause you would have a healing crisis. What was that? Simple? They would scream, they would vibrate, had actually a padded room where the ladies could go and loosen their corsets and fling themselves about and bang their heads against the wall and whatever they needed to do in order to kind of release the damned up energy. It was apparently quite dramatic.

Speaker 3:          03:44          Oh my, the looks of it. They were real seizures and people said they felt better afterwards. So word spread and SUNY had disciples

Speaker 1:          03:53          and then more disciples and it had a lot of popularity. Yes it did. So he did what any businessman would do. He franchised it, he branched out. And I mean this, literally, he magnetized trees, trees, trees, Mesmer, or, or sometimes his assistants would take to magnetized iron rods, touch them to a tree in the forest, and that would transfer the magnetism to the tree.

Speaker 5:          04:17          The tree would then have the kind of therapeutic powers that a mesmerist would have, how convenient. That's in Harrington, a Harvard historian. And this was quite efficient because then you could sort of have the trees do part of the work for you.

Speaker 1:          04:31          So imagine if you will. Lots and lots of people gathered around a tree touching each other and the tree and allowing the flow to move through them. Then they would all have fits together. And the problem was the doctors of the time who used to have all these people as their patients were now losing patients and money. So they protested to the king.

Speaker 5:          04:49          King established a commission. And actually one of the members of that commission was Benjamin Franklin, who at the time was the ambassador to France. And there were other important scientists.

Speaker 1:          05:06          [inaudible] was one of them. Is that the guillotine? We know from the right, so we're talking here about a major, major league panel. These were big guys, big names,

Speaker 5:          05:15          and they devised a series of experiments to test for a magnetic field.

Speaker 1:          05:20          They weren't concerned whether or not animal magnetism work. They were concerned whether or not animal magnetism existed because they figured, you know, it can work

Speaker 3:          05:33          even though it may not exist.

Speaker 5:          05:35          And one of the most dramatic tests that they devised is sometimes identified as the first placebo controlled trial in history.

Speaker 6:          05:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          05:48          they were actually down on Benjamin Franklin's estate.

Speaker 3:          05:51          This was just south of Paris and Franklin himself conducted an experiment

Speaker 5:          05:54          and it involved front of a young boy. Is that on too tightly? No. Yeah, that was with 12, 13 years old. Can you see anything? No. Any light at all? No. And uh, he was told that is the deal. Young boy, a lot of these five oak trees, one of the trees on the estate has been eyes by an actual mesmerist. We'll take you to one tree at a time. Your job is to tell us which one has been magnetized. They said one of the trees when magnetised and where you blindfold you and you, you tell us when you know you're up by them. Magnetic trees cause patients insisted that they could feel the energy. And by the way, I believe them, I'm totally persuaded that the real experiences were happening. They brought the boy to one tree, this is tree number one. He began to kind of shake and they brought him to another. We started before tree number two. They began to sweat and by the time they brought him to the third and they look forward. Here we are before tree number II sort of collapsing convulsions, which is all that dramatic except okay tree number one, tree number two and number three and number four. Yup.

Speaker 7:          07:14          Had never been magnetized.

Speaker 5:          07:16          So this was seen as pretty definitive evidence that there was no mandate magnetic force here. But they also didn't think that the boy was sort of faking it. So what they concluded was that there is no magnetic force, but that all the effects which they don't deny the reality of were caused by the imagination.

Speaker 7:          07:36          That was Harvard just starting in. And Harrington and Rutgers historian, Ed Cohen, my final stuff in this hour comes from reporter Gregory Warner, who recently visited a tent revival in upstate New York, little Adirondacks, lakeside community, very rural to see a faith healing. Okay, so, so I get there and I'm a little bit late, I'm a little bit nervous, there's a lot of mosquitoes. People are restless, they're sitting in their chairs, the tent flaps are still up, the sun is kind of setting. And Steve, Steve Booza is going on about some verses of scripture and people are really bored. And he says, don't worry, we're going to get to the healing. Pretty soon the readings important too, you know, that kind of thing like a teacher, like so then he says, okay, now it's time for some healing. The flaps go down and suddenly the space changes because what was before this kind of people milling in and out becomes this very focused title chamber.

Speaker 7:          08:36          And in the beginning of the Ministry of any kind combined, okay, this preacher who, who is this guy? That's Steve Booza, he owns a construction company in Syracuse. All the [inaudible] physical healings. Financers, so he's looking out into the crowd and then the volunteer comes up. Hi. Hi. Strawberry Blonde hair. Pink Cardigan. Okay. Oh my new, my backbone shit and yeah, Ninja backbone straight and tell me what your honor, how old is she? She's in high school in an s shape. B diagnosis, her scoliosis. That's cool though. Don't let this scare scary. Now I'm not trying to scare her. Scoliosis of the spine is 100% of the time. Demonic. Okay, that's not even physical. That's a demon. I'm standing next to Steve. If it's going to be straightened right now, can be your hands full. He spins her around. I break any generational curse off of my sister right now. In Jesus name, you'll spirit of scoliosis. I break your power and then all of a sudden you spirit me now in Jesus name backbone, be straightened and Jesus just kind of shoved her forward straight and right now in Jesus name and Jesus. Then try it now. Move around. Do what you couldn't do before. Stand back and give yourself plenty of room movement. Moving more faith.

Speaker 7:          10:00          I really don't want to say that she was healed or that she wasn't healed because she was just crying for some of this. This isn't a hundred percent bad, but I did meet a woman who something, I think something did happen with the other woman that I met had. Okay, so there was nothing wrong with it. From my phone sticks out. She comes up, I'm older woman in her 50s or 60s and she just holds her hands up and I know I clean offices sometimes do have carpal tunnel problems. Carpal tunnel. Explain what that is. I mean as far as I know, it's like an inflammation of the, of the ligaments and it's really, really painful. It's a repetitive stress injury. I want to show you something though. Sandra sand right here. Sideways cover. You could everybody see he, what he does is he basically tells her to to grip together her little pen, pinkie and her phone and make a ring like an okay symbol.

Speaker 7:          11:05          I'm going to take my smallest finger, my pancake. Then he sticks his finger in in the rain. Try to see if I can pull my pinky through. Your hand. He says, I'm going to try to break it and you try to stop me and I want you to fight me. Now I want to, I want to see how much strength you have. After you're ready, he just pops it right open. You got no strength. Throw it all day. She can't hold her grip. That means she got trouble in her carpal tunnel, which is right here. Give me those hands. Give me no chance. She gives me her hand. He takes it and both of his carpal tunnel. I command you in Jesus name for all swelling and inflammation and rubbing right now his thumbs, I command all the ligaments and tendons circled back to the normally last.

Speaker 7:          11:41          Statistically that's supposed to be a narrow command. All pain to be going out to this carpal tunnel region like command healing like one to this entire arm and his carpal tunnel and all strengths that come back there and Jesus then don't do it again. He said, okay, let's do the same demonstration right again. He hasn't bring her pinky against her thumb. Now make that, make that grip. I'm going to take my big finger and I'm going to fight you. And when he puts his finger in this and watch what's going to happen and fold your ready, he doesn't break her grip and you can hear, he just drags her right across the stage.

Speaker 3:          12:14          Okay?

Speaker 7:          12:18          The silly it worked. It maybe did Lee's temporarily. Um, she went back to her seat. They gave her a blanket. She was really trembling. I went over to talk to her. Can you describe what the experience was like? But then when he did that thing,

Speaker 7:          12:46          Christian belief is that Christ died for our sins. We actual phrases, which they always repeat is Jesus Christ. I'm healed. By his stripes, we were healed by the stripes of Jesus. You work. He killed me when he died on the crush. What does that mean? It means that you were healed. Meaning he died in the cross for our sins and also for our ailments. So we've already been hit. We've already been healed. We just have to access it and realize it by our connection and relationship to God. Okay, so, so what happened to Linda afterwards? The carpal tunnel came back almost immediately. And um, I met with her in a coffee shop. But this is my belief from reading the word of God. The Devil, Satan comes in, tries to talk you out of that. He like he'll say you didn't really get healed. You know those things come into your mind.

Speaker 7:          13:38          And I believe that's just Satan. So you have to have strong faith to stand against that pain is Satan's way of testing her belief? I think that's what she thinks. I talk to Satan and I tell them, yeah, like the pain is part of the test. God says you are liar and if the pain is there, you wants me to pos, she's not healed. She's seeing this, this bigger struggle, this bigger battle where pain is just one more kind of obstacle. Not that there aren't times that I, I doubt I do, but I have to be pet and I have to say, I'm sorry God, I doubt it because I know you feel me so many times. There's so many different things. So I know it's for real. It's not, you know, fake. I'm not part cause I know that. I think that's a crucial point. I mean if we think of it as a medical encounter, it's about pain in the body. But if we think of it as a spiritual encounter, the way she sees it, it's really a battle against doubt. Reporter Gregory Warner. Thanks to him and to you for listening. We've got to go now. Yup.
