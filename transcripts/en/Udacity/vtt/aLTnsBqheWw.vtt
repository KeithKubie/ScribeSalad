00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.350
This lesson is about
parallel algorithms for

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.090
sorting in the dynamic
multi-threading model.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.420
There are two parts.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.060
The first part consists of the
videos,which cover the idea of a sorting

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.220
network.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.837
You can think of a sorting network as
a special kind of circuit that sorts.

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:18.187
It's a topic that's not usually
covered in your standard undergraduate

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:19.438
Algorithms 101 class.

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:22.478
So I hope that many of you will find
it interesting and, heaven forbid,

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.110
even a little fun.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.830
Now separate from the video part,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.840
I also want you to read a short
chapter on parallel merge sort.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.920
I hope you'll find this reading helpful.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.615
It should reinforce the main
ideas behind the dynamic

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:36.260
multi-threading model.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.210
You'll also see some additional
techniques to analyze algorithms in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.460
this model more formally.
