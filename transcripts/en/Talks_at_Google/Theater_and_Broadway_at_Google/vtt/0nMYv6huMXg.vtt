ALAN SEALES: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.970
Thank you for coming.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.340
I'm Alan with the Talks
at Google program here.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.387
The show itself, "Tail!

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:09.740
Spin!" is the truth
laid hysterically

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.090
bare in a wild, inventive
new comedy drawn-- actually

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.080
verbatim-- from
the leaked emails,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.600
raunchy texts, tell-tale tweets,
that brought down politicians

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590
Anthony "I Was Hacked" Weiner,
Mark "Appalachian Trail"

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.310
Sanford, Larry "Wide Stance"
Craig, and Mark "Underage Page"

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.280
Foley.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.190
So as they say,
"Politics is dirty.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.940
But politicians are dirtier."

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.240
And now, performing for us
and introducing the show,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.590
please welcome the cast
and the writer from "Tail!

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.647
Spin!"

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:46.848
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:51.380
MARIO CORREA: I really
thank you so much.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm Mario Correa.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.535
I'm the writer of "Tail!

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.290
Spin!".

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.410
Although "writer" is sort
of a fuzzy term in our show.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.240
Because everything you'll
hear today was actually

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.140
said by the person in question.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.970
So it's a verbatim
recreation, our show

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.110
is, of four, real-life political
sex scandals as Alan mentioned.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.270
I want to start off, actually,
by thanking Alan for having us

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.980
here today.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.212
Jeremy [? Susphin, ?]
my friends at Google are

00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:15.837
who actually got us
in touch with Alan.

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:18.325
So this is all because
of Jeremy and Alan too.

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:19.740
So thank you, guys, very much.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.800
In our show, you'll see these
verbatim scandals played out

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.460
on stage.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550
And the actors, that
you'll have here today,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.710
play a bunch of different
characters in our show.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.050
So they take on all kinds
of different personas.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.870
We have a projection
screen on our show,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.953
usually, when you see it
down at the Lynn Redgrave

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:36.409
Theater in NoHo.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.950
And it tells you
who is playing what.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.300
Because they are constantly
switching characters.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.909
But today, I'm going to
tell you who these guys are

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.450
and which characters
they're playing.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.715
We're going to do the Anthony
Weiner scandal for you.

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:48.340
AUDIENCE: Whew!

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.048
MARIO CORREA: When
you come see our show,

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.170
it's a longer scandal.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.794
Because as you
remember, Weiner kind of

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:54.290
kept going, and
going, and going.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.421
MARIO CORREA: We're
going to give you

00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.950
just the first part of that,
a little teaser to get you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.730
guys downtown.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.160
So let me start by tell
you guys who our cast is,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.660
introducing them, and telling
you who they're going to play.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.831
So we start with Rachel Dratch
who-- I think many of guys

00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.789
know-- who is going to
start by playing-- whew!

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.527
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:17.110
MARIO CORREA: Rachel
is going to start

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.770
by playing a stripper,
called Ginger Lee,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.700
that Anthony Wiener used
to have conversations

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.530
with on Twitter and DM.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.950
Then she's going to switch
into a blackjack dealer,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.970
from Las Vegas, named Lisa.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.940
And then, eventually,
into a Texas single mom

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.430
named Megan, who all
of whom were involved

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.230
with Anthony Weiner in
one way or the other.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.640
Tom Galantich is going
to start by being

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.860
a DJ, who questions
one of these women,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.651
and eventually will become
Wolf Blitzer of CNN--

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:46.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.780
MARIO CORREA: --who
will, of course,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.656
question Anthony Weiner himself.

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.030
Then we've got
Arnie Burton who's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.200
going to start by being
Luke Russert, young Luke

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.310
Russert, who also
questioned Anthony Weiner,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.080
and will turn into
Gloria Allred.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.310
She's the lawyer who, basically,
every scandalmonger person

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.290
gets involved with
at some point.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.950
And, finally, Sean Dugan
will play Sean Hannity,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.970
from Fox, who was
always fascinated

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.720
with any sexual misdeed
by our politicians.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.280
And then, last but
not least, Nate Smith

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.160
is the one, the
only Anthony Weiner.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.660

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.368

component, which I thought

00:17:47.995 --> 00:17:49.380
was a different kind of thing.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.190
And then, we have more
of romantic scandal,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.600
that Tom plays, which is
Governor Sanford, the guy who

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.397
went to South Carolina
to, supposedly--

00:17:56.397 --> 00:17:57.480
well, he was the governor.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.340
And he was, supposedly,
hiking the Appalachian Trail.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.389
Really he was with his
mistress in Argentina.

00:18:01.389 --> 00:18:03.180
Those are the ones that
I want to focus on.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.082
But I considered John
Edwards, for example.

00:18:05.082 --> 00:18:06.790
SEAN DUGAN: Ah, he
would have been great.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.760
MARIO CORREA: There
was David Vitter.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.926
There was, I mean, there's
all kinds of politicians.

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:14.872
You have no dearth of
possibilities there, yeah.

00:18:14.872 --> 00:18:16.330
MARK DOUGLAS: So
what do you think,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.030
other than the
obvious things, what

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.790
do you think that all
four of these guys

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.780
have in common that
just makes them so--?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.750
I feel like there's something
about people who just refuse

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.720
to let go and throw
in the towel that

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.580
just is so great for comedy.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.064
Is that-- I guess I kind
of answered the question,

00:18:35.064 --> 00:18:35.564
didn't I?

00:18:35.564 --> 00:18:36.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:38.170
ARNIE BURTON : That's
going to be easy, then.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.620
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I want to--

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.270
MARIO CORREA: Answer is yes.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.570
MARK DOUGLAS: All right.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.170
Cool.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.540
I wanted to ask some
of the actors a lot

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.057
of you have, obviously,
done sketch comedy.

00:18:47.057 --> 00:18:49.640
Is there a different approach,
I mean, do you sort of approach

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.630
that-- I mean Rachel-- do you
approach this the same way you

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.040
would like an "SNL" sketch?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.720
ALAN SEALES: Or Nate,
too, from "UCB".

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.780
MARK DOUGLAS: Or
Nate, of course.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.150
Yeah

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.430
NATE SMITH: Yeah.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.388
MARK DOUGLAS: I mean, is
there a big difference

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.300
between this kind of
thing and a sketch?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.591
RACHEL DRATCH: I mean, I
pretty much approach this just

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:04.050
like "SNL", "The Second City".

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.360
But our approach
is very sketchy.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.045 --> 00:19:11.700
RACHEL DRATCH: But then, I think
the guys, who all, they each

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.790
have kind of an arc.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.080
So some of them have
to-- well, I mean,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.560
you can see with Anthony Weiner.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.000
There are moments where you
actually feel for these guys.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.330
You actually feel bad
for them at some points,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.940
which you might
not have expected.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.480
So I mean, there is an
element to real acting in here

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.450
as well for sure.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.085
But because I'm sort of
darting in and out of things,

00:19:32.085 --> 00:19:32.960
I'm definitely more--

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.090
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.430
RACHEL DRATCH:
--sketchy, I guess.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.790
MARIO CORREA: Well, yeah.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.297
Since Rachel plays
all the women,

00:19:35.297 --> 00:19:37.130
all the mistresses
except for Gloria Allred.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.075
She plays all the mistresses,
all the wives, all of the--

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:42.200
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, it
says, "wives, tails, beards,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.830
and Barbara Walters".

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.160
RACHEL DRATCH: Barbara
Walters at the end.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.810
MARK DOUGLAS: Which
could be it's own play.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:45.060
RACHEL DRATCH: It could be, yes.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.550
MARK DOUGLAS: Definitely,
it's a, I mean,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:46.730
that could be an awesome--

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.190
ALAN SEALES: Children's book.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.050
RACHEL DRATCH: Well, because
some of the wives are very,

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.130
a lot of them are very
"stand by your man".

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.310
And they're just stick
by them to the end.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.690
And then, Sanford, who's last
in our show-- Jenny Sanford

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.390
isn't like that.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.340
And I feel like by the
time she comes around,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.460
the audience is, they're so
psyched that somebody didn't

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.870
stand by the guy that
there's this big burst

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.240
of spontaneous applause.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.651
RACHEL DRATCH: Because
I think they're just

00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:12.380
waiting for someone
to say, like, no.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.841
I wasn't going to
stand up there.

00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:14.340
Yeah.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.740
ALAN SEALES: Billy, you're
the show's producer there,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.510
on the end, right?

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.454
So the show originally was at
the Fringe festival, correct?

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:22.370
BILLY ZAVELSON: Right.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.070
So two years ago, 2012, I
bumped into Mario at the gym,

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.060
right here.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.090
RACHEL DRATCH: It's
where it all happened.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.385
BILLY ZAVELSON:
Not the Google gym.

00:20:29.385 --> 00:20:30.730
MARIO CORREA: One of
us was working out.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.690
And the other one
was not so much.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.970
BILLY ZAVELSON: Everyone
was at a typewriter.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.200
MARIO CORREA: So you
can tell which one.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.200
BILLY ZAVELSON: No, I'm great.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.400
But whatever.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:35.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.962
BILLY ZAVELSON: So
he came up to me.

00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:37.745
And he said he wrote this play.

00:20:37.745 --> 00:20:38.490
MARIO CORREA: You're
supposed to say no.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:38.810
BILLY ZAVELSON: Right, exactly.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.110
MARIO CORREA: OK.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.210
OK.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.550
BILLY ZAVELSON: But
he came up to me.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.174
And he told me that
he wrote this play.

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:44.214
And any time somebody
says that, usually, it's

00:20:44.214 --> 00:20:45.880
just like, I don't
want to hear anymore.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.790
Because, more than
likely, that play stinks.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.840
And especially if
it's a friend, right?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.702
You don't want to.

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:52.660
So he told me about it.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.230
And it sounded, I love politics.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.980
And, of course, I like
theater and comedy.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.600
And it sounded great.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.070
So I read it.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.195
And I fell in love with it.

00:20:58.195 --> 00:21:00.560
And he had already submitted
it to the Fringe Festival.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.601
But he needed a producer.

00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.590
And I happily joined on.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.160
We had another partner, Marianne
Mills, who came on with us.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.140
And we did it there.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.050
Some of our cast was
a part of that cast.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.570
Sean Dugan, Nate
Smith, and Rachel

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.480
were all a part of that company.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.810
And we put it up.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.852
And it was excellent.

00:21:19.852 --> 00:21:20.560
It was excellent.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.490
It was exciting.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.150
It was right after the
most recent scandal

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.920
on that, was that one was--?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.090
MARIO CORREA: Had been,
I think, the Weiner one

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.840
had just happened.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.540
BILLY ZAVELSON: Weiner
had just happened.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:30.830
MARIO CORREA: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.520
BILLY ZAVELSON: You're right.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.202
And the critics loved it.

00:21:34.202 --> 00:21:35.160
The audiences loved it.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.020
And so then we decided to
make a commercial go of it.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.340
And it took a long time.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.305
It took about two years.

00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:44.480
Then, we got it up and running
at the Lynn Redgrave Theater

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.840
downtown at Culture Project.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.050
And we started
performances September 18.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:48.940
Opened October 1.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.649
And we're now running
through February 1.

00:21:50.649 --> 00:21:52.856
MARIO CORREA: And during
those intervening two years,

00:21:52.856 --> 00:21:54.700
tow of the guys ran
for office again.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.550
And had other scandals
the second time.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.130
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.790
MARIO CORREA: Weiner and Sanford
were like, thank God for that.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.789
BILLY ZAVELSON: Exactly.

00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:00.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.150
BILLY ZAVELSON: Exactly.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.525
I mean, it was
really, literally,

00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:03.770
the gift that kept on giving.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.835
Two days before we opened,
Larry Craig was, he was--

00:22:08.835 --> 00:22:09.960
MARIO CORREA: He was fined.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.550
BILLY ZAVELSON: --fined, right?

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:10.960
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.626
BILLY ZAVELSON: For
using campaign funds

00:22:12.626 --> 00:22:14.790
to fight his legal battles
for snooping around

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.800
in the bathrooms.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.080
And Sanford had
just posted, the day

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.380
before we started performances,
Sanford posted a 2,500 word

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.000
post, on his wall on Facebook,
basically breaking it off with

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.800
is Argentine lover.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.190
And things are
continuing to evolve.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.760
So as they do, we're evolving
the show, which is a headache,

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.791
but also really great too.

00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:37.790
MARIO CORREA: Every day.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.490
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, it's funny.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.180
Because it's almost, when
you think about the things

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.610
that they actually did to start
these things off, they're bad.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.150
But they're not the worst
things in the world.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.270
But it's almost just how
they handled it afterwards,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.370
especially with Weiner.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.340
I mean, just I feel like
I was around in the city

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.670
when, I felt like I saw
him around the city a lot.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.970
It was almost like
he was like, yeah.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:02.670
I'm doing this.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.705
It was like a performance
piece or something.

00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:06.080
But how did you
get that little--

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.079
ALAN SEALES: Your piece.

00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:09.160
MARK DOUGLAS: Performance
piece, yeah. [CHUCKLES]

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.290
MARK DOUGLAS: How did you get
that little "nyeah" noise?

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.160
Was that based on a real thing?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:17.710
Or was that--

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.140
NATE SMITH: It's based on--

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:18.940
MARK DOUGLAS: Was that
on the transcription?

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.231
NATE SMITH: --his being Jewish.

00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:24.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.584 --> 00:23:25.500
MARK DOUGLAS: Got you.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.900
Got you.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.150
NATE SMITH: I don't think
he really does that.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.570
[? MARIO CORREA: It ?]
seems so right, though.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.850
ALAN SEALES: It does.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.190
NATE SMITH: I
think people have--

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.560
because he doesn't
really do that.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:33.880
I mean--

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.650
MARIO CORREA: I've
never asked you.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.490
I always wondered.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.365
But you made it work.

00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:38.810
NATE SMITH: It's a
combination of Lenny Bruce

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.505
and SpongeBob is what it is.

00:23:40.505 --> 00:23:43.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.270
NATE SMITH: It just sort
of naturally came out.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.790
It's not something
he does, really.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.820
I just thought it was a nuance
that would be fun to add.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.770
SEAN DUGAN: And yet,
it seems like everyone

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.603
thinks that he does.

00:23:52.603 --> 00:23:55.270
Because it always gets
a laugh of recognition.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.060
NATE SMITH: What he
does do is write really

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.130
corny humor in his tweets,
and his texts, and stuff.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.250
And and that just was,
generally, his persona.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.650
He was kind of
aggressively funny

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.724
in a way that wasn't
particularly funny to me.

00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:10.140
ALAN SEALES: So
the drinking game,

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.560
and the hamburger comment--

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.000
NATE SMITH: Yeah, the
drinking, the hamburger--

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.440
ALAN SEALES: --this
is all verbatim

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.240
from something he said.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.350
MARK DOUGLAS: Wait. even
that nickel bag line was?

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.700
NATE SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:16.890
Everything.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:17.180
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, my God.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.020
MARIO CORREA: Everything
comes from something

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.860
that's really been said.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.280
BILLY ZAVELSON: It's so
funny that you say that.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.070
Because we feel like
we're banging people

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.100
over the head with this.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.599
There's a sign,
before they walk in,

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:27.854
that "every single thing you
hear was tweeted, texted,

00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:28.520
told", whatever.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.060
We have it before every scene.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.810
And it's so funny.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.830
People still leave
the theater and say,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.115
I cannot believe that that
happened or that they said

00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:34.360
that.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.060
BILLY ZAVELSON: And they did.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.726
It's remarkable.

00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:36.820
It's extraordinary.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.920
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I
think some of the moments,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.670
from remembering--

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.370
MARIO CORREA: Surprise, bitches.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.150
ALAN SEALES: That's
what I was about to ask.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:42.720
Because you're known--

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.650
RACHEL DRATCH: I don't know
that she said that then, right?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.820
MARIO CORREA: She said it in
her blog post about something.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.278
RACHEL DRATCH: Yeah, that's
the one we took some liberties.

00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:50.820
She really said those things.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.650
But probably not when she was
up there with Gloria Allred,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.120
right?

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.060
MARIO CORREA: Right, not
during the press conference.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.261 --> 00:24:56.636
MARIO CORREA: In
our world, yeah.

00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:57.020
RACHEL DRATCH: I think that's
the only place we did that.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.010
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, Sean,
you're the naughty boy

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.617
speech about Bill Clinton.

00:25:01.617 --> 00:25:02.450
SEAN DUGAN: Oh, yes.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.280
MARK DOUGLAS: I felt
like you almost, he

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.675
said it more ridiculous
than you, actually.

00:25:07.675 --> 00:25:09.720
You delivered it more
like a person then he.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.350
SEAN DUGAN: I've started
zhugging it a little bit.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.141
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:25:12.141 --> 00:25:13.920
Can we hear a
little bit of that?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.880
SEAN DUGAN: Well, gosh.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.370
Let's see.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.195
Can I get into him?

00:25:17.195 --> 00:25:19.770
Can I embody Larry
Craig right now?

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:20.270
Let's see.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.853
What did he--?

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.520
Oh, yes.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.850
The American people,
already know-- thank you,

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.910
paddle-- the American
people already

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.910
know that Bill Clinton is
a bad boy, a naughty boy.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.410
I'm going to speak out for
the citizens of my state

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.950
who, in the majority, think
that Bill Clinton is probably

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.070
even a nasty, bad, naughty boy.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.964
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:44.172
MARIO CORREA: Out of context.

00:25:44.172 --> 00:25:44.630
SEAN DUGAN: OK.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.356
MARK DOUGLAS: OK, maybe
you didn't underplay it.

00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:47.397
[? ARNIE BURTON : Bad. ?]

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800
SEAN DUGAN: It's evolved
since you saw the show.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.220
MARIO CORREA: Sure.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:52.870
MARK DOUGLAS: Sure.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.310
SEAN DUGAN: I
really just allowed

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.104
him to be the queen
that he wants to be.

00:25:57.104 --> 00:25:57.871
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.871 --> 00:25:59.620
NATE SMITH: It's a
moment in the play when

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.578
I'm not doing anything.

00:26:00.578 --> 00:26:02.690
And I just watch
Sean's bottom lip.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.520
Because it quivers
with this subtlety

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.880
that just really
makes you laugh.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.782
Boy.

00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:12.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.920
ALAN SEALES: How much
liberty do each of you

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.180
take with the
characters in making

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.097
it an exaggeration
versus true-to-life?

00:26:21.097 --> 00:26:23.430
RACHEL DRATCH: Well, I think
in some, well I don't know.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.440
In some, I try to do
a real impression.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.400
And in others, I
just do like, here's

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.770
what I think this
person would sound like.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.020
Or here's what would be funny.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.980
And then, others are more
sort of true to the--

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.396
TOM GALANTICH:
Yeah, I think we're

00:26:34.396 --> 00:26:37.250
doing giant
characterizations of them.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.290
We're doing overblown
versions, for the most part,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.120
I think just to take
advantage of most,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.540
as much as we can
of the material.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.100
MARK DOUGLAS: I particularly
enjoy your sudden explosion

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.127
into tears.

00:26:53.127 --> 00:26:53.960
TOM GALANTICH: Yeah.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.920
MARK DOUGLAS: That
Sanford isn't really nice.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.356
Is there any trick to that?

00:26:59.356 --> 00:27:00.980
TOM GALANTICH:
[CHUCKLES] I don't know.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.290
Just being Jewish, I guess.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.118
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.118 --> 00:27:06.999
TOM GALANTICH: No.
[CHUCKLES] No, it's just fun.

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:08.040
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.540
MARIO CORREA: There's a moment
when Arnie, as Mark Foley,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.660
jumps in as Congressman
Mark Foley in the beginning

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.130
of a scene, when Mark
Foley's the guy who

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.880
was IMing those underaged pages.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.499
And Arnie starts the scene.

00:27:20.499 --> 00:27:22.040
I should let you
describe what you do

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.595
and how you select the person in
the audience that you do it to.

00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:25.340
Because that's a really--

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:25.930
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.388
ARNIE BURTON : Oh,
well, it starts,

00:27:27.388 --> 00:27:31.320
the whole Mark Foley section
starts where he's addressing

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.260
the graduating, if you will,
class of the pages for that

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:35.760
year.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.720
And this was the year where
the underaged page, that he

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.460
was corresponding
with, was there.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.810
And so it takes place.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.660
And I'm introduced.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.330
And I'm addressing the pages.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.510
So I thought it would be
fun every night to go out

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.560
in the audience and
fondle, use the audience

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.450
as the pages and a good
excuse to fondle an audience

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.570
member every night.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.820
MARK DOUGLAS: Do you need one?

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.080
ARNIE BURTON : I thought
it would be fun to go out

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.930
and fondle.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.355
Just like in the sound byte.

00:27:58.355 --> 00:27:58.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.710
MARK DOUGLAS: Just fondle, yeah.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:00.260
TOM GALANTICH: Just
so you know, there's

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.260
no warning about that
when you walk in the door.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.093
ARNIE BURTON : Yeah.

00:28:03.093 --> 00:28:05.540
ARNIE BURTON : And so, during
their sketches I'm looking

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.890
around, seeing who would
be best that I could fondle

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.350
and wouldn't get
pissed off, or hit me,

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.400
or try to-- so it's
dicey every night.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:15.052 --> 00:28:17.260
ARNIE BURTON : Some nights,
people are really into it

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:17.900
and play along.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.680
And then, there's some nights, I
have just picked the wrong guy.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.560
Because I go up.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.809
And I like, [FONDLING NOISES].

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.260
[CHUCKLING] One night,
I got so carried away,

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.460
I started-- because
they really enjoy it.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.216
One night, I had put my
finger in a guy's mouth.

00:28:34.216 --> 00:28:37.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.536
MARK DOUGLAS: That's getting
your money's worth right there.

00:28:40.536 --> 00:28:42.850
BILLY ZAVELSON: Yes.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.790
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, now you're
ready to play [? Head Wig, ?] I

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.510
guess.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.020
But I was thinking about that.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.645
I wonder if people
get a little freaked

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:52.920
out about Ebola
and stuff with it.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.465
But anyway, that's just
something I was thinking of.

00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:59.340
SEAN DUGAN: Ebola's the
least of your worries

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.365
if Arnie Burton's putting
his finger in your mouth.

00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:01.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.864 --> 00:29:04.550
ARNIE BURTON : [LAUGHS] Wow.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.261
SEAN DUGAN: No, actually, no.

00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:07.010
That was terrible.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.290
ARNIE BURTON : I know.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.120
SEAN DUGAN: I retract that.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.090
ARNIE BURTON : Yes.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.990
I'm clean.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.199
I'm clean.

00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:12.990
ALAN SEALES: Quick.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.196
Ask a question.

00:29:14.196 --> 00:29:14.696
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:14.696 --> 00:29:16.190
ALAN SEALES: Uh, uh, uh.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.830
MARK DOUGLAS: What do you got?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.770
Well, it's funny.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:23.000
As you are all actors,
it feels like the line

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.740
between politicians
and actors is

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.380
getting more and more blurry.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.310
There's something
about, what do you

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.510
think it is that compels these
people just keep going and not

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:36.040
knowing when to stop
once they've sort of--

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.260
and when it's obviously
over for them?

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:45.030
ARNIE BURTON : A few weeks ago,
the real page that Mark Foley

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.560
corresponds with, three of those
pages came to see the show.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.440
We were very excited.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.630
Because it was, of all
the stars and celebrities

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.880
who have come to see the
show, that was, for me, like,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.667
oh my God.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:56.250
And we got to talk
to them afterwards.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.370
And I was talking to
the three of them.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.010
And they said, you know,
it's so much about--

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.390
and he was very dear.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.730
Because he was very nervous
about seeing it and seeing

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.220
his words put up there.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.950
MARK DOUGLAS: Did
you sit on his lap?

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:08.290
ARNIE BURTON : Oh,
well, you know.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.623
MARK DOUGLAS: In the front and--

00:30:09.623 --> 00:30:11.571
ARNIE BURTON : We
started texting.

00:30:11.571 --> 00:30:12.737
We're seeing each other now.

00:30:12.737 --> 00:30:13.114
MARK DOUGLAS: Next
thing you know--

00:30:13.114 --> 00:30:15.630
ARNIE BURTON : And
we're very happy.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.275
MARK DOUGLAS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:18.900
ARNIE BURTON : But
and we were talking.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.162
He said it so much about--
because it's, especially

00:30:21.162 --> 00:30:22.620
for him, in the
Mark Foley section,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.370
it's hard to understand why this
17-year-old kid played along.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.290
And he said it's so much
about power with these guys.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.330
And from both
sides, I think they

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.140
get caught up in
their own power.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.950
And they think they're
invincible in a way.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.575
And they think they
can keep doing this

00:30:37.575 --> 00:30:41.274
or, in Weiner's case, lie to
the press, and just say it.

00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:41.940
And that's true.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.356
And then, go on
and keep doing it.

00:30:43.356 --> 00:30:46.180
Because I think they
feel they're above.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.550
They're so brainwashed
with their own power.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.680
And then, the people
beneath them, these pages,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.890
and whoever they're dealing
with, are so awed by this power

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:59.520
that they get sucked into
this vortex of toxic power.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.870
NATE SMITH: I will
say, conversely,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.890
that we hold them to
this ethical standard

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.410
that they should be
the infallible people.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.730
And the the Larry
Craig scandal is

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.370
one where we talked
about repeatedly.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:17.140
That this is a guy who is from
a generation where you live,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.920
if you're a gay man-- and he's
of a constituency that wouldn't

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.260
accept one of their elected
leaders being a gay man.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.400
So he really was living a lie.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.029
And it is--

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:30.570
SEAN DUGAN: Allegedly,
we don't know.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.680
NATE SMITH: Yeah, allegedly.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.638
He's alledge, you know.

00:31:32.638 --> 00:31:34.060
NATE SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.110
So on one hand, there is
this the lure of power.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.660
On the other hand,
there's a feeling

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.890
that we are expecting them
to be infallible people.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.669
And it's just not a reality.

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:49.710
SEAN DUGAN: But that's an
interesting observation

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.560
that politicians and actors,
there's a line blurring.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.450
Because, to me, it
also seems like you've

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.870
got an almost completely
dysfunctional government.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:05.940
But then, you also have the news
media has become infotainment.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.280
It's about ratings
rather than actually

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.390
giving the news to people.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.876
So then, I think that you
really have to care a lot.

00:32:15.876 --> 00:32:17.500
And I think you have
to care a lot more

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.540
than the average American voter
does about what's going on

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.480
to really get through
all the crap between so

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.750
many of these people who
are elected to fight.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.630
And compromise has
become a dirty word.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.550
And they grandstand
and all this stuff.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.969
And then, the people, who
are reporting about them,

00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:37.010
are doing the same thing.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.210
And the--

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.440
MARIO CORREA: They all become
talk show hosts at the end

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.600
anyway.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:38.860
ARNIE BURTON : Yeah.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:38.940
SEAN DUGAN: Yeah.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:39.900
MARIO CORREA: And they
go right from Congress

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.680
to host the show on Fox News.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.340
So it's one in the same, really.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.570
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, we're
all interested in it.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.910
ARNIE BURTON : --doing the show.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.970
And then, two books,
"The Unwinding" and "This

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.930
Town" together.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.217
And it completely soured
me on politics forever.

00:32:52.217 --> 00:32:52.800
Just because--

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.040
MARIO CORREA: This town
is [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.250
ARNIE BURTON : --the whole thing
has become so, it's almost like

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.795
it's become so show biz, that
you feel the politicians,

00:32:59.795 --> 00:33:02.430
that are coming in now, and the
people that are covering them,

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.470
it's all about show biz.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.580
And they're all in
it to be famous,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.290
to chase that thing instead of--

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.790
MARIO CORREA: And that's why
it's easy to make a comedy out.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.960
Because these guys really
are low-rent comedians.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.350
So as Rachel, I think,
often points out,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.070
she's like, "We didn't
write these jokes.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.010
We sort of found
them and figured

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.570
out how to really make them
pop in what is a comedy."

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.984
So audiences, who come see
our show, they really laugh.

00:33:24.984 --> 00:33:25.900
Because it's a comedy.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.870
But these guys
actually said this.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.810
And, by the way, it's
your government at work.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.280
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, yeah,
it reminds me of, on "SNL"--

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.355
you see that show?

00:33:35.355 --> 00:33:36.600
You know that show?

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.660
When Tina Fey, I
remember there was

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.656
a point where she
was literally just,

00:33:40.656 --> 00:33:42.280
I don't even think
they wrote anything.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.400
It was, literally,
just the Sarah Palin--

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:44.442
[?

00:33:44.442 --> 00:33:44.700
MARIO CORREA: Sarah
Palin, yeah. ?]

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:44.800
MARK DOUGLAS: --interview.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.852
And I was waiting
for, I was like, oh.

00:33:46.852 --> 00:33:48.060
This is the actual interview.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.060
But it's hilarious.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.810
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.220
TOM GALANTICH: For me,
the large-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.220
One thing to add.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.590
For me, the larger issue
has always been, in addition

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.110
to all of that, is
the infancy that we're

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.470
in in dealing with the type
of media that's out there now,

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:08.129
and with learning about
tweeting, and about Facebook

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:09.420
messages, and things like that.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.250
And they're out there in
the ethernet somewhere.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.179
But are they really retrievable?

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.560
And in this case,
a lot of them were.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.800
And so, to me, it's about
these men and about us

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.850
as a whole learning to deal
with what you all are creating,

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.935
which is this different world
that we're living in now,

00:34:26.935 --> 00:34:29.561
where information
is instantaneous.

00:34:29.561 --> 00:34:32.060
MARIO CORREA: You guys got all
the DM jokes, which sometimes

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.300
audiences are like-- because
theater goers can be older.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.610
And they're like, what's a DM?

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:37.480
NATE SMITH: In a way, I was
like, you guys are laughing.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.770
MARIO CORREA: Is like the DL?

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:39.310
TOM GALANTICH:
So, for me, that's

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.768
the larger issue, how we deal
with that as a society, then,

00:34:41.768 --> 00:34:42.428
going forward.

00:34:42.428 --> 00:34:43.219
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.414
Question?

00:34:44.414 --> 00:34:45.606
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:45.606 --> 00:34:47.105
So you mentioned
that the pages came

00:34:47.105 --> 00:34:49.260
and saw your show
a little while ago.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.260
Let's say Anthony Weiner
was coming next week.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.486
How would that influence
how you guys did the show?

00:34:53.486 --> 00:34:54.610
Would that change anything?

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.693
[? MARIO CORREA: Press. ?]

00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:57.375
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.375 --> 00:34:58.625
ALAN SEALES: For the positive.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.890
ARNIE BURTON : I don't know if,
I do know I was a little extra

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.160
nervous when we knew that the
pages we're going to be there

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.840
that night.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.650
Because these people are
so outlandish in a way,

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.610
we tend to forget
that-- at least I

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.660
do-- that they're
actually real people.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.430
And it brought it home the night
that they were there that, oh,

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.930
my God.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.620
These are all real people,
They all said that.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.036
Especially meeting
him afterwards.

00:35:24.036 --> 00:35:25.670
Because he was still sweating.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.744
He had sweat the page.

00:35:26.744 --> 00:35:27.410
He was so sweet.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.620
But he was really sweating
through the Foley section.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.800
And it really brought home
that these are real people.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.350
And, especially,
him because he got

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.700
caught up in something
that he did not

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.965
want to be caught up in.

00:35:40.965 --> 00:35:41.510
SEAN DUGAN: Well, but
there's a difference

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.460
between the real person,
and the politician,

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.890
and the people
that were affected

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.140
by it who weren't politicians.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.750
ARNIE BURTON : But Sean thinks,
every night in the audience,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.150
that there's someone.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.608
SEAN DUGAN: I was
totally convinced

00:35:49.608 --> 00:35:51.630
that Mark Sanford
was at our show.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.970
And I shit myself.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.965
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.965 --> 00:35:55.340
SEAN DUGAN: So
that's the answer,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.870
for me, is that I was
sitting right here.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.250
And there was a guy right
there who looked exactly

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.120
like Mark Sanford, with
a woman next to him,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.780
and no one on
either side of them.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.240
And they were watching--

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:04.570
MARIO CORREA: She looked
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.140
SEAN DUGAN: --the
show like this.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.809
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.809 --> 00:36:10.600
SEAN DUGAN: There was
very little laughter,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.516
during the whole show.

00:36:11.516 --> 00:36:13.990
But during the Sanford stuff,
they found nothing funny.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.600
They did not clap
after the show.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.530
It was cray.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.110
ARNIE BURTON :
But you were like,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.526
the Koch brothers
are there today.

00:36:19.526 --> 00:36:20.276
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:20.708
SEAN DUGAN: David
Koch was over there.

00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:21.620
ARNIE BURTON : Satan's is there.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.332
Satan's in the third row.

00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:22.814
SEAN DUGAN: No, it's true.

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:23.296
RACHEL DRATCH: Oh, yeah.

00:36:23.296 --> 00:36:24.560
You were like, Anderson
Cooper's out there.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.143
Then I looked.

00:36:25.143 --> 00:36:27.744
I was like, that is a poor
facsimile of Anderson Cooper.

00:36:27.744 --> 00:36:29.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:29.404 --> 00:36:31.070
BILLY ZAVELSON: To
answer your question,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.230
I think it's likely
that that could

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.350
happen depending on
which politician.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:39.240
I think it may be too
soon after Anthony's

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.050
failed mayoral campaign.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:45.075
But someone like Foley,
I have connection to him

00:36:45.075 --> 00:36:46.450
through friends,
down in Florida,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.260
who say that he is
considering another run.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.400
He probably would not
hate seeing this so much.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.260
I think it's likely.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.240
And I hope that they do come.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.458
I mean, look.

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:00.852
I hope Craig comes.

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:02.810
NATE SMITH: I think,
ultimately, it's a comedy.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:07.570
I mean, we are sort of stirring
a mock-up a little bit.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.960
But it also is a comedy.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.454
It's meant to be funny.

00:37:11.454 --> 00:37:13.745
MARK DOUGLAS: And you're not
embellishing the dialogue.

00:37:13.745 --> 00:37:14.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:14.720
NATE SMITH: Yeah.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.922
Yeah, they're expensive.

00:37:15.922 --> 00:37:18.005
MARIO CORREA: We do know
that Barbara Walters, who

00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:21.470
was played by Rachel in our
show in one of the crowd

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.457
favorite moments of our
show, her hairdresser came.

00:37:24.457 --> 00:37:25.540
RACHEL DRATCH: Oh, really?

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:25.910
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.450
RACHEL DRATCH: I
didn't know this.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.940
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.200
Yeah, the hairdresser came.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.250
RACHEL DRATCH: That was
the Anderson Cooper guy?

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:29.580
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:29.845
RACHEL DRATCH: No.

00:37:29.845 --> 00:37:32.260
MARIO CORREA: And we thought
that that was like the-- yeah.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.070
RACHEL DRATCH: I
didn't know that.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.600
MARIO CORREA: --she sends the--

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.001
ARNIE BURTON : She sends out
her Minions to check it out.

00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:37.792
MARIO CORREA: Tell,
then, how was the hair?

00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:38.636
ARNIE BURTON : Yeah.

00:37:38.636 --> 00:37:40.660
ALAN SEALES: So how do you
find-- Mario especially,

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.243
I guess-- how do you
find the balance?

00:37:42.243 --> 00:37:46.350
Because there's so much
seriousness and realist

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.680
to the dialogue.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.700
We had a tender moment
watching Anthony Weiner

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.190
admit wrongdoing.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.550
But how do you find the
balance between the comedy

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.200
and the seriousness
to make it flow?

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.060
Was that difficult?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.851
MARIO CORREA: Yeah.

00:37:57.851 --> 00:37:59.340
It is trial and effort, really.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.320
And these guys, during
the rehearsal process,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.010
really helped me with that.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.480
Because there's just some
narrative that we just

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.970
have to put out there, even
if it's not a funny line.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.920
But then, we, like
a joke, right?

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.870
So we played a lot with
moving things around, first

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:13.650
when I wrote it.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.165
Then, when these
guys rehearsed it,

00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:17.540
and they offered a lot of
suggestions during the process.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.680
It really is a little
bit of trial and error.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.280
And then, every
night is different.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.770
Some nights, people laugh
at this versus that.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.210
Luckily, they're
always laughing.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.610
But what they laugh at tends
to vary night by night.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:29.790
MARK DOUGLAS: Question.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.380
AUDIENCE: So it's a question
about your research.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.860
I noticed that all
of the politicians,

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.519
saying these funny
things, all are men.

00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:38.060
So when you were
doing your research,

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.720
did you ever find any instances
of female politicians getting

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.900
stuck in these scandals?

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.510
Or does that just not happen?

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:45.090
MARIO CORREA: Not really.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.506
I mean, first of
all, I should say

00:38:46.506 --> 00:38:48.660
that-- I have said in
other interviews-- Google

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.297
is my collaborator on this play.

00:38:50.297 --> 00:38:51.880
Because that's how
I found everything.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.062
Literally, it's all I did was
fall into internet wormholes.

00:38:56.062 --> 00:38:57.270
MARK DOUGLAS: You're welcome.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.811
MARIO CORREA: More
and more Googling.

00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:01.430
Mark Sanford plus
sex plus whatever.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.880
MARIO CORREA: But
there have been

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.380
a couple of women
politicians who've

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.104
been accused under the radar
of having been involved

00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:10.270
in scandals, including the
current governor of South

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.260
Carolina, a woman.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.390
But nothing that's actually
gotten out in the open

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:15.160
and been verified.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.660
So it's basically men.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.660
Men are the ones who are
doing it, by and large.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.540
SEAN DUGAN: It's also there's
a larger societal thing.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.170
I mean, what happens
when a woman teacher

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.150
sleeps with a male student.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.380
There's a collective,
kind of "right on, boy".

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.740
Because we treat men
and women differently

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.600
in terms of sexuality.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.190
And plus, you could
also say that women

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.812
are just smarter than men.

00:39:38.812 --> 00:39:40.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.920
ALAN SEALES: There's also, I
guess, a little bit of history.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.790
Because Barbara Walters did have
an affair that's been public,

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:47.290
right?

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.080
So she had the affair with
former Massachusetts Senator

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.960
Edward Brooke.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.188
So Barbara, right?

00:39:54.188 --> 00:39:55.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.210
ALAN SEALES: If you could give
any advice to these Senators

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.292
on how to make things better--

00:40:02.292 --> 00:40:03.470
RACHEL DRATCH: Oh, my God.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.450
No pressure there.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.941
Well, I don't know.

00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:09.816
Just to address this.

00:40:09.816 --> 00:40:12.410
This is they're
so-- well, whatever.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.531
I could use one of your
Barbara Walters things.

00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:15.473
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:15.473 --> 00:40:18.300
MARIO CORREA: Do Barbara while
it's not [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.090
No, OK.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.760
The very last line
of the show is

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.180
after all these
guys are going on

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.266
and on about,
"Here's why did it.

00:40:23.266 --> 00:40:25.724
And I'm sorry. [BLAH BLAHS]
Then, they all leave the stage.

00:40:25.724 --> 00:40:28.130
And then, Barbara Walters
just peeks to the audience.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.480
And she's like, "I had an
affair with Edward Brooke,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.000
the first African-American
elected to the US Senate

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.530
since Reconstruction.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.940

I've ever been with."

real [INTERPOSING VOICES]

Oh, geez.

question should be,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.390
you're up here listening to
four actors talk about politics,

man.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.270
It should just be
like, do funny things.

[LAUGHTER]

00:40:55.674 --> 00:40:57.720
MARK DOUGLAS: You think,
does Anthony Weiner

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.117
say "cack" like that really?

00:41:00.117 --> 00:41:01.950
NATE SMITH: That was
actually the directors.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.360
ARNIE BURTON : Nyoh, cack.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.640
NATE SMITH: A specific
note from the directors.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.990
ALAN SEALES: Actually makes
it a little less dirty.

[?

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.590
NATE SMITH: To say it c a k. ?]

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.340
MARK DOUGLAS: Well,
you know what's funny.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.550
It seems like what happens
with a lot of these guys,

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.660
especially in the case
of Anthony Weiner,

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.830
I think a lot of
these guys are nerds.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.970
So it's like they get famous.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.730
And then, just the way
he tries to talk dirty,

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.087
he's not good at it.

00:41:24.087 --> 00:41:24.972
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:24.972 --> 00:41:25.680
NATE SMITH: Yeah.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.180
He's not.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.510
I think that's two things.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.050
One, I think it's like he's
[? skewing ?] what he really

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.100
wants to say sometimes.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:42.270
And then, other times he's
just kind of a dork about it.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:43.270
I've done some sexting.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.640
And let me tell you something.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.890
It's better to be direct.

one thing away from this Talk,

be sure it's that.

Question over here.

AUDIENCE: Do you
have a wish list

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.780
for politicians you'd like
to see in scandals so you

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.105
can make fun of them?

they're all in them already.

00:42:14.223 --> 00:42:15.580
It's hard to think of one.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.040
[? ARNIE BURTON : I'd ?]
like to see Boehner.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.840
MARIO CORREA: You'd like to
see Boehner in a sex scandal?

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.150
BILLY ZAVELSON: Of course.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.810
And McConnell.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.600
I mean, God forbid
we see him in one.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.202
But of course.

00:42:22.202 --> 00:42:24.410
[? ARNIE BURTON : I think ?]
Palin would be good too.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.620
Because she'd

MARIO CORREA: Palin

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.210
That'd be a great
one-woman show, for sure.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.880

whole thing, yeah.

MARIO CORREA: Ready to stage it?

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.830
Yeah?

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:35.750
It'll happen.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.300
It'll happen.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.425
BILLY ZAVELSON: You betcha.

00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:39.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.042
ALAN SEALES: So bad.

00:42:40.042 --> 00:42:44.240
So this is, obviously,
very scripted and very

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.400
well-organized. .

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.270
And the dialogue is
stacked together.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.380
But did anybody, I
mean, just watching

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.880
you guys run through the
run-through this morning,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.590
you're still, the cues
are very hard to remember,

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.510
and the the pickups.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.250
And especially--

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.206
SEAN DUGAN: Excuse me,
but we nailed that.

00:43:01.206 --> 00:43:01.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.706 --> 00:43:03.970
ALAN SEALES: Oh, the
performance was spot on.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.970
MARK DOUGLAS: You make
it look really difficult.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:11.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.300
NATE SMITH: We did a
press event last week.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.800
And it involved a lot of
like, "Uh ay, what's my line?

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.457
Uh."

00:43:19.457 --> 00:43:21.290
There are times when
it's really hard to do.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.210
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
I guess if you really

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.051
don't want to end up
improvising at all.

00:43:25.051 --> 00:43:27.175
Because then, you're killing
the integrity of the--

00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:27.332
[? MARIO CORREA: You ?] can't.

00:43:27.332 --> 00:43:27.490
You can't.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.830
ALAN SEALES: Has that
happened where during a show

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.600
you've just forgotten
lines and--?

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.760
SEAN DUGAN: Well, after our
days-long rehearsal process,

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.960
the rigorous 10 days we had,
there were a lot of times,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.211
in the first few shows where--

00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:42.835
RACHEL DRATCH: Like
the part in Weiner,

00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:44.200
when I kept having to switch.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.930
There was this big chunk where
I kept forgetting the lines.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.013
Just not in the show, but
when we were rehearsing.

00:43:49.013 --> 00:43:51.394
And I'd just be like, "Um,
about to fuck my friend?"

00:43:51.394 --> 00:43:52.060
Because it was--

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:52.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:52.895 --> 00:43:54.520
MARIO CORREA: That
was fallback always.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.240
RACHEL DRATCH: It was
usually a pretty good chance

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.803
that's what the
person was saying.

00:43:57.803 --> 00:44:00.840
So I was like, "Um,
can I bang friend now?"

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.096
NATE SMITH: Yeah, so it would
be just Plan B for the scene.

00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:05.220
It was just like, oh, yeah.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.647
We just skip those two pages.

00:44:06.647 --> 00:44:07.730
MARIO CORREA: That's true.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.330
If you guys curse and
say like, oh, fuck,

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.175
we just assume
it's the audience,

00:44:10.175 --> 00:44:11.425
that that's part of the lines.

00:44:11.425 --> 00:44:12.376
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:44:12.376 --> 00:44:14.000
MARK DOUGLAS: It's
a pretty nice friend

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.250
that's just always on standby.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.920
ALAN SEALES: It's hard
enough to remember

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.190
what's already in the script.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.640
So it's always changing
due to the news, right?

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.510
But how do you rewrite
that and do the put-ins?

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.130
MARIO CORREA: Well,
these scandals

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.040
have had some things happen
in the last couple of weeks.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.450
And we make small changes
to keep up with them.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:37.220
But it's true.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.980
When we were doing the
preview process, for example,

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.409
we were getting all this new
stuff from Sanford, and even

00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:42.450
from some other scandals.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.760
So we'd pick one a day.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.850
Like, today, we're going
to do the new Sanford.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.480
Tomorrow, we do the
new Larry Craig.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.590
Because it's amazing
what these guys can

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.520
do in terms of
learning and adapting.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.692
But I think we were
pushing them to the limit.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:56.900
RACHEL DRATCH: Well, also
for this show, It was cool.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.649
Because, with
Sanford, you imagine,

00:44:59.649 --> 00:45:00.940
well, he did cheat on his wife.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.500
But if that was his soul
mate, they're meant to be.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.280
So, OK.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.470
And then, during the
last part of rehearsal,

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.107
you find out that he broke it
off with the Argentinian woman.

00:45:09.107 --> 00:45:09.940
And you're like, OK.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.060
So he's just as much of a dirty
dog as all these other guys.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.274
And so that's what
we added back in.

00:45:15.274 --> 00:45:16.440
We added that into the show.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.310
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, I
remember feeling like,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.563
when that happened,
I was like, well,

00:45:19.563 --> 00:45:22.030
this guy really does seem
like he's in love. [CHUCKLES]

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.122
RACHEL DRATCH: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:23.122 --> 00:45:25.080
MARK DOUGLAS: It seemed
like the most pure one.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.390
But--

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.680
RACHEL DRATCH: Right.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.430
ARNIE BURTON : And that
he didn't tell her--

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.720
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, well.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.845
ARNIE BURTON : --in person.

00:45:27.845 --> 00:45:29.170
He did it over Facebook.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:29.480
SEAN DUGAN: On Facebook.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.050
ARNIE BURTON : That's how
she found out, over Facebook.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:31.280
RACHEL DRATCH:
And he thought she

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.590
understood they
were breaking up.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.470
But then, she didn't.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:37.000
And so then, she saw it on his
Facebook post or something.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.830
[CHUCKLING]

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.850
MARIO CORREA: Always
check Facebook, I guess,

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.180
is the way I see it.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.060
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:40.920
MARK DOUGLAS: Do you
think they don't--

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.120
TOM GALANTICH: We're
back to my point.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.460
MARK DOUGLAS: --understand
how technology works?

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.320
Is that some of that?

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:43.730
What it is?

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:44.020
TOM GALANTICH: Well, that's
what I was saying before.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.810
MARK DOUGLAS: They
just think it's

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.540
a private message between
them or something?

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:46.640
ARNIE BURTON : That's right.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.490
Because Bob Kerrey
came to see the show.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.530
And we got to meet
him afterwards.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.260
And he just gave us a
one-word description

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.070
for each of these guys.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:52.710
Because he knows them all.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.430
And he said Sanford
is just an idiot.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:55.679
That's what he said about him.

00:45:55.679 --> 00:45:56.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.880
MARIO CORREA:
Kerrey, for those who

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.879
don't remember, he was a
Senator, from Nebraska,

00:45:58.879 --> 00:46:00.190
who ran for president in '92.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.246
And he came, and saw
the show, and said,

00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:04.120
"Oh, and thank you for
keeping me out of it."

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.800
And I said to him, "You
kept yourself out of it."

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.591
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, so we're
running short on time here.

00:46:09.591 --> 00:46:10.735
We take one more question.

00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:11.150
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.358
Thank you so much for coming.

00:46:12.358 --> 00:46:15.380
I just had a question about,
I guess, the creative process.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.550
Do you think that having
the lines predetermined,

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.180
not being able to
improvise at all,

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.910
constrained your creative
process in any way,

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.406
either writing the show
or acting in the show?

00:46:25.406 --> 00:46:27.780
Definitely in sketch, you
probably improvise a whole lot.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.010
So I'm just wondering how it
was different for you guys

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.750
performing in this
versus something

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.980
where you have a
little more freedom.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.730
RACHEL DRATCH: Well,
because this was a play.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.160
I mean, so the good thing
is there was give and take.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.100
If you had an idea like, maybe,
let's switch these lines around

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.220
or, I mean, basically
we kept the lines

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.410
as is to keep with that
thing that this is all really

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.200
what they said.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.130
But if you saw an
angle on something,

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.960
then you could approach
Mario or Dan, the director,

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.600
with an idea.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:03.560
But, for the most part, there's
no real in improv in it.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.290
I mean, I guess, well, for
example, here's a good example.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.610
Arnie, in his Gloria Allred,
or Arnie does this character,

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.920
is a very straight line.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.790
It's just this guy saying,
"The South Carolina--"

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:16.927
What's your line there?

00:47:16.927 --> 00:47:18.390
[? SEAN DUGAN: South ?]
Carolina [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.500
ARNIE BURTON : (AMERICAN
SOUTHERN ACCENT) The General

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.390
Assembly does hearby
censor Marshall Sanford Jr.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:22.674
for dereliction of his duties.

00:47:22.674 --> 00:47:25.090
RACHEL DRATCH: Yeah, so it's
just this very straight thing

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.510
of Mark Sanford being censored.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.140
But he comes out and does
this whole big, almost

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.520
like a Foghorn
Leghorn character.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.150
And the audience
goes nuts for it.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.980
He applies kind of a sketch
vibe to a very straight line.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.540
So that's kind of how a game
is sketchy in this sense.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.155
But no verbal improv.

00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:44.530
ARNIE BURTON : It
is interesting.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.490
Because, sometimes,
during a rehearsal process

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.720
and you work with a
playwright, and you can work.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.330
And he can change and rewrite
things with the actor in mind.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.630
And you combine
and make it happen.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.760
But in this, the trick
was exactly like you said,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.970
it's very predetermined.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.390
And there's no futzing
with the lines.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.040
You have to keep the
integrity of what they said.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.550
So we have to come at
it at a different way.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.140
Like what can we bring?

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.100
What can we do with the
lines to make them pop,

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.790
or to make the joke pop, or
bring a character to the lines?

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.260
Because there's
nothing we can do.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.259
Those are set in stone.

00:48:20.259 --> 00:48:21.800
SEAN DUGAN: And
there's so much of it

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.850
that's really rapid-fire
timing that we're all

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.520
speaking together, sharing
lines, or talking right

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.420
after the other.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.180
That was probably
the trickiest part

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.390
of the early part of the
process and early performances

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:40.050
where if you drop something,
you're just toast.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.290
And that we had to just
keep doing it over and over,

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.914
and drill it, and just get it
so we could be more free to--

00:48:46.914 --> 00:48:49.080
ARNIE BURTON : But it's
such a good group of people.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.970
Because if we do drop
it, which we still do,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.596
it's a play where you can
laugh and acknowledge it.

00:48:54.596 --> 00:48:56.262
And you can catch
someone's eye and just

00:48:56.262 --> 00:48:56.468
realize how ridiculous
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:48:56.468 --> 00:48:56.510
Yeah.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:57.000
NATE SMITH: Nobody knows
[INTERPOSING VOICES] like that.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.460
ALAN SEALES: Well, it must be.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.560
Sanford's like that.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:48:59.686
MARK DOUGLAS:
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.490
be really tough
because he's talking,

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:05.360
he's pulling things
out of this butt.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.360
He's just digging--

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.030
TOM GALANTICH: Or Mario's,
Mario's butt, yeah.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:14.110
No, honestly, I approached
it like any play,

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.590
like any play or show.

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:15.960
MARK DOUGLAS: Funny
man, funny man.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.793
TOM GALANTICH: Yeah.

00:49:16.793 --> 00:49:19.430
I mean, Mario gave
us the blueprint.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.930
He gave us the
step-by-step screw

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.570
goes here, nail goes here,
stud goes there, literally.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:30.130
And it's our job, as actors,
to then take that and make

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.080
the most of it, and
make what we can of it.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.280
And that was the
improvisation aspect to it.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.900
You take what you're given
and make the most of it.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.320
And so it's a real collaboration
between writer, and director,

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.850
and cast.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.390
MARK DOUGLAS: Well,
I think that's it.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.140
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.556
MARK DOUGLAS: The
show is amazing.

00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:52.116
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:55.060
MARK DOUGLAS: You guys
really should go see it.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.950
ALAN SEALES: Visit them down
at the Lynn Redgrave Theater.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.354
Visit them online,
tailspinshow.com, Instagram,

00:50:00.354 --> 00:50:01.520
and Twitter-- @TailSpinShow.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.495
Yeah, I think that, should
we get a current state

00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:10.102
of the world from Debbie Downer?

00:50:10.102 --> 00:50:10.426
RACHEL DRATCH: Oh, God.

00:50:10.426 --> 00:50:10.588
No, no.

00:50:10.588 --> 00:50:11.074
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:12.050
RACHEL DRATCH: Are
you kidding me?

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.570
MARK DOUGLAS: What would Debbie
Downer have to say about Ebola?

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:13.645
RACHEL DRATCH: No.

00:50:13.645 --> 00:50:14.480
What are you doing to me?

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.845
TOM GALANTICH: They can't
see how they're doing to you.

00:50:15.845 --> 00:50:16.755
RACHEL DRATCH: We're
about to wrap it up.

00:50:16.755 --> 00:50:17.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.495
RACHEL DRATCH: I'm
like, we're done here.

00:50:18.495 --> 00:50:18.870
MARK DOUGLAS: I know.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:19.296
ALAN SE-ALES: All right.

00:50:19.296 --> 00:50:20.574
No, 40 seconds overtime.

00:50:20.574 --> 00:50:20.634
RACHEL DRATCH: [SOBS]

00:50:20.634 --> 00:50:21.000
SEAN DUGAN: We're just getting
our Google glasses out.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.344
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:21.430
Cool.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.125
Thanks.

00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:24.050
Give a big round of
applause. [APPLAUSE]

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:25.550
BILLY ZAVELSON:
Thank you, everyone.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:26.630
[APPLAUSE]
