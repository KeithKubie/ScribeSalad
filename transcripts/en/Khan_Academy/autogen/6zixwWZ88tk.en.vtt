00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 . 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.390
 What we will do in this presentation is to graphically draw some lines 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.330
 Using x and y intersections of the line 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.060
 At first, the line is defined by two points 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.760
 If you find two points - if you are able to set two points 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.020
 On-line, you will be able to connect between them and continue 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.050
 Both directions 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410
 And so you draw the line 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.750
 What I will do in this show - the two points that are 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.620
 I will choose them as line intersections 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.380
 These are two of them 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.040
 There is an x-junction and a y-intersection 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 These are the points where 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 Lines intersect with x and y axes 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 To illustrate this, this is the x-axis 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
 On the graph sheet 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.090
 That is the x-axis 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.340
 It's continuous 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.030
 That is the x axis 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.770
 Here, in the center, which is heading up 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.880
 The bottom is the y axis 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.845
 That is the y axis 

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:05.250
 I do not think you can see what to write 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.690
 That's the y axis 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.780
 Let me explain what I mean by x and y intersections 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.010
 Let's do part a 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.860
 Part a 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 I will do it in a different color, not the same color 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.510
 Intersections 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.610
 Part a, we have equation y = 2x + 3 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.550
 First, let's think about what will happen when x 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.800
 = 0 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.010
 When x = 0 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.980
 When x = 0, how much is y? 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.280
 y = 2 × 0 + 3 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.210
 Well, 2 × 0 = 0 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.730
 If y = 0 + 3 ie y = 3 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.830
 If point x = 0, and y = 3, that is 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 Check the equation 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 Or it exists on the line defined by this equation 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 If point .3 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.890
 Let me see her 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.810
 Point 0.3 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.790
 Now note, this point - when x = 0 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.750
 It lies on the y axis 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100
 This is called a y intersection 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800
 When x = 0 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220
 But it is called the y intersection because it is located on the y axis 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
 It is the intersection of the line with the y axis 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 Let's do the same thing now with the x axis 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.830
 Let's put y = 0 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.020
 If y = 0, we will have 0 = 2x + 3 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.380
 We can subtract 3 from both ends of the equation 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.960
 We get 3 = 2x 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.190
 Now divide both sides on 2 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.680
 We get 3/2 = x 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 And a 3-2 score of 1-1 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.050
 We know that the point is 3/2, 0, is not it? 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.110
 The second point was y = 0 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 We know that a set of x and y values ​​are also achieved 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.450
 This equation 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 Or that this point also falls on the line 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.180
 3/2 - and remember that it is equivalent 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.780
 -1 1/2 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.060
 Located here, y = 0 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 This was the second point we created 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.440
 When y = 0, in this case we deal with the x intersection 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.090
 We cross the x axis 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.300
 That is the x intersection 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.850
 If you want to draw the line, it will look like this 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.320
 Approximate, I will reach these points then 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.020
 continue 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.770
 Continue both ways 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.790
 Both directions continued indefinitely so I had 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.870
 Painted line 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.920
 Let's solve more 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.040
 I do not want to be a mess here 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 Let me erase all this 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.910
 Let me 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.550
 Let me erase this also 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.560
 You can stop the show whenever you want, if you want to stare at it - ohh 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.490
 I did not have to do that 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.640
 See the axes 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.440
 I will redraw the axes 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.790
 I will redraw them again 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.410
 Good end 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.410
 This is the first axis, x-axis 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.880
 This is the y axis here 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.110
 Let me do part b, it seems that b 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.390
 Interesting 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.860
 b is 6x - 1 = 2y + 3 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.080
 Let's look at the case where x is = 0 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.090
 When x = 0, the result of equation 6 will be 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.080
 X -1 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.540
 is not it? 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.590
 Because this is 0 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.860
 6 × -1 = -6 = 2 - call me 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.400
 Divide it - +2y + 6 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 You hit 2 × y and × 3 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.220
 Then we can propose 6 from both parties, and so 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.080
 We get -12 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.650
 -12 = 2y 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.315
 I put six of the parties up until I moved this 6 

00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:02.780
 To the left side 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.450
 We subtract 6 from here, and these disappear 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.910
 We subtract 6 from here, and get -12 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.020
 Divide both sides on 2, and get 6 = y 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.110
 If the first point that we have and know it lies on the line are 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.300
 x = 0, and y = -6 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.560
 x = 0, and y = -6 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.950
 That is the intersection of y 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.890
 That is the intersection of y 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.570
 Now, let's see what happens when y = 0 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.960
 Return to the original equation 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.330
 We have - let me write this in a different way - when y 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.260
 = 0, we have 6x - 1 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.290
 Let me make up for that 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.220
 6x - 6 = 2y 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.630
 Well, y = 0 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.430
 So we have 2 × 3 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.480
 This all becomes 3 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.550
 Will equal 6 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.310
 Let's subtract 6 from both parties - or let's add 6 for both 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.060
 The two ends of the equation 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.800
 I want to get rid of them here 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.380
 I need to add 6 until it becomes 0 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.000
 We get 6x = - we add 6 to the right side 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.390
 We get 12 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.010
 And we get x - we divide both sides on 6, and we get the 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.630
 x = 2 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.660
 If the other intersection is x = 2, and y = 0 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.060
 We have x = 2, and y = 0 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.030
 Here 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.300
 This is the x intersection 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.430
 Then our current line, we connect points 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.860
 It will look like this 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.770
 We clearly have a problem drawing a straight line but I do 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.840
 I think you understand the idea 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.380
 Two points define the line 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.320
 Let me have one more 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.870
 I can solve it at the top here, in these 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.220
 Area 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.340
 Let's solve the part d 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.360
 Part C can be solved if you want extra exercise 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.380
 Part d, we have x + y = 8 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.230
 It's really, really straightforward 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.500
 When x = 0, how much is the value of y? 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.370
 If it is 0, then y = 8 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.030
 Then when y = 0, how much is the value of x? 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.860
 Well, you can cover this as well 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.090
 You get x + 0 = 8 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.750
 If x = 8 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.280
 These were direct 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.870
 If our first point is 0.8 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.830
 0.8 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.010
 This is the y intersection 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.040
 Then we have point 8.0 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.060
 8.0 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.470
 This is a x intersection 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.252
 Then we can reach the points 

00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:41.460
 It seems so 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.310
 Now let's solve this issue 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.080
 At a local grocery, the strawberry price was $ 3.00 per 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.810
 Lbs and banana price $ 1.00 per pound 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.555
 If I had $ 10 to pay between strawberries and bananas, draw 

00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:03.140
 A composite graph of everything I can buy 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.320
 I would pay exactly $ 10 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.990
 Let me draw the axes 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.030
 And make sure it's good and packed 

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.880
 This as you remember is the horizontal axis 

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.620
 This horizontal axis 

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.070
 But for pleasure, instead of being called x axis 

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.235
 I'll call it the strawberry hub 

00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:28.280
 Strawberry hub 

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.640
 In fact let me name it, Axis S, where it's dedicated 

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.330
 For strawberries 

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.666
 Let s = number of strawberries 

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:41.760
 the strawberry 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.419
 I think you realize what I'm doing 

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.830
 And b will be the number of banana pounds 

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.580
 the banana 

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.830
 Let me put the b axis 

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.340
 I will set the number of banana pounds on the vertical axis 

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.760
 This is the axis of b 

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.095
 b Ratio to bananas 

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:06.070
 Okay 

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.860
 Strawberry Price $ 3.00 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.380
 Well, this is not the number of strawberry beads 

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.790
 It is the number of pounds 

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.040
 Let me erase this 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.430
 These are the number of strawberry pounds 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.990
 We will not walk with the number of strawberries 

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.920
 But with strawberry pounds 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.660
 These are banana pounds 

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.680
 this is good 

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.480
 Strawberry price $ 3.00 per pound, bananas 

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.080
 Its price is $ 1.00 per pound 

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.800
 How much will I spend? 

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.690
 I will spend $ 3.00 × the number of strawberries 

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.860
 Because their price is $ 3.00 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.230
 Well, I will spend $ 3.00 × the number of pounds 

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.750
 The strawberries are priced at $ 3.00 per pound + $ 1.00 

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.810
 Ø Number of banana pounds 

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.330
 It is required to spend $ 10.00 on both 

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.040
 This is worth $ 10 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.010
 If 3 × strawberries + strawberries 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.650
 Bananas = 10 

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.710
 1b is equal to b, so I can rewrite it b 

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.160
 + b = 10 

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.610
 Now let's fix it 

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.235
 Let's look at the situation where there is no strawberry 

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:13.030
 The situation in which there is no strawberry 

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.120
 That is, strawberries are 0 pounds 

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.280
 How to become an equation? 

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.860
 3 × 0 + b = 10 

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.700
 This is 0 

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.550
 And b = 10 

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.300
 Now I will put 0 pounds for strawberries 

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.380
 I get 10 pounds of bananas 

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.650
 If I have 0 pounds of strawberries, I will get 10 

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.710
 Bananas 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.510
 Now what about the rest? 

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.330
 What did not I have a banana? 

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.400
 I'll get 0 pounds of bananas 

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.610
 Now let's make up for here 

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.120
 We have 3 x strawberries + 0 lb pounds 

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.780
 Bananas = 10 

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.410
 This is 0 

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.470
 Divide both sides on 3 

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.960
 I can - if I do not have a banana - I'll get 10/3 

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.400
 Strawberry pound 

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.480
 Or this equals 3 1/3 

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.170
 Point 3 will be 1/3 pounds for strawberries, and 0 

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.890
 Lbs for bananas 

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.240
 If 3 1/3 pounds 

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.290
 Strawberry, 0 lb banana 

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.110
 Then we can connect the line 

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.010
 This line I will draw, I will paint it 

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.090
 In the first quarter 

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.880
 Because I can not have negative bananas 

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.760
 I will not sell negative bananas 

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.210
 I can not have a strawberry 

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.620
 We are not talking about selling strawberry negative 

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.810
 I can only buy this stuff 

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.150
 This is the amount I will buy 

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.010
 Let me get the points out 

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.700
 This is structured because this line illustrates all 

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.580
 Possible compounds of strawberries and bananas 

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.700
 For example, this point - I do not know if I am 

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.360
 Draw it exactly - it looks like I took 5 pounds 

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.200
 Of bananas, and less than two pounds of 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.350
 the strawberry 

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.110
 That's what I'm telling him 

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.460
 If you take 3 pounds of strawberries, if you take 

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.010
 Exactly 3 pounds of strawberries, so I can take one ban of bananas 

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.720
 Each point here represents a compound 

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.040
 I can get it for $ 10 

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.200
 .
