00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:09.509
(hip hop music)

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.847
Kelly: I've never seen this.

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:14.225
This has been so impressive and amazing,

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:17.536
and leaving teachers with wanting more.

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:19.615
(hip hop music)

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:21.142
Joshua: When I first
knew about Khan Academy,

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:23.792
it was mostly like, "Uh, my
teacher said this in class,

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.094
"but I can't remember what he said,

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:26.694
"so I'm going to go check
out on Khan Academy."

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:27.824
So, it was more of a personal resource,

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:29.670
and that's kinda where I
was thinking it would be

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.344
in my classroom down the line, and say,

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:32.456
"If you're struggling with this,

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.556
"go check out Khan Academy."

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:36.950
But now, after coming to this,
it can be that first step.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.549
It can be the go-to, "Hey, go learn this,

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.619
"go learn the foundations,"
and then we can take it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:43.831
to the next level in our classroom.

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.399
We can put those hands-on activities.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.202
(hip hop music)

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:48.683
David: [Thinking] it will take a child,

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:51.111
and look and say, "Wow, they're
really struggling here,"

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.700
so, now when I've got
everybody else doing this,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.701
I can slip around back
without anybody noticing

00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.201
that I'm helping somebody
because they're slower

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.825
and allowing that child
to keep their dignity,

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:05.915
because I was able to privately
identify what there was

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.545
that they needed help
with; and that was awesome.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:10.122
(hip hop music)

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:12.692
Jeannie: I love this whole concept.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:17.217
This is so life-changing
in the way that you teach,

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:19.429
because then it gives you
time to work with the students

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.199
and it gives you time to
understand what they know

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:26.873
and clear up misconceptions.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:30.690
It gives you time to just really encourage

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.301
those students to go on.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.261
(hip hop music)

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.757
Teri: I have a very
unique set of students.

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:37.795
They happen to be behind bars.

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:39.699
In my classroom, I might have a guy

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.561
that's functioning at his 2nd grade level,

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.738
and I may have a guy that has his PhD,

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.614
sitting in the same classroom,

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.380
and how do you bridge
that gap as a teacher?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.622
And yet, I saw the Khan
Academy being a tool

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:54.312
that we could implement at a very low cost

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:55.970
with our economy the way it is

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.171
and provide the biggest bang for the buck.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:00.735
(hip hop music)

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:02.753
David: Empowering the student to learn

00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:06.525
is what the key is to
making them learn for life,

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:09.214
so I think this is a great
aspect and a great tool of that,

00:02:09.214 --> 00:02:12.936
and I think it'll actually
start helping them to say,

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.698
"Hey, if I don't know the
answer, I can find it."

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.386
Because that's kinda what I
try to do in my classroom,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.004
and I think we need to do more of that.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.099
Al: It's the way kids learn now.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.210
It's the way kind of education is going.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.507
It's been kind of status
quo for many years now,

00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:26.818
and I think that we really
are on the front edge

00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:32.133
of some new, innovative
solutions to helping kids learn,

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.349
and catching up, with not
only the rest of the nation,

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.449
but the rest of the world.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.087
Kelly: I feel like my students
are the [revolutioni].

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:49.145
