00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:07.907
( jungle sounds )

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.609
In the summer of 2011,

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:12.112
I visited the forests of Borneo,

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.380
the rainforest of Borneo,
for the very first time.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.650
As you can imagine,
it was the overwhelming sound

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.219
<i>that really struck me the most.</i>

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.022
<i> But in the background
 of this sound,</i>

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.624
this overwhelming cacophony,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.893
is the sound of chainsaws.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.497
In fact, if you turn down
the sound of the forest

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.099
there was actually
a chainsaw noise behind that,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.633
- ( sound of chainsaw )
- the entire time.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.002
<i> It's very, very hard to know</i>

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.837
<i> where illegal logging
 is taking place,</i>

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.105
<i> even over a short
 distance of the forest,</i>

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:41.841
<i> because it's such a loud place</i>

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.542
<i> and because it's such
 a dense place</i>

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.177
<i> that you can't move
 through so easily.</i>

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:46.278
<i> So, here's this idea, right.</i>

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.681
<i> The moment that a chainsaw
 goes off in the forest,</i>

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.417
<i> a computer, a device,
 is able to pick up the sound,</i>

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.786
<i> pick it out of the rainforest,
 the chainsaw,</i>

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.488
<i> and send an alert to
 the local authorities</i>

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.424
<i> who can show up in real time
 and halt the loggers.</i>

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.858
<i> But you need a device, right?</i>

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.494
<i> And so we're talking
 about cell phones.</i>

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.362
<i> The amazing thing is that
 there's sometimes</i>

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.697
<i> pretty good connectivity.</i>

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.467
<i> There's cell phone service out
 in the middle of the forest.</i>

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.402
<i> To protect it from
the elements of the rainforest,</i>

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.503
<i> we put it in a box.</i>

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.104
<i> There's a powerful
 microphone on it.</i>

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.507
<i> You do have to put some
 solar panels on it</i>

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.108
<i> to make sure it
 can stay powered.</i>

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.877
<i> This is actually what it
 looks like all put together.</i>

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.746
<i> This is the prototype.
There's a phone inside that box.</i>

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.215
<i> And you're able to listen to
 the sounds of the forest.</i>

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.152
<i> We were able to pick up
 the sounds of chainsaws</i>

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.653 line:0%
<i> and send a real time alert</i>

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.656
to myself and to the
rangers that were there.
