00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.669
If I had two words to
describe Dolley Madison,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.463
they would be
vivacious and cunning.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:08.341
She was very much the
center of attention,

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.760
the life of any room
and at the same time,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.763
she knew exactly what she
was doing at all times.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.684
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.186
- She's a very attractive woman.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.607
She's slender, she has jet
black hair and blue eyes.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:28.820
James Madison sees her and
apparently falls in love,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.531
in lust, in whatever over her.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.702
He's small, pedantic,
not the life of a party.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.539
It's a remarkable marriage
of opposites attract.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.375
- Dolley Madison was a
legendary entertainer

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.670
but in a subtle way,
that kind of entertaining

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.298
was also really
deeply about politics.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.801
- Dolley carefully
constructs these invitations

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.637
to these dinner
parties to get people

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:58.057
on board to the policies
that James Madison

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:02.479
wanted to put forward
and to whip Republicans

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.731
into line to support him.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:09.235
She introduced the idea
that the First Lady

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.239
could be a political matchmaker
and she was extremely

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.158
skilled at it.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.036
- She was such a gracious
hostess and was so involved

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.247
in politics that one of her
husband, James Madison's,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.042
opponents said it was
really unfair that he had

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.377
to run against both Madisons.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:28.505
- Dolley really
did what she could

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.341
to, sort of, position
herself and her husband

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.927
in the best possible
light and she succeeded.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.347
- Dolley Madison was
probably best known

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.933
for saving the portrait
of George Washington

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.351
during the War of 1812.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.187
- The British Army was
marching right into the city.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.689
There was the danger
of being killed.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.068
She stayed in that
White House much longer

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:53.363
than she should've
to protect it.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.406
- She actually
instructed the servants

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:58.117
to fill the carriages that
they were going to take

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.870
away from the White House
with government papers,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.622
notes from the
Continental Congress,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.749
things that were
important to the nation.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.627
- As she's leaving, she
realizes that the portrait

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:11.131
of George Washington, which
Dolley always understood

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.217
the national symbolism of,
was still in the White House.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.804
And they roll it up and
they carry it to safety.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.557
- She wanted to make sure
that the government papers

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.393
were preserved, in addition to
George Washington's portrait

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.728
which hangs in the White
House to this very day.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.897
- She knew that these
things were the stuff

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.650
that we build our sense
of a nation around.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.487
- Dolley Madison was really
a force to be reckoned with

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.738
in her own right.

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.241
She was so influential
as First Lady

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.744
that for decades after she
left office, she was still

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.956
considered politically powerful
and important in Washington.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.333
She was the only First
Lady to be granted

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.002
an honorary seat in Congress.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.753
- She lived in a home
across the street

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:54.424
from the White House
and it was very common

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:57.343
for visitors and dignitaries,
anytime they went

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.262
to visit the President
of the United States,

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.973
they in turn went over to
visit Dolley Madison as well.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.474
- She lives quite a long life.

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.352
She doesn't die until 1849.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.355
When she dies, there
is a huge funeral.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.150
- Zachary Taylor eulogized her

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.944
as the "First Lady
of the nation".

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.488
That was actually one of
the first times in history

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:19.782
that that term "First
Lady" was used.
