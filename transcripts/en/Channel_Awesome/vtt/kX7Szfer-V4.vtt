00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
Just a heads up everybody,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.120
the audio on this might sound a little distorted

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.300
because I was actually screaming so much

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
I blew out the mic.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm sure you'll take that as a good sign.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.200
Enjoy!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.880
Okay, so I've seen a lot of Disney sequels this year

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.100
and I've hated a lot of them but for some reason

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.820
some strange reason, Mulan II

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.020
I hate the most.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.380
Now that's not saying it's the worst.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.800
It's not the worst animated, it's not the worst story

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.360
The third Beauty and the Beast probably has that distinction.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.840
But something about this one just rubbed me so the wrong way

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.120
and got me legitimately angry.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.940
Which is so strange because the first Mulan I didn't even get THAT into.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.140
I mean, I liked it, I thought it was fine. It had some good moments and stuff.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.920
But something about this one just made me appreciate it all the more

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.580
when I see what it could've been.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.620
How awful it could've turned out.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.840
Mulan is back home training a bunch of kids how to be little warrior princesses

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.060
when her boyfriend drops by and proposes.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.660
She of courses says "Yes" but this looks like bad news for Mushu

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.900
not voiced thank God by Eddie Murphy this time but a, much more unfunny Eddie Murphy impersonator

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.300
who's going to lose his job because he no longer has to look after Mulan.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.480
So, it's up to him to try and split the couple apart.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.700
Yeeeeaaaaah, doesn't that make him incredibly likeable?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.860
But come on, this is the sequel to Mulan, this girl that went in and defeated this army

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.420
surely some action's gotta be in here.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Well, the emperor of China sees that the Huns are about to attack

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.280
Okay! Here we go! Now we're gonna get some good sword fighting!

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.720
He calls in Mulan and what does he have her do?

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.280
Escort these three princesses to be married.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.500
Yeah, because, a marriage will unite these two kingdoms and thus they can fight the Huns together.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.020
Well, wait, that's it?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.500
That's really it??

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.240
I mean, don't get me wrong, the movie makes it very clear early on that it isn't just about fighting and violence

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
it's about the, center and peace and tranquility of the mind but...

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.720
Really? This is the plot?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.100
Of course they bring in the comic relief from the last film and they're gonna fall in love with them

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.540
there's gonna be this whole thing about "Oh should they marry or should they not?"

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.800
You know "choose your heart" all that blah blah blah.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.360
But, here's the thing:

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.180
It isn't like being forced to marry just cause you're forced to marry cause of tradition

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.180
The future of China relies on this!

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.300
That throws in a completely different element.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.180
But Mulan doesn't care! Oh she just wants her girlfriends to be happy!

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.380
EEEEEEEEEE!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.000
But to make things worse, Mushu is constantly trying to split up the main couple throughout the entire movie

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.920
And I mean, the ENTIRE movie!

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.340
He suddenly becomes the most despicable, unlikeable character in the world!

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.280
And what makes it even worse is, that it kind of works!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.740
The boyfriend just goes off on Mulan in this really uncomfortable animation

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.340
By God, what the hell is he even doing?

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.460
Mulan at some point through some bullshit realizes that it wasn't true and she's gonna fall in love with him again and marry him but

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.080
Then HE disappears! So she thinks now she has to marry one of these princes to unite the two kingdoms.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.100
The climax?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.220
Every dumb ass romantic comedy you've ever seen.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.400
Where the bride is gonna marry the person she doesn't want to marry

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.260
and the guy has to come in, confess his love

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.740
and some sort of dumb comedic ASS happens!

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.760
I'm just gonna warn ya, I'm gonna get into spoiler territory here but I'm sorry this is really important to talk about.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.660
So, Mushu tries to make everything better by telling them that they don't have to marry.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.280
Well...Okay.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
The three princesses marry the men they want, Mulan marries the boyfriend but...

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.380
What about China?

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.260
They're doomed!

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.440
There's no alliance! The Huns are going to attack!

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.540
China is officially destroyed because of this!

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.280
But...

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.960
At least they're marrying for true love! Ooo!

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.200
It's never addressed what happens after this!

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.160
I wouldn't make that big a deal out of it. I know: Direct-to-Disney sequel  - haha! But...

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.980
THEY make a big deal out of it!

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.440
They keep talking over and over why they can't get married, how

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.640
thousands will die if they don't join this union!

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.580
And... in the end I guess they just let thousands die!

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.200
It's...

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.780
It's really awful!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.020
There's only one good song in the whole thing and it's the first song

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.840
all the others are either hand-me-downs or repeats.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.200
Yeah! They just repeat half the songs!

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.920
"Girl Worth Fighting For" comes back, that'll save from having to write another paycheck!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.460
The animation, while smooth and colorful, also kind of looks out of place.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.200
Mulan in the original had a pretty good range of emotion, but here all the animation is kinda done like they're comic relief.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.760
They're TOO expressive. They're TOO rubbery.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.680
Which, like I said, makes for some really awkward scenes when the boyfriend has to yell at her.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.040
[noise of disgust] That's disturbing!

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.640
I don't know what it is, because like I said, I didn't get super into the first film

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.680
but something about this was just SO insulting and SO demeaning.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.940
The choices were just SO bad

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.160
and maybe the fact that they did put in this really good animation just made the insult greater.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.440
If it had the animation of, say, "Tarzan and Jane" or one of these TV pilots

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.200
I'd forgive it a little bit more.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.100
But you know that they put in a lot of effort

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.940
like, yes, this is the script. This is gonna be Mulan II.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.340
This is gonna be what everyone is gonna get behind.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.720
I don't know, it just really friggin' irked me.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.500
And all the characters are unlikeable

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.580
and generic

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.560
and bland

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.700
and not interesting

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.460
or stupid

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.100
or just mean-spirited!

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.820
I can't believe what an asshole Mushu is!

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.400
And the boyfriend!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.280
And Mulan for letting the entire... everything of China die because "follow your heart"

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.440
which is, like: "Oh my god, what is wrong with this movie?!"

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.600
It is a mess.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.720
It is awful.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.580
It just got under my skin I hated it so much!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.080
Like I said, I can't say it's officially the worst

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.320
there's definitely been worse Disney sequels

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.360
but this one so far, I've hated the most.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.120
It sucks. It REALLY sucks.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.260
If I ever had a kid and they wanted to see this, I'd say no!

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.300
I'd just show them the first Mulan again

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.540
*sigh* I don't even know what to say about it.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.580
Just skip it!

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.000
Don't check it out!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.180
If you really love the movie Mulan or even just think it's okay like I do

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.040
Avoid this at all cost!

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.400
The only thing it did is that it made me appreciate the first one a lot more.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.240
So I guess I'll give it that.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.140
But for everything else, this movie can friggin' blow me!
