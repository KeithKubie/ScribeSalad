00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.040
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, I'm Clara Hughes-Johnson.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.210
I'm very excited to be here with many of you
in mine, old and dear friend and former Googler,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.929
Sara Wampler, but we will not be calling her
that.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.379
[laughter]

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.950
This is Sara Ramsey today for purposes in
video posterity, we are being recorded.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.950
Just want everyone to know.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.500
So, Sara, I think we all knew, know, grew
up in Iowa and still returns often to Iowa

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.990
to play board games with her family.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.990
[laughter]

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.899
'Cause that's what you do, I guess, besides
the corn in Iowa.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.899
Is that fair?

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:35.899
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: That's fair.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:36.899
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: All right.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.320
And went to Stanford and stayed out here and
took a temporary job with Google.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320
&gt;&gt;Clara.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.280
And then stayed with us for a long time.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.199
Tried to take a leave to work on her writing.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.789
We just reeled her back in.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520
She's now out.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.710
Award-winning author of--.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.399
Is romance novel the category, or this like
a sub-category?

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.749
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Romance novel is pretty appropriate.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:58.829
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: You think it's?

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.829
OK.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.829
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:01.829
Historical romance.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Historical romance.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.829
[laughter]

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.829
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's still a romance.

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.810
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Is Georgette Heyer
part of the category, or is she not?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: She is the mother of the category.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.300
So, I'm impressed that you knew who she was.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.080
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I read a lot of her
novels when I was back visiting my family

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.280
and it was boring.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
[laughter]

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.170
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: That's pretty much how I got
into it.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.170
[laughter]

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: OK.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.170
So, this is exciting.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.430
So, are we--?

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.250
I noticed that we don't have any plans for
you to read an excerpt.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.680
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I think that's probably for
the best.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
[laughter]

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: OK.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680
OK.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: OK, there are 50 books over
here.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.960
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: But we do have some
copies for folks.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960
I'm thrilled.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.780
So, your novel, "Heiress Without A Cause--"

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.060
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yes.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.100
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: has won a couple of
pieces of acclaim.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.180
Can you describe the industry in what those
awards are for people who are maybe not aware?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.180
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.400
So, for those of you who aren't aware, the
romance industry has this, it's this entire

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.940
sub-culture that, I think, none of us have
ever laid eyes on until I started going into

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.650
it and realized just how many people there
are and how many magazines there are and the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.110
awards and everything like that.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.710
So, this novel, when it was still unpublished,
finaled for the Romance Writers of America

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.580
Golden Heart Award, which is given to the
best unpublished romances.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.900
And it gets about 12 hundred entries.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.430
They give it at this conference that draws
two thousand people.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.540
There's about ten thousand people in this
organization.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.969
So, that was exciting.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.629
And then, when it came out, it got four stars
from Romantic Times, which is the industry

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.629
magazine.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.489
So, I have the magazine at home and it has
the little blurb in all the covers.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.489
And it's pretty scandalous.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.959
So, it was exciting.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.959
[laughter]

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.959
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: OK.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:35.959
So, you sent this entry in.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.359
It won out of 12 hundred entries, which is
amazing.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.359
Then, you self-published.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.359
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Right.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.360
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, talk about that
decision and how it works in industry.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.370
So, I had, I think it was a lot of you who
knew me, knew I wrote two books and was in

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.939
that process when I finally left Google.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.310
The first book won that award and the second
book finaled for that award.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.880
And I got an agent and we were sort of moving
along that path of, "Oh, I'm going to get

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.529
a traditional deal and this is going to be
great."

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.390
But neither of those books ended up selling.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.969
And the market has been so tough with, I wanna
say economy.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:08.969
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Selling it to a publisher.

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:09.969
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.040
Ever since the economy collapsed, all of big
publishers are part of these bigger media

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040
conglomerates.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.489
So, they're part of like, News Corp or Viacom
or something like that.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.409
And they just can't take the risk on a smaller
author because they're looking at their bottom

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.930
line so stringently.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.769
So, my agent, with the first book we were
like, "Oh, just shove it under the bed.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.769
I'll write another one."

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.049
'Cause there weren't options at that time.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.430
This was in 2008, 2009.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.609
But now, if Amazon and Barnes and Noble and
I'll give a shout out to eBooks, although

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.810
it doesn't quite deserve the same level of
claim, unfortunately.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.599
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: All five of them that
sold.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.599
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yes.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.599
[laughter]

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.599
Yes.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.599
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: To people in this
room.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.599
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Probably.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.599
[laughter]

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.470
All of those options have come up for authors
and it's a really exciting time because two

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.359
years ago, I couldn't go down this road.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.239
But when I was looking at the numbers, I think,
Clara knows I like brightly colored spreadsheets

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.930
that have a lot of numbers all over the place
and aren't necessarily organized according

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.969
to business school plans, but they do work.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:09.640
And they told me that it would be fairly straight-forward
for me to sell enough copies to make as much

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.120
as I would've on an advance from a traditional
publisher.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.330
In these days, a publisher may give four thousand
dollars for the first book.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.330
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yeah.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.340
You don't get a lot for your first book, right?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Right.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.150
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, you're feeling
like you're on with the sales of this self-published,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.150
you're on track?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah, once you all buy a copy
today.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.300
[laughter]

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.300
Yeah, it feels pretty good.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.300
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yeah?

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.230
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I mean, I think that it was
the right decision for me.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.660
And I think, too, coming from someplace like
Google, where we're so used to things moving

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.660
fast.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.330
If I took six months to get back to Clara
on an email, which I never did, I hope--

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.330
[laughter]

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: No.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.330
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: No.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I would've been fired, right?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.330
Whereas in publishing, it's traditional.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.470
My agent sent the manuscript out to these
publishers last April, and by October we still

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.479
hadn't heard back from three of them.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.670
And when she would call, she'd say, "Oh, we're
still considering it."

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.770
But finally, I was like, "We're gonna pull
this and I'm gonna do it myself."

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.420
Because the speed with which the industry's
changing, I couldn't keep sitting there for

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.090
a year waiting for them to make a decision.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.090
So.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.090
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: All right.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.810
So, what everyone is dying to know is how
does your Google experience prepare you?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.810
[laughter]

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.990
So, you talked about lunch, getting a speedy
lunch.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.280
Anyone else, is anyone here in the book?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280
[laughter]

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.889
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I like how you snuck that in
at the bottom of that question.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.509
I was prepared to go career route.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.759
I'll answer the "is anyone here in the book?"
first.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.759
No.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.759
[laughter]

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:29.759
No.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.759
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I mean, come on.

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:31.759
The character--

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.759
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Alan Moss.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.000
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Alan Moss is not in the book.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.479
I can guarantee that.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.949
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Loosely based on--.

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.280
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I will say, I'll have little
interactions with people and I don't even

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.860
necessarily remember who the person was, but
they'll end up in the book in a different

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.860
context.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.810
If I see someone walk funny or do something
a little bizarre, all of those things end

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.241
up in the creative process, but it's not like
you can pick out and say, "That character

00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:03.979
is Alan Moss" for example.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:04.979
[laughter]

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:05.979
He's not in the book, I promise.

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.710
But, and there was one funny moment where
I realized that I put somebody's last name

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.310
in as a placeholder for a servant and then
forgot to take it out.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.960
'Cause I will just try to think of a name
and then, I forgot to take it out.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.150
So, if that person reads this book--.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.849
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Like, a last name
is a unusual last name?

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:23.849
[giggles]

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.669
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's actually not someone in
this room.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.270
It was somebody from one of my dorms at Stanford.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.979
So, that should encourage that corner of this
room to read the book.

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.539
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: He's a servant.

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:35.539
All right.

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:36.539
Interesting.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:37.539
So, back to the Google experience.

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.539
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.539
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Novelist.

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:40.539
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.690
I think that, as Clara said, I started here
as a temp and I intended to stay for about

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.610
six months and was going to go off and get
a PhD in English, which I quickly realized

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.490
was not gonna pay any bills at all.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.520
And I really liked Google.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.760
And I think that the longer I stayed, there
were always those days where I felt like I

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.379
should be writing a book or pursuing this
passion.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.710
But I will say I don't think I could've been
nearly as successful self-publishing if I

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.580
hadn't had the business and marketing experience
that I got here.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.629
Being able to do something like put together
a spreadsheet and say, "This is how much I

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:17.389
would've made this way versus that way," or
working for Clara with the communications

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.389
job.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.069
I wrote the back cover copy for my book, which
was a very different skill than writing a

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.069
novel.

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.610
Writing fiction is very different than saying,
"These are the five words that are gonna appeal

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.539
to somebody and this is how I get my message
across."

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.060
So, I think from that perspective, even though
the job wasn't related to what I wanted to

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.330
do with my writing, all of those little career
things have really helped.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.550
And I think it's easy to lose sight of that
when you're thinking, when you're sitting

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.990
in a job thinking, "This isn't what I wanna
do."

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.849
It's easy to forget that you're still learning
things that could help you later with that

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:47.849
path.

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:50.550
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: And then, I recall
some conversations that it is very lonely

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.120
to be home without your Diet Coke soda machine.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.360
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's very, very difficult.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360
[laughter]

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.590
The Diet Coke, not the loneliness.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.930
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: How did you figure
out, how did you end up sticking with it?

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.349
'Cause there were some moments where maybe--

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.349
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.870
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: you weren't too excited
to stick with it.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.870
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I'll be open.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.970
There was a moment last spring where I emailed
Clara and I was like, "Can I have my job back?"

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.970
[laughter]

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.460
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I wasn't gonna say
it, but--.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.699
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: But it was set up for me to
admit that.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:15.699
[laughter]

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:16.699
Yeah.

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:19.639
I would say that it was hard and I think the
first six months is the hardest.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.639
And that's why--.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:24.439
When I took my first leave of absence, it
was six months and I came back because it's

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:30.009
not enough time to really break yourself out
of all the habits that you have in a job that

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.029
I was really, not just comfortable in, but
really happy with, right?

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.850
Like, I didn't leave Google because I was
unhappy.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.789
And so, my first leave, I will admit going
back to Iowa was maybe not the wisest choice

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.340
either because board games are great, but
you can only play so many of them before you

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.760
start thinking "maybe I need something more."

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.480
But my, I think, taking more than six months
to actually get on my feet and moving to the

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480
city helped.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.139
So, I moved to San Francisco.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:00.370
I was living in this log cabin out in the
woods of Palo Alto, if you can believe they

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.370
exist.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.740
I found the one log cabin in Palo Alto.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:09.140
I think getting more active with my social
life and accepting I have to get out of the

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.810
house and take more time.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.810
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yep.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.810
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I think you know this, too.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.839
Most of the people that I've worked with here
are so driven and goal-oriented that if you're

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:22.600
doing your own thing, it's easy to just spend
all your time doing that, starting to feel

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.870
guilty if I'm not making progress on this,
I'm a bad person and I'm wasting my time and

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.700
the world's going to explode, which, as it
turns out, is not true.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:36.110
But that's still a work in progress for me
to figure out how do I have a balanced social

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.459
life and still get things done and feel good
about everything that I'm doing.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:41.589
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, how does that
work?

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:44.029
Do you have certain hours that you're writing?

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:47.070
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: You probably know that I'm
not the most organized.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.670
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I was like, how do
you procrastinate when--?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.310
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: How do I procrastinate?

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.800
I procrastinate pretty well.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.230
I would say if you wanna follow me on Twitter,
I tweet often about the Sarapocalypse, which

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.230
involves a lot of glitter.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.180
And my brand name is a little weird.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.450
I'm still figuring out my brand.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.180
I would say, I don't really have set times.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.300
But I try to set number of words per week
that I wanna hit, which I find works better

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.300
for me.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.860
I read all these things, like all these famous
authors get up at five and they write until

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.920
eight and then they have coffee and then they
read a book and then they write from three

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920
to five.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.310
I could never, I couldn't get up at five for
one thing.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.040
Getting down here was hard enough.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.930
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: For a noon--?

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.930
[laughter]

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.810
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: We had a time change yesterday.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.810
It's only eleven.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.810
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: This is really eleven,
yes.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.810
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: And I had to blow dry my hair.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.810
[laughter]

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.810
Yeah.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.810
I'm just not that kind of writer.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.490
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I can understand that
this morning due to the time change.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.490
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.500
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I can relate to that.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.760
So, you mentioned you just finished your second,
so this is Book One of the "Muses of Mayfair."

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yes.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: And you just finished
Book Two draft.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.050
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Last night.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.310
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Last night.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.890
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: The whole thing.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.890
[applause]

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.550
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, how long did it
take to write that?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.930
That's what we're trying to get at here.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:01.480
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I'm looking at my roommate,
who has seen me not leave my room for days.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.610
That's my roommate.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.199
The interesting thing was that the second
book was actually the first book that I wrote

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.420
in 2009.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.540
And so, I wrote that book and it didn't sell
and I put it away.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.540
Gretchen read it.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.540
It didn't sell.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.540
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: And Alan Moss was
in it, right?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.540
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: No.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.540
[laughter]

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540
Again, Alan Moss was not in any books.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.620
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Just because he didn't
show up, we can do this.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.382
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I'm saving it until I get really
famous and then I'll write a book just about

00:11:26.382 --> 00:11:29.990
him, but I wanna have the audience built-in
so I can take advantage.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.990
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: That's fair.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.990
That's a good plan.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.260
So, you rewrote the book.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.260
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I rewrote.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So, what I initially did was--.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.420
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: "Scotsmen Prefer Blondes,"
is the working title.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: "Scotsmen Prefer Blondes."

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420
Yes.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.420
It's not just the working title.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.420
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: It will be the title.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.420
I don't really [inaudible] title.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.779
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I guess if you self-publish,
you can just make the.

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:45.779
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:46.779
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: titles.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:48.300
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Which is nice.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.300
Yeah.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.300
So, I rewrote the book.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.089
And it was a very painful process because
when I originally intended to self-publish,

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.610
I said, "Oh, this is great.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.810
I have two books that are done.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.279
I can get them out back-to-back."

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.470
I started advertising when they were coming
out back-to-back.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.440
And then I read it and I was like, "Oh, crap."

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.779
Because my writing style has changed a lot.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.050
I've learned a lot as a writer.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.740
I've gotten a lot, I think I've gotten better.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.060
We'll see.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.089
There were things that I legitimately saw
that I could've done better in the first book.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:22.779
And because I put it away and wrote the second
book to be the prequel, there were continuity

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:23.779
issues.

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:24.779
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Mmm.

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.920
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: So, I initially though it'll
take me three weeks to fix this.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.820
My roommate’s still laughing because that
was in October.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:37.060
And I think, looking through it, I probably
kept maybe five to eight percent of the first

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.060
version.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.060
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Wow.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.060
Just--.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.060
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I rewrote the entire thing.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060
Don't do that.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.060
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Since October.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.060
So you basically--.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.910
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: If there are any writers in
the room, just throw it away and do something

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.430
else 'cause it was really, really painful.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.089
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: But that's less than
six months.

00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:52.690
I mean, that's, you rewrote basically a whole
book.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.800
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's true.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800
But it was--.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: On the bright side.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
[laughter]

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.459
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's hard to see the bright
side 'cause I haven't slept, but no.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:00.459
It is good.

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:01.800
I think it was a good process to go through.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.880
I think I'm just worried that this is my process
because I go through these--.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.890
I've written two books, but word-wise, I've
really written four.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.060
And so, I need to figure out is this my process
and I'm just the kind of person who writes

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.070
a book and then looks at it and rewrites it?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.200
Or, can I figure out how to do it without
that pain.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.149
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I think my battery--.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:27.149
Oh, no.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:28.149
I'm OK.

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:32.199
If you look at, I don't know, Jonathan Franzen
or Jeffrey Eugenides, it takes them like,

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:34.300
nine or ten years between books.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:40.709
So, if you can write two books in a matter
of months, that may be a fair process.

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:43.980
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I feel like this maybe needs
to be a therapy session and you guys can just

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.980
like listen for a while we--.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.321
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I'm just like, I don't
think that's a bad thing.

00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:49.220
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I haven't had a one-on-one
with you in a long time.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.220
[laughter]

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.240
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, back to the--.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.720
So, let's talk about, well first of all, you
talked about your writing style has changed.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720
Why?

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720
What happened?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.390
Was it getting away from writing emails at
Google?

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.520
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Clara's blog actually really
helped me to find my writing style.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520
No.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.750
Actually, I think some of that's true.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.970
Like, I think, and I know I shouldn't just
keep pointing at people in the audience for

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:16.680
the sake of YouTube, but Heather, who managed
me several years ago, would get all over me

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.579
because my emails were like, this long.

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:23.330
And they always made sense and they were well-written,
but they were novels.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.250
They weren't bullet point things.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.420
And I think my writing style as I've seen
it has changed from--.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.740
That first book I wrote in fits and starts
from 2005 to 2008.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.889
Now, I think my writing is a lot crisper and
the sentences tend to be shorter.

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:41.640
I'm a little more focused on pacing than I
was.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.899
Like, they're not these long, flowery, I'm
in love with the language.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:49.829
Now, it's more--hopefully--I'm trying to get
more of the character across and I'm not just

00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:51.690
using pretty words that are big and formal.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.790
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Are these more character-driven
or plot-driven when you think about--?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.670
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I'd say they're more character-driven.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:02.060
And that was the big problem with the first
book was that I was so character-driven that

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.030
the feedback from the publishers who didn't
decide to buy it was that there wasn't enough

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.030
going on.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.149
Like, they were really fun characters and
they loved watching them banter with each

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:13.750
other, 'cause I do like to banter, but nothing
really happened.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.750
Like, they got married.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.750
Great.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.350
And that happens in a romance, but there needs
to be a little more "if they don't have any

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.589
conflict, why didn't they just get married
Day One?"

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.110
And maybe banter at the wedding and the book's
over.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.110
[laughter]

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.130
So, I needed a little more plot.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.130
[laughter]

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:33.519
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, crisper writing,
a little more plot, a little more action.

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:35.459
Let's talk about this particular genre.

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:37.870
Is this, how did you decide this is it for
you?

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.870
Or is this not?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.510
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I kind of fell into it.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.089
I don't know if it's, and I think everyone
who's worked with me knows I tend to get bored

00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:47.149
with stuff at some point.

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:50.279
So, I don't think that I'll write romance
for the rest of my life.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.120
I'll probably keep coming back to it, though.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.290
And I think the nice thing about romance is
that it's such a huge genre that I can choose

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.650
to do other things within it.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.440
I'm working on these historical romances,
but I've got this young adult project on the

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.829
side that's not historical at all, that does
have romantic elements.

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:08.339
And I think that it's a great place to work--.

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:10.910
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Are you gonna write
that under the same name, or new name?

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.610
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I haven't decided yet.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.800
I mean, the sad thing is I've sort of been--.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.860
Sara Ramsey sounds much more romantic, which
is why I went with it.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.259
Sara Wampler, less romantic, all the way at
the end of the alphabet.

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:25.860
Back when bookstores mattered, I was thinking
I didn't want to be the person on the last

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.860
shelf.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.040
I wanted to be closer to like, Nora Roberts
or Julia Quinn, who are big romance authors.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.750
Now, it doesn't matter as much because people
aren't walking into book stores and finding

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.839
those books.

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:37.290
But we'll see.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.290
Yeah.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.769
So, I don't know what name I'll write under.

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:43.920
And I don't know that I'll write romance forever,
but I think it's a good--.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.780
It's a great place to build an audience.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.830
Romance readers read a lot of books.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:54.509
So, the average romance reader probably reads,
I don't know, four to ten a month, which is

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:55.509
huge.

00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:56.509
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: What's up with that?

00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:57.509
[laughter]

00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:58.509
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: They like their romance.

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.089
And they tend to, but they also tend to read
outside the genre, too.

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:02.459
They don't necessarily just read romance.

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:04.560
They'll also read mystery or fantasy or sci-fi.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.560
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Do they write to you?

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560
Do you have fans?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560
I mean, what's up?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560
Are they--?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.620
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I've gotten a couple of fan
letters, which was really crazy.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.059
Yeah.

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:14.059
It's very odd.

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:15.110
If you write dear Sara at SaraRamsey.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.630
com, I will respond to you.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.630
Yeah.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.630
It's odd.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.140
And people, I see things starting to pop up
on blogs where they read the book and they're

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.339
giving a review.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.830
Goodreads is a really popular reader site
where people are starting to review the book.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.419
So, it's been, it was pretty exciting the
day that I finally got an email that wasn't

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:36.660
like my mom or somebody sitting in this room
saying that they read the book and they really

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.660
liked it.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.260
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, what, do they
give you any feedback?

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.390
Or is it just--?

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.910
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I didn't--

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.140
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Good one.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140
[laughs]

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.950
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: The people who emailed so far,
I know people who have gotten emails that

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.230
just rip them apart for being too steamy or
too something or getting their facts wrong

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.230
or whatever.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.400
And there was one Barnes and Noble review.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.429
You're not supposed to read the reviews as
an author.

00:17:58.429 --> 00:18:02.409
You're supposed to pretend that you're impervious
and that none of it affects you, but I read

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:03.409
every single one.

00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:04.409
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yeah, right.

00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:05.409
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: And I have a Google alert set
up.

00:18:05.409 --> 00:18:06.409
[laughter]

00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:07.409
And I don't wait for the Google alert.

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:09.909
I search on Google every day and just look
through all the pages.

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:10.909
[laughter]

00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:14.930
'Cause Google alert's like four to ten hours
behind, probably, which is not fast enough.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.930
[laughter]

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.030
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, we know how you're
spending your morning.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.030
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.030
Oh yes.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.030
The procrastination question.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.030
That's what I do.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.080
Yeah, but there was a--.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.100
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: You had one review
that said--.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.880
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: There was one review on Barnes
and Noble that they did not like that the

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.530
Duke was treated with disrespect.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.530
[laughter]

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.120
Which I found really interesting.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Were they British?

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120
I mean, what's that about?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.540
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I don't know.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.540
I don't think so.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.010
They said they'd read another book.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.010
They really liked it.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.419
But they didn't like the Duke being disrespected.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:45.770
So, if any of you care about Dukes, don't
buy the book.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.960
I'm not your target author.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.970
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, what about this
quote that's now made it into your bio?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.890
"True story, I had to turn the little overhead
air fan on while reading on the airplane.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.680
I was so flushed from reading the love scenes."

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.100
[teasing jeers from the audience]

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.490
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: That was another Barnes and
Noble review.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.840
It was like, the first one I got that wasn't
somebody I knew.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.890
And I was like, "Oh, awkward."

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.730
'Cause my mom called and was like, "Did you
see the review on Barnes and Noble?"

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.770
I was like, "Yes.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.950
I did.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.750
She did get flushed from reading the love
scenes.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.470
Had to turn on the little overhead fan."

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.670
I don't know.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.210
People, I can't control reviews.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.659
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Are they that steamy?

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.680
I mean, I'm gonna take my copy.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680
Gretchen's like, "Yes."

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680
[laughter]

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.000
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: They're steamy, but I would
say they don't dominate the book.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.210
Like, that's how I would put it.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.450
There's, and this is what romance at it's--.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.289
I'm not gonna say I'm romance at its best.

00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:41.370
But romance, when it's at its best, is, there
is a full story arc that goes through it and

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.620
the characters are the focus.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.039
But there are a few scenes where the sex is
part of their relationship.

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:52.150
And that, their character development and
their emotional arc shows through that, too.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.590
So, where someone like Georgette Heyer, first
of all, they usually didn't admit that they

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.700
loved each other until like, the last two
pages.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.480
And then when they did, they might kiss once
and then it's over.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.360
Which is good.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.419
And there's something to be said for that.

00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:09.400
But I think romance, always modern romances,
tend to show a couple's entire relationship

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.210
and doesn't just close the door when it's
time for them to go off and make babies.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.210
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So,--.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.620
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Or not make babies.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.620
Just, whatever.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:23.580
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, the genre is evolving
from when I read a couple of books, clearly.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.460
And what about this "Fifty Shades of Grey"
thing going on?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.480
Can we talk about this?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.909
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: "Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:31.950
So, how many of you have heard of "Fifty Shades
of Grey?"

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.950
[pause]

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:33.950
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yeah.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:34.950
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Wow.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.159
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: You need to hang with
some moms in the suburbs, which I do.

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.159
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:40.650
It is a suburban mom phenomenon, from what
I've heard.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.850
So "Fifty Shades of Grey" is a trilogy that
originally started as Twilight fanfiction.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:51.220
So, this woman wrote this story of Bella and
Edward--hate Bella.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.220
Don't tell anybody.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.220
[laughter]

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I think you just told
some people.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.220
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: She's like--.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220
I think I did.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.220
She's useless.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.220
Anyway.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.220
I'm not, so I may not be the target audience.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: She seemed like a
vehicle for other people.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: She was.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.230
She had no real desires of her own.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.570
Anyway, I'm not going off on that.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:10.340
So, she wrote this fanfiction, but it had
a BDSM element, which those of you who worked

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.400
in AdWords Approval Bin know what that is.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
[laughter]

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.919
So, bondage, domination, sadism, masochism.

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:20.179
Or, domination, submission.

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.000
The D and S mean two different things.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.080
So, they have this--.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:29.310
"Fifty Shades of Grey" has Bella, who is now
named something else, I don't know, obviously

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:34.640
as a fairly like, vapid and useless girl,
but she ends up attracted to this guy who's

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.970
an extreme sexual dominant rather than being
a vampire.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.220
So, they're not vampires anymore.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220
He's now like dominant.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I don't get how it's
"Twilight."

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.800
First of all, I haven't even read it, but
as it was described to me by people who have,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.909
it didn't, the "Twilight" fanfiction thing
got lost in translation.

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:52.470
It's just this particular author got inspired
by that.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.870
This is a British author.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.710
And then, wrote this book that's erotic suburban--.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.090
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.650
So, it's basically erotica.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.690
It's not really a romance.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.150
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Drama.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.150
I don't know.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.150
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I think "Twilight" was really
a romance.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.210
Like, "Twilight" was definitely a young adult
and it had romantic elements, but it's not

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.630
like, if you're thinking "Twilight" is a romance
novel, then you should read a romance novel.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.210
Or read "Twilight."

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.440
I wouldn't recommend that.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.440
[laughter]

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.260
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: But what I was getting
at is it seems like that is being treated

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.370
in a separate category.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.310
I don't know if it's because it's such a phenom,
but it's also being treated differently because

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:30.740
it has so many more digital downloads than
people buying any physical copies, which would

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.380
make sense if you understand the content of
the book.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.380
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.380
It's gigantic.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.380
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, what does it make
you--?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.409
I'm getting at this from a business perspective.

00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:40.789
I think the thing is moving because of this
particular book.

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:41.789
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:44.390
Well, I think, and I think that's something
that I was considering when I was writing

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:49.510
my books is that the online space especially,
romance readers went online really fast.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.970
Because if you're reading ten books a month,
having a Kindle makes sense, right?

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.190
Like, they're cheaper.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.220
You don't have hundreds of them stacked in
your house.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.529
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: You're not on the
airplane with the--.

00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:00.620
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: You're not on the airplane
with the cover.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.620
And so, erotica has actually grown tremendously
as a sub-genre of that because of the cover

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.620
issue.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.470
If you can sit there and read "Fifty Shades
of Grey" at your coffee shop, and people think

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.210
you're reading like Dickens, great, right?

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.390
You're in Menlo Park.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.770
You're sitting at Cafe Borrone.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.700
You're secretly reading erotica, which is
good.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.190
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Getting out the personal
fan.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.610
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.610
[laughter]

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.289
I should get personalized misters that you
can--.

00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:26.390
That would be a good giveaway.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.390
Yeah.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.020
So, I think, but I think romance as a whole
is moving steamier, too, because that's where

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.480
publishers see the market being.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.040
Publishers are making the most money off erotica.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.179
And so, they keep, one of the rejections we
got for the first book was it wasn't sexy

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:42.179
enough.

00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:46.880
Even though, this woman had to turn on her
overhead fan to read a couple of the scenes,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880
right?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
[laughter]

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880
That's the direction they're moving.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.220
But I think the good thing, too, about eBooks
is that there's a market for erotica, but

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.350
a book that may have a little bit less of
an erotic focus can still find the audience.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:02.620
There's definitely people out there, myself
included, who are looking for more of the--

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.780
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Like story characters.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.549
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: not sweet historic, but more
of a historical influence rather than just

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:08.549
sexy times.

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:09.549
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Well, let's talk about
the historical.

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:13.140
How do you know what you're talking about
there in the "Muses of Mayfair?"

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.780
Are you researching the period?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.110
Are you just watching a lot of PBS?

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.930
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: So, I read a ton of these.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.179
I read a ton of these before I got started.

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:24.630
So, I have read for, romance novels.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.111
My first one was when I was 12.

00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:27.111
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Wait.

00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:28.111
Just hold on a second.

00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:29.470
So, you're getting your historical knowledge
from other romance novels?

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.470
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.610
So, that was the point I was going to get
to was that there's now this whole phenomenon

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.230
called "Romancelandia," which, if you read
any of these romance blogs, which I'm sure

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:44.169
none of you do, it's this problem where people
have read so many of these--and Georgette

00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:48.450
Heyer was the founder of this genre--they've
read so much of her that--not Clara.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.790
Georgette Heyer.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.179
They think that that's the fact.

00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:58.280
And so, you read these books where everyone
goes and they waltz all throughout the book.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.770
They do these waltzes.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.250
The waltz wasn't actually in London until
1815.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.450
And even then, it was still really scandalous.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.090
And a lot of people didn't dance it until
the 1820's or 1830's.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.850
But if you don't put it in the book, you run
the risk of--.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.680
Basically you're damned if you do and damned
if you don't because the people who have read

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.760
a lot of romance, but haven't studied the
period, think that you made a mistake if you

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.669
do something that violates the "Romancelandia"
rules.

00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:27.490
But then, if you put them waltzing in like,
1805, you'll get emails from people who are

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.500
like, "The waltz wasn't in London and you
treated it with disrespect."

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.500
[laughter]

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.529
So, I think that's a huge issue.

00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:34.529
It's figuring out--.

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:36.900
And a lot of times, I just try to avoid some
of those issues.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.900
I just don't have them.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.900
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: But how do you know?

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.450
You clearly researched outside of Romancelandia.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.510
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.510
So, I'm part of--.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, Romancelandia
has its own version of our history is what

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220
I'm taking.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: OK.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.220
So, you have done your own research.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.220
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I have done my own research.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.130
There's an online special interest chapter
of Romance Writers of America, if any of you

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:59.530
are interested, called "The Beau Monde," that
is just Regency historical writers.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.600
They are a wealth of information.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.360
You can send them emails and say, "What kind
of boots would this guy be wearing in April

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.480
of this year?"

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.480
They know.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.590
I have costume books.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.100
I have a membership to Stanford Library, which
is awesome 'cause they have basically every

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.110
historical book you would ever need to research.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.670
When I was writing this first book, where
the heroine is an actress, I was researching

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.510
what plays were being put on that year, what
theaters were popular, who the actresses were,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.100
that kind of thing, which was really fun.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.299
And since I minored in History in college,
it's a chance for me to be a huge dork and

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:36.190
read all these books and write it off on my
taxes.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.190
[laughter]

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.190
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I see.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.190
I see the angle there.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.190
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Don't tell the IRS either.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.190
This video may not need to go up.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.289
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, that's included
in--.

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:45.680
[whispers] Should not have said IRS.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.279
So, that is included in your writing process.

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:49.279
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:50.279
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Before or after you
write something.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:52.120
Do you go back and add historical details?

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.450
Or, you research before?

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.990
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I'd say I do some of it before,
figuring out, if there's a main plot point,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:03.840
like could this woman do this at this time,
I need to know before--as I've discovered--before

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.770
I have to rewrite the entire book.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:11.951
But little things like, what kind of coat
would he wear to this event or who a person

00:27:11.951 --> 00:27:15.850
might be at this party, I just make a note
in my manuscript and keep going.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.570
Because if I sat down and researched everything
as it came up, I would just go down rabbit

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.080
holes and research for days.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.090
Wikipedia is probably, other than Twitter,
the place where I spend the most of my time

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.090
procrastinating.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.090
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: All right.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.090
So, we're gonna go to some questions.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.970
So start thinking of your questions.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.830
I'll anticipate one, which is maybe there's
some aspiring novelists or even non-fiction

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.909
writers here in the room.

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:41.730
What advice would you give to folks who are
wondering if they have dual or a second career

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.750
as a writer coming from where they're sitting
now?

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.460
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Make sure when you leave that
you're ready to leave, so you don't come crawling

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.110
back for your job, which is awkward.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.919
And then you say, "Actually, I don't want
it back."

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:52.919
Which is doubly awkward.

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:53.919
[laughter]

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:56.700
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Well, luckily, "Are
you sure you want it back?"

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.380
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.380
No.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.720
No, it was pretty obvious.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.960
Clara was very good.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.580
I think this is a very safe place to explore
your writing before you actually go off into

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.659
the world and try to write full-time.

00:28:10.659 --> 00:28:13.740
There's so much freedom to do your own thing.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.179
There's obviously benefits, which are incredibly
valuable--Diet Coke, all of that.

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:20.660
But I think just, I don't know.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.580
Taking that time to get through that first
manuscript first, I think is really valuable.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.360
I wrote that first manuscript and it won the
award and that was great.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.200
But looking at it now, I realize it really
wasn't ready to be published.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.220
And in my head, because I tend to do things
fairly well and tend to succeed at things

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.519
that I want to succeed at, not to talk myself
up too much, but I'm used to that level of

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:45.519
success.

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:47.000
It was really hard when it didn't sell.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.880
And I think going through that process, it
was good that I still had this job to fall

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.860
back on, 'cause if I hadn't--not just from
a money standpoint, but if I had been going

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.549
through that process of trying to sell the
first book, living alone in my cabin without

00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:02.559
being able to come into work every day and
think about something else for a few hours,

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:03.919
I probably would've just gone insane.

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:08.790
Like, it would've been incredibly difficult
emotionally to, if that was my only thing.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.620
So, I think getting to the point where you
feel comfortable that you're truly on that

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.230
path before leaving is really important.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.890
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Great.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.080
Any other, any questions?

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.809
Hi, Kerrie.

00:29:22.809 --> 00:29:26.250
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi, Sara.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.250
Congratulations.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:33.490
I wanted to ask about if you did any kind
of workshops or what kind of support network

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.990
you had as you were getting towards your publishing?

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.410
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.820
So, workshops, there are so many writing resources
out there.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.130
Romance is just a sub-piece of the broader
shadow writing community that exists.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.350
I think the Bay Area is fantastic for it.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.909
There are so many people here who want to
write.

00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:54.659
And so, the opportunities are pretty big.

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:56.340
The first things I did were--.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.630
Stanford has great continuing studies classes
in writing.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.799
None of them were romance, but it was still
really helpful to talk to other writers.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:07.220
I took an historical fiction class, which
was really great.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.559
I know there are other colleges in the area
that do that.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:12.309
I just was close to Stanford.

00:30:12.309 --> 00:30:16.480
And then, any genre that you're writing, with
the exception of literary fiction, 'cause

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.320
I think they don't like to band together 'cause
they're too snobby--I didn't say that--mystery,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.130
romance, sci-fi, all of those groups have
their own professional organizations and joining

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.130
that was huge.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.169
So, I joined Romance Writers of America.

00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:31.890
They have a conference every year.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.890
They put on events.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.290
I'm now part of a San Francisco chapter.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.570
I go to that once a month.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.570
They bring in speakers.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.309
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Are the people kind
of people you'd be friends with?

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:41.309
I mean, just--.

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:42.870
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: They are.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.870
[laughter]

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.560
This is being taped, so they are actually.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560
[Clara laughs]

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.419
It is a really strange and different world
that I was used to at Google.

00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:54.670
The first one I went to was in 2008.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:59.610
And I think I was probably in the 99th percentile
in terms of youth.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.241
I'm still really young compared to a lot of
romance novelists.

00:31:02.241 --> 00:31:07.980
I think a lot, especially in romance, it tends
to be more women who have raised their kids

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.010
at least up to toddler age and they're now
starting to do something else.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:17.370
So, the average age is probably like 48 to
50.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.250
I can't tell.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.220
But yeah.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.250
I mean, with any group, a lot of writers are
pretty introverted, so some of the conversations

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.289
can be awkward.

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:29.059
But there are a lot of people who are--.

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:33.250
I think romance novelists get stereotyped
as the woman who sits alone with her cat,

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.970
which is why I don't have a cat.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.970
[laughter]

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.130
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Good call.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.420
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.820
But if you go to these conferences, a lot
of the people are actually lawyers or doctors

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.200
or came from someplace like Google.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.779
Basically any broad spectrum of society you
took, you can find a romance novelist in any

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:50.779
one of those.

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.159
Which is the same readers.

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:57.409
I know there are secret romance novel readers
in this room who may not talk about it, but

00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:58.409
they're out there.

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:01.909
If you would connect and start reading more,
that would be wonderful.

00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:05.179
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, did you go to
any writer space?

00:32:05.179 --> 00:32:06.179
I don't know.

00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:09.610
My brother has like, he goes to this place
in New York and they all sit there and write.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.330
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: No.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.000
I don't go to writer's space, but I found
it's really helpful for me if I'm in the last,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.279
if I have been next to last draft of the book
to go away for a few days and just read it

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:23.789
and then figure out how to edit it.

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:25.880
So, about a month ago, I went to Santa Cruz
for four days.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.610
I just got a rental on the beach and read
the book and made my notes and figured it

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.809
out and had my little panic attack and then
was good.

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:35.429
Which Santa Cruz isn't that far away.

00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:38.380
If someone wanted to have dinner with me,
I could've easily driven here, but it was

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.540
just far enough to say, "No, I'm in my writing
space.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.540
I need these few days."

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.760
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Other questions?

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760
All right.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760
Go ahead.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.360
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Comment and a question.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.929
I'm currently tracking my Scottish history,
so if you need any stories I'm happy to provide.

00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.040
I don't know how scandalous they might be.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.179
So, back to the self-publishing piece.

00:32:58.179 --> 00:33:02.460
I'm curious if, when I think about the music
industry and how hard that is for some people

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.010
to break into it.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.700
And they've had phenomenons like Justin Beiber
making it through YouTube.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.010
Is there the equivalent for a writer?

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.010
I know you have a blog.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.900
I follow you on Twitter.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.900
How do you get no--.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.900
Yes.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.900
Fantastic.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.110
I always know what you're up to.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.710
How does a writer get recognized in the--?

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.570
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It is really tough.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:27.639
And I think because there isn't that sort
of instant gratification of video on YouTube,

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:29.799
although I'm thinking about ways to use YouTube.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:34.289
My roommate works at YouTube, so I get talk
in my ear about it.

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:35.289
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Yeah.

00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:36.289
That'll be interesting.

00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:37.289
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:39.309
But I think there are reader communities out
there.

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:40.820
I mentioned Goodreads.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.070
There's Shellfari, which is affiliated with
Amazon.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.289
There's different places where readers congregate.

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:51.240
Goodreads, I have a love/hate relationship
with because they, some of the communities

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.840
can be pretty caustic and tend to review--.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.529
Their reviews tend to skew more negative than
necessarily you would see on like, Barnes

00:33:59.529 --> 00:34:00.830
and Noble dot com.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.660
So, each place has their own weird community
and just getting used to that is important.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.250
But I think, I don't know.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.820
The most helpful thing for me right now has
been connecting with other authors who are

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.670
more established than me, who then do things
like re-tweet my tweets, or, which I know

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.870
sounds ridiculous, but re-tweet my tweets
or share my book on Facebook because they

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.090
already have more of an audience than I do.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.710
And so, building that network, I think, through
other authors.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:25.710
I don't know.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.170
Or maybe we just tell ourselves that 'cause
everyone I interact with on Twitter is either

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.870
someone I know or another author.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:35.750
I don't know that I have more than a dozen
peer readers on Twitter.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.750
But it's our version.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.550
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: How many followers
do you have?

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.590
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: 750 ish.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.460
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: It's gotta be more
than 12 readers.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.430
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: I don't know.

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.330
And there's some spambots, too.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.330
But--.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.330
[laughter]

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.040
I don't block them 'cause it's really gratifying
to see the numbers like 750.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.290
But Twitter's like our version of like, a
water cooler.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.120
Like, if you sit in your house and you're
all alone, it's our version of being able

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.590
to like, get up together and gossip.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.810
So, I don't know, Amy.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.040
There's not a really great way to become a
phenomenon.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.300
I don't know how "Fifty Shades" took off.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.300
I'm baffled.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.300
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: We should find out.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.300
All right.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.300
We had another question?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300
Still have--?

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yes.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.500
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Really.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.500
Is this about Twitter?

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.600
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Oh, I have a question.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:25.020
So, how important is that, so when you are
writing the characters that you told us about

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:33.170
and everything, are they real or realistic,
or are they more like fiction that you made

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.510
it up?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:40.560
How important it is to you that you match
real thought patterns like, across humanity?

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.670
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.140
That's a good question.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:48.690
I think I will fully admit that I'm sure it's
hard for me to have a realistic guy's thought

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.690
pattern.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:50.690
And I try.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.690
But I'm not a guy.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:52.690
I don't think like a guy.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.650
I think I think more like a guy than I should
sometimes.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.220
But with romance, at least the kind that I
write, it tends to alternate points of view

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.220
between--.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.040
Probably two-thirds of it is in the heroine’s
point of view--her thought pattern, her perception

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040
of what's going on.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.300
About a third of it's in the guy's point of
view.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.730
I'll fully admit I probably don't get the
guy right all the time.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:17.590
I do try to, now it's gonna sound like I'm
stereotyping, but I tend to be a little more

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.250
directive in the way he talks.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.470
Women tend to speak more with a question at
the end of the voice and making excuses for

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.400
their behavior, apologizing excessively.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.600
And guys don't do that as much.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.180
So, I've thought a little about what I've
seen in the work place, what I've learned

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.580
from the trainings we've gone through where
we all do our different colors or our like,

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.000
E-N-T-J or P or whatever you are.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.560
And I think about that.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.700
I don't know if the exact speech pattern is
right.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.430
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: Do you write a back
story?

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.970
Like, a human, like this is a real person
kind of story even though it's not all in

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.970
the book?

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.080
Do you have it in your head or do you write
it or--?

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.880
I have stuff in my head that never makes it
in the book.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.930
Like, things that happened when they were
kids.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.680
Or, what they wanted to do.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.400
Things that happened off-stage that don't
get referenced.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.230
But for me, it makes them feel a little more
three-dimensional.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:12.880
And those little details, like could pop up
in future books, which is always fun.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.840
'Cause I do wanna have enough of a consistent
pattern for a character that I don't write

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.270
myself into a corner and then discover that
last book I said that he was an orphan and

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.070
now I really need him to have a mom.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.270
I need to have an idea of who he is.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:32.220
And then, if that person is solid enough,
I would never think, "He needs to have a mom,"

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.080
because within me, he's never had one.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.200
I don't know if that makes sense.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.410
It's, I don't know.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.230
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: No, I get it.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.230
I get it.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.510
It's like the story board.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.510
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Hi.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.030
I'm a long time writer and I've always had
a full-time career, job outside of that.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.690
And so, I'm curious, you talked about that
you created a personal metric for yourself

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.270
around words and that you obviously were happy
here.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.640
So, you felt like you needed to leave Google
to be in that space and writing.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:03.370
So, I'm just wondering if you could say a
little bit more about how it helped you, if

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:08.680
it helped you significantly leaving your full-time
career to go to your other full-time career

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.751
to write, in terms of, 'Cause I know you can't
just sit eight, nine, ten times a day and

00:38:13.751 --> 00:38:14.751
write.

00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:15.751
It doesn't, hours a day.

00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:16.751
It doesn't work like that.

00:38:16.751 --> 00:38:20.060
So, I'm curious about how did it help you?

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.060
Did it help you to really just be in that
space and be away in terms of your productivity

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.270
and meeting your goals?

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.270
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.650
It's an interesting question because a lot
of the writers I've talked to, when they leave

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.110
their full-time jobs, they still write just
as much as they did when they had a full-time

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.950
job, which is awkward because you're, "Oh,
I'm still writing five pages a day, but I

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.000
don't get paid anymore."

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.870
I wouldn't, I would say my productivity has
gone up some, but the time that I would've

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:50.450
spent on my job, I now spend marketing or
networking or building my business plans--just

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.500
working on soliciting cover art and things
like that.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:39:00.660
I wouldn't say my number of words per week
or month has increased substantially, but

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:06.200
I also like to, I would never shut the door,
I'm not asking for my job back, but I would

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:11.110
never shut the door on going back in a business
capacity, especially with publishing the way

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.110
it is.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.280
At some point, if I get bored with writing,
or I see an opportunity, I could see myself

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:23.250
either starting my own publishing, consulting
or going to one of these big eBook places,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:27.100
like Google if they actually sell a lot of
eBooks.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100
Yeah.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.110
So, I'm keeping those doors open.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.920
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: So, talk about the
cover art for a second.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.090
How did you get that?

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.520
Should we show the?

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.990
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah, the cover art was really
fun.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.580
So, no it's not me.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.790
My brother told me that they put my family's
very cute about this.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.490
When they got their first paperback copy,
they stopped the UPS man and made him wait

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.880
for when they opened the box.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.890
And then they gave him my bookmarks.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.170
So, that was nice.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.170
But yeah.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.620
They've apparently put these bookmarks all
over town and they're getting questions about

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.690
whether it's me.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.790
So, that's awkward.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.700
It's not me.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:07.620
But the cover art processes are now, because
so many people are moving to self-publish,

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.850
people like cover artists from the old publishing
houses or I hired a freelance editor, who

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.800
used to be an editor at Harlequin, they're
moving to do more of their own freelance stuff

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.370
'cause they can make more money and have more
reasonable hours than they could being a cog

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.630
in the wheel at a publishing house.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.630
So.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.780
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: A photo?

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.370
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah, it's a photo.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:30.030
So, if you go to hotdamndesigns.com, this
woman takes all this stock photography.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.260
And so, she has the costumes.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.640
She does all the, stages these things.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:40.430
You can get not just historical, but paranormal,
contemporary, all of that.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.510
And then, she designs the cover.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.630
So, I sent her, this is what my characters
are like.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.810
I like covers where you can't see the woman's
head.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.010
I don't know why.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.380
But actually, I do know why.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.050
I don't like seeing the person's face and
having that visual when I want to imagine.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.050
So, yeah.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.970
That was fun.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:02.430
Thank you for humoring me by raising your
hand.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.500
[laughter]

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.100
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: I really am.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.100
Especially 'cause I got a free copy.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Yeah.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100
So, Clara gets a free copy.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.540
Everyone else, it's 11.99.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.540
Sorry.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.450
But I take cash or credit card.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.110
And if are really excited about credit card,
I have the little square app, which I know

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.940
is not a Google thing, but it's amazing.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.340
It plugs into the iPad so you can just swipe
it.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.430
It's pretty cool.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.220
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: [inaudible] Oh.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.100
I think this is still not on.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.500
But anyway.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:39.070
Any final remarks or pieces of advice or plugs?

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.070
Marketing.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.070
This is like one of those talk shows.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.070
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Follow your dreams.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.070
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: And available, you
know?

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.070
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: It's available.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.140
It's available on Barnes and Noble, Amazon.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.230
The next one, which I just finished last night,
as I said you're lucky I'm here, will be out

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:57.790
March 29th, which is the huge advantage of
doing this myself, because if it were a traditional

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:01.590
publisher, I would mail it to them, they'd
respond in three months and say, "Great.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.590
Change this stuff."

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.350
It would probably be a year to 18 months before
it came out.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.620
So, next one's out.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.700
"Scotsmen Prefer Blondes."

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.580
Amy, I'll ask you later if that's true.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.580
[laughter]

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.580
OK.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.580
&gt;&gt;Clara Hughes-Johnson: All right.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.600
Well, thank you so much and congratulations.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600
[applause]

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:15.606
&gt;&gt;Sara Ramsey: Thanks for coming, everyone.
