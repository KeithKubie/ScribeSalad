00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.567
[music playing]

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.066
Hello my name is
Geoffrey Rush and I

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.800
play Albert Einstein the older.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.033
I was four when
Albert Einstein died.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:21.467
So everything I know about
him is more from the legend

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.967
that he became,
because he was almost

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:28.467
like a cult figure in a way.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:33.000
Einstein was a very complex
theoretical physicist.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
ALBERT EINSTEIN: What is time?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.834
It is the key to
understanding relativity.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.100
It is also the reason
my hair is going grey.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.633
[laughter]

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.533
GEOFFREY RUSH: I've enjoyed it
enormously because you think

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.734
you're going to have to go in
act being a genius every day

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.734
on set.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:53.033
Action!

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.867
GEOFFREY RUSH: But there's
a kind of clown-like naivety

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.400
in his persona.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.100
(LAUGHING) Cut.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.367
That's a cut!

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.266
GEOFFREY RUSH: Rumor has it that
he was regarded as being quite

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.233
dopey, and they
thought he might have

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.767
been a bit of a slow
starter in his childhood.

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:12.934
ALBERT EINSTEIN: To
truly grasp the idea

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:17.233
of time we must take a step
back and ask what is light?

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.400
GEOFFREY RUSH: But
his daydreaming ended

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.533
up being his greatest strength.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:30.333
This is one of the great parts.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.300
And the scale of it is so big.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.367
[streetcar bell]

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.800
GEOFFREY RUSH: This is the
first National Geographic

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.834
fully scripted drama series.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:45.467
So Ron was very keen to take
the elements of Einstein's life,

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:49.567
let it not fall into the
trap of being a bio pic.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.333
RON HOWARD: Keep it
personal like that, Michael.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.100
I really like how
conversational that was.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.500
OK.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.967
GEOFFREY RUSH: Because the
story of Einstein's life

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:59.633
sandwiched between a major
golden breakthrough period

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:02.333
of science from the
late 19th century

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.734
through the devastation
of two world wars.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.734
Hey, Einstein!

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:09.500
Stop!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.867
May I have your autograph, sir?

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.400
GEOFFREY RUSH: He wanted that
to have real dramatic kick.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.033
Bruno!

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.567
Back here now.

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:22.133
When I grow up, I want to
be a scientist just like you.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:23.200
Germany ho!

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.233
Cut!

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:29.633
Cutting.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.834
GEOFFREY RUSH: The whole
series is about an epoch.

00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:38.000
And a [inaudible] on a level
that will be exciting rather

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.767
than rigid and formal.
