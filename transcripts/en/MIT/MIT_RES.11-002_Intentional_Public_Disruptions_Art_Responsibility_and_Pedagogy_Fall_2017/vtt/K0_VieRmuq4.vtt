STEPHEN CARPENTER: We think
about conventional activities

00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:05.252
to expand thematic and
conceptual exploration.

00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:07.710
So the traditional ways or
maybe more conventional ways you

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.720
might think about art education
or learning studio practices--

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.256
sculpture, working with
clay, working with wood,

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:20.882
working with paint,
or drawing practices--

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.090
those are fine if we want
to develop a set of skills.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.080
But what about thinking about
concepts and themes and issues?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.140
Well, we might as well get
started and do some of that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.640
now.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.530
So we're going to make
a little transition.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.890
I'm going to set up a
still life over here.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.140
And we're going to
do some drawing.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.130
The range of ways
in which people draw

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.574
is perfectly acceptable,
perfectly acceptable.

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:48.490
So if you're concerned
that it's tough for you

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.630
to draw a conclusion or
draw a straight line,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.321
don't be concerned by that.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.070
It's the process that
we're interested in,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.230
not the visual representation.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.510
We have the three
chairs in the center.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.710
With your marker, I would
like you to draw what you see.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.170
And you can draw it
on this paper the way

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.320
that it makes sense to you.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.695
If you want to draw it as
large as you can, that's great.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:15.487
If you want to draw it
smaller, that's fine.

00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:17.570
But here's our still life,
these three chairs kind

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.400
of sitting in relationship
to each other.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.060
We'll take about 8 to
10 minutes to draw this.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.350
Oh, but there's one thing.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.390
This is my-- there's
one more thing.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.800
You'll draw for 30
seconds at a time.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.070
And then after your
30 seconds is over,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.367
I have another task for you.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.450
So you're going to draw
the chairs for 30 seconds.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.720
And then I'll give you another
step to continue your drawing.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.800
Got it?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.160
All right, so when
you're ready, set, go.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.470
It's not a race.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.850
Just go, time starts now.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.690
Try to put in as much
information as you can.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.180
All right, stop, stop.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.040
Now, what you're
going to have to do

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.170
is slide back in your chair,
slide back a little bit.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.020
And then stand up.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.700
And then move one
drawing to the left.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.410
So now you're standing in front
of somebody else's drawing,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.450
to the left.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.154
OK, stand in front of the next
person-- the next drawing.

00:02:36.154 --> 00:02:37.320
All right, now keep drawing.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.630
Continue the drawing that
this other person has started.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.130
Go.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.720
All right, stop, move.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.280
Did you learn
something about drawing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.995
from other people's drawings?

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:03.120
Like as you went through
and you sat down and said,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.034
oh, there were some things
happening at this new drawing

00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:07.950
that you're sitting at
that you hadn't thought

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.500
about that maybe you
tried to replicate

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.965
or you tried to avoid.

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:13.590
LARRY SUSSKIND: My
attitude toward what

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.550
I was doing changed rather
markedly in different parts

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.480
of the circle.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.450
I started out with trying to
take the assignment literally.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.350
And I assumed that
somebody else, that's

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.800
their representation of that.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.850
It's my job to add--

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.520
to complete their
representation.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.640
But about over
there, by that time,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.210
since I couldn't figure
their representation

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.450
relative to what I was looking
at, that I finally decided,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.940
well, I could contribute
something to this,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.340
but it isn't their
representation

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.170
that I'm helping to finish.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.070
I'll just focus on adding
solid surfaces to ones

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.540
that don't have solid surfaces.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.400
Because clearly, there
are some solid surfaces.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.220
So as I moved along, I was
making sure I added something.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.300
But I wasn't any longer
trying to complete

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.880
what the message was
that the previous person,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.970
that the original
person had left.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.120
By the time I got
over there, I realized

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.350
people were adding things
that were extraneous

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.910
to the literal assignment.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.660
And I said, oh, I see.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.080
This is just a picture now.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.050
This is no longer a still life
that has to be represented.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.290
Now there's people just
making it into a picture.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.250
They're putting things that
are not there in the picture.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.180
Oh, OK, that's fun.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.730
And so now I realized that
the assignment had changed

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.920
or my conception of it
had radically altered.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.710
And then by the time
I get back to my own,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.360
I recognized nothing.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.970
And I said, OK,
well I can barely

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.550
find what I started with.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.190
There's layers of what
other people produced.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.790
But my sense of what
I was doing changed

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.050
as there were changes
imposed by many people

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.580
before me getting
to the picture.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.560
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Man,
that's such a wonderful--

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.880
I want to transition to
the next drawing task.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.850
But inherent in what
everyone was saying

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.010
could be applied to other
tasks, other subjects.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.920
Imagine if we didn't have
a set of chairs there.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.770
Imagine if there
was a person there.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.930
Instead of drawing
with lines, we

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.960
were drawing with the questions
we were asking this person who

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.990
we had never met before.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.032
Or maybe we had passed
this person numerous times

00:05:38.032 --> 00:05:39.656
like we pass these
chairs all the time.

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.160
These chairs are
just in the room.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.880
But now we put them
in a space of inquiry.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.290
Oh, now I have to look.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.267
I've learned some things about
these chairs in this circle

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:50.850
that I didn't realize
about the chairs

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.740
before, just by the
act of mark-making.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.350
So what if we put
a person there,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.355
someone we may pass on
the street everyday.

00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:00.480
And we just, we stopped--
instead of drawing them--

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.813
we could draw them-- what if
we asked questions of them?

00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:04.680
What if each mark
that we're making

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.744
is some form of a question
that we're asking?

00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:09.660
How much more would we
learn about that person

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.230
just by talking to them?

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.844
The idea here will be that
we'll still use the chairs.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:19.010
And we're still building
on this premise of learning

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.650
from each other's drawings.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.030
But now instead of us
all drawing and moving

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.090
to each other's
drawings, one person

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.060
will take the drawing
implement and you

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.602
will be connected, fixed
to that drawing implement.

00:06:36.602 --> 00:06:38.060
In other words,
you're an extension

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.680
of that drawing implement.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.500
And your partner
has to find a way

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.730
to use you, the drawing
implement, to draw the chairs.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.230
All you're doing,
drawing implement,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.220
is holding the marker.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.010
The person who is your
partner is using--

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.110
they might have to hold
your hand or your elbow

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.269
or your shoulder or
shoulder and wrist.

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.310
That's why I'm saying need
to have the permission

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.330
of the other person.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.450
And then they're going
to draw what they see,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.690
they're going to draw
the chairs using you

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.219
and the marker as the implement.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.260
And you're the implement.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.542
You're kind of in it to see
how this drawing turns out.

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:26.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:40.580
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
So some of the words

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.780
I'm hearing that, to me, work
in tandem with this notion

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.930
of themes or concepts--

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.460
responsibility, influence,
some notion of liberation

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.110
in what you said over
there, right, cooperation.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.870
So these are themes
or concepts that

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.810
might be important to many
disciplines or many discourses.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.882
But one way we might get to
it could be doing an activity

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:08.840
like this, even though
this activity could also

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.190
be taken very literally in
terms of formal approaches

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.450
to revise and enhance
the way people render,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.587
through drawings, who
render realistically

00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:21.920
the objects that they're seeing.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.378
But there's also
a conceptual piece

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.780
here that we don't want to miss.
