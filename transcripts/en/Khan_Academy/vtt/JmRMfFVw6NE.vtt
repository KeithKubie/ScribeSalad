00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:01.375
- [Paige] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:02.208
Hello, David.

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:04.887
- [David] Hello. . . Paige.

00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:06.692
- [Paige] (chuckles) So
in this video we're gonna

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:10.243
talk about a piece of
punctuation called the ellipsis

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.737
or ellipses in the plural
form as we have here.

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.277
So, what is an ellipsis?

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:18.531
- [David] So an ellipsis
is a punctuation mark

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.482
that is actually made up of
three periods with spaces

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:24.315
in between them, boop, boop, boop.

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:27.954
And it has two main uses.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:28.787
- [Paige] Okay.

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:30.174
- [David] Use number one.

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.511
It indicates a pause in speech.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.982
So like when you said, "Hello, David."

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:37.831
And I said, "Hello...Paige."

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.765
- [Paige] Right, so
that ellipsis in the middle

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.614
shows that you're pausing
when you're speaking.

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:44.553
So like, there's a lot of
reasons why you might pause

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:47.355
in your speech, you might
be hesitating or thinking

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.371
or just whatever the case may be,

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.345
you can use an ellipsis to
show that you're pausing.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.181
- [David] Right.

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.673
Uh, and usage number two for the ellipsis

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:58.348
is that it shows that a portion

00:00:58.348 --> 00:01:02.006
of quoted material has been taken out.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.790
- [Paige] Why would you
take some of a quote out?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.957
- [David] So we have here, Paige,

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:09.648
you have chosen a quote from
the renowned wizard and orator,

00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:11.795
Albus Dumbledore, and he says, "Words are,

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:13.895
"in my not so humble opinion,

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:17.460
"our most inexhaustible source of magic."

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.782
If you wanted, you could
kind of take out that aside,

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:22.988
that, "in my not so humble opinion."

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:24.191
- [Paige] Yeah, I
don't have a lot of space

00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:26.343
on this screen, so I don't
want to write that whole thing.

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:27.176
- [David] Mm-hmm.

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:28.044
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:32.439
So I can say, "Words are,
ellipsis, our most inexhaustible

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.579
"source of magic."

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.397
- [David] So, okay, so
Paige, I have a question.

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:36.230
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.245
- [David] Why do we even need this?

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.948
Why can't you just say,
"Words are our most

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:40.271
"inexhaustible source of magic"?

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.346
- [Paige] That's a great question.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:45.454
So, if I quote someone and
I just sort of willy-nilly

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:47.973
take words out without
indicating that I've taken

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:50.775
some information out of the quote,

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:52.953
I can make it seem like someone said

00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:53.804
something totally different

00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:55.171
to what they actually said, right?

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:59.338
It can be so easy to misconstrue
someone's actual words.

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.488
So this shows that this isn't exactly

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:05.746
what Albus Dumbledore
said, but it's the point

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:08.298
that I want to get across with my quote.

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:09.468
Does that make sense?

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:10.301
- [David] I think so.

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.191
So you're saying that there's kind of like

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:14.848
an ethics question here.

00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:15.681
- [Paige] Right.

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.495
- [David] So how do we
like accurately reproduce

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:22.705
someone's words without
misrepresenting them?

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:23.594
- [Paige] Totally.

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:25.383
- [David] So it shows
that you have messed

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:26.216
with it somehow.

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:27.729
- [Paige] Yes, exactly.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.641
- [David] But that
you're calling out the fact

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:33.175
that you've cut out pieces, so
that people don't necessarily

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.331
get the wrong idea.

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.556
- [Paige] Totally.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.901
- [David] But I think
there is kind of an art

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.537
to using ellipsis, right?

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:39.406
- [Paige] Yeah, I agree.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:42.279
You know, you could use it in, you know,

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.723
technically wherever you want
when you're quoting someone

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.263
if you wanna take something out.

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:50.245
But if you use it over and
over or in the wrong places,

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:54.219
you can still misrepresent
what a person was saying.

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.079
- [David] If you wanted to,

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.820
you could render that sentence,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.998
"Words are my opinion."

00:02:58.998 --> 00:02:59.831
- [Paige] Yeah.
- [David] Right.

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.133
- [David] If you didn't use ellipses,

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.399
you could just render
that however you please,

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.966
because those were words that were said

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:08.547
approximately in that order, right.

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:10.004
- [Paige] Yeah, without ellipses or--

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:11.054
- [David] Without ellipses.

00:03:11.054 --> 00:03:11.887
- [Paige] Okay.

00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:12.720
- [David] You know,
you could just be like,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.999
"Words are my opinion."

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:14.942
- [Paige] Mm-hmm.

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.034
- [David] And that's
not, that's not exactly

00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:19.008
what Dumbledore said, right?

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:20.059
- [Paige] Right.

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.055
No, that's not what he was saying at all.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:23.142
Those are some of the words he said,

00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:25.521
but that's not the idea he
was trying to get across.

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.881
- [David] So you
have this responsibility

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.955
with ellipses to do the right thing,

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:35.122
to really represent the way
that somebody speaks accurately.

00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:37.629
- [Paige] Yeah, definitely.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.607
- [David] Let's talk about the end

00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:42.314
of someone's sentence
and I want to indicate

00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:45.165
that at some point after I cut
off the end of the sentence,

00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:46.665
the sentence ends.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.439
Where do I put that extra period

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.971
or do I need an extra period?

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:51.804
- [Paige] Right.

00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:52.780
Okay.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.901
- [David] So let's say our
sentence is something like,

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.687
"I like cheese, although I'm more partial

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:00.920
"to a Wensleydale than I am
to a cheddar or a Stilton."

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.328
You might want to just be able
to write that sentence as,

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:06.578
I like cheese, ellipsis, period, right?

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.902
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:10.742
- [David] So we're still including

00:04:10.742 --> 00:04:12.942
the terminal punctuation in this sentence.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:13.775
- [Paige] Yes.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.034
- [David] To show that
it ends after the ellipsis.

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:17.008
- [Paige] Right, yeah.

00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:20.539
That ellipsis there is showing
that stuff has been removed,

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.042
right, from this quote,
and then that final period

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:25.507
is showing that it's
the end of a sentence,

00:04:25.507 --> 00:04:28.026
just like it normally does.

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:30.210
'Cause like, the ellipsis, you know,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.605
looks just like three periods,
but it is it's own thing,

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:37.128
and doesn't stand in as a period.

00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:38.205
- [David] So that's what,

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:39.332
so if we didn't have that final period,

00:04:39.332 --> 00:04:41.347
it would just sort of look
like you were trailing off

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:42.287
like there was a pause.

00:04:42.287 --> 00:04:44.173
I like cheese.

00:04:44.173 --> 00:04:47.443
- [Paige] Yeah, there would
be no end to that sentence.

00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:48.276
- [David] Right.

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:49.121
But those are the two functions

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.715
of ellipses, then, is that it
indicates a pause in speech,

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:53.548
like, "Hello...Paige."

00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:56.413
Or it shows that a
portion of quoted material

00:04:56.413 --> 00:04:57.760
has been taken out.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.593
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:00.306
- [David] Like, "Words are...our most

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:02.914
"inexhaustible source of magic."

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:04.447
- [Paige] That was a
great Dumbledore impression.

00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:06.446
- [Albus] Thank you, Paige.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:07.531
You can learn anything.

00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:08.515
- [Paige] Okay.

00:05:08.515 --> 00:05:09.671
- [Albus] Albus out.

00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:11.306
- [Paige] Paige out.
- [David] Cool.
