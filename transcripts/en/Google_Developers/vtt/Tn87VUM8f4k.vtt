JEFFREY POSNICK: Hi, I'm Jeffrey
Posnick from the

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.760
YouTube API Developer
Relations team.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.280
And I'm here with Dean Jansen
from Amara joining us live

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.430
from New York City.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.710
And via Hangout,
we have Arthur.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.960
Hello, Arthur.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.210
ARTHUR DEBERT: [NO AUDIO].

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.080
JEFFREY POSNICK: And I'm
having a little trouble

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.930
hearing you, Arthur.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.450
Hopefully, we'll
be able to work

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.940
through those sound issues.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.140
Arthur's joining us
from Sao Paulo.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.360
And he is the developer working
on Amara, and Dean is

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.220
one of the co-founders?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.150
DEAN JANSEN: Yep.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.490
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.800
OK, so we're talking
about Amara.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.770
What is Amara, and how
did you get started?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.530
What's some background?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.520
DEAN JANSEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.840
So I guess we've been working on
this piece of software for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.220
about three years now.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.150
Amara is essentially, we think,
the easiest way to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.810
create captions from scratch
or subtitles for videos.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.920
And the beginnings of the
project really were around why

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.090
is it so difficult to
create captions?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.850
A lot of the software, while
freely available, can be

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.980
difficult to use.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.674
You've got to download it,
install it on your

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:13.660
computer, et cetera.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.620
And so that's kind of what
the birth of Amara was.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.540
And we figured, this is
the internet age.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570
Why isn't there an easy way to
do this, and why isn't it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.720
collaborative?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.730
And so the whole idea behind
Amara was make it so that you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.200
can take a video from anywhere
on the web, whether it's on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.200
YouTube or Vimeo or hosted on
your own server, plug it into

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000
our platform, and then be up
and running in seconds, and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.310
also be able to engage friends
strangers, volunteers, anyone

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.500
on the internet to help you
then translate video.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.060
So a big part of it also is
around collaboration and--

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.550
JEFFREY POSNICK: And
crowdsourcing.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.990
DEAN JANSEN: --the Wikipedia
style model, yeah.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.100
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.830
And to be sure I have my
terminology right, is there a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.570
difference between captions
and subtitles?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.030
I don't want to use one
instead of the other.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.050
DEAN JANSEN: That's a really
good question.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.389
And we had a lot of learning to
do also, and I think we're

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.320
still learning a lot.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.930
But captions in the US are
oftentimes thought of as

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.390
something for someone who is
deaf or hard of hearing that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.320
will have the audio
information.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.570
So if a door slams shut, then
you'd get the door slamming.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.200
Whereas subtitle is, I think,
a bit more of a generic term

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.590
and is often used when you're
talking about translated

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.770
captions, possibly without
the audio information.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.980
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.140
Thank you for clearing
that up.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.910
So all right, you talked about
the different video platforms

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.670
that you integrate with.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.340
And obviously, YouTube shows,
we're very interested in

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.820
hearing about your YouTube
integration.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.790
But can we talk a little bit
more about who the target

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.250
audience is for your platform?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.950
Who do you find using Amara?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.330
DEAN JANSEN: Yeah.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.940
That's another good question.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.890
Well, of course, I think it's
also worth mentioning, we're a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.160
nonprofit organization.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.490
It's an open source project.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.380
And the reason behind what we're
doing really is to make

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.590
it so that video can become
accessible, and not just in

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.990
the sense of accessibility for
deaf and hard of hearing, but

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.190
also accessibility in a broader
linguistics sense of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.980
translating videos into
as many different

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.950
languages as possible.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.280
And so the audiences
are varied.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.660
Someone who's going to be a
consumer of captions or

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.180
subtitles is going to be anyone
who doesn't speak a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.190
language, which I'm sure there
are a couple of languages you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.680
don't speak.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.285
I certainly don't speak
a lot of languages.

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:39.800
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.320
DEAN JANSEN: And then we have a
pretty exciting community of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.460
both deaf and hard-of-hearing
people, but also we have a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.640
caption team that's purely
around requests from deaf and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.020
hard-of-hearing users.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.220
So they can basically
say, hey, I'm

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.240
interested in this video.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.300
I'd like to have it captioned,
and then people caption it.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.850
So there's a lot of different
viewing audiences.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.290
And then, of course, I think
anyone who's making video is

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.160
potentially a creator
audience.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.630
JEFFREY POSNICK:
Sure, totally.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.690
And obviously, it goes
without saying,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.649
YouTube is a global platform.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.910
I'm an English-language
speaker.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.070
But I often find myself
interested in content that's

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.070
not in English, and it's a real
barrier to me if there

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.710
doesn't happen to be
subtitles for that.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.110
So I certainly appreciate it
even as someone who's an

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.980
English speaker.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.350
So we've talked a little bit
about content creators.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.190
And let's say I'm not somebody
who would initially think of,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.350
hey, I should be providing
captions or

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.530
subtitles for my videos.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.490
What's the value proposition?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.970
Why should I, as a content
creator, really go about

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.360
captioning as much
as possible?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.020
DEAN JANSEN: Well, I think if
you strip out a single reason,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.990
then it can be easy
to brush past it.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.440
But when you think about the
broad application of having

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.800
same-language subtitles or
captions as well as translated

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.500
captions, you start out with
having a basis of better SEO.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.830
So your video is captioned.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.750
You've got more metadata around
the video content.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.620
It's easier for people
to find.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.200
It's easier for you to
go back and refer to.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.300
Well, when we're talking about
drones in that new sequence?

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.870
And we can get right there.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.120
On top of that, you have the
accessibility reasons for deaf

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.160
and hard-of-hearing folks.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.730
On top of that, you start to
potentially, if you're

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.440
engaging volunteers, you're
bringing in folks and engaging

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.550
them in a real and meaningful
way in your content.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.750
JEFFREY POSNICK: It seems like
a nice way of building

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.600
community around a video.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.490
DEAN JANSEN: Well, the TED Talks
Conference, they have a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.110
humongous volunteer community
of translators.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.120
I think there are 14,000 or
15,000 of them right now.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.560
They're all volunteers.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.910
And TED thinks of that community
as a hugely valuable

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.930
part of the overall TED
Conference organization.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.410
And they speak very highly of
the people who are putting in

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.560
their time and effort and a lot
of hard work to translate

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.140
the 12,000 or 15,000 TED Talks
and 20,000 TEDx Talks.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.710
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.410
And this is obviously one of
the more scalable ways of

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.035
doing that.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:30.250
That's a very daunting process
if you have one person.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.370
One person who happens to know
dozens of languages sitting at

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.450
a keyboard, that doesn't
scale very well.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.140
DEAN JANSEN: Right.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.760
So to get back to your question,
even someone who's a

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.720
content creator that has a
popular YouTube channel, let's

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.760
say, and may not know a lot of
reason to do this, if they

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.880
want to get a more global
audience, this is a way not

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.320
only to get your video subtitled
into different

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.290
languages, but also to have
ambassadors, potentially, in

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.220
these other languages.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.420
JEFFREY POSNICK: And this is the
sort of thing that's hard

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.820
to come up with really strong
metrics about, but certainly,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.440
I would assume that this
increases viewer engagement.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.430
It just really raises the
potential audience from just

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.950
everybody who can speak one
language to a much wider

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.780
global audience.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.980
DEAN JANSEN: This was your
trickiest question, I think.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.710
This is something that because
we're not the primary viewing

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.270
platform, you can come on to
Amara and watch videos in

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.150
different languages.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.510
But I think a lot of times,
people are syncing subtitles

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.410
back to YouTube, let's say.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.370
Or on ted.com, they're
hosting them.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.110
They're caching them
on their side.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.170
So a lot of the metrics we
actually don't have access to.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.450
We would love it if YouTube
started making some of this

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.650
stuff more public or even a
broad summary of here's what

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.010
we're seeing across
lots of videos.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.110
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.610
That's something I'd like to
follow up with internally,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.320
definitely.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.490
OK, so hopefully, folks are
aware of the power of captions

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.030
and why going about
captioning your

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.310
videos is pretty important.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.780
Could we actually dive into
a demo of how you

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.350
could Amara to do that?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.450
DEAN JANSEN: Absolutely.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.100
JEFFREY POSNICK: And I
might have to unlock

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.010
for you right now.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.480
But if we could pull up the
demo, I think we should be

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.170
good to go.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.030
DEAN JANSEN: All right.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.220
So I chose a nice and
non-copyrighted Creative

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.409
Commons video for us to
experiment with here.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.690
I'll jump over to the
Amara website.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.930
I guess right now, there's
a lot going on right now.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.240
But the most important thing
is there's a box right here

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.060
that says put a URL in
and click subtitle.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.600
So I'll go back to
my YouTube tab.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.710
I'm going to copy the
URL here of this

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.900
Creative Commons video.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.670
I'll paste it in, press

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.920
Subtitle, and fingers crossed--

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.510
bingo.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.600
OK, so this is an Amara
video page.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.640
This is the home base
for the video.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.770
And if you're wanting to invite
other folks in, this is

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.860
where you'd point them.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.340
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.450
So again, you can put any
video ID you want here.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.160
It's not necessarily something
in your own channel.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.920
It might be something that
you're just interested in, and

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.370
you want to engage
the community in

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.636
crowdsourcing the captions.

00:09:27.636 --> 00:09:28.310
DEAN JANSEN: Yes.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.560
Right.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.280
And so, yeah.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.940
And it can be pretty much
any kind of video, any

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.170
format that you want.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.070
So I'm just going to click on
the Subtitle Me button, and

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.890
then it's going to ask what
language is the video in.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.920
It's in English.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.900
We're going to subtitle
into English.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.350
And there's a little tutorial
video that I won't go into.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.950
Let's see.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.860
So this is the interface.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.720
This is pretty much all
HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.390
Of course, the video itself,
I think, may be Flash.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.170
But it doesn't require Flash.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.990
Any modern browser
will use this.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.670
I think we're in Chrome
right now.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.460
JEFFREY POSNICK: Hopefully,
you're using the iframe player

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.210
API, which will use the HTML5
video for playback.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.650
I haven't double-checked that,
but we can talk about the

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.240
technical aspects with Arthur.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.640
DEAN JANSEN: We'll ask Arthur,
and we've got a new editor

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.350
that we're just about to
start rolling out.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.160
So I think that if we're not
doing it now, we will be.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.740
OK, so to start with, I think
for anyone who's done

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.360
captioning, this may or
may not look familiar.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.990
But the process is oftentimes
set in point, type out what

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.930
you hear, set out point, next.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.610
And so we've broken it into
three distinct steps that

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.320
break that apart.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.170
The first is just transcribing
everything you hear and laying

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.550
it all out.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.390
So I'll do one line here just to
show how it works, and then

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.350
I've got another window that
has more work done.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.148
So I just play here.

00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:12.865
I'll rewind.

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:13.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.480
-What it mean to be
human if we don't

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.076
have a shared culture?

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:17.860
What is a shared--

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.070
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.180
JEFFREY POSNICK: So
being a speedy

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.060
typer is pretty important.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.010
DEAN JANSEN: So the interesting
thing is that

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.120
we've got a thing here called
magical autopause that's one

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.270
of the modes.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.320
So as long as I'm typing, I'm
doing a little bit of movement

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.520
of the cursor to
keep it typing.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.720
When I let off, it's going to
say, OK, you're done typing

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.750
and unpause the video
for me and rewind it

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.380
just a little bit.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.370
JEFFREY POSNICK: Oh, that's
quite nice, OK.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.745
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:41.120
-A shared culture--

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.680
DEAN JANSEN: There it goes.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.480
And so I can just keep typing,
and it will watch the

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.600
background of my typing and
pause and unpause for me.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.290
JEFFREY POSNICK: That's really
nice integration.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.630
DEAN JANSEN: So once I've got
everything typed out in this

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.520
other window--

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.360
oh, let's see if this
is going to work.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.455
Successfully resumed editing--
yeah, all right.

00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:02.640
Nice.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.020
So in this one, I've typed
out a bunch of lines.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.950
You just go through.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.140
You type out all of
the dialogue.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.540
Then you go to the
second step.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.290
I've got another
helpful video.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.340
The second step is modeled
after a video game.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.720
It's like Dance Dance
Revolution.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.170
And the idea is that you're just
tapping every time you

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.500
hear what's the dialogue, and
it's going to time the lines

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.150
out for you.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.740
So I'll just do a couple
of these lines so we

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.610
can see how it works.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.190
And I don't know if you're
able to hear it.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.900
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.060
-What does it mean to
be human if we don't

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.370
have a shared culture?

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.545
And what does a shared culture
mean if you can't share it?

00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:43.000
-So it's only in the last 100 or
150 years or so that we've

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.880
started tightly restricting how
that culture gets used.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.390
-The internet enabled
an infrastructure--

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.870
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.610
DEAN JANSEN: So I'll
pause that.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.660
And the last thing that I think
is worth showing quickly

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.660
is the final step, which is the
review where you're able

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.660
to just go in and fine
tune things.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.940
So if I've timed something late,
it's like a nonlinear

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.560
video editor.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.210
I'm able to hop in, change
everything up.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.190
If I made a mistake, I
can easily edit it,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.900
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.090
It's pretty intuitive and a
simple interface, and we've

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.570
seen people as young as eight
years old use this thing.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.950
JEFFREY POSNICK:
That's awesome.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.540
I've obviously interacted with
YouTube captions before, and

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.125
I've done some API
integration.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:26.830
And I know it as having to
provide this data file that

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.630
has time codes and everything
like that.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.910
So having this whole automated
process for generating that

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.250
seems like a huge win.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.335
So that's very cool.

00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:36.650
And it's really nice
integration, too.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.110
DEAN JANSEN: And once you're
done, you submit your work.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.070
You can then download
the SRT files.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.720
We provide a lot of
different formats.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.950
You can upload those onto
YouTube, and now we'll talk,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.470
I'm sure, about the YouTube
syncing integration as well.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.140
JEFFREY POSNICK: Excellent.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.660
Cool.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.780
So thanks so much for
showing that demo.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.130
Hopefully, we have Arthur via
Hangout, and I'd like to say

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.670
hello again.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.124
Arthur, can you hear me OK?

00:14:03.124 --> 00:14:04.990
ARTHUR DEBERT: Yeah,
perfectly fine.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.660
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.940
So I can hear you now, so that
is definitely a lot better

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.870
than earlier on the show.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.470
So thanks so much
for joining us.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.970
I know that you're one of the
developers who was working on

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.030
this open source project.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.430
I guess, first of all, it's
interesting that this is all

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.645
an open source project.

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:23.890
So if folks are interested in
looking at some or all of the

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.040
code, how would they go
about doing that?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.140
ARTHUR DEBERT: It's on GitHub.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.160
It's
github.com/pculture/unisubs.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.480
I'll paste the link
on the chat.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.730
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, and we'll
add that to this video

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.521
description also, maybe
do a nice annotation.

00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:44.940
Or maybe it will show up in the
captions for this video.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.870
This definitely is a video that
we should get captioned.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.210
Cool.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.710
So, OK.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.590
I saw a really wide range
of different YouTube API

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.690
integrations there, Arthur.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.800
So can you talk a little bit
more about which are the APIs

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.500
you are using?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.050
ARTHUR DEBERT: Yeah.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.070
We use YouTube API in a bunch
of places, actually.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:09.910
So when you're adding videos
to Amara, basically our

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.590
servers are using Version 2
of the API, which is the

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.950
Atom-based one, to gather
data about that video.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.110
Everything from is this
video private?

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.390
Can we view it?

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.890
Then metadata, the title,
description, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.330
and stuff like that.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.530
So that's how we register that
video on our website.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.010
As soon as you add the video, we
pull every caption that the

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.630
video has on YouTube already.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.100
Not the auto-created ones,
but the ones that are

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.770
user-generated on YouTube.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.665
JEFFREY POSNICK: And that's part
of the standard v2 API

00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:50.700
that anybody could do for
pulling the captions.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.386
ARTHUR DEBERT: Exactly.

00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:54.820
It's the part of the captions
API which is just standard, so

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.130
we pull those in.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.150
Whatever you have already on
your video on YouTube, it's

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.660
going to be there on Amara.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.140
So it's nice because if any
subtitling work has been done

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.785
on YouTube, once you add it to
Amara, the work isn't lost.

00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:11.960
It's already there.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:18.360
So that's using the regular
API, captions API,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.210
to bring them in.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.050
That's pretty much
on the back end.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.860
When you are using our tool
to subtitle the video--

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.590
or we also allow you to embed
the video anywhere else-- on a

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.180
website, on a blog, just
like [INAUDIBLE]--

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.390
we are obviously interfacing
heavily with

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.820
the JavaScript API.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.340
JEFFREY POSNICK: The
Player APIs.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.400
ARTHUR DEBERT: The
Player APIs.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.140
JEFFREY POSNICK: Are
you actually

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.420
using the iframe player?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.640
Do you know if you're using
that or the older--

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.710
ARTHUR DEBERT: The iframe
player is in beta.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.640
We are now using, I think, the
iframe player only on Android,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.580
because we'd just rather
not use Flash.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.440
It depends.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.790
We are slowly moving to
the iframe player.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.770
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.580
We're out of the experimental
mode for the iframe player

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.270
now, which we were in for an
extended period of time.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.050
So at this point, it's
definitely what I'd recommend

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.900
using for both desktop
web-based

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.640
interfaces and also on mobile.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.230
So you can talk a
look at that.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.700
ARTHUR DEBERT: And there is just
another use of the Player

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.060
API that's interesting that
we're doing is that you can

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.060
embed the video plus the Amara
widget on your website.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.560
Sometimes, let's say you already
have a blog with

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.820
dozens of YouTube videos, and
you don't want to go back to

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.910
your blog and change all the
embed codes to our embed code.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.625
You can use something we
call the widgetizer.

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.260
It's just one JavaScript
you insert.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.287
And as soon as we load, we are
going to look at the page to

00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:50.210
see if there's any
YouTube video.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.860
And you hook up into the already
embedded YouTube video

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.670
and load our widget
together with it.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:02.030
So it can attach to an already
playing YouTube video.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.360
JEFFREY POSNICK: And that
widget will display the

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.390
captions out of bound?

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.640
ARTHUR DEBERT: Yeah.
it's going to show

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.890
those captions anyway.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.050
JEFFREY POSNICK: Very cool.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.080
So in terms of programming
languages, there's obviously a

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.220
bunch of JavaScript on the
Player side of things.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.145
What language are you using to
interface with the Data API?

00:18:26.145 --> 00:18:29.350
ARTHUR DEBERT: At the back
end, we are using Python.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.240
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.470
I know that using Python with
our older Data API is a bit of

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.870
a challenge in some regards,
so thanks for

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.900
bearing with us there.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.600
At this portion of the show, I
would normally tell people,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.140
hey, maybe you should check
out our newer Version

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.300
3 of the Data API.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.470
Unfortunately, one of the things
that we have not yet

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.840
managed to port over to Version
3 the Data API is

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.430
support for the captions.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.050
So that is something that very
legitimately still requires

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.090
use of our older Data API.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.230
But I'm certainly hopeful, at
least, it will be added to

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.230
Version 3 before too
much longer.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.540
So stay tuned for that.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.670
We make announcements about that
sort of thing on our blog

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:21.320
and Google+ feed and
that sort of place.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.090
So any general feedback that you
have about the development

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.110
process, any gotchas that you
want to point out to other

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.520
developers who might either be
looking at your code and

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.430
trying to learn from it or
trying to do similar things

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.660
themselves?

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.670
ARTHUR DEBERT: Well, I think
the Data API, the older

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.120
versions were a bit
hard to work with.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.350
They were a bit for both.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.476
They are not very Pythonic,
I think.

00:19:47.476 --> 00:19:50.990
In general, within the Python
ecosystem, they are a bit off

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.180
place there.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.145
But in general, it works.

00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:57.490
You just need to be careful.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.340
It's reasonably documented,
and things are pretty

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.040
predictable.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.390
I think at the scale we
work, we sometimes--

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.090
API quotas and smaller things
that once you get a bit big,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.060
they start to be a concern.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.490
But in general, everything
has been pretty smooth.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.480
The only thing I would say,
depending if you are doing

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.900
deep captions integration,
YouTube uses foreign language

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.990
codes PCP-47, which is
the same standard

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.210
that XMl:lang uses.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.580
And while it's a very
good standard,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.770
it's also a bit complex.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.860
So if you're doing a lot of
back and forth between

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.650
subtitles, you just might want
to watch out for that because

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.990
the way the standard does,
locator-specific and just

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.330
language definitions
is a bit wonky.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.164
It's something to be wary of.

00:20:51.164 --> 00:20:51.990
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.324
That's definitely very good
feedback to be aware of.

00:20:56.324 --> 00:20:58.250
Cool.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.850
At this point, I actually wanted
to quickly check to see

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.990
whether we had any questions
on Google Moderator for

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.465
anybody who might we
watching this show.

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:10.840
I'm going to pull that
up real quick.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.170
And OK, so there are a couple
that might be a little off

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:25.800
topic, but there is one here
from Sparkyish saying,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.430
"Awesome stuff.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.880
Obviously, this setup is
for on-demand videos.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.690
Any plans to tackle live video
streaming with a similar setup

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.100
and speed demon typists?"

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.980
We're broadcasting right
now as part of

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.820
YouTube live platform.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.460
Have you been in any discussions
with anybody on

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.290
our end about YouTube lives or
other types of streams and

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.010
captioning there?

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.340
DEAN JANSEN: Have not
yet, but I think

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.680
that's an exciting idea.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.740
It certainly has come up before
and is something that

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.700
we'd love to explore.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.550
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely,
yeah.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:59.390
And I don't think we are ready
to yet on the YouTube Live

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.420
platform necessarily, but
there's always the ability to

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.820
have captions that are out of
bound from the video and that

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.270
sort of thing.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.480
So, yeah, definitely a very
interesting topic.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.210
OK, so thanks so much for taking
time to go into the

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.990
system, Arthur.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.430
I'm sorry I cut you a little
bit off there.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.960
Hopefully, you got through all
the topics that you wanted to

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.910
cover on the technical
side of things.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.670
And thanks so much, Dean, for
joining us in person and

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.580
talking about Amara.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.900
We will make sure that this
video is captioned.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.400
DEAN JANSEN: Sounds good.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.590
JEFFREY POSNICK: We could
go through the whole

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.380
Amara system as well.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.680
DEAN JANSEN: Great.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.970
Yeah, we can try and get it
translated in the couple

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.930
different languages.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.180
JEFFREY POSNICK: Awesome.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.210
Very cool.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.410
One last thing, we plug at the
end of most of our shows that

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.520
Google Developer Relations,
which is the team that I'm on,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.480
is hiring, as always.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.630
So if you're interested in doing
the same sort of things

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.740
that I'm doing, going on camera
and helping developers

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.230
and chatting with people doing
cool API integrations,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.930
checkout
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.700
So that's it for this week.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.370
Join us next week for
our upcoming show.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.424
Cheers, everybody.

00:23:14.424 --> 00:23:15.292
ARTHUR DEBERT: Thank you, guys.

00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:16.160
Later.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.410
DEAN JANSEN: Thanks.
