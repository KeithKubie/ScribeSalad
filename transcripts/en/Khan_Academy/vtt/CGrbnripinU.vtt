00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
SAL: This is Sal, and I'm
still at Stanford Medical

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.824
School with Dr. Connolly.

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:05.990
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Sal, we're
going to continue going.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.510
You going to get one
unit of credit for today.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.450
SAL: Excellent.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.932
My mother would be proud.

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:13.140
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So what
we're going to look at today

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.200
is a colon polyp.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.810
We had said before
polyp is something

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.740
that's going to
stick up like this.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.470
SAL: So in that last video
we saw, it was not a polyp.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.896
That was like an irritated
part of the bowel?

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:25.830
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.980
It was very low lying.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.560
It was--

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.080
SAL: Let me get
you the pen here.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.280
We've got it all tangled up.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.946
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: It
was really just kind

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:33.820
of a patch of
irritant right there.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.320
SAL: I see.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So we've
got a bigger piece now.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.270
SAL: I see.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.010
That's why it just looks--
everything is more--

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.950
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So you can see
the glands look tiny in here.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.740
SAL: So roughly that last slide,
how big would it be on this?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.860
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: It would
be about a piece like that.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.780
To be fair, it
probably was what was

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810
underlying this area right here.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.941
SAL: I see.

00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:53.440
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
And then it grew on

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.975
to be something more than that.

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.500
SAL: It wasn't this exact one.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.260
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: No, it wasn't.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.290
SAL: It could grow on to be
something like this polyp.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.820
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: It
could grow into this.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.130
So this is something where
when we have a colon resection,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.210
if there's a cancer,
often there's a polyp.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.710
SAL: Right.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.410
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: There's
an area of that patch

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.642
like we saw with hyperplasia.

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:10.350
SAL: Not necessarily
where the cancer is?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840
It's in that same
section of colon.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.756
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:14.910
We find that people, if
they have colon cancer,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.522
often they have lots of
other pre-cancer lesions.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:19.230
And you can see--

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.729
SAL: I see.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.010
Their bowels are just going
through a lot of trauma.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.260
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Some of
it's familial susceptibility,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.530
but a lot of it is that they are
showing a propensity to this.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't know if it's from
environmental exposures

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.520
or what.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.100
SAL: I see.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.220
And just to remind myself
on what we're doing here,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.120
so you cut out a
bit of colon-- you

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.070
can kind of view it as
a tube-- because there

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.210
was some cancer there.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.610
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Right.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.985
SAL: And then this thing might
be some other polyp that's

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:44.810
sitting in that same
section you cut out.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.080
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.980
SAL: And maybe that
second slide we

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.710
saw with the irritation, that
could be like right there.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.100
I see.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.558
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
As matter of fact,

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:54.210
it's important that you
normally wouldn't see this slide

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.250
in a patient, because almost
all polyps, the colonoscopist

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.540
is coming in.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.504
And they remove it
through the colonoscope.

00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:05.920
SAL: I see, because they don't
know whether it's cancerous

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.250
or not.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.870
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
They'll remove it,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.328
but you wouldn't
see the full wall.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.137
So right out here--
I mean, that's

00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:11.720
all the way through
the wall and which

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.051
you've got muscle up here.

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:14.550
SAL: I see

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.800
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: That's the
muscular part of the wall.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.260
And so this is, really,
kind of going down

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.200
to a full piece of the wall.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.800
SAL: I see.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.779
Wow.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.570
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
this is a larger piece,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.660
and this is in order
to show the polyp

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.804
in its natural environment.

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:30.220
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.850
going to begin looking
at the polyp here.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.560
And so we'll first
start way out here,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.641
which is to go back again
to the normal architecture.

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:42.140
SAL: Right.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.230
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So we had said
there are supposed to be tubes.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.844
Luckily, this one,
it's cut right

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:47.010
down the middle of the tube.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.370
So you can see how big the
hole is supposed to be.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.340
And so this is normal
architecture there.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.520
And then if I just
go out a little bit

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.590
and I'm just going
to come along,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.795
you can see that you
have an area here

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:01.580
in which there was
a bit of irritation.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.450
So it's thrown up a little
bit like we saw before,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.100
but the real trouble is
this thing sticking out.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.600
SAL: Right.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.530
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
And we wonder what

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.150
is that thing sticking out.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.290
And so for the
medical students, we

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.270
try to tell them to think like
the way the pathologist would

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.136
be, that you first need to look
at the overall architecture.

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:21.510
This is an abnormal
architecture.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.790
SAL: Yes.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.022
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
You don't usually

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:23.590
have bumps sticking out.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.302
Then the next thing
you're going to do--

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:27.010
SAL: In 3D it would
look like a mushroom?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.600
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.975
So it would look
like a mushroom.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.800
Actually, they tend to have
foldings on the top of them,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.986
so a little more like
cauliflower, because they

00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:35.390
tend to be cauliflower colored.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.770
SAL: I see.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.080
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So then
when you look here--

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.160
SAL: That color, too?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.410
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.868
They don't have
much color to them.

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:43.920
In fact, the colonoscopist,
when they look at a polyp,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.200
can kind of tell if
there's a chance of cancer,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.544
because they begin having
weird blood vessel samples.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:50.960
SAL: And just to be clear,
they're not this purplish color

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.120
that we're seeing on this slide.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.940
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: No.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.650
SAL: This is color added.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
Thin section and we

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.691
had to put the-- it would
be colorless otherwise,

00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:58.280
so we had to put a stain on it.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.340
SAL: Right, right.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.140
Makes sense.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.880
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So now
what I'm going to do

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.622
is I'm going to
draw the area where

00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:02.830
I'm going to do a comparison.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.920
See this thingamabob here?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.320
SAL: Yeah.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.540
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
You're going too--

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.290
SAL: Look at that.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.331
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So now--

00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:07.460
SAL: Miracles of science.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.376
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:09.780
SAL: Technology.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.820
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
So these are cells

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.580
which are relatively normal.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.630
These are cells
which are abnormal.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.079
And when we look them, a
pathologist immediately

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.700
says these look angry.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.779
SAL: They do.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.860
I would say that, too.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.790
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: And
so when you look-- so

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.050
what's angry about
them is, first of all,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.540
they're not committed
to behaving.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.510
Proper behavior over here.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.490
Nuclei belong at the bottom.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.540
Things that you're supposed
to do for your job,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.221
J-O-B, are at the top.

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:37.720
SAL: Yes.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.886
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: And so
when you look at these guys,

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:42.320
it's like, where's your job?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.990
And so a few of them
are making mucin,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.606
but these ones have nuclei of
different sizes and shapes.

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:48.106
SAL: Yeah.

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:48.460
And they're all just--

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.220
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: They're
just doing their own thing.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.380
SAL: They're not
even doing mucin.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.350
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
No, some make mucin,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.490
but a lot of them all
they're doing is growing.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.180
And so usually there's
a playoff between that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.150
if you're committed
to your specific job--

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.820
and we call it differentiation.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.570
SAL: Right, right.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.195
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
if you're committed

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:04.940
to your differentiation,
you tend

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.250
not to have as much
propensity to grow.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.742
And if you tend
to grow a lot, you

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:10.200
tend not to do the
differentiation.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.310
And so this is
largely that you have

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.280
this sort of chaos
of nuclei, less

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.350
commitment to the
normal structures.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.300
And you're not
producing as much.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.640
And so what this, this
is now called dysplasia.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.532
SAL: Dysplasia.

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:26.490
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: D-Y-S.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.820
SAL: Right, plasia
in the wrong thing.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.530
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
it's the wrong growth.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.670
And so that's what
we're saying is

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.430
we don't like the
looks of these ones,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.310
and so these individual cells
look dysplastic and they grow.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.730
So then to tell
whether it's cancer,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.150
cancer means in this
organ that you've

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.560
grown across this
line in the sand.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.340
SAL: So let me-- so
literally if you've

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.390
crossed this boundary
right over here, cancer?

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.348
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Right.

00:05:51.348 --> 00:05:53.490
SAL: So even if I'm
in the polyp up here

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.787
and I'm controlling
uncontrollably cancer cells

00:05:55.787 --> 00:05:57.620
and it's mutated and
it's not killing itself

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.340
the way it's supposed
to, you still

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.217
would not call it
officially cancer?

00:06:01.217 --> 00:06:02.050
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: No.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.700
So what happens is that there's
a middle term where it's

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.180
a cancer still in
the usual place,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.000
and that's carcinoma in situ.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.699
SAL: I see.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.240
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
carcinoma in situ

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.530
means it's not an
invasive cancer.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.590
And therefore, most people would
not really call it a cancer.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.890
It's just so wild
looking up here,

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.470
you know that it
would do that if it

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.321
was given any chance or time.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:27.820
SAL: I see.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.320
So what we're saying
is if something

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.239
was out here, carcinoma
in situ, that eventually

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:35.530
it probably would make its way.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.446
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.000
It just looks so
committed to growth

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.164
and so aggressive and so
little differentiation

00:06:41.164 --> 00:06:42.580
that you know if
you gave it time,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.620
you'd worry that it would grow.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.270
SAL: Makes sense.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.811
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
with here though,

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.230
this is dysplasia, where
it's very upsetting

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.130
that it's growing so fast.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.880
But what's important about this
is in hyperplasia, if you took

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.880
away the stimulus or irritant,
it would go back to normal.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.611
This will not.

00:06:57.611 --> 00:06:58.110
SAL: I see.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.970
Like we said, if
there's some irritant

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.412
unless we do--
like a week later,

00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:03.870
we had a couple weeks later
that hyperplasia would go away.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.350
Dysplasia is here to stay.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.599
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.334
And so the key word
we use is autonomous.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:09.000
SAL: Autonomous.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.843
It's independent.

00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:11.343
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
It's just whatever.

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:12.990
So it will grow no matter what.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.950
It doesn't care about clues
from neighboring cells.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.830
It doesn't need
something driving it.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.650
So what you have then
is this is growing.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.380
And if it's growing and it's
all by itself and growing,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.420
it's then called a neoplasia.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.420
So that's our last plasia.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.995
SAL: So neoplasia
showing dysplasia--

00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:31.870
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yep.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.800
So dysplasia just is
more of when you go in

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.112
to look at these
guys, these features--

00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:37.612
SAL: Oh.

00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:38.903
It's like a particular feature.

00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:41.095
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: These
cells aren't growing right.

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:42.720
SAL: So that's an
example of dysplasia.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.100
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Right.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.300
That's dysplasia.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.145
And then overall, this
lump is a new growth.

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:49.020
SAL: New growth, neo.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.478
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
It's a new plasia,

00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:53.730
and we you reserve it in the
medical field for meaning it's

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.540
growing on its own.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.915
SAL: And how do
we know it's new?

00:07:55.915 --> 00:07:58.750
Because as you said, it sticks
around like the hyperplasia.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.820
So how do we know this
wasn't around for a year?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.361
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
Oh, it probably was.

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:04.619
So I think it actually
came from an area here.

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.410
And the thinking would
be that you probably

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.817
had irritants or hyperplasia.

00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:09.900
It would continue to grow.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.555
Cells divide.

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:14.000
Cells divide too much, and then
one of them made a mistake.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.400
And so then it clicked on
something where it would say,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.550
you know what, from now on I'm
not listening to any clues.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.110
SAL: And then all of its
descendants were crazy, too.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.360
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.447
So then it would then
have a real mean streak,

00:08:26.447 --> 00:08:28.030
and so then they
would grow from here.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.915
So this is an area
where you can see--

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:31.623
SAL: I see that pattern
in my own family.

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:33.190
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.230
So then here, these
are more normal glands.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.780
But even these,
that's dysplasia.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.600
So these are growing,
and they do not

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.240
have a good pattern of growth.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.500
And overall, this
lump is a neoplasia.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.900
SAL: I see.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.780
So when we say new, it's kind
of newer than the other tissue.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.696
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.270
We don't really
mean so much the new

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.720
for-- meaning that's new
as much as its own thing.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.040
New kid on the block.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.220
SAL: OK.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.860
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So
this is the neoplasia.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.570
So this one here is a polyp.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.980
It has features of
dysplasia, but we

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.780
would say we see no cancer.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.150
SAL: How would you know that?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.760
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: And so--

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.210
SAL: Right, because it never
crossed a boundary line.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.751
DOCTOR CONNOLLY:
And there's a reason

00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:19.490
why the boundary is important,
is that if you look here,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.970
these are all the surface cells.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.610
Down here, these
are the vessels that

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.090
go to the rest of the body.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.690
These are blood vessels.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.071
These ones are
called lymphatics,

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:31.570
and what lymphatics
are is they just

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.180
take the clear
fluid around there.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.190
SAL: So these right here are
the lymphatics, the clear fluid.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.240
Fluid can go back and
forth between blood vessels

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.710
and the lymph system?

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.626
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.760
Usually what happens
is that blood comes

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.050
in an artery like this, goes on
down to these little vessels.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.470
And then a little bit
of the clear parts of it

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.150
will kind of leak out into it.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.441
SAL: The red blood cells are
too big, kind of leak out.

00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.380
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.555
So then the lymph is the
clear stuff that comes out.

00:09:58.555 --> 00:09:59.930
And then this is
how it gets back

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.180
to the rest of your body are
through these lymphatics,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.920
so you can see you do not
want neoplastic cells in the--

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.729
SAL: Right, because
once they're in there,

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:09.270
they can get to any
part of the body.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.680
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Go anyplace.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.240
And then guess what.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.824
Set up shop.

00:10:10.824 --> 00:10:11.740
New kids on the block.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.810
They just do what they want.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.560
SAL: Mis-mis-stas.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.514
I can't say the word.

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:15.680
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: Metastasis.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.210
So metastasis would be if
it gets into these things,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.085
it can get out of
the colon in a hurry.

00:10:21.085 --> 00:10:22.585
SAL: Go anywhere
in the body, right.

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.860
DOCTOR CONNOLLY: So this is
one where it is not cancer,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.520
and it has not
invaded these areas

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.160
where it gets the
rest of the body.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.710
SAL: Fascinating.
