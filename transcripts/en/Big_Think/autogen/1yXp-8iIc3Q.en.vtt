technology transform education is that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
technology transform education is that
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.900
technology transform education is that
were able to utilize people in a way now

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
were able to utilize people in a way now
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.360
were able to utilize people in a way now
that's bringing the outside world into

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370
that's bringing the outside world into
 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490
that's bringing the outside world into
the classroom that maybe before it was a

person had to physically go there and do
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.300
person had to physically go there and do
something and you know they only had the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
something and you know they only had the
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609
something and you know they only had the
capacity to do that once now we're able

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
capacity to do that once now we're able
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.970
capacity to do that once now we're able
to stream people in and and bring them

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
to stream people in and and bring them
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.050

out petition in and we're looking at

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
out petition in and we're looking at

out petition in and we're looking at
behavior change technology allows us to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
behavior change technology allows us to
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759
behavior change technology allows us to
have that repetition that's necessary

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
have that repetition that's necessary
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.259
have that repetition that's necessary
for behavior change so I think that's to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
for behavior change so I think that's to
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.260
for behavior change so I think that's to
me that's the the biggest thing that we

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
me that's the the biggest thing that we
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.229
me that's the the biggest thing that we
believe classroom champions is that

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239
believe classroom champions is that
 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.850

technology is enabling us to cause
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560
technology is enabling us to cause
behavior change by bringing repetition

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
behavior change by bringing repetition
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.830

these athletes every month they're able

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
these athletes every month they're able
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960
these athletes every month they're able
to focus on a different video lesson and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
to focus on a different video lesson and
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550
to focus on a different video lesson and
send these to the classrooms that we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
send these to the classrooms that we
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380
send these to the classrooms that we
adopt for them and they actually form

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
adopt for them and they actually form
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.670

because the kids are able to send videos

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
because the kids are able to send videos
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240
because the kids are able to send videos
back so when they do that they're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
back so when they do that they're
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.890
back so when they do that they're
actually sending it to somebody who is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
actually sending it to somebody who is
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.740
actually sending it to somebody who is
somebody an Olympian the power of that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
somebody an Olympian the power of that
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539
somebody an Olympian the power of that
is something that we're seeing where

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
is something that we're seeing where
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670
is something that we're seeing where
we're seeing kids that are now happy to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

classroom champions we believe that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
classroom champions we believe that
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.109
classroom champions we believe that
repetition causes behavior change and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
repetition causes behavior change and
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270
repetition causes behavior change and
that's what we see with through the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
that's what we see with through the
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.130
that's what we see with through the
technology through the the pre-recorded

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
technology through the the pre-recorded
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.810
technology through the the pre-recorded
video lessons every month that the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
video lessons every month that the
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520
video lessons every month that the
athletes send in you know just a few

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
athletes send in you know just a few
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.840
athletes send in you know just a few
weeks before each month they record

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
weeks before each month they record
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370
weeks before each month they record
these videos and then the kids are

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
these videos and then the kids are
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.630
these videos and then the kids are
actually able to a couple times a year

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
actually able to a couple times a year
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279
actually able to a couple times a year
whether it be Skype or Google hangout

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
whether it be Skype or Google hangout
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.229
whether it be Skype or Google hangout
these athletes are then able to answer

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
these athletes are then able to answer
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.280
these athletes are then able to answer
the kids questions

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
the kids questions
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.080
the kids questions
and when you make that connection real

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
and when you make that connection real
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.869
and when you make that connection real
you actually put an extra mint or an

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879
you actually put an extra mint or an
 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.640
you actually put an extra mint or an
extra role model in these kids lives and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
extra role model in these kids lives and
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.099
extra role model in these kids lives and
all kinds of things wonderful happen at

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109
all kinds of things wonderful happen at
 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.590
all kinds of things wonderful happen at
that point
