00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.030
This is Jocko podcast number one 82 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.620
Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.370
The insertion was flawless.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.860
We were in the woodline and on our way for a general area reconnaissance.

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.480
This time we played it by the book moving 10 minutes than waiting 10 minutes.

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.970
As we moved, I swore that I'd never run an eight man team again.

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810
It's too cumbersome in this target.

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.020
The vegetation still made me a tad on edge as it had a second canopy in some

9
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:41.410
areas, but still gave us long lines of sight, something we weren't used to

10
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.960
as darkness approached. We looked for a good spot to Ron

11
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.300
with the flat terrain finding a good Ron became really dicey.

12
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.070
Ordinarily we'd look for high ground dense vegetation or an area far from any

13
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:01.390
trail. Finally, we found one and south set up a perimeter,

14
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.510
set up the watch rotation and oversaw the placement of extra claymore mines in

15
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.130
one area where the vegetation was thin.

16
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.110
Bubba placed a couple of toe poppers in the ground. I couldn't sleep.

17
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.450
The flat terrain played on my mind before first light.

18
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.040
The entire team was awake, alert,

19
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:24.880
retrieving the claim or minds and preparing for our move out of the Ron.

20
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.880
After a night on the jungle floor,

21
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.650
I wanted an rnr anywhere with firm beds, clean sheets,

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.070
and cold drinks because I insisted on carrying the PRC 25 there was little room

23
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:44.551
in my backpack except for essentials at night when I slept on the ground,

24
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:47.950
I did so without an air mattress or hammock.

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The sole item of comfort was an army issue,

26
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.490
pullover sweater that buttoned up to the neck.

27
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.250
Whenever I put it on at night.

28
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.660
I was always worried about Charlie hitting us when I was pulling the sweater

29
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.583
over my head.

30
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.880
It was one of the few creature comforts I allowed myself or had room for in my

31
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:07.714
rucksack.

32
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
<v 1>All right.</v>

33
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 0>Shortly after first light,</v>

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.380
the Green Horn at c aircraft flew into the edge of our AOL for a routine camo

35
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.800
check. I gave him a quick team. Okay.

36
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.460
And prepared to move the team out of the Ron. However,

37
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:24.710
the CNC crew told me to wrap up the mission.

38
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.920
There was another problem that he couldn't discuss on an open frequency.

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.190
We knew the NVA monitored SOG, FM radio transmissions,

40
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.410
and had radio direction finding equipment.

41
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.570
The CNC pilot told us to find an El z and let and to let them know when we'd be

42
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.780
ready for extraction. A few minutes later,

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.310
the Green Hornets roared into the new LC, picked us up and returned us to base.

44
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.620
The reason we were yanked from the field this time stemmed from a tragedy in the

45
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.930
prairie fryer area of operations.

46
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:58.931
On 30 November an age 34 king bee was shot out of the sky during an son.

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.830
Operation Seven Green Berets from fob one and fob four were killed when an

48
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.750
antiaircraft round struck the Sikorsky chopper and ignited the ammunition on the

49
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.570
aircraft killing everyone on board.

50
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.100
One of the men killed and that ill fated King Bee was staff Sergeant Arthur e

51
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.934
Bader.

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.700
I liked Bader on my last night at fob one before shipping out to fob six I

53
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:32.610
played in a poker game where he won a lot of money.

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.220
The longer we played, the more money Bader won,

55
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.630
the more money Bader won, the more morose he became.

56
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.850
<v 0>At one point I asked him what was wrong.</v>

58
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.000
He was winning and he was a head several hundred dollars,

59
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.300
but kept complaining that he'd never spend the money.

60
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.280
His response was that he had a premonition that he was going to die and that men

61
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.270
about to die often when a lot of money, money that they would never spend.

62
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.130
We all tried to Josh amount of his dark mood but failed.

63
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.250
<v 1>Cool Bader</v>

64
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.250
<v 0>was a unique special forces green baret he had earned and lost three separate</v>

65
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.290
fortunes in between three terms in the service.

66
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.740
He was in his thirties but still enjoyed SF,

67
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.690
spoke fluent German and a few other languages and merely wanted to accomplish

68
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:29.280
any mission assigned to him

69
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.000
on the flight on the long flight back to fruit by,

70
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.810
I kept hearing him talk to us at the poker table that last night.

71
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.683
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.600
<v 0>now he was gone.</v>

73
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.410
<v 0>Now he was gone and that</v>

75
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.240
is the reality of war captured in the best selling book across the fence

76
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.650
and back with us again to talk about war is the author of that book and of

77
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.790
another book called on the ground and have a series of books called the sock

78
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:12.301
chronicles,

79
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:17.301
a man who has seen more than most and who has had more close calls than any man

80
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:19.434
should have.

81
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
<v 0>John is Stryker Meyer and if you haven't listened to podcast one 80 and one 81</v>

83
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:27.430
yet,

84
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.430
go back and listen to them first to hear the background of this hero,

85
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:38.230
this warrior special forces soldier and leader of our t Idaho,

86
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.490
a recon team for Mac v SOG working missions across the border from Vietnam into

87
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:50.260
Laos and Cambodia. John, good evening, sir. Good evening.

88
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.670
Thanks for coming back again.

89
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.920
Glad to be back every time you walk out of the studio.

90
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.230
About 10 minutes later I said you had a tech say, hey,

91
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.540
can you come back again next week? We just have so much fun.

92
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.330
I can't say no that's happened. That's just that happened. That's both.

93
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.000
That's how you ended up here. Again, every time you walk out of here I go,

94
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.510
I want to hear you talk more. Oh,

95
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.320
hear more about what you've done and yeah, no, it's a, it's been awesome.

96
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.410
And the response from people have been hitting me up. There've been, uh,

97
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.680
just just enthralled with what you've been talking about and hearing,

98
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.480
hearing you tell these stories has been, has been interesting.

99
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.560
And you, you haven't seen this.

100
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.740
Have you heard of a movie character named Jason Borne?

101
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.580
Have you heard of this guy? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

102
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.690
So I posted a picture of you when you were 21 or 22. I think you were 22.

103
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.080
He's my illegitimate son. Yeah, they, they,

104
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.400
you've got some definite comments about that. Interesting.

105
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.990
So yeah, we got there. The real guy back again. So

106
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.030
I know we have that first excerpt that I just read was from across the fence and

107
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.330
I wanted to go back to your other book for a little bit,

108
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.170
the book on the ground and then I just want to,

109
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.720
I got a bunch of things I want to just to ask you about. And talk to you about,

110
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:11.150
but I wanted to cover one more section of this book on the ground.

111
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.470
I was reading through it again yesterday and it's just again,

112
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.120
one of these situations where

113
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.380
I don't know how you're here right now to be honest with you buddy Grayson guy.

114
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.230
Indeed. To become guides to smarter our team. And you know,

115
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.200
you guys had more than a hundred percent casualty rate. Correct.

116
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.320
You had guys that, you had some guys that had seven, eight, nine purple hearts.

117
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.930
<v 2>Bob Howard was put in for 11 he only received eight and my case,</v>

118
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:47.290
I've been put in for two more for just shrapnel. You know,

119
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.010
you look at guys who get two legs blown off arms pla office,

120
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.910
like almost embarrassed to take it and anybody got a purple heart in our day.

121
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.410
You got really ragged for it, you know, cause they you dumb ass,

122
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:02.530
you just couldn't get out of the way fast enough. She got a purple heart.

123
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.550
<v 0>Yeah. I think we had one of my old Vietnam seal buddies,</v>

124
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:10.210
I think he called it the v the Vietcong achievement medal was the purple heart.

125
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.600
That's a good one. I like that. Uh,

126
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.580
so you were put in for two more. How many did you get already?

127
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.310
<v 2>Oh, it's that one. Okay. And again, spider parks and pat walk-ins. My, you know,</v>

128
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.460
my gurus, my recon Gurus, uh,

129
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.640
we had one that had been put in for just minus Rapinoe.

130
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.830
The paperwork disappeared.

131
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.080
[inaudible] another one have more shrapnel and this time was a little bit,

132
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.670
a lot more serious bleeding and scratching and stuff. Little blood.

133
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.240
But I think serious compared to what guys, for sure they really get hammered.

134
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.970
They said no put in for it. Someday you may have to go to the VA and to his VA.

135
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.560
Even though the benefits, it's there, you'd get home loans. Oh,

136
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:55.980
okay. I might be a future if we get through. There might be a future

137
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.960
<v 3>set that had still pays 22, Tom After three purple hearts. Was that a rule?</v>

138
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.000
No, that's this room out of sock. What about a normal,

139
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.050
what about a normal soldier? I wouldn't know.

140
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:12.270
I never spent any time in a regular unit or, yeah, no. I mean Bob Howard,

141
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.460
he took his age and he should have had 11 all the cluster. They just,

142
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:19.860
they ran out of clusters for those. Yeah, and you talk about [inaudible]

143
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.770
<v 0>calls volume one. What was it? 16 guys went out.</v>

144
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.420
16 special forces soldiers went out and they got 33 purple hearts in four days.

145
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.550
<v 3>Oh yeah. It probably could have gotten more. Sure. Ridiculous.</v>

146
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.330
Absolutely is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. All right. We're going back to all that.

147
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.120
<v 0>The ground. Here we go. The Hueys lifted off,</v>

148
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.300
made a gentle lazy turn and pointed their noses northwest.

149
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.650
Once everyone was settled,

150
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:50.310
I allowed my mind to wander as I looked out and marveled at how beautiful

151
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:54.810
landscape was from several thousand feet up in the air up where it was open and

152
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.150
cool rather than closed in Magee,

153
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.840
there was also a sense of inner peace and pride.

154
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.670
This is what I had volunteered and trained so hard for this chance to run top

155
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.420
secret missions behind enemy lines, dangerous missions that made a difference.

156
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.880
Like most special forces types.

157
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.750
I couldn't stomach the monotonous routines of camp life,

158
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.550
the ash and trash detail stuff. The petty rules, regulations,

159
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.490
formations and egos

160
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.861
more amazing.

161
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:30.861
Yet here I was at the ripe old age of 22 sporting the exalted rank of e four and

162
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:37.161
the one zero of ASOG recon team 22 years old.

163
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.540
<v 3>Young and dumb. Yeah. 22 years old. And you'd been bust if you hadn't been,</v>

164
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.960
you got busted down once or twice. Only once. Okay.

165
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.000
So you would have been an e five you think at this point?

166
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.490
Oh would have been up must of powerful. Yes. At least to me

167
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.640
that must've been car crazy cause usually you got promoted based on a,

168
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.120
if you're running missions whenever the appropriate timeframe was to be in one

169
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:10.020
grade before you be considered for the next saga was really good about getting

170
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.760
the promotions. At least our people are.

171
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.870
So as soon as you accomplish your time in rank, you get one from me,

172
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.250
deuce e four really quick.

173
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.470
So yeah.

174
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.930
<v 0>When you this,</v>

175
00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:27.931
this idea of being an SF and just being on camp and on base and having the

176
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.240
normal kind of routines, you just couldn't stand that. No.

177
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.310
You just would rather be out in the field.

178
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 3>Oh yeah. It just drives you nuts,</v>

179
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.460
Jack. All right, here we go. Back to the book. I had been with Archie,

180
00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:49.490
Idaho for seven months now by dent of hard work, lots of mission experience,

181
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.650
and simply having survived. I was now a team leader at moment's notice.

182
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.710
I could have millions and millions of dollars worth of air support assets,

183
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.970
some of them manned by majors and lieutenant colonels all doing my bidding,

184
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.090
all giving their courageous best to save my bacon.

185
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.590
I'd come a long way since flunking out of college and doing a stint as a garbage

186
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:11.170
collector and Yosemite National Park Park.

187
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.240
My egotistical reveries were cut short when the door gunner on my side of the

188
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:19.630
Huey decided to cut loose with a long burst of [inaudible] machine gun fire

189
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:24.100
right next to my ear. Fortunately, he was simply test firing it.

190
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.160
You're, you know, we would get,

191
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.580
I guess kind of similar is we'd be driving to a target, right?

192
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.880
Being in a home v, you know, sometimes the targets are an hour,

193
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:37.240
sometimes two hours. You know, we did some long, long transits,

194
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:42.241
but you would get time to sit there and think about stuff because well you're,

195
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.590
you're sitting there and being transported. There's not too much you can do. Um,

196
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.560
you know, you're scan and you're looking for, but you were in a helicopter.

197
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.510
There's nothing to do but think really.

198
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.780
It was always amazing cause it's just so beautiful.

199
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.610
I mean Southeast Asia from the air, even when you went over to combat zone,

200
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.610
you see the bomb craters and he, but the jungle, it was just,

201
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.400
just beautiful country.

202
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.170
And then you get under it and get into the underbelly of the jungle disliked.

203
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.290
Oh, so you notice it does a whole world, the starling contrast, you know? Yeah.

204
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.810
And like if you're in the desert,

205
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.270
it has its own beauty and it can be spellbinding if you just watch it a little,

206
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.030
wow. Look at this.

207
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.070
That without realizing that somewhere there's a little hole so a guy could pop

208
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:30.550
out of the hitch with an RPG or detonate. And in your case,

209
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.080
does remote controls your, when you roll over,

210
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.310
did you,

211
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.930
it sounds like you recognize this when you were doing these operations,

212
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.280
you kind of knew that this was,

213
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.530
I don't know, I guess I'm going to use this word, you are lucky to be there.

214
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.060
Oh clearly.

215
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.840
Cause I 100% when I was in Iraq and I only did two deployments to Iraq,

216
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.170
I 100% knew every day that I was there.

217
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.510
I knew that this was

218
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.050
<v 2>okay.</v>

219
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:10.490
<v 3>Like my time, this is what I'd been like, this is what I will live for.</v>

220
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.710
And I knew that it wasn't like I look back and say,

221
00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:15.260
oh well I really wish I would have appreciated those days. No.

222
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.350
When I was in them I completely knew it and appreciated being there like every

223
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.483
single day.

224
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.110
<v 2>Yeah. And I,</v>

225
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.260
it was a nice feeling personally to think that here we are with the best of the

226
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:34.800
best and we're running into missions and that's what we live for is, okay,

227
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:35.730
now we're here.

228
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.530
Let's go do this and just hope,

229
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.460
get the mission done.

230
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.760
And just was the Dan trackers who leave you alone as he get the mission done.

231
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:49.380
Good. Do to wire tap or snatch a pow, something like that. Oh yeah.

232
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.100
It felt good, but you know, it's like quiet professionals.

233
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.140
You just don't talk about that much. Yeah.

234
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.990
<v 0>Going back to the book, as we approached the LZ,</v>

235
00:14:57.991 --> 00:15:01.020
the team crowded the two doors of the helicopter.

236
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.680
I was on the right half standing on the skid. Sal was kneeling behind me.

237
00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:06.570
His hand on my shoulder ready to follow me out.

238
00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:11.250
The door next to him was Hep my one one John Bubba shore.

239
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.270
Along with Foc, our point man and Twan are grin.

240
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:17.370
A deer got ready to exit out the left side door.

241
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.510
We all kept our eyes riveted on the looming jungle scanning for any signs of

242
00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:23.820
movement in the treeline surrounding our LZ,

243
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.880
the top of the triple canopy growth of trees,

244
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.110
vines and other vegetation was at least a hundred feet off the jungle for.

245
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.830
And the opening into which we were descending reminded me of the mouth of a long

246
00:15:34.831 --> 00:15:39.600
dark tunnel at the bottom of which resided things alis never dreamed of when she

247
00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:41.610
tumbled into that rabbit hole of hers.

248
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.900
As we were swallowed up and the darkness increased,

249
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.590
a cold chill ran down my spine.

250
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

251
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.550
<v 0>When you're going into these spots,</v>

252
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.970
so you had pre identified this El z prior to, is that correct?

253
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.130
<v 2>At that point we were working with Covey at Dorn debriefing.</v>

254
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.590
We give out the officials, uh, LZs, you know,

255
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.070
the primary secondary alternate [inaudible] and that would go to Saigon.

256
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.760
Then we in his year find something else because we knew the servers,

257
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.693
it was corrupt.

258
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.420
<v 0>And then so by find something else,</v>

259
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.950
you're basically just looking for a clearing of some kind. That's right. Right

260
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.720
<v 2>within that, within that target. And usually to be somewheres else,</v>

261
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.520
say go somewheres, we're Saigon,

262
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.030
the leek deer wouldn't get the word back cause we had that one target.

263
00:16:34.031 --> 00:16:35.320
We went in with the bomb.

264
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.750
The LZ was literally wired and a top streak awardee had wire already with a 500

265
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:43.020
pounder. So, uh,

266
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.360
we were beginning to do that much more often than could. We had good,

267
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.160
great copies. They knew what we,

268
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.183
<v 0>the key, the cab,</v>

269
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.190
the cubbies fly the area of operations before you inserted on the day before or

270
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.440
anything like that.

271
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.750
<v 2>Well during the day up they will just fly over it. Sure.</v>

272
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.400
Where they just pictures or anything? No, no. Uh,

273
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:06.170
usually they just do a VR visual reconnaissance and they would try to be subtle

274
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:08.870
about like an early 68.

275
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:13.460
We always flew a visually causes prior to the mission and the NVA is not stupid

276
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.730
there. If they see a bird dog flying over targeted, they figure,

277
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:19.880
well pretty soon we're going to get visitors and sure enough,

278
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.100
so that gave them time to get ready.

279
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.840
So we basically cut out dvrs on our part.

280
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.310
And then when cubby go out, you know, a lot of these guys have been flying,

281
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.510
they're more familiar with the ego, the VR with a helicopter on. Oh No.

282
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.690
Usually with a South Vietnamese air force,

283
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.220
they'd have a little a oh one. Oh. Just like from World War II.

284
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.130
The one from the battle from the bowls were Henry Fond.

285
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.240
It's up there in the right seat.

286
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.900
And a pilot's got this little cub piper cubs going 88 miles an hour top speed

287
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.770
downhill. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what, and uh,

288
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.530
so that would be most of our vrs,

289
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:01.830
but then by Christmas we pretty much cut that out.

290
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

291
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.240
<v 0>Yeah. And that just cause they were, they, that was given away, you know,</v>

292
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:11.250
we used to ride on logistics air and kind of move the logistics air a little bit

293
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.550
to go over an area that we're going over.

294
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.050
So no one would know that we were in there, that we were taking pictures,

295
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:23.090
you know, like just logistics air, just to an aircraft flying somewhere.

296
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:25.870
They'd go in a straight line. They wouldn't, they'd just veer off a little bits.

297
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.050
We could see what we wanted to see.

298
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.200
<v 2>Sure. And then also did the fake fake inserts. Um,</v>

299
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.620
sometimes they didn't have the fuel to do a lot fake inserts,

300
00:18:35.621 --> 00:18:40.390
but they had a device called the Nightingale where they would go in,

301
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.620
go to Nightingale, often pull the a detonator on it and it was,

302
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:49.450
sounded like a firefight so that would have a lot of commotion and then they

303
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:53.680
would jump up, go to a second LZ and, and put us in at down south.

304
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.030
We were with the, uh, the greenhorns. They,

305
00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.940
they really had a cold cause it was flat down, up, down, up.

306
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.990
So at the NVA were trying to guess which of the three or four touchdowns where

307
00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:06.700
we were, they were really busy.

308
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.320
<v 0>Got It. Going back to the book as the chopper near the jungle floor,</v>

309
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:14.870
Bubba and I executed our first standard operating procedure,

310
00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:17.990
which was checking the LZ for trip wires or booby traps while the rest of the

311
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.480
team's search the surrounding jungle for any signs of trouble.

312
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.660
After giving the all clear, the team was out the doors.

313
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:26.270
And all on the ground before the skids firmly touchdown.

314
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.930
How long would you hover there and look at the LZ for? Oh, not long.

315
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.670
Like a matter of 10 seconds

316
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.450
<v 2>and just like you guys would go in God's down, get out.</v>

317
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.480
<v 0>Sure. Yeah. We used to just jump out,</v>

318
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:40.490
lay down like the helicopter would just touch and take off it.

319
00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:43.500
We would just jump out, lay down right there. We wouldn't move away from it.

320
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:46.920
Just jump out and laid out a modern day version of touching gum. Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.360
We quickly headed to the woodline and set up a provisional perimeter where we

322
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.200
could wait and listen.

323
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:53.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.700
<v 0>When again, we saw on her, nothing suspicious.</v>

325
00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:58.400
We burrowed deeper into the jungle where as both dancer and darker,

326
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.680
like some furtive predatory animal,

327
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.910
we were looking to hide ourselves after 10 minutes of no threatening sounds or

328
00:20:04.911 --> 00:20:05.744
movements.

329
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.260
I radioed Covey and gave him the message he had been waiting to hear Timo K he

330
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:15.560
and others could take up breathing again. At least for the time being.

331
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:16.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

332
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.100
<v 0>The deeper we moved in the deep we move,</v>

333
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:22.790
the darker and more claustrophobic things became moving through.

334
00:20:22.791 --> 00:20:27.410
The foliage was an excruciatingly slow and painful process with sweat,

335
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:29.180
stinging one's eyes, bugs,

336
00:20:29.181 --> 00:20:34.070
crawling and feasting upon exposed skin and visibility cut to mere feet.

337
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.680
<v 0>It could also be disorienting,</v>

339
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.220
especially when the maps we were given were so useless.

340
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.060
And here was our t Idaho looking for fuel lines.

341
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:48.430
Some bright eyed Covey writer had spotted and directed airstrikes against

342
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.590
intelligence reports said there was a second pipeline in this EO as well.

343
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.910
Regardless of how many, any pipeline we found we were going to destroy.

344
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.260
And what were the map? Would you have one to 50 maps? Is that what you had?

345
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.970
Yeah, one to 50,000

346
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.770
<v 2>right. But they would cut out from the big map.</v>

347
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.040
They would cut out like a 10 by 10 or 12 by 12 square so that if we were killed,

348
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.210
they came across the map to be no other Intel on a separate at one targeted that

349
00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:18.050
we were on the ground.

350
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.640
<v 0>Now I've gone into triple canopy jungle before with one.</v>

351
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.440
You ever had seen a one to 24 map?

352
00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.240
They're basically more detailed duress. They're twice as detailed.

353
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.140
They're pretty good. But one to fifties are not that accurate.

354
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.320
<v 2>No. Then we had that one target where they had forgotten a mountain. You know,</v>

355
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.890
we're on a mountain and we're getting ready to go down the go over and we look

356
00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:45.450
at it as like, Hey, you forgot one that really could stretch your Mitch and out.

357
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.800
When you're in triple canopy

358
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.160
<v 0>claustrophobic, you use that word claustrophobic quite a bit in this section.</v>

359
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.530
Is this jungle just tight?

360
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.790
<v 2>Very. Yeah. Because again,</v>

361
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:03.140
sometimes you had to keep sight on the guy in front of you as you moved, uh,

362
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.550
because you just become separated so easily because of the dense vegetation.

363
00:22:07.551 --> 00:22:11.780
Of course. A lot of times, um, our Vietnamese were shorter.

364
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.600
They get through a cricket. Well, we would be down on our knees. I'd be,

365
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.960
I wore out more pants crawling through the jungle.

366
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.600
<v 0>I know. I saw a picture. I was looking at the pictures in the books.</v>

367
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:24.000
I saw a picture of one of the indigenous that some of those guys were really

368
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:25.800
small. Oh yeah. Really small.

369
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.060
<v 2>98 pounds soaking wet, but 50 pounds of heart.</v>

370
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.520
<v 0>Oh, that's awesome. All right. Going back to the book,</v>

371
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:36.470
but I had more immediate and pressing concerns.

372
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.830
The adrenaline rush that always accompanied it and insertion had pretty much

373
00:22:39.831 --> 00:22:43.910
worn off and another characteristic sensation had begun to take its place.

374
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.200
It was a feeling of familiarity and comfort combined with an eerie sense of

375
00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:51.860
foreboding. Both were a product of experience.

376
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.630
I was comfortable because I was surrounded by extraordinary well trained and

377
00:22:56.631 --> 00:23:00.410
fiercely devoted team that knew what it was doing yet.

378
00:23:00.411 --> 00:23:05.411
We also had stepped in enough accidental shit and had encountered so many

379
00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:10.751
hostile enemy units that it was impossible to not feel serious anxiety.

380
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.260
In fact, I figured that when I stopped being scared Shitless,

381
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.720
I would be on my way to buying the farm.

382
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.590
Cockiness had cost more than one life.

383
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.160
So you still,

384
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.010
you get that little mixed feeling of comfort but fear and anxiety at the same

385
00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:31.844
time.

386
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.650
<v 2>Yes. You know, you like the whole adrenaline of, you know how it is inserted,</v>

387
00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:39.410
you're just pumped and at some point you get off,

388
00:23:39.411 --> 00:23:42.530
you get on the ground sell downs. You guys would hit so many times, you would,

389
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.160
you would insert immediately get contacted a lot of, yeah. So

390
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.380
<v 0>once it'd be amped up, going in,</v>

391
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.260
and then when there's nothing there that starts to fade. Yeah.

392
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.540
Then you finally get on the grass like, oh, at last we're on the ground.

393
00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.340
Now let's get on with the mission. Worry about the trackers, let's get moving.

394
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.470
But let's also stay cognizant,

395
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.870
keep our situational awareness tight and that, you know, this is a,

396
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.920
one of the reasons I highlighted this section is, you know,

397
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:14.760
just this is something that, you know what,

398
00:24:14.761 --> 00:24:16.430
we talk about complacency all the time.

399
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.350
I know there was a number one of the Marine Corps units, we were with the,

400
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.290
the three, eight and Ramadi, they had a bed aside.

401
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.260
They had signs around their compound. Complacency kills. Yeah, for sure.

402
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.340
But this idea of they knew,

403
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:36.070
I also talked to young military guys, young seals that, you know, they're,

404
00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:38.450
they're scared of this. They're scared of. That's like, I always tell them good.

405
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:40.500
You know, you should, you should be afraid you.

406
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.500
Cause if you're afraid you're going to prepare more,

407
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:43.880
you're going to train harder. You're going to,

408
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.580
you're not going to cut any corners. You're not going to get complacent.

409
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And that's the same thing that you're saying here is you'd seen cockiness cost

410
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:55.280
people their lives cause they think, oh we can just get away with whatever.

411
00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:00.250
Yeah. If you're not scared, I'm scared of you. Really?

412
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.290
Yeah. Yeah. And then you have to overcome that though,

413
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.260
cause you can't let that get, get controlling you.

414
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:08.810
We were talking before we started recording and we were talking about a guy that

415
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:12.140
was in a firefight. There was one guy that didn't fire a shot,

416
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.070
stayed curled up in a ball praying. Yeah. That's when,

417
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.230
that's when fear is not good. Not your friend,

418
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.250
your arc guys wanting to shoot him.

419
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.640
So you got to balance that. You got to be, you got to have the fear.

420
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.800
You got to feel it, but you got to deal with it. Correct.

421
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.120
We had campuses so we knew the general direction we were headed,

422
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.340
which was to the northwest, away from the LZ.

423
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.640
We had been working our way slowly through the underbrush for about an hour when

424
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:45.620
suddenly we heard an explosion behind us.

425
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.680
It had to have been the claim or bubba rig to go off.

426
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:50.780
If anyone tried to follow us off the LZ,

427
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.610
it's detonation single signaled a profound change in the situation.

428
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.130
The hunters were about to become the hunted in the jungle.

429
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.050
There are almost always animal noises of some kind and these suddenly fell

430
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.570
silent in the quiet.

431
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.890
We could hear some distressing sounds to the west sounds that were not of a

432
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:16.340
jungle kind, but those of men on the move.

433
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:17.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

434
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.890
<v 0>We were not alone.</v>

435
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.420
<v 0>Welcome to the jungle baby. Yes,</v>

437
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:29.630
indeed. That, uh,

438
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.470
how do you know that the claymores that you rigged weren't set off by some kind

439
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:37.280
of monkey or whatever, some kind of animal. Um,

440
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:42.290
did you guys reg them a certain way that that was unlikely way the way Bubba

441
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.040
and, and the freshmen later would

442
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.120
<v 2>do it and Lynn,</v>

443
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.930
they would put us in an area where it would be easiest for the trackers to

444
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.440
follow. And so he's just based on human nature.

445
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.140
You're going to go through the tick part,

446
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.330
you're going to go where it's easier to travel and uh,

447
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.720
it could have been an animal, but basically it's an end

448
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.940
<v 0>VA animal. Yeah. You know? Yeah.</v>

449
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.020
The coincidence would be too much and the chances are it's just NVA.

450
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.110
<v 2>Yeah. And then if it is a monkey as opposed to an NVA,</v>

451
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.020
we're happy we'll find that out within the next couple of hours.

452
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.360
On the other hand, let's get ready.

453
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.020
<v 0>Yeah. And the, so the, when there was,</v>

454
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.670
when there was enemy moving in the jungle, the animals would stop making noises.

455
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.340
<v 2>It all depends how close you are. But yes, lots hot.</v>

456
00:27:27.341 --> 00:27:31.200
That's why the most important thing in the jungle was listing. I mean 10,

457
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.650
10 sounds pretty extreme,

458
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:38.130
but it really gives you time to hear what's going on.

459
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.540
Cause a lot of time you can't see it as much.

460
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.740
<v 0>The best sense in the jungle. And like I said, I've,</v>

461
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.160
I've been in triple canopy and we've done patrolling triple canopy and you can

462
00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:50.450
hit by monkeys too, right? Yeah. Well yeah we had monkeys freak us out.

463
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.010
But um,

464
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.270
<v 2>okay.</v>

465
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.790
<v 0>That the sense just so people can understand, you can only see in,</v>

466
00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.320
in that thick jungle sometimes you can only see five feet. Sure.

467
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.610
Five or 10 feet at the most.

468
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.330
And so you patrol for 10 minutes and then you just stop.

469
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.140
Everyone is quiet and you listen to see if anyone's following you to see if

470
00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:11.030
there's any other movement out there. That's what you're doing.

471
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.291
<v 2>Sure. I mean,</v>

472
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:17.291
and it's so thick that if I'm behind a point man or sometimes,

473
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.220
oh, it'd be the point man was Sao and myself, why would never see the point man,

474
00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:26.210
I would just keep an eye on sal and the guy behind me would just be on my

475
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:30.200
backpack. I wouldn't, I couldn't tell you where the point man was caught.

476
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.590
Just follow sound. The vegetation was that thick a lot of times.

477
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.030
And again, I'm depending on a Vietnamese. Could they know they ended up jumbled

478
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.080
<v 0>better than me? How come the animals would stop making noise?</v>

479
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.390
Would the animal stop making noise when you would patrol?

480
00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.050
<v 2>I would assume, but once we settled down, then things would come back normal,</v>

481
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.820
<v 0>so when you stop moving then the sounds would escalate and if it didn't have to</v>

482
00:28:57.821 --> 00:29:02.290
10 minutes ago, the pucker factor types up to the VA a little bit more.

483
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.740
All right.

484
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.130
I immediately signaled foc who is on point to head north.

485
00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.730
This would take us up a hill that dominated our right flank.

486
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.090
The climb was pretty severe, which was good and bad news.

487
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.620
While it made the going rough,

488
00:29:20.621 --> 00:29:23.980
it also meant we were gaining some genuine high ground and high ground as the

489
00:29:23.981 --> 00:29:26.380
preferred PR position. When it comes to defense,

490
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.890
the steepness also meant the enemy would have to work as hard as we were.

491
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.780
I couldn't tell how close the NVA trackers were or how many of them were headed

492
00:29:34.781 --> 00:29:37.270
our way, but I knew if push came to shove,

493
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.740
I wanted to be looking down on them. Always take the high ground.

494
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.520
Always that's just military maximum and you know I or Iowa actually say you take

495
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.720
the moral high ground as well.

496
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.230
Take dialogue with the high ground is going to take you. Hey Man.

497
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.770
When we reached the hilltop,

498
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.550
just as dark clouds unleashed a torrent of rain while bubbling,

499
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.430
sal began put setting out a perimeter of claymores.

500
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:06.370
I can't contacted Covey and appraised him of the situation,

501
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.640
namely that it didn't look good and that we might be calling for an immediate

502
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.310
extraction before nightfall. Did you guys speak at all?

503
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.050
Only minimal because most of the we hand seamless. Everything has circles.

504
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.550
Just like usually you'd have to risk Bonnier. Yeah, but if we could,

505
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.720
if we just avoided it as much as we could, but something like this,

506
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:28.660
just so people understand something like this, you're on patrol.

507
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.870
You're not saying anything. You head up the hill, you don't say anything.

508
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.870
You get to perimeter, you give the perimeter signal. You don't say anything.

509
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.610
Everyone knows what to do. When you're in there.

510
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.330
You could go days out in the field without talking. Oh yeah, absolutely.

511
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.930
Because with the training isn't pissy.

512
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.960
You've got the visual with the person that you're signaling. Like in my case,

513
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:49.090
if I'm behind, fuck the point man,

514
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.080
I'm telling him what to do and I'll turn around and tell the guy behind me same

515
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:54.490
signals and then we go. Yup.

516
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.850
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

517
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.690
<v 0>while I was talking to</v>

518
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.700
Covey Sao who had moved north to set out his claim more suddenly opened fire on

519
00:31:03.701 --> 00:31:06.580
full automatic assure side we had visitors.

520
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.140
This was immediately confirmed when heavy AK 47 fire ripped out of the jungle

521
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.570
and response in less than five seconds.

522
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.130
The well practice Sao had fired off all 18 rounds in his car,

523
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:23.020
15 set off the claymores and reloaded his weapon while falling back to join the

524
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:26.050
rest of the team. That's the legit right there.

525
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.230
Sal was making things happen. He was the man.

526
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.670
Would you guys, you guys be trading in these immediate action drills,

527
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:35.500
mag changes, I mean everything that we do, right?

528
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:38.500
You guys drill that stuff every drill and drill and drill. If we're in camp,

529
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.890
we go down often and just a particularly unit beginning to June,

530
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.130
my first couple of months,

531
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.140
whenever every day Hondas arounds and when this happens,

532
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.240
these guys are called the enemy has come very close to you because you can at

533
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:59.980
least know that they're there. They gotta be what, 1520 maybe 30 meters away.

534
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.180
And in that case here,

535
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:06.181
I forget how close they weren't that far for Saudi to blow his claim or en the

536
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:08.440
car 15 and reload and do it one more time.

537
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.953
<v 4>Okay.</v>

538
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.470
<v 0>Back to the book cover.</v>

539
00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:16.340
You had heard the background shots and explosions so he was not overly surprised

540
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:17.720
when I stated the obvious.

541
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:22.370
We had a prairie fire emergency in progress and we wanted out asap.

542
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.490
The mission was over at the fuel lines would have to wait until another day.

543
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.990
The focus now became saving our asses. And to this end,

544
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:34.190
every air sab would air asset within striking distance would immediately be

545
00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:38.030
vectored to our target area. The odds would soon turn,

546
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.440
if not in our favor, very decidedly against the enemy.

547
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.130
Our t Idaho might not make it out alive,

548
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.620
but neither would the NVA.

549
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.240
<v 0>You guys had some serious confidence in that air power.</v>

551
00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.220
<v 2>Yeah. That was our lifeline. I mean, um,</v>

552
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.640
a major edge that we had and whenever we could use it,

553
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.530
we use it because, um,

554
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.260
it was only a matter of time before they would get more bodies there.

555
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.760
And we had teams that had been overrun and 67,

556
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:18.080
68 so we knew the potential for things to go really wrong.

557
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.710
And that was one of the things I could neutralize the manpower when they had

558
00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:25.580
the, Amy has so many troops.

559
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.900
<v 0>Did teams ever get over while they had air power? Oh, sure.</v>

560
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.550
<v 2>Sadly, yes. Severe. Oh yeah.</v>

561
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:38.160
They would just keep coming as Silva Medal of honors recipients. Uh,

562
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:43.510
Fred sabotage Tasky Robert Howard s f on missions and they were directing air

563
00:33:44.921 --> 00:33:47.660
power still just got overrun.

564
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.900
That's all part of the horror of being on the ground. The guest,

565
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.980
they really determined fall.

566
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.460
<v 0>So even though you have confidence in your air power,</v>

567
00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:58.310
you know there's limitations and

568
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.250
<v 1>yeah,</v>

569
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.360
<v 0>if things really go bad that air power is not going to be able to save you.</v>

570
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.990
<v 2>Correct. Is He? Again is time.</v>

571
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.060
Whether and where are you in the jungle and the triple canopy.

572
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:12.080
If you're in triple canopy,

573
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:15.680
all you could do is maybe gun runs and you're not even sure how effective it

574
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.390
will be, but at least you get their attention.

575
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.123
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

576
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.980
<v 0>going back to the book, Call King Bees, call king bees beaucoup VC beaucoup VC.</v>

577
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:30.240
It was clear Sao and I shared similar appraisal of our situation in the same

578
00:34:30.241 --> 00:34:34.770
thoughts about what needed to be done. The only hitch was how to pull it off,

579
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.450
what with darkness approaching a storm raging and no helicopters anywhere near

580
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:44.100
us. I didn't want to add to either sow's or the team's exed. Sorry,

581
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:45.600
I didn't share my misgivings.

582
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.070
Instead I gave Carvey the direction and probable distance.

583
00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:53.520
We'd moved from the LZ and told them I was about to throw two yellow smoke

584
00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:54.870
grenades to Marco location.

585
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:59.400
I threw two hoping some of the smoke would somehow travel up through the thick

586
00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:02.700
vegetation and into the clear where Covey could see it.

587
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.990
Covey had good and bad news. He thought he had our location,

588
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.770
but he doubted seriously. If he could get extraction helicopters to us before.

589
00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:16.280
Nightfall not good, not good at all.

590
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
We now had confirmed enemy north and south of us and they were closing in south.

591
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.230
Frantically signaled Bubba to set off the south facing claymores.

592
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.830
When bubba hesitated for a second, I could hear Sao his code of

593
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.790
Co Kaka Dow VC. How do you say that? Kaka Dow Kaka Dow VC [inaudible]

594
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.020
Kill Dumas, which is Vietnamese for mother, mother Fockers.

595
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.330
As the claymores erupted,

596
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.020
sal pulled the pin on the fragmentation grenade and lob that into the boiling.

597
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:57.021
Dustin smoke even as even more enemy troops came up the slope with my ears

598
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:02.040
ringing from the blast. I thought I heard additional movement to the east,

599
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.280
but I couldn't be sure because the NVA had abandoned any pretense of stealth,

600
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.700
I assume verified they were coming from that flank as well and there were lots

601
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:15.300
of them. As these unseen forces maneuvered in for the kill,

602
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.010
the jungle took on its most terrifying and claustrophobic reality.

603
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.490
Not a friendly place in the very best of circumstances.

604
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.270
It was now about the worst place in the world to be.

605
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

606
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.220
<v 0>Again, that claustrophobic sense. Can you see,</v>

607
00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.150
can you see the sky in this triple care to be okay?

608
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.241
<v 2>Uh, depends.</v>

609
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:43.290
Sometimes you can see it like glimpses of it or like to be a little opening.

610
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.820
So he was able to see the smoke.

611
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:48.630
Sometimes you'd pop a yellow smoke which is bright and it wouldn't even be able

612
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:49.464
to get through.

613
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.710
<v 0>Everyone was cutting loose as fast as he could in an effort to suppress the</v>

614
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.180
enemies fire and drive him back.

615
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:02.590
Twatted managed to find some narrow openings in the vegetation and was shooting

616
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:07.591
rounds with his m 79 grenade launcher and suddenly the jungle went silent as if

617
00:37:08.021 --> 00:37:10.780
someone had thrown a switch or hit it, hit the mute button.

618
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.440
The only sounds were the metallic clicks as both are t Idaho and the NVA locked

619
00:37:17.471 --> 00:37:21.880
fresh magazines into their weapons. The fight was far from over.

620
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.953
In fact,

621
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.040
the party was just getting started and we were simply changing records for the

622
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:28.510
next dance with death.

623
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:33.310
The jungle again erupted with deafening roar of gunfire,

624
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.360
so that's sketchy. That's gotta be a horrifying feeling. Boom goes quiet.

625
00:37:41.361 --> 00:37:42.620
Everyone dumps their mags.

626
00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.980
There's that moment of silence and then that silence are you here as reload

627
00:37:45.981 --> 00:37:46.160
happens.

628
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.650
<v 2>Well, and you know too when, when that happens,</v>

629
00:37:48.651 --> 00:37:51.770
how when your adrenaline is pumping, when you're here,

630
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.720
your time frame has expanded. So now instead of like you just read it,

631
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.100
that's a quick, it is Bam, Bam, you're saying, but now I need the adrenaline.

632
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:04.700
It feels like it's slowed down. He can feel the magazine coming out.

633
00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:07.950
You hear that click, click, click. Everybody else is them in. Come on,

634
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:12.951
boys come down on his first and our guys one with

635
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.621
<v 0>all the noise.</v>

636
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:18.621
I had to shove the radio handset damn near inside my ear to hear what Covey was

637
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:23.190
trying to tell me. The good news, bad news routine continued.

638
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:26.700
The good news was that some of the yellow smoke had finally made it its way to

639
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:31.680
where Covey could see it. But the bad news was we were nowhere near the NLZ.

640
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.770
He wanted to know if we could find our way back to where we had inserted

641
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.170
negative. I yelled as folk,

642
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:42.700
Bubba and Hap all opened up on some NVA who had managed to sneak up from the

643
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:46.240
south. There were green tracers whizzing all around me.

644
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.920
Covey would have to wait.

645
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.720
And that's another good point because in this war,

646
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.670
the enemy almost always had green tracers always. Okay. Yeah. For us,

647
00:38:57.671 --> 00:38:58.870
they're getting me. Didn't always have great.

648
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:00.670
They'd Gret they in fact most of the time,

649
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.430
well a lot of times I had red cause they had no kidding. Yeah. So it was,

650
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.030
they learned the lesson. Yeah. So it was, you know,

651
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.110
just they got their ammo from all different sources and so it wasn't just this,

652
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.430
there wasn't just a, hey, they're green and wear red. It was mostly red,

653
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:20.110
some green occasionally, but wow. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

654
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.363
<v 1>okay.</v>

655
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.620
<v 0>After helping repel the attack,</v>

656
00:39:25.621 --> 00:39:29.670
I got back on the radio to impress upon Covey,

657
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.820
the directness of our straits. But of course he already knew that.

658
00:39:32.821 --> 00:39:36.810
So in his calm voice, which could drive a one zero to murder, he said,

659
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.940
we don't have a lot of time. No Shit.

660
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.200
The only chance we have is about a hundred meters north by northeast from your

661
00:39:43.201 --> 00:39:44.880
location, there's a small hole in the roof.

662
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.650
We might be able to get strings down to you.

663
00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.270
He inquired if we add much activity to our north. It depended,

664
00:39:51.271 --> 00:39:54.210
I thought on what you meant by much and activity.

665
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.760
I reminded him that North was where the whole shooting match got started and

666
00:39:59.761 --> 00:40:01.560
while the while I fought,

667
00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:04.800
we had pretty much taken that group of NVA out of action.

668
00:40:04.801 --> 00:40:08.040
I couldn't be sure when I finished. He said, don't worry,

669
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:12.930
I have a pair of a one e's on station and I'll have the leader make a gun run

670
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.160
and then give and then have his wing men follow with 500 pounders.

671
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.450
Before I could say Roger that the first Skyraider roared across our northern

672
00:40:21.451 --> 00:40:25.970
perimeter. His 20 millimeter cannons blazing away as wood chips, dust,

673
00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.830
and debris filled the air. The members of RTI,

674
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.980
Idaho did not need to be told what to do.

675
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.130
We kissed mother earth and pressed against her body for all we were worth in the

676
00:40:37.681 --> 00:40:39.000
brief quiet that followed.

677
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.260
I told Bubba did per pair some explosives just in case we needed to cut down

678
00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:44.640
trees at the extraction point.

679
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:49.050
I told Sal we needed to head north as that was our only chance for escape.

680
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:53.820
No one looked happy with this news, particularly not sal who had finished,

681
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.410
who had seen firsthand what was waiting in that direction. About this time,

682
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.760
the second Skyraider appeared and released it's load of 500 pound bombs.

683
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.010
They were so close that the concussions bounced us like jumping beans

684
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.250
and this is all based on the yellow smoke that you'd thrown five minutes ago or

685
00:41:16.291 --> 00:41:20.870
eight minutes ago. They're looking at a massive weight.

686
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.733
This is another thing.

687
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.970
It's hard to understand or it's hard for me to understand.

688
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:26.700
I just remember I was a radio man when I was in the new guy and we were out in

689
00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:31.230
the desert and we were trying to call in helicopters to come pick us up and it's

690
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:32.730
me calling them in. It's not, we isn't me.

691
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.740
I'm sitting there on the radio trying to call on these helicopters and I got my

692
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:39.980
air panel out and we were in the desert. This isn't triplicate,

693
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:43.850
this is the desert and these helicopters can't see me. They're, they're not far.

694
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:44.720
They're not at altitude.

695
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:49.721
They're probably 500 to 500 meters away or they'd do an apnea 30 I'll be there

696
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.100
looking for us there. They're kind of,

697
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.500
they know we're in the general area and they're looking for us and I'm sitting

698
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:57.680
there with a signal panel, like trying to get their attention.

699
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.230
And what you don't realize is that there's, you know,

700
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.700
you're seeing this helicopter, it's so obvious. I mean you,

701
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.490
you'd think there's no possible way that they can't see.

702
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.960
You'd think there's no pop where you've got a s a 16 man seal platoon out there.

703
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.590
I'm waving around a piece of fluoresce and orange were the only human beings in

704
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:19.700
this desert and they can't see us and now you're [inaudible].

705
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.010
And the reason they can't see us this, cause they're looking everywhere.

706
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.690
They're looking, they're looking at whatever,

707
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.860
however many square miles they can see into an ocean. Yeah, they're looking at,

708
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.270
yeah, they can see all this space. And so it takes them a while. You don't,

709
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:32.960
finally I get them to say, I think I popped this up.

710
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.380
I think I popped a smoke and they didn't see the smoke and then I popped another

711
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:38.700
smoke. And so that,

712
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:43.780
I can't imagine these guys are coming in hot dropping bombs based on where the,

713
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.220
not even him,

714
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.930
but where the Covey saw smoke five minutes ago.

715
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.183
Yeah.

716
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.890
<v 2>We may have popped into a smoke in here somewhere and also I know that I had</v>

717
00:42:56.891 --> 00:42:58.170
talked to Cubby Kay,

718
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.790
here's our smoke north of us and he knew they had,

719
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:07.290
we had a lot of Actelion north and south and he forgot about maybe what we were

720
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:10.260
getting from the east button if we're talking about trying to get to the north.

721
00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:15.090
That's why he came across the northern. So he knew basically where we weren't.

722
00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:16.720
He came in and of course the 500 pounds,

723
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.410
we're able to get through the jungle and impact on the ground.

724
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.670
<v 0>I had those things. Rocked you guys. Oh yeah.</v>

725
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:31.520
Uh, it's one of those happy pains. Ugh.

726
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.660
Good Times. I guess. Tilt. Alright.

727
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.040
With the a one e activity to occupy us,

728
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:44.180
we had momentarily taken our attention away from our southern flank and now a

729
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:46.400
wave of NVA hit us from that direction.

730
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:51.970
Everyone responded with automatic fire and Bubba and I lobs some grenades down

731
00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:53.474
the slope.

732
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:58.430
I informed Covey of the attack and told him that when I gave the word and the

733
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:02.450
team moved to the north, I wanted more a one. He runs to ourself.

734
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.990
In my heart of hearts, I also wanted more runs to the north,

735
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.130
but we didn't have time for that. We had to get out while the getting was good,

736
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:15.410
the next NVA wave could be the one to overrun us.

737
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:16.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

738
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.150
<v 0>As bubba finished preparing explosives happened,</v>

739
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:26.180
I continued rolling grenades downhill toward the enemy.

740
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.170
Sal and folk covered Twan with car 15 fire.

741
00:44:30.171 --> 00:44:33.390
As he set up a or facing south and covered it with leaves,

742
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.090
a little parting gift for our friends.

743
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.180
The race was on.

744
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.980
I gave Covey the word and behind us the a one at the a one ease began bombing

745
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.550
the shit out of whoever was back there. Folk angled back to the north.

746
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.700
We passed the, we pass bodies of dead NVA soldiers,

747
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:54.030
but we didn't have time to stop and search them for papers or anything of an

748
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:58.560
intelligence value. We had only one thought in mind get out.

749
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.920
It was something of a miracle that Farkin sal actually located the spot Covey

750
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.400
had found for us when we finally looked up toward the hole itself. However,

751
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.990
it appeared a long, long ways away. It was at least a hundred feet or more.

752
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.810
And the green tunnel leading to it was narrow and dangerous.

753
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.100
As we were approaching,

754
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.050
I'd seen the tops of trees being whipped around by the gusting wind and knew

755
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:26.340
this would complicate matters even more. This was not going to be an easy exit.

756
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.780
So you guys are moving to this thing,

757
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:31.020
you're looking up at the tree tops and you see there's like a heavy wind cause

758
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:33.690
it's story that's just weather, wind like it's wet, it's windy out.

759
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.510
<v 2>And we had weather forecasts and it might be some problems with the weather.</v>

760
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.950
And so here we are as dark and I'm, I didn't tell the guises. I mean, yeah,

761
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.270
I knew that seeing those trees like that. This is, yeah,

762
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:51.680
and it was getting late. Dark. I needed your Knox.

763
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.980
<v 0>Yeah, you did wish you could add them bro.</v>

764
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.670
They want to totally change this whole scenario because the helicopter,

765
00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.690
because the aircraft too sure. Cause the aircraft would be, oh yeah, we got you.

766
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.090
Yeah we got you locked and we'll just wait. You guys can just, you know,

767
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:10.460
pitch a tent. Uh,

768
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.890
and the NVA, this still, you know, the,

769
00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:17.840
the big motto of the insurgence, right,

770
00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:20.270
is that they only fight when they want to and they don't have to fight if they

771
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:20.871
don't need to.

772
00:46:20.871 --> 00:46:25.871
And you don't imagine troops that don't have to fight,

773
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.910
just keep coming after you just keep your, you're laying waste to them,

774
00:46:31.911 --> 00:46:32.840
but they keep coming.

775
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:38.950
That must've be the value of capturing you all cross border would be so high

776
00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:45.200
that they just must have had serious intent to try and capture.

777
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.170
<v 2>Well, yeah. And then then too, you know,</v>

778
00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:49.930
you had that propaganda Dave been fed for all those years.

779
00:46:49.931 --> 00:46:53.140
They really believed it. They really believed that like the French,

780
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:58.030
we were there to occupy where we were just, there was combat in communism,

781
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.840
but then they never heard any of that stuff and he were dedicated.

782
00:47:01.841 --> 00:47:03.700
That's absolutely, Yes sir.

783
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.320
<v 0>Back to the book. The NVA had not given up. Its troops were hot on our tail,</v>

784
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.860
even though we had heard Twan claymore go off and had listened to the

785
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.690
[inaudible] work them over, you had to hand it to the NVA soldiers.

786
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.580
They were very tough and determined.

787
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.390
I again contacted Covey and asked for some,

788
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.780
asked for some tactical air command, air support to our,

789
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.810
and in a matter of minutes, bombs were falling and canons were blasting away.

790
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:35.800
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

791
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.270
<v 0>I'm sure I was impressed with the service as the NVA were surprised by how</v>

792
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:41.890
quickly the ordinance had been delivered.

793
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.260
They were learning a lesson the hard way.

794
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.400
If a recon team wasn't wiped out in the first few minutes of the fight,

795
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.190
the NVA would pay dearly for the mistake.

796
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

797
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.340
<v 0>But more than one NVA unit had experienced this firsthand.</v>

798
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.870
So that's kind of a creek, a critical few minutes, as long as it,

799
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.480
how long did it take for Eric to get on station? Usually

800
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:08.230
<v 2>well dependent, every, every worse from several hours to, in this case, uh,</v>

801
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.790
we were fortunate to make contact really early on with Covey. Hoot,

802
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.290
fortunately had a ones that were within a few minutes away.

803
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.540
So there was some luck involved very much.

804
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:22.930
I mean we saw them had that kind of response and layoffs.

805
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.860
<v 0>Did you ever preplan to have coverage at certain times</v>

806
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.070
<v 2>it would be a special mission. Yeah, like the ones we put in, the uh,</v>

807
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.190
sensors you put 'em in and you know,

808
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:37.390
you're going to be in the ground for two or three hours. He booked a times,

809
00:48:37.391 --> 00:48:39.370
had the assets set, so we have to go,

810
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:43.150
or something happens in between bing you can come in. But most of them

811
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.880
<v 0>where these were these aircraft necessarily briefed on the mission itself.</v>

812
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.910
So do they were they know coming in, hey,

813
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:54.510
this is the EO that they're working or these guys just come in there, right.

814
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:58.770
<v 2>They were just random pilots, ob, both, they has Pacific,</v>

815
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:01.180
a one units in the air force, uh,

816
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.840
in that timeframe that were specifically there for SOG,

817
00:49:05.841 --> 00:49:07.000
missions and Sar,

818
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:12.430
say search and rescue up north for any down pilots. So,

819
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.510
um,

820
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:18.040
they were very much attuned to our people working with Kontomble and with us up

821
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:19.600
north. Um,

822
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.740
so they knew everything was in a prairie fire. AAO.

823
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.210
Sometimes when you,

824
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.530
like when we're in echo for our first contact was with a fighter jet,

825
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.150
the heard the earth 10 beeper and responded to that.

826
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.710
So, and other missions, uh, another aircraft would hear it and um,

827
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.710
they would, if they had an ordinance then we had the, you know, get to Miri,

828
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.040
get them located to find us and,

829
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.980
and bring in the ordinance while he put the call out to get the Covey or the

830
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.760
Hillsborough or Moonbeam left the note.

831
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.050
He had a tactical emergency going on here.

832
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:01.510
<v 0>And you're doing all that on the radio while you're still fighting.</v>

833
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:03.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

834
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.890
<v 2>Yeah. We had had to spend a few rounds or lighten the load.</v>

835
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.963
<v 0>All right.</v>

836
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:16.450
Bubba Sao and foc had been busy placing explosive charges on trees while Hap

837
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.340
Antwan set out claymores facing south. I couldn't help but shake my head.

838
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.113
<v 4>Okay.</v>

839
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.000
<v 0>In wonder at Hap in a dark jungle with knight approaching,</v>

840
00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:27.430
he still had his ever present sunglasses.

841
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.470
We booed the charges around the trees and they were cut clean.

842
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:32.840
But the dense jungle refuse to let them fall.

843
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.720
We had not succeeded in making the hole any bigger.

844
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.560
So we just have to hope the rescue ships could manage to drop the ropes down to

845
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:42.210
us and then pray the ropes were long enough.

846
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.050
So you're trying to make that hole in the jungle a little bit bigger.

847
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.460
Like what diameter is this hole that you're looking at? Oh,

848
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:54.710
this is like 10 meters. Is it? Not that. Yeah, that's a good question.

849
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:58.700
Maybe 20, 30 meters. Okay. There's trees in it. Yeah, no,

850
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:02.600
it's at least it's a little bit more open as opposed to just chapel canopy

851
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.260
enclosed where you're just completely, we could see skylight,

852
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:10.370
you can literally see the sky, but, and then you try and blow some of the trees,

853
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.340
but they don't even fall down because there's too much junk to mines.

854
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:16.310
There are too many retreats. Yes, exactly. It doesn't even help. Didn't help.

855
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.590
Good Times. Add to the frustration.

856
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:26.290
Uh, we tried to blow up some palm trees, or actually it was Lafe laughs, uh,

857
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.920
platoon tried to blow up some palm trees that were obstructing their view,

858
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.020
you know, Overwatch position. Right.

859
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.080
And they blew up.

860
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:41.180
They said they sit so many charges on these palm trees. It was embarrassing.

861
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.500
I launched, I got rotten. No, they weren't. They didn't budge. No,

862
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:48.770
I got embarrassed. I've, I'm sitting there telling the battalion commander,

863
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.390
he's saying what I'm saying, hey, there's sir,

864
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:52.490
there's going to be another controlled debt and boom,

865
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:54.860
and then there's going to be another control debt and then boom,

866
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:57.830
and then so there's going to be another controlled bet and then boom. He said,

867
00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:00.080
what are they doing? I said, you tried to get rid of some bomb trees.

868
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:01.730
Don't worry about it. You know what sir?

869
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:03.890
We're just going to leave those palm trees. He had a score.

870
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:07.970
Right now there's palm trees. Three seals. Zero. Yeah, that's what happened.

871
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.470
Oh No. Those palm trees are hard. Resilient. Thick.

872
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:16.880
Alright. Back to the book with the helicopters on their final approach.

873
00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:20.150
I threw out another smoker need to mark our location and the rest of the team

874
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:23.180
began firing at the end VA, who had again pressed in on us,

875
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.210
we could barely make out, make out their shadows,

876
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:29.780
but they were definitely out there as evidenced by the green tracer rounds

877
00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:33.530
flying towards us. Covey hadn't been able to see my smoke,

878
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.300
so he asked for a pen flair. When I tried to fire it up through the trees,

879
00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:41.540
it struck a limb and bounced back being desperate.

880
00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:44.360
I told Covey I was going to shoot three tracer rounds,

881
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.620
red tracer rounds up through the hole and before he could scream, no,

882
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.180
I had pulled the trigger on my car.

883
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.680
15 I immediately realized what a dangerous move it was as I saw him pass

884
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:57.680
overhead in case there was any doubt in my mind.

885
00:52:57.681 --> 00:53:01.910
Covey took the time to let me know in no uncertain terms how stupid I was.

886
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.080
I believe the expressions dumb asked and shit for brains came into play

887
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.900
wildly. So you're in this situation,

888
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.160
you still took the time to call you shit for brains.

889
00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:18.100
You know you're about to die priories. Oh Man.

890
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.710
Yeah. And you know, I was thinking I, I'd never fought in Afghanistan.

891
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:24.710
I Dunno what they had and if they saw a lot of more green tracers over there off

892
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:27.840
to ask them. I'm a buddies and never really thought about that. Um,

893
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.760
so that's uh, that was that just like the normal little pencil flair,

894
00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:37.350
the little trigger thing. You crank around like a 22 round that fires up.

895
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.560
It's a tracer. Yes. You got it. It didn't penetrate through.

896
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:45.561
So you decide you're just going to fire some car rounds but fuck my tracers.

897
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.800
But they saw them, right? They did. Yeah. So hey one for till

898
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.740
just before the rescue choppers attempted to hover and drop the ropes,

899
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:59.220
I told Covey I wanted the gunships that accompanied them to work over the area

900
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:00.990
around us, particular to the south.

901
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.740
I wanted the NVA to be either dead wounded or with their heads buried in the

902
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.710
ground. When we tried to make our escape the muskets,

903
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:13.130
the men from the 176th assault helicopter company immediately went to work with

904
00:54:13.201 --> 00:54:18.201
their 2.75 inch rockets and they're Gatling like mini guns,

905
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:22.980
multi barreled weapons that could pump 6,000 rounds of seven six two a minute.

906
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.800
As the last rocket hit and exploded behind us,

907
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.520
the first hundred first airborne division slick appeared over the hole and the

908
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:32.460
jungle roof and dropped sandbags with ropes attached to them.

909
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.620
The helicopter was so high up,

910
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:39.210
it looked like a toy and even its powerful rotor wash couldn't reach us.

911
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.150
I could tell he wasn't being buffeted by the wind,

912
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.910
but he'd somehow managed to hold steady over the opening.

913
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.440
One of the sandbags attached to the rope had a strobe light attached to it and

914
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:52.560
we watched it bounce off the limbs as it fell toward us.

915
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.980
You guys, I guess they hadn't invented the jungle penetrator yet.

916
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:02.330
You know what it has, but not on us. Okay.

917
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.580
They had them on the HH threes and that's just the mean giants. Yeah.

918
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.770
For those of you that don't know, it's like a big metal,

919
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.690
uh Yap jungle penetrators, a big metal kind of spear,

920
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:17.040
almost spirit and it was still cabled as hook to a crane and it just drops down

921
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:22.310
and that weight and it's well shaped as opposed to just a random sandbag.

922
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:27.030
It bouncing and so this thing was hot.

923
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:31.290
This thing must've been like 150 feet up. Yeah,

924
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:35.370
they had the longest ropes in there. A surprise even got down to us

925
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.880
back to the book while we kept an eye on the ropes descending through the trees.

926
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:44.850
The NVA mounted a desperate last charge towards us.

927
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.870
Twan and Hep triggered their cake claymores and the rest of us opened up with

928
00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:53.550
all we had. Somehow in the midst of all the tumultuous activity,

929
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:58.080
the four [inaudible] had managed to rig themselves a Swiss seat using the six

930
00:55:58.081 --> 00:56:00.630
foot long pieces of rope we carried just for that purpose.

931
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:02.640
Bubba nine now tried to do the same,

932
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:04.950
but it wasn't easy to wrap a rope around my waist,

933
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.430
pass it between my legs and then finish tying it off on the right hip while

934
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.264
under fire.

935
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:14.610
But we managed to do it while the Indians held off the enemy and began to hook

936
00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:15.990
up for the lift out.

937
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:22.310
You guys ever think about using some kind of pre rigged like sitting or

938
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:24.050
something?

939
00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:27.510
<v 2>They, they were developing those as time they upgraded.</v>

940
00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:28.780
They had like the McGuire rig,

941
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:34.090
which is just basically a thick material that you could sit in and hook in.

942
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:39.480
And then later came out with the rigs. Um, I can't think of now, but it was a,

943
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.410
uh, an outfit where you had your harness built in sandy web gear with a harness.

944
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:46.110
So when, when it came down,

945
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.190
you just hooked link in Click and you're ready to go.

946
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.550
<v 0>I'd be thinking about that a lot when I, when I found this,</v>

947
00:56:52.551 --> 00:56:56.810
you try to tie us to a seat. Oh yeah.

948
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:58.760
That's awesome.

949
00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:03.290
We were getting low on ammunition grenades and claymores.

950
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:06.860
If we didn't make it out, it was going to be a very long night. In fact,

951
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.753
I wasn't sure we,

952
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.630
I wasn't sure if we could survive the night no matter what kind of air support

953
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.100
managed to reach us. It was now or never salad,

954
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:21.050
foc located three of the four ropes and it attached themselves to one of them

955
00:57:21.051 --> 00:57:22.250
using snap links.

956
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.940
When I asked Covey if the chopper could lift us all out at once, he replied,

957
00:57:25.941 --> 00:57:27.890
no way. It's going to take two lifts.

958
00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.620
No way is exactly what I thought in return.

959
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.680
There was no way we had enough time for two attempts.

960
00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.380
There was no way I was going to split the team either.

961
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.790
All six of us were going out together on four ropes or we were going to die

962
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:44.300
together trying call it comradery or fear,

963
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.100
but I was not going to leave anyone,

964
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:49.520
myself included on the ground for a minute longer than necessary.

965
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.440
I had heard all the horror stories I needed to about what could result in and I

966
00:57:54.441 --> 00:57:59.441
didn't want to be the subject of some gruesome tail around the bar at Fob one.

967
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.850
I suddenly had a bright idea and asked Bubba if he still had the claim worn with

968
00:58:04.851 --> 00:58:08.690
a white phosphorus grenade tape to its front when he nodded yes,

969
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.270
I told him to strap it as high as he could,

970
00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.620
as high as he could reach on a nearby tree facing south. He gave me his best.

971
00:58:15.621 --> 00:58:17.660
Are you out of your fucking mind? Look,

972
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:22.900
because he knew at that proximity the back blast would kill us all when we set

973
00:58:24.261 --> 00:58:28.310
it off. So he hesitated and I had to order him to do it.

974
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.980
Once he finished the remaining two little people paired up and hooked themselves

975
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.720
on to into one of the ropes while Bubba and I each took one of the remaining

976
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:36.554
two,

977
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.160
I wanted to balance out the weight distribution by having me on one side of the

978
00:58:40.161 --> 00:58:41.690
helicopter and bub on the other,

979
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.140
but it was impossible to tell for sure which ropes went where.

980
00:58:45.141 --> 00:58:47.900
So I took a wild guess and hope for the best,

981
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:52.640
best using the barrel of my m 79 to shield the flash from the NBA.

982
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.470
I used a strobe light to signal the chopper to begin to lift to begin lifting us

983
00:58:57.471 --> 00:58:58.304
out.

984
00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

985
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:02.880
<v 0>Did the chopper have enough power? Would we be dragged through the trees?</v>

986
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:06.780
Would the NVA managed to shoot one or all of us out of our saddles?

987
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:13.120
We were about to find out as the ropes became taught,

988
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:18.121
fire gunfire erupted from the West Sao fuck and I returned fire butter bodies

989
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.680
blocked the other's line of sight,

990
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:25.340
so they watched in frustration because my rope was longer than the other three.

991
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.050
I was the last to leave the ground.

992
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.770
This also gave me the additional seconds I needed to reload my empty car.

993
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:35.150
15 twice. Things were happening very fast,

994
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:39.920
almost too fast, and my bright idea demanded perfect timing. As we started up,

995
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.160
bubba reached out and ignited the delay flu's on the the,

996
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.380
the delay fuse on the last claymore,

997
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:50.330
the one he'd fastened to the tree with my feet dangling in the air,

998
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.590
I fired around from my m 79 still gaining altitude.

999
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:59.660
I then pulled the pins on two hand grenades and tossed him down onto the ground

1000
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:00.860
at about the same time.

1001
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:05.150
The claim more went off the back blast blue wonder us,

1002
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:08.300
but we could still feel its power and heat.

1003
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:14.630
The phosphorus was like a giant flash bulb going off in that frozen instant of

1004
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:17.960
illumination, I could finally see the faces of my enemy.

1005
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:23.860
They were hurting but still advancing with its engine screaming.

1006
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:27.770
The Huey somehow came up with the power it needed.

1007
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.720
It was agonizingly slow going and we had to push our way through some branches,

1008
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:37.040
but we were not being dragged through them. We were being lifted straight up.

1009
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.760
The NVA continued to fire at us and I had the unsettling impression that tracer

1010
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:48.350
rounds were passing between my legs and a sensation that will give any man pause

1011
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:49.184
for thought.

1012
01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:55.490
The team fired back on full automatic and we threw the last of our grenades back

1013
01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:58.920
to fiercely demented and determined beasts.

1014
01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:04.020
The NVA and our t Idaho remain locked in battle to the bitter end.

1015
01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:05.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1016
01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.110
<v 0>As we find the cleared the trees,</v>

1017
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.670
I immediately called Covey and confessed our little deception. The team is out,

1018
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.930
the whole team is out. I screamed into the handset. We came out together,

1019
01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.370
do not send in a second helicopter. I repeat. No second chopper.

1020
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:21.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1021
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.510
<v 0>The muskets rolled in and pull Vera's the ground.</v>

1022
01:01:24.511 --> 01:01:29.511
We had just left the a one were right behind them and as the muffled explosion

1023
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.620
and light flashes reached me,

1024
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:35.280
I found myself feeling a little sorry for the NVA troops down there.

1025
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.150
They were Valeant and dedicated soldiers. They would have,

1026
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.810
they would have been a credit, a credit to any army.

1027
01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.680
Those left alive would no doubt, have some stories to tell,

1028
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.870
but I doubted they would ever admit that a six man team had held them at bay for

1029
01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:56.871
so long and then escaped their most determined to efforts to wipe them out.

1030
01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.670
As for our Idaho, we were simply happy to be alive.

1031
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.650
Not something I would have bet on a short while earlier.

1032
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.010
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And we were just,

1033
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.530
I mean we were lucky too because of the, it was called,

1034
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.640
you were more lucky than that.

1035
01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.200
<v 2>I mean we used up a whole lot of luck on that one. But you know, it was a,</v>

1036
01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:32.010
we were lucky because we were still relatively high and not like the big peaks

1037
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:37.220
and deeper into Lagos and so the helicopter was able to pull us out if that had

1038
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:43.041
been in the middle of the day in with jungle heat and heat of the day.

1039
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.110
He never would've been able to if six of us out.

1040
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:52.070
But we weighed all that and I did list a cubby just rolled the dice because it

1041
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:56.220
was so dark or her at that point. So,

1042
01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.640
oh yeah. The recon guides smart on us one more time.

1043
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.140
<v 0>So when you, when you, once you got pulled out,</v>

1044
01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.930
would they just look for a clearing somewhere to set down,

1045
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:08.690
get you guys in the helicopter for real? No, that's the part that's put,

1046
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.170
they just froze your balls off

1047
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.180
<v 2>because with the Swiss seed, you know how it is with the rope. You just,</v>

1048
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:19.170
everything goes numb. Yeah. And so because it was dark particularly,

1049
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.790
they want to make sure that he,

1050
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:23.550
wherever he pours down is going to be somewhere in south Vietnam.

1051
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:27.570
So we were in the air. I just forget how long and I finally sat us down.

1052
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.290
But you can't walk. You just, you lie to like a cripple for a few minutes,

1053
01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:34.050
clip on clip. He can't flip.

1054
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:37.090
<v 0>So, so they, so they didn't really care about your comfort?</v>

1055
01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.230
<v 2>No. And we, and we didn't complain too much, but he's a, he, you go,</v>

1056
01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:43.840
you're all sweaty and you how it is when it five,

1057
01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.420
five minutes later you're at 5,000 feet, which is cold.

1058
01:03:46.421 --> 01:03:49.000
People forget how cold it is at 5,000 feet.

1059
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.760
<v 0>Yeah. You're freezing. Yeah.</v>

1060
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.900
Especially cause you're soaking wet and you're going 80 miles an hour,

1061
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.590
80 mile an hour wind. Yeah. All that too.

1062
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.700
Yeah. This is just, I mean it's just crazy.

1063
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.860
It's absolutely crazy.

1064
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.550
And this was just over and over again now. Um,

1065
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:16.320
you know,

1066
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.790
I spent a lot of time on the books on the last couple podcasts I wanted to,

1067
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:23.790
I wanted to kind of just ask you a couple of questions,

1068
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.200
get your thoughts on some stuff. Um, and I also,

1069
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.010
and I know we might have to come back again, but I've got saw chronicles here,

1070
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:36.660
I read that outstanding book, you know, and this is [inaudible] chronicles, uh,

1071
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:41.730
real quick talks about a big operation that, uh,

1072
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.410
took place that you weren't on,

1073
01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:47.550
but you got really good descriptions and talk to people operation tailwind.

1074
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:51.690
That's another one where helicopters are getting shot down.

1075
01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:55.140
I mean it's completely, completely insane.

1076
01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.680
<v 2>Yeah. And it is and no,</v>

1077
01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:01.890
no ordinary hilic these are the CS 50 threes Delta models the biggest a marine

1078
01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:07.050
corps had. And he took out two of those. I left one really banged up. Yeah.

1079
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:12.010
And when they inserted, they still, they had three wis on their assertion,

1080
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:17.290
but they had to get in for that to take the pressure off of the CIA operation.

1081
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.070
That was

1082
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.620
<v 3>their mission. September, 1970. Yeah, that's, so that's operation tailwind,</v>

1083
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.610
operation tailwind in that that book saw chronicles volume one and I hope

1084
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:30.660
there's going to be about 30 more volumes of solid work on it.

1085
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.900
The model that Anne and I came up with is that we're going to write till we die.

1086
01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.460
I like it because there's so many songs,

1087
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:38.860
stories they have never been told because we couldn't tell.

1088
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.020
And so many of our guys, I mean even when I, a fellow recon guy talked to him,

1089
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.200
it's like pulling information out.

1090
01:05:46.201 --> 01:05:49.270
I'm sure you've run into that with your people that they're not,

1091
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.540
they're not inclined to talk. Well, yeah. And you know, modest.

1092
01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:56.050
That's an interesting thing cause people to, not the wannabes at the bar,

1093
01:05:56.110 --> 01:06:01.030
you know, I'm a green baret or Omar seal and most of the guys, when you know,

1094
01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:04.020
people say, well you should have more guys from t your bruiser on there.

1095
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:05.170
You have to have more guys,

1096
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:08.620
more seals on the seals that I know that I would want to have on a lot of them.

1097
01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:12.550
They're still in or they don't want to come on that. They won't say a word.

1098
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.100
Yeah. They're like, Hey, no, I'm good. You know,

1099
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:20.020
and then obviously I got a lot of my friends that do come on and it's great when

1100
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:24.280
they come on. But yeah, a lot of guys are still doing it, you know,

1101
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.830
and so, hey, that's the way it is.

1102
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.190
I want once those guys retire and I do have some friends that are retiring soon

1103
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:34.510
and they're becoming on, so that's pretty awesome. Oh yeah. But um, yeah,

1104
01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:38.230
so the sod chronicles, uh, you, you've, like I said,

1105
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:40.900
hopefully there's 30 volumes of that right now. There's just one.

1106
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.700
We're going to try to turn across the fence and on the ground into audio books.

1107
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.620
That's awesome. That's our project right now.

1108
01:06:47.621 --> 01:06:52.100
And then as soon as we're done with that, to commence a, with volume two

1109
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:55.170
<v 2>and Wa, we got a couple of stories there. Uh,</v>

1110
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.670
well the one that we talked about and on the ground,

1111
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:03.040
the August 23rd attack, we've had a lot more research.

1112
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.470
We had this Gal who's, uh,

1113
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:09.190
as she was in emi and she has pulled out more information as we're going to pull

1114
01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.930
the whole thing together for the,

1115
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.980
hopefully the most detailed store in a night because it was such a tragic yet

1116
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:18.280
heroic night for the people that were there on the ground at night.

1117
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.180
And Larry Tremble up on a marble mountain here. So we have that.

1118
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.410
A couple of the stories, many other stories, but there's the other one.

1119
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.920
One of our guys went in for a bright light and they got shot out an a,

1120
01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:36.240
a, a for crashed as it was crashing.

1121
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.030
It hit three separate hilltops come to the restaurant and third one,

1122
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:44.470
they got to the second hill and got shot out.

1123
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.720
He went back 25 years later, he became a doctor on his own money,

1124
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:54.721
spent $70,000 to go back to Cambodia to try to find that forage.

1125
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.230
Just nod as conscience. They got in,

1126
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.110
got to the site and were run off by bandits.

1127
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:08.070
He meant back now it'd be two years ago with DPA and DPA was working on the

1128
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:13.040
second hill where the jet was on the Third Hill.

1129
01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:16.460
So he's able to go in to give them direct, uh,

1130
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.590
citing as to where to dig.

1131
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.770
So they're still working and he was on the ground digging things out with these

1132
01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:23.400
guys that's going to be in that book.

1133
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.310
<v 0>Yeah. So check out that book too. Saw Chronicles, um,</v>

1134
01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.600
<v 2>you're training. How ready</v>

1135
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.640
<v 0>do you think you were when you got to Vietnam? How ready for you for</v>

1136
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.820
<v 2>what you were about to encounter? Well,</v>

1137
01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:45.420
a lot better than the guys that went through just basic training and advanced

1138
01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:49.590
infantry training and I'm sure that commenced on units had in country training.

1139
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.930
Our in country training was, was good. He worked, we, you know,

1140
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:58.830
we practice calling in spooky, worked with the helicopters,

1141
01:08:58.831 --> 01:09:01.770
told about the dangerous and working with the little people,

1142
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.810
the history as well as some of the do's and don'ts about working with south

1143
01:09:06.811 --> 01:09:10.410
Vietnamese. And I thought that was good.

1144
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.890
But then two distal eight camp duty, which is,

1145
01:09:13.891 --> 01:09:16.300
I think all of that was geared for the eight camps.

1146
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.550
SOG was just in another level and that's why we always talked.

1147
01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:24.850
So people like Patois and spider parks, John McGovern, um,

1148
01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.680
Dick Gross theoret to senior east sevens are aesics is in camp,

1149
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:32.850
all of whom had run at night. US Green guys would talk to them,

1150
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:37.230
particularly after mission. And then we talked to each other. You know,

1151
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:42.190
John Walton came back from a target and uh, where, uh,

1152
01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:44.160
Tom Cunningham's leg was blown off,

1153
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:48.330
one of those little people that got shot four times and Captain Tin who saved us

1154
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.400
in October, pulled them out in August and we talked right away that night.

1155
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.870
Well, what'd you learn? And it always be this back and forth to try to,

1156
01:09:58.890 --> 01:09:58.920
uh,

1157
01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.300
get any sense of what happened with anything you could do to give us anything

1158
01:10:03.301 --> 01:10:06.930
for another edge on, in a field. And meanwhile, we're getting the Intel reports.

1159
01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:11.490
We knew Bella teens had been wiped out and the Intel reports about the sappers.

1160
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:15.290
So y'all bounced it out. And just key thing was comma.

1161
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:18.660
So in answer to your question, SOG was so different.

1162
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:22.290
A lot of with innovative to things we were doing there with the strings.

1163
01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.750
That was all things that you use today really advanced in no, no fast ropes.

1164
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.110
That was another dimension of when the war,

1165
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.120
so we're working at firepower, working with the air assets,

1166
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.250
um, and new weapons.

1167
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.910
But it was all I could experiment on things to learn as you go.

1168
01:10:41.911 --> 01:10:46.190
Try to take what's best and like Lynn black blow yourself up in a an ambush just

1169
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.640
for good luck to make sure it really works.

1170
01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:53.140
<v 0>Did you, when you were calling for fire, so I don't know if you know this,</v>

1171
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:55.410
but now it's like a school you go to, you,

1172
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:58.810
you go to a joint tactical air controller school and that's sort of your

1173
01:10:58.811 --> 01:11:01.570
specialty is calling for fire calling and bombs,

1174
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:06.860
<v 2>but you just, you trained in country to learn how to do it.</v>

1175
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:10.670
Yes. And again we talk to,

1176
01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:14.370
that's where we talked to spider and Pat walking specifically.

1177
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.420
And so that was it. That was more important than act actually going out,

1178
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.130
popping smoke and having a gun run. It was learning how to do it the right way.

1179
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:27.300
Now you're in a box and you never have a gun run, go cross.

1180
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:28.770
You could be in front, you know,

1181
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.520
you're front to left southeast and you'd direct it that way.

1182
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.730
In the how many inches, I mean how many feet or yards from your perimeter,

1183
01:11:35.731 --> 01:11:36.600
how many meters.

1184
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:42.290
And that applied when we got to the field because once we were up at Fubu by,

1185
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.340
we didn't practice airstrikes once we were on the ground, we did it.

1186
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.370
But it did it with confidence thanks to spider walk-ins and John McGovern

1187
01:11:53.371 --> 01:11:57.960
particularly, they sat with our, the green guys at night and made us, you know,

1188
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.823
understand that.

1189
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.910
And we had a couple of cases where people made mistakes and teams got hit and

1190
01:12:02.911 --> 01:12:07.380
lost people. They had a, they were bringing in some people, we are,

1191
01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:11.910
our body count was so low that they were bringing in people from other units and

1192
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.550
they would come in cocky and uh, when,

1193
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:17.120
once they got on the ground they would just maybe a little too cocky and hadn't

1194
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:21.870
listened to the lessons and some of the teams would let other people carry their

1195
01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.870
rest. Why character radio. And we have one team,

1196
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:28.560
young guy came in and called the airstrike cornerstone team.

1197
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.360
They came with a gun room right across the teams, Ron. And it's like that,

1198
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.020
you know. So yeah,

1199
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.620
<v 0>I, I that does not surprise me at all. I mean,</v>

1200
01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:42.010
when I'm listening to or reading your books,

1201
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.190
the fact that you guys were doing that,

1202
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:49.660
you could obviously had a massive amount of skill to not have that happen.

1203
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.410
Because like I said, these guys are looking at a jungle canopy.

1204
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.370
They're looking at some random bit of smoke that came out and yet you're

1205
01:12:57.371 --> 01:13:00.250
directing fire based on that. It's, it's, it's awesome.

1206
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:04.010
But I could see where somebody could easily, you know,

1207
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:07.290
make a mistake and you know, you give the wrong direction. You, you know,

1208
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.900
you look at your compass suspending the wrong way, you know, it's crew,

1209
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.980
close your weapon, you've got your cardinal directions.

1210
01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:15.300
I mean there's so many things that could go wrong that and yet,

1211
01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.010
and yet you're just doing, I mean there's times we're out there doing,

1212
01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:21.930
going runs for, for 12 hours, straight, long,

1213
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.390
<v 2>long time. And in like your case where you had the, um,</v>

1214
01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.740
the unit that you wanted to tack the building and you challenged that three

1215
01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:34.000
times in the last time you called it out because it was another unit,

1216
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.880
another seal team.

1217
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:39.560
Well we had that common sense thing on the ground to where we would direct it,

1218
01:13:39.561 --> 01:13:41.510
but if there was something that wasn't quite right,

1219
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:44.480
you put everything on hold until you got it right.

1220
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:45.850
<v 0>Yeah. That's,</v>

1221
01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:50.580
it's weird cause Leif and I wrote extreme ownership and we didn't really

1222
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.630
coordinate stories that we were talking about.

1223
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:58.770
And yet there's multiple stories in there about either blue on blues or

1224
01:13:58.771 --> 01:13:59.640
potential blue and blues.

1225
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:03.480
Cause man in a city like that with all these different different units running

1226
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:08.481
around all on different radio frequencies and a bunch of enemy Musha Dean

1227
01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:13.720
fighters running around in there too. It blue on blue was a very real thing.

1228
01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:18.721
And there would be probably the one case of blue on blue a day that would happen

1229
01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.870
and maybe one a week that would get reported, you know, but just,

1230
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.380
and I'm not talking where somebody gets shot but, but like, you know,

1231
01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.780
just all of a sudden you're taking rounds and you're like,

1232
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:29.680
where are those coming from?

1233
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:34.180
Oh that's another unit down there and maybe they're four and four and a one

1234
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:38.590
opening up on the, exactly. Exactly. So that it would happen all the time.

1235
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.360
Um, and that's one thing that was nice about, well for you it was not nice,

1236
01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:44.650
but it's less complicated.

1237
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.900
You're the only friendly guys out there that won't you,

1238
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.600
there was no friendly fire half than you guys. This US versus them. Yeah,

1239
01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:54.010
it's all them. Uh,

1240
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.530
when you got mission taskings, where'd they come from? Where they,

1241
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.980
where they coming from up above. Where you guys developing targets yourself?

1242
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:04.060
Where did that, how did that work?

1243
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.380
<v 2>Yes, we're happy mix of both. Um,</v>

1244
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.730
do the chain of command for SOG went to [inaudible] headquarters right to their

1245
01:15:10.731 --> 01:15:15.120
White House. They had somebody from dod that was there, some, I don't know,

1246
01:15:15.121 --> 01:15:19.100
some general somebody, but that was their mission was to keep an eye on saw.

1247
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:24.140
So they would send missions from near that would come to headquarters to each

1248
01:15:24.141 --> 01:15:28.160
have will be, and then our immediate action reports,

1249
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:32.390
and I'll go back after actually report to go back through the chain of command.

1250
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.360
So they knew what was going on at the White House.

1251
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.610
There's somebody at the warehouse, that's where we were told.

1252
01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.810
And on occasions if we had a target that we wanted to do,

1253
01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:46.580
B 52 strike that, we'd go back through the chain of command and then

1254
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.000
<v 0>approval on it. But the, the, from what the public knew,</v>

1255
01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:54.690
the public knew we were bombing none. He didn't know anything about the answer.

1256
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.990
Cambodia then they didn't even know we were bombing Laos and Cambodia, correct?

1257
01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:00.990
<v 2>Nothing. There are no reporters in there.</v>

1258
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:05.670
There's no communist news network back then. Um, so,

1259
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.360
and the communists would not talk about it because they had agreed to the

1260
01:16:12.211 --> 01:16:15.600
agreement of not having their people, their cadeau. He said, Hey Leon, I can't,

1261
01:16:15.601 --> 01:16:20.550
but they're neutral. We respect them. Lion Dogs. And we said the same thing,

1262
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.240
but ours,

1263
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.560
we just went in with our recon teens as opposed to them just going down and

1264
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.880
enslaving all the people to work there, work with us, help us open the roads.

1265
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:34.100
And you know, if we saw indigenous people, we were not open fire on it. I mean,

1266
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.840
it's like you're not going to go out to the local people don't any better just

1267
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.610
caught in the middle. Um, but the NBA,

1268
01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.300
they, they, they tell you, work with us so you die. Yeah.

1269
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.440
<v 0>Well, you, you know, in one of the books you're talking about how the,</v>

1270
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:51.830
the NVA treated the [inaudible] people,

1271
01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:56.180
they're so horribly that the indulge troops that you worked with like hated the

1272
01:16:56.181 --> 01:16:57.560
NVA. Oh, they hated them.

1273
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:02.180
These NVA had raped their women and beat their wives and just done horrible

1274
01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:05.540
things to them after they were there for, they were there to fight.

1275
01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.520
<v 2>Yup. And they, they cut nobody any slack.</v>

1276
01:17:10.521 --> 01:17:13.850
I mean America today particularly are snowflakes.

1277
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.880
Don't know what the soldiers of calmness from we're really like in the field and

1278
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.030
just nasty people. And um,

1279
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.790
that's what we were fighting and they were dead.

1280
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.870
They were really dedicated and their,

1281
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.900
their sense of purpose because there have been so thoroughly indoctrinated and

1282
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.040
they really believe what they're doing even though they're working off a

1283
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.150
propaganda. Yeah.

1284
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.980
<v 0>When you, so the, so you would come up with some of the missions,</v>

1285
01:17:43.981 --> 01:17:46.920
some of the missions would come down to you. Majority came,

1286
01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.090
majority of came down to you.

1287
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:52.540
<v 2>You know, they would have sometimes I think there would be,</v>

1288
01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.800
we got to get a team on the ground. That's why we were going in primary.

1289
01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:58.510
Secondary all gets shot out, eat lunch,

1290
01:17:58.511 --> 01:18:02.380
go back and try again because they just wanted to get somebody on the ground and

1291
01:18:02.381 --> 01:18:05.410
that would just be your sr automatic area reconnaissance.

1292
01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.770
And that's because they had something they wanted to see their,

1293
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.360
some something like that sometimes harassed me.

1294
01:18:10.361 --> 01:18:13.420
People would just want to get a team on the ground so they can be pour to

1295
01:18:13.421 --> 01:18:16.450
headquarters at night. We have one or two teams on the ground.

1296
01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.980
Where do you mean that they're just wanting to, hey, look what we're doing.

1297
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.873
Yeah.

1298
01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:26.200
Now I'll shortly guys or an s three would deny that and emphatically,

1299
01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:29.710
but it felt like that. Yeah. You came back and said,

1300
01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:34.711
here's the new target and they'll pick an LC for you while you're flying back to

1301
01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.050
the next target. Did you ever, what if you,

1302
01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:41.140
what if there was a mission that you looked at and you said, hey, this is dumb.

1303
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:42.940
This doesn't make sense.

1304
01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.470
What does only one that I declined around about Christmas time of 68 I just had

1305
01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:50.080
a feeling and a team went in and I was word,

1306
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:53.500
but they were on the ground for five days and it was a dry hole and they came

1307
01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:55.450
out without any shots fired or anything,

1308
01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:59.020
so that's the only time I officially turn something down.

1309
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.460
<v 0>Maybe that's why he had a bad feeling and tell if you knew nothing was going to</v>

1310
01:19:02.461 --> 01:19:06.780
happen. It wasn't your kind of target. I don't want a boring target.

1311
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.670
Uh, so if so, how did that go when you, when you said no, what'd you say?

1312
01:19:11.671 --> 01:19:14.040
Hey look, my guys need rest. Sorry. Yeah. Not this time.

1313
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:15.180
We had the right to say no, no,

1314
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.950
<v 2>it was frowned on. Yeah. But you know, they had,</v>

1315
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:23.660
at that time we had a couple of new teams in camp and Rodney had came in and he

1316
01:19:23.661 --> 01:19:26.900
was just good one zero. So he went out, he came back, said, hey, you know,

1317
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:31.820
that target was pretty cool. We uh, slept a lot. Dry Hole, dry hole was really,

1318
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.760
so I had all these feelings man, and I was hyperventilate.

1319
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:38.630
Interiorly I figured we're gonna run into hoochie men is in, you know,

1320
01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.400
a couple of divisions. Again for good luck.

1321
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:45.140
I hadn't seen the division in a month. Now it's like, okay,

1322
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:50.180
but no, see and that kind of show me how your mental state of mind too.

1323
01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.390
Cause I was really, that's why I believed that.

1324
01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:57.890
And the system was such that you could turn it down and we took it from there.

1325
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.020
Where you say that's where you believed you,

1326
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.030
you believed that it was a bad target.

1327
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.530
I just felt we had been so lucky and going through the Christmas,

1328
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:08.670
thanksgiving and everything else that are,

1329
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.530
I just fell our number's going to build,

1330
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.950
you know how [inaudible] and I just said this could be the target.

1331
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.470
I said m a target and those were particularly, there were the, uh,

1332
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:20.840
the ones who are all along the DMZ river, uh,

1333
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:25.080
west of Vietnam that went deeper into Laos and they were nasty.

1334
01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:28.320
We lost several teams up there. I figured this could be our turn.

1335
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.300
So buzz wrong.

1336
01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:34.300
<v 0>Uh Huh. Now did you ever get that feeling again?</v>

1337
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:37.890
<v 2>Not, not, not in a strong enough to act on it.</v>

1338
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:41.190
And I mean the carrot in the back of my tiny mind, he was like,

1339
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:45.060
that's the last time you thought you were going to die. You didn't.

1340
01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.800
<v 0>I had some guys that thought they were going to die every time we left the wire.</v>

1341
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:52.340
You know what I mean? God bless him. But he's, no man, this could,

1342
01:20:52.341 --> 01:20:55.520
I could be the night man. No, I'm going to feel good about this one.

1343
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.930
And they'd always get their gear on.

1344
01:20:56.990 --> 01:21:01.340
But I'd say I always looked at it as a good sign. If certain people were scared,

1345
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:03.110
if they wouldn't, wouldn't have been scared.

1346
01:21:03.111 --> 01:21:06.380
I would have been nervous cause they were so scared all the time. I think man,

1347
01:21:06.381 --> 01:21:07.970
this must be really stressful for him.

1348
01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.060
<v 2>Yeah. I never wrote the letter like dear mom and dad, I'm dead now.</v>

1349
01:21:13.061 --> 01:21:15.660
If you read this letter, I'm dead. Yeah. Um, I know,

1350
01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:20.661
I just felt and hope that we somehow get through it and uh,

1351
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.940
and you're right about the scare thing. You, you want that emotional edge.

1352
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.960
A little fear can go along. It's a great motivator. But I wouldn't,

1353
01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.920
I wouldn't go out with the guy if somebody was saying, hey man, I'm not afraid.

1354
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:36.010
I'm afraid of you. Do you go somebody else?

1355
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:41.570
<v 0>I also used to get the feeling that if you were scared like that,</v>

1356
01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:46.050
if you were, if you were scared and you were going to be hesitant,

1357
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.260
that was going to be bad. Sure. Like I,

1358
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:54.950
I was more worried about guys that were like hesitant or I felt like if they

1359
01:21:56.671 --> 01:22:01.671
were hesitant on the battlefield that would work out bad for them.

1360
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.450
The guys that I always felt like, okay, if someone's aggressive, not, not,

1361
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:11.470
not unafraid and suicidal like that, but just, hey, oh yeah,

1362
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.740
I'm going to go do, I'm going to, we're going to go kick ass right now.

1363
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.940
I was fault. That was the attitude to have was to be aggressive was to be like,

1364
01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:22.350
okay, yeah, we're, oh you want, you got an op for us, cool, we'll go do it now.

1365
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:26.670
We turned down ops too. There was ops where we looked at and said, man,

1366
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.850
this is not good and this is a massive amount of risk.

1367
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:33.660
I mean there was areas where there was areas where

1368
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:40.460
there were take IED strikes on vehicles and like, you know,

1369
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:43.510
and went in a big Id hits a home v everyone dies or oh yeah,

1370
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.530
three out of five people die or something like that. I mean it's,

1371
01:22:45.531 --> 01:22:49.290
it's very catastrophic and there was one target. They were looking at it for us.

1372
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.180
They asked us to do and the, there was like one road going in,

1373
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.930
they'd had multiple odd big IED strikes and then they wanted us to,

1374
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:02.760
they were asking if we could take out mortar.

1375
01:23:02.761 --> 01:23:06.880
He was either a mortar team or an IUD in place or we are looking at it and where

1376
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:10.990
the mortars had been launched from, we're all over the place. So it was just,

1377
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.290
it was one of the, one of the types of missions where we looked at it and said,

1378
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:14.471
hey,

1379
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:17.590
there's got to be a better way to do this because us going up there is not going

1380
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:20.350
to be worth it because a lot of your missions were point missions. Right.

1381
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.420
What do you mean by that? They give you a target,

1382
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:26.350
get to the point and wipe it out. Uh,

1383
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.330
I would say my first deployment it was go capture, kill bad guys.

1384
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.740
That was my first deployment to Iraq.

1385
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.530
We were in Baghdad where that's mostly what we're doing in the middle of the

1386
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:37.390
night. We'd find out where a bad guy was, we'd go get them.

1387
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:41.350
And that's what my second deployment in Ramadi,

1388
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.890
mostly what guys were doing was Overwatch sniper,

1389
01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:48.940
Overwatch positions set up in buildings so that when the bad guys would either

1390
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:52.270
maneuver on friendly forces or they'd be out doing what they shouldn't be doing,

1391
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:56.660
right, the guys would take them out. So that's, that's pretty much the end.

1392
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:00.490
There's all kinds of crap in between that. Everything from, you know,

1393
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.360
everything from doing just reconnaissance of areas to counter mortar types that

1394
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.240
you just, you know, a lot of other, a lot of other things would happen.

1395
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:14.740
But primarily it was direct action missions going out to take out a target or

1396
01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:18.880
these sniper Overwatch types. But you know, we'd be doing big clearances too.

1397
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:22.810
Big conventional clearances. You know, we had our, we called them John Ds,

1398
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:27.240
which is John d means it means soldier in, in Arabic. Right.

1399
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:30.760
And, and so we call them John Ds. That's what they called themselves. John Ds.

1400
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:34.570
But so we had Joan Dee's like, you guys had little people like [inaudible].

1401
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.160
We had Indian forces, they were Joan Ds.

1402
01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.520
And so we would do very conventional missions with the jumbies of them and us,

1403
01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:42.251
you know,

1404
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:45.130
we'd be overseeing them as they cleared big sections of the city and we'd be

1405
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.640
working in conjunction with the army. So yeah,

1406
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:51.310
we did a little bit of everything, but um,

1407
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:57.240
<v 2>that brings us back to our side of it where you can give yourself a mental</v>

1408
01:24:57.330 --> 01:24:57.961
delusion,

1409
01:24:57.961 --> 01:25:02.550
which is our mission is to go look an area recon.

1410
01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:07.560
So theoretically you're going to get inserted quietly and go about your job and

1411
01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:09.650
that's different from you what your point missions,

1412
01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.630
a whole different field wine. So [inaudible] okay.

1413
01:25:12.631 --> 01:25:17.310
We're hoping to get into our mission to come back and report or find a fuel

1414
01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:20.120
line, blow it up or it gets appeal.

1415
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.400
Dubby get the wiretaps give them Intel where you're going out and doing your IUD

1416
01:25:26.461 --> 01:25:29.490
pickups in and mortars. That's totally different.

1417
01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:31.470
So at least in my mind,

1418
01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:36.120
I think that's part of my self comfort factor that we're going to get inserted

1419
01:25:36.121 --> 01:25:39.840
in carbon. Nice quiet mission for five or six days. Take some pictures.

1420
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.590
That sounds great. And come on back. It's really cool. Yeah,

1421
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.850
we're behind enemy lines.

1422
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:48.780
What percentage of operations would you guys get contacted on? Oh,

1423
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:53.310
we left always left under fire. The only question was how much never had,

1424
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.720
well one,

1425
01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:00.100
they won a where we got you opened up our discussion tonight there where we got

1426
01:26:00.691 --> 01:26:03.000
pulled out as no fire there because they came in and got,

1427
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:08.140
we had a great Ron and we were going to get some pow but they pulled us out

1428
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:11.510
right away. So there's no gun fire in that mission. But other than that,

1429
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.600
every time we left under gunfire is the only question how much.

1430
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:17.420
So Tyler is like the whole jungle was wide enough,

1431
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:22.100
sometimes only be two or 300 and yet you still fooled yourself into thinking,

1432
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:26.600
Hey, this recon is going to be different. But yeah,

1433
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:31.130
so I guess my point was I looked at it and I still look at it.

1434
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.180
If you are nervous about getting hurt,

1435
01:26:35.181 --> 01:26:37.040
if you're nervous about something going wrong,

1436
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:40.670
to me that's when something goes wrong. When you're nervous about it. Now,

1437
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:43.160
I'm not saying you should be arrogant about it and think, oh,

1438
01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:47.090
we're going to get away with whatever. But I'm saying like,

1439
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:49.940
when you're doing this, even when you're doing like a sport, you know,

1440
01:26:49.941 --> 01:26:52.820
even when you're doing some physical activity, if you,

1441
01:26:52.821 --> 01:26:55.940
if you're afraid you might get injured. To me, that's when you get injured.

1442
01:26:56.270 --> 01:27:01.250
It's when the, when you're, when you're afraid, I think fear can hurt you.

1443
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.910
And that being said, the other side of the coin is if you have no fear,

1444
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:08.720
well then you're definitely, you're definitely at risk. He who has a taste lost.

1445
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:09.470
There you go.

1446
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:13.070
So there's a dichotomy there that's got to get balanced between and that's where

1447
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:15.200
we're so lucky we have to sell,

1448
01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:20.201
did a great job of vetting are our indigenous troops and to go from spider parks

1449
01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:24.920
to Wilkin to Bubba and then back to Lynn black.

1450
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:29.930
And then when I left the team was in Lynn's hands and I came back,

1451
01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.430
lends the one zero, what more could you ask for? So that was just the, you know,

1452
01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:38.990
very fortunate. What was your, uh, your mission planning like?

1453
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:43.580
So you guys get a tasking. How long does it, how long did you guys plan for?

1454
01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:48.560
Uh, for, it's just an area of mission, uh, area. We constant, very little,

1455
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:52.070
put the wire tabs opposite. We did ours now as a training on that.

1456
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.950
And then as time went on, you know,

1457
01:27:54.951 --> 01:27:59.951
first it was just sal who could do it and then south trained have and fuck to

1458
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:03.020
guys who are strong to do it all. And um,

1459
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:05.270
as well it'd be aspect of it.

1460
01:28:05.271 --> 01:28:08.000
And then we cross trained each other and we even had,

1461
01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:13.001
so that hap would begin to teach a couple of young guys,

1462
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.190
basic English. So if any of us got killed,

1463
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:20.240
Hep could take over the radio or the ditch could takeover.

1464
01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.130
So a couple of guys like chow and hung as it went. Ha Honk came on a team,

1465
01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:26.750
they picked up English pretty quick.

1466
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.690
So he worked with him and we practice calling,

1467
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:33.080
working on the radios to problems with the batteries and things like that.

1468
01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.720
So we cross trained everything back and forth.

1469
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:40.310
And the wire tap was one particular one where we had several guys on a team

1470
01:28:40.311 --> 01:28:43.490
trained up to do it all. Everything for knowing about the batteries,

1471
01:28:43.491 --> 01:28:47.500
watching it, keeping a battery indicator to get an uh,

1472
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.840
put the wire up the tree or a telephone pole.

1473
01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.770
And when you came down and you covered it with mud, that was from that area.

1474
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:58.640
So it would look like was part of that area and try to cover the wire.

1475
01:28:58.670 --> 01:29:02.010
But as far as the actual mission planning of,

1476
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.660
<v 0>okay, here's where we're going in tonight,</v>

1477
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.670
that didn't take you much because you were running repetitive type missions,

1478
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:08.890
right?

1479
01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:12.820
<v 2>It's a high degree of similarity. The most important thing was the training.</v>

1480
01:29:12.821 --> 01:29:17.770
So when you may contact, you could take care of yourself and how to react,

1481
01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:21.280
try to continue to mission. But these were like [inaudible].

1482
01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:25.480
So once you have been seen or compromised, the mission's compromised.

1483
01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.820
<v 0>Would you would be flying in.</v>

1484
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:34.410
What was your degree of certainty on where you were inserted?

1485
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.770
<v 2>Oh, we knew very clear where we're gone.</v>

1486
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:41.430
So like in a case we would talk to Covey,

1487
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.760
we'd send a three LZs down to Saigon and Kabi would go pick a site and then he

1488
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:50.940
would tell me on a radio kid, this is where we're gone. And you would be,

1489
01:29:50.941 --> 01:29:54.000
would you be looking at your map as you started? And he knew what,

1490
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:54.961
what the frame was.

1491
01:29:54.961 --> 01:29:59.961
Who would be in within that map that we are that second map that we a car,

1492
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.500
remember when we first,

1493
01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:07.040
<v 0>you know, w w as a radio man, believe it or not, when gps first came out,</v>

1494
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:10.430
the radium and kind of got saddled with the gps because it was a piece of

1495
01:30:10.431 --> 01:30:11.840
electronic equipment, right?

1496
01:30:11.841 --> 01:30:14.870
And then no one else could work with electronic or women. So,

1497
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.140
so I would be usually a lot of times be carrying the GPS as opposed to the

1498
01:30:18.141 --> 01:30:21.140
appointment. And the point man, you know,

1499
01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:26.090
we're still using map encompasses the early nineties but the GPS wouldn't always

1500
01:30:26.091 --> 01:30:27.530
work well in a helicopter.

1501
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.450
And so sometimes they took me, you know,

1502
01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.920
this was some training operations where I learned, oh,

1503
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.810
so well I'm not where I think I am.

1504
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:39.920
And you get out and that gps finally finds itself and you realize you're three

1505
01:30:39.921 --> 01:30:42.800
clicks away from where you're supposed to be or whatever, and it's bad.

1506
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:46.610
And that's why we'd go, I went back to, hey, when I'm in a helicopter,

1507
01:30:46.611 --> 01:30:49.310
I'm on a map. So that way when my boss looks at me and says, Hey,

1508
01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:52.310
we were where we were supposed to be. You either yes or no,

1509
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:56.150
like don't get out of the bird or okay, we're good. But, but that,

1510
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:58.130
so I was thinking about that for you guys.

1511
01:30:58.131 --> 01:31:01.160
You'd be doing the same thing as you approach to, okay, Yup.

1512
01:31:01.161 --> 01:31:04.450
There's that train feature. There's this other train feature. Cool. Where we're,

1513
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:05.690
where we're supposed to be.

1514
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:06.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:10.260
And then Laos also want to know where the water was because some the targets,

1516
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:13.650
they had more, more streams of things. So we, we carry less water.

1517
01:31:13.651 --> 01:31:18.060
I have lily just carry one canteen with the purification pills so that if we're

1518
01:31:18.061 --> 01:31:22.350
in for it several days, like with echo four, but ended the first day a,

1519
01:31:22.351 --> 01:31:24.980
we had gone through some water and took,

1520
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:29.010
we all took a turn going to his little stream, put the purification pills in,

1521
01:31:29.190 --> 01:31:32.610
hit the water and let us sit for a couple hours before we drank it.

1522
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:36.240
Did you get acclimated where you needed less water? Oh yeah, absolutely.

1523
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.640
Less water. And um,

1524
01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.270
I can truly say I never dedicated and layoffs.

1525
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.940
Somehow the body just tightened up in May.

1526
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:50.490
They had no ships pills that Gaza take silly.

1527
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.670
Lilly would not go to the bathroom. Um,

1528
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:58.020
I worried about those that were asked me to. Oh yeah. I was like,

1529
01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:01.660
Hey, for numerous reasons that the creative mind can think about,

1530
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:05.650
but so I didn't, but my body never had. And then we never did it.

1531
01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.680
<v 0>D and The d you guys didn't a TMI.</v>

1532
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.320
Did you guys, have you guys, did you guys use imagery at all?

1533
01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:17.270
Like overhead imagery? Nothing.

1534
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:21.970
<v 2>No. Um, some of the, uh, uh, gunk, the cobras,</v>

1535
01:32:22.890 --> 01:32:24.000
no or no? Some of the, uh,

1536
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:29.440
first CAV helicopters had some, I'm

1537
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:34.200
trying to think what an IRR they would have. Um,

1538
01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:38.200
the ability to see through the clouds and style. Okay.

1539
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:43.750
And it was just a very primitive boasts beginning whereas the Cobra gunships

1540
01:32:43.751 --> 01:32:44.380
didn't have it,

1541
01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:49.120
but the first calf could get low into the jungle and navigate in fog and stuff

1542
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:50.380
to get down to our guys.

1543
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:51.430
<v 0>But no,</v>

1544
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:55.960
you guys wouldn't see photographs of the areas where you are going into at all?

1545
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:57.190
<v 2>No,</v>

1546
01:32:57.190 --> 01:33:01.930
the only time was down in Cambodia for that missionar where that was.

1547
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:04.960
Um, now that base was really close to Saigon,

1548
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:09.550
close to McAfee headquarters and um, we may have had overviews.

1549
01:33:09.551 --> 01:33:13.310
I just forget for up north, that one down in there. I stuck.

1550
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.230
It stuck in my mind.

1551
01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.380
<v 0>And then what was your, what was your optempo like? In other words,</v>

1552
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:20.090
how often were you going in the field?

1553
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:24.840
<v 2>Well, through November, December, we, if we weren't on the,</v>

1554
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.200
if we weren't on the ground, we were getting ready to go back the next day.

1555
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.510
That's why it was such a push, push,

1556
01:33:30.511 --> 01:33:35.490
push and I rotated or a little people out because they were just getting beat

1557
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.690
and we had trained them up. So by November, December,

1558
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:41.550
all the cross training we had done all those months, you know,

1559
01:33:41.890 --> 01:33:45.970
south could take a day off. Uh, even half could take a day off.

1560
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:49.650
We had a couple of guys that could speak enough English if anything happened to

1561
01:33:49.651 --> 01:33:53.550
me or Baba, they could take care of the radio due to comms.

1562
01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.410
And, uh, so we rotated them through, but it was every day.

1563
01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.910
And then if the weather can we get a break? And, um,

1564
01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.260
so there was no, and the rule of thumb was if you ran a mission for five days,

1565
01:34:07.261 --> 01:34:07.861
you came back,

1566
01:34:07.861 --> 01:34:12.450
you got five days off so you could clean up and get back in shape,

1567
01:34:12.451 --> 01:34:14.880
get the team ready. But for that period of time,

1568
01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:19.050
we had minimal teams who the teams at fob one had become.

1569
01:34:19.051 --> 01:34:23.670
So between disease, um, health,

1570
01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:27.330
God's getting wiped out, teams getting blown away. Um,

1571
01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:30.780
we were one of the few teams and camp TDOT is fully operational.

1572
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:36.060
So that's why I was the other pressure we had. Like I remember the me to saying,

1573
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:38.760
hey, you only got to, we got your, you're going to say afternoon,

1574
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:41.520
here's your target, go eat. Okay.

1575
01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.530
So we did it and then we got shot out and come back the next day.

1576
01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:51.910
And so there was no, this, the op temple was supposed to be robbed.

1577
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:56.310
My Mr Five to 10 days if you're lucky. Well it never happened. Some guys did,

1578
01:34:56.730 --> 01:34:59.150
don't get me wrong, we had some guys that were able to stay on the ground.

1579
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:01.430
Amazing. But in our case we didn't.

1580
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.640
So it would be very flexible.

1581
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.490
Didn't really take less than less than six guys. A few guys ran with four.

1582
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:14.540
And uh, at the end of my tour of duty, a second tour,

1583
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:15.770
I tried a four man team,

1584
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.400
but we had this whole way she would do radio stuff just so we could move faster.

1585
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:21.410
Just wanting to try anything. Something different.

1586
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.420
Because when we had moved fast,

1587
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:28.130
we had success getting away from the LZ and that caused them confusion.

1588
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:31.640
So if we broke what our slps were, it worked.

1589
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:36.320
But the eight man was too much. Too much. I felt more comfortable with sex.

1590
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:37.540
It was a lot of firepower.

1591
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.720
We had the m 79 near and then all the America's had DM city nines too.

1592
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.750
<v 3>And then how often would you get legitimate rnr?</v>

1593
01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.010
<v 2>Uh, you had one a year. One for a tour of duty.</v>

1594
01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:54.250
You get five days anywhere you want it. So I went to Hong Kong,

1595
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:58.570
bought my stereo bad and poker money. Sat Out. Paul,

1596
01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:02.960
Nice Stereo. Stady art sent home. No, mom and dad, they,

1597
01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:05.680
they and my little brother put it together. He was good at that stuff.

1598
01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:10.270
<v 3>Uh, yeah, that's it. Other than that, there was no [inaudible].</v>

1599
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.140
If we had gotten that pow ah, then you would've gotten more here. We would have,

1600
01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.880
what was the offer for catching a bad guy? An rnr, anywhere in the world.

1601
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:22.880
And then you've got her a a hundred dollar bonus. How many days? Five.

1602
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.940
Like a regular rnr. Oh yeah, it was, oh yeah. That's why we lost it.

1603
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:33.420
I cried when spider said no, a hundred bucks. How much was 100 bucks? How about,

1604
01:36:33.421 --> 01:36:36.320
how much was your normal paycheck? How much do you make a month back then?

1605
01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.930
<v 2>Oh, I don't know. Um, when, when we went through jump school,</v>

1606
01:36:39.931 --> 01:36:44.370
now I'm only a private e one. Right? I got 100% pay raise,

1607
01:36:44.371 --> 01:36:48.690
my jump pay because I was getting paid $50 a month. The jump pay was 55,

1608
01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:53.730
55 was a constant. Then later maybe he too was like 75.

1609
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.160
I never paid, it was never enough.

1610
01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.410
<v 3>So 100 bucks was like a hundred bucks. Was like a a month to pay basically. Yes.</v>

1611
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.920
<v 2>Money even then a c note was a big deal. Absolutely.</v>

1612
01:37:07.190 --> 01:37:10.190
<v 3>And then when you guys would come back, you're talking about this,</v>

1613
01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:13.580
how you would sit there and debrief, would you debrief your, your team,

1614
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:15.920
would you guys sit down and debrief? What happened? What went wrong,

1615
01:37:15.921 --> 01:37:16.754
what went right?

1616
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:21.020
<v 2>We always talked to a little people. Um, maybe not right away because, uh,</v>

1617
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.670
as to would want to know what happened.

1618
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.600
So we would go in for an immediate debrief, go back to the team,

1619
01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:31.550
make sure he had food for tonight and stuff and then go back for a final, uh,

1620
01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.810
after action report,

1621
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.450
which would go through talking about everything from the vegetation,

1622
01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:40.760
a type of hills animals you encountered on a [inaudible].

1623
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:44.970
Just crazy stuff. The foreigner, oh my God, the questions to his,

1624
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.410
he was just after awhile I was like always the same. There's layoffs. Yeah.

1625
01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:52.460
Triple canopy is pretty dangerous. The NVA a pretty dedicated.

1626
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:55.660
And then anything specifics off the target from the,

1627
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.740
from that to take a learn from. How long,

1628
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:02.970
how long did it take you to become the one? Zero well, my case,

1629
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.190
um, I got in country, you may aspire to put me on a team at the end of May.

1630
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:11.910
We trained June, July, uh, had a couple in country,

1631
01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:15.940
like little IAM bushes locally. And then we had a, uh,

1632
01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:18.600
the practice mission in August.

1633
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:23.310
And then we did at first wiretap and not a wire tap, but the air force sensors.

1634
01:38:23.311 --> 01:38:27.180
We did two of those missions as September cause we had the monsoons too.

1635
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.500
It's a lot of glue between the rain. We had like weeks, we would just rain.

1636
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:36.390
Seemed like a rained every day. Ever see a horizontal rain?

1637
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.510
Uh, yeah. Seen as much,

1638
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:42.630
which are you guys would not run missions during the monsoon season. No,

1639
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:46.200
you use too much. Too much. When you going to be too bad,

1640
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.860
your saw your socked and you couldn't get out of the base. The to kink.

1641
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:53.010
We couldn't get to the base. So how long, so how long was that?

1642
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.960
Like four months before you were, yeah, four months. And, and,

1643
01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:01.680
and how many missions did you run before you are one? A one zero.

1644
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.870
I had five missions under my belt. We had a two practice to two, um,

1645
01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.010
wiretaps and then don woken echo for,

1646
01:39:11.530 --> 01:39:15.720
and by that time, um, when he came to me he said, Yo, welcome,

1647
01:39:15.721 --> 01:39:19.080
got promoted to a copywriter and um,

1648
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:21.900
cause pat walkers was leaving, there's an opening.

1649
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:26.100
So he went there and they gave me option. Are you ready?

1650
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.120
Well,

1651
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.120
we a see what happened with Alabama with Lynn black in October when they put a

1652
01:39:32.191 --> 01:39:34.860
guy on a team that didn't have no experience.

1653
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:39.150
So I talked it over with happened sal. I said, look, this the situation,

1654
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.930
I don't know who they're going to give us. So we're about, I'll,

1655
01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.980
I'll be the one zero and spider had thought that was okay to do it,

1656
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.090
talk to walk-ins and uh, they all said, well,

1657
01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:55.230
you're ready if you want to try it. And we didn't know who could,

1658
01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:59.100
they had new people coming into camp and some of these guys were the older ones

1659
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:02.550
who had no experience on layoffs. We didn't want anything to do with them.

1660
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.100
And it has, some of the younger guys are coming in.

1661
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:10.250
Like I'm like Jim Robinson who was on a team for one mission and um,

1662
01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.530
we didn't know how to would stand up. So our guys were happy and,

1663
01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:21.360
and bubby came in and Bubba and the guy named the freshman, Doug Laterno,

1664
01:40:21.361 --> 01:40:25.950
the freshmen came in together and the freshman got picked for Virginia and I got

1665
01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:30.330
Bubba. They were buddies. They got be training group together. Yeah, that's

1666
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:31.930
you.

1667
01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:36.930
So you'd been in the army for like a couple of years and younger in charge of a,

1668
01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.200
of a recon team. Yeah. Got in the army.

1669
01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:43.560
December 66 became a one zero on October 68.

1670
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.560
So you figure years, almost two years. Yeah.

1671
01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:52.290
Cause the whole SF training between that and going through basic jumps school.

1672
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:56.860
And then we had that uh, training before Vietnam d r t t training,

1673
01:40:56.861 --> 01:41:01.180
which was different, but that's just because we're Camo geeks.

1674
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.710
Oh, the RTT training was just radio, radio teletype. Got It.

1675
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.190
They want a top secret clearance men on those machines.

1676
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.740
<v 3>How much did you see the tactics that you guys were using</v>

1677
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:17.850
<v 2>change over time?</v>

1678
01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.170
Um, I think by the time, like when you read, we few by Nick Brock housing,

1679
01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:30.400
someone's guys were all carrying either rpds or an [inaudible].

1680
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:34.050
So they were just going and heavier and um,

1681
01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:38.100
they would go into bigger team and um,

1682
01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.970
they were just anticipating the contact more whereas we thought we would try to

1683
01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:47.380
go in and try to escape and of aid and to the point where you hope he can get at

1684
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:51.360
least some the mission done or to get some Intel reports about troop movements,

1685
01:41:51.361 --> 01:41:53.940
trucks, stuff like that or get a good wiretap.

1686
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:59.200
<v 3>So the biggest thing that changed was the guy started going in heavier and</v>

1687
01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:04.090
actually bringing automatic weapons or belt fed machine guns. Sure.

1688
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:07.930
That makes sense. I every single time I read any of your operations,

1689
01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:12.060
I want nothing more than a belt van machine gun. So do we use,

1690
01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:16.210
we didn't know who was going to carry yet. The seals had a, the stoner. Oh yeah.

1691
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.250
Did you guys ever think about using that?

1692
01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:21.350
<v 2>About it? A lot but, and it was a great system.</v>

1693
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.510
We heard many great reports about it, but again, the stoner system,

1694
01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.920
you needed audio ammo,

1695
01:42:27.921 --> 01:42:32.120
you had to get the supply system set up and we just weren't sure if we were

1696
01:42:32.121 --> 01:42:35.690
going to be able to get the guarantee if we converted, who would it be?

1697
01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:36.590
Just Americans.

1698
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.150
We want everybody with common weapons so that if somebody gets blown up,

1699
01:42:41.210 --> 01:42:43.730
their weapon gets blown. Didn't know how to use the other guy's weapon,

1700
01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:44.603
your honor.

1701
01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.710
<v 3>And you have the same magazines, same everyone's all that. Sure.</v>

1702
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:52.790
And what about the mission set itself?

1703
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:54.820
<v 2>Did you guys,</v>

1704
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.780
did you notice that change over time while you were there?

1705
01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:03.550
Later we began to get more point targets like in on the ground.

1706
01:43:03.551 --> 01:43:06.230
One of my favorite stories was, uh, the Frenchman.

1707
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:10.270
He goes into a Cecile type mission. Um,

1708
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.720
the CIA comes and says, we know about the NVA.

1709
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:19.170
They're floating a 55 gallon drums down to river and to a storage area deep in

1710
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:25.420
layoffs. So he wants you guys to go in, but we all trust you with the device.

1711
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:29.570
They had a device that they screwed into a 55 gallon drum.

1712
01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:33.190
And so what we're going to do is, and that would be like a tracking device. No,

1713
01:43:33.191 --> 01:43:36.700
no explosive in nature. Oh that's right. That's right. Yeah. It's okay.

1714
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.050
So here's what,

1715
01:43:38.690 --> 01:43:42.160
so we're going to meet you on this hilltop and lay us.

1716
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:47.680
So Doug was the one one on a Rt. Virginia guther wall was the one zero.

1717
01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:50.890
They go in Hump three days, get to the mountain top.

1718
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.700
There's the CIA with a couple guys. Okay, here's your device.

1719
01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:00.110
Go installed. Now come to the wall was a marine.

1720
01:44:00.111 --> 01:44:03.110
So you think that he'd be the guy doing a swimming, right? He goes,

1721
01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:06.450
I'm an e six freshman, you're an e for hit the work.

1722
01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:11.660
So the CIA gave to disclose the device, hump down the mountain,

1723
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:16.140
get to the river and then now they're on a river with all the stuff gone by the

1724
01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:21.210
drums and some have NBA troops riding the drums or being present with a boat or

1725
01:44:21.861 --> 01:44:26.450
something. So in between artists, Doug strips down, goes in, gets a drum,

1726
01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:29.180
brings it back, puts in the explosive device,

1727
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:34.990
swims it back out and it comes back soak and wet and not happy mean he's from

1728
01:44:36.681 --> 01:44:39.950
southern California. So He's, he's really not happy.

1729
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:45.070
But two days later to get an extract it now to King Bees come extract and her

1730
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:51.821
getting distracted as his use explosion and had sonic boom that literally moved

1731
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:57.570
the aircraft and the guards were on the string swinging from the Sani.

1732
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:01.700
Poon looked back, Derek goes a fueled up. Wow. Beautiful mission.

1733
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:07.550
So those are kind of the point mission, the wire tactic in the pipelines.

1734
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:11.720
We have more reports of pipelines and then also there are doing some trail work

1735
01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:16.070
trying to figure out how to re uh, look like it'd be a stream,

1736
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.570
but they have things. That's one of our missions,

1737
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.750
like the orchid mission to get in there to see,

1738
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:24.470
well how to corner food splitter and can we use, go in and while you're there,

1739
01:45:24.471 --> 01:45:28.870
blow it up. May with a truck on it. Sure. Jack. Uh,

1740
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.270
let's talk a little bit about gear. And you put,

1741
01:45:32.271 --> 01:45:35.480
you actually have a section in Sar chronicles and it's an across the fence to

1742
01:45:35.481 --> 01:45:39.620
where you talk about stuff you carry and stuff that you didn't carry. And uh,

1743
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:44.810
some of the stuff that you didn't carry, no underwear, never.

1744
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.640
No socks. Never.

1745
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:52.130
And that's because you're just want to stay dry as much as possible. Yeah.

1746
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:56.460
And both those things just hold water and keep moisture in. Yeah. And uh,

1747
01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.880
then black, uh, when he came,

1748
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:03.860
all I had to made it was still on my underwear cause I went over with eight or

1749
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:07.290
10 pair of the jockey shorts. Right. And it's,

1750
01:46:07.530 --> 01:46:11.230
so I was done on my last pair and the May was literally stealing.

1751
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:12.620
Could they sell them on a black market?

1752
01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.870
They're relatively cleaned and relatively new.

1753
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:17.780
Mom bought me a whole bunch of stuff and socks and everything.

1754
01:46:17.781 --> 01:46:20.870
So we had army socks. But, so anyways,

1755
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:25.700
I talked to Len's L W I can't believe my mail has been still in my underwear

1756
01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:29.630
because we pulled down here the little I down, there's my underwear. So I said,

1757
01:46:29.631 --> 01:46:29.811
here,

1758
01:46:29.811 --> 01:46:32.750
take the last one and have good day and lingoes don't wear that stuff because

1759
01:46:32.751 --> 01:46:37.130
you get jungle rotten, crotch rot. And he says the same thing.

1760
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:39.650
Put away your socks. Well,

1761
01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:43.490
you know if first couple of weeks the jungle boots were really tough on my feet,

1762
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:45.850
but he was right there. And once you get a bunch,

1763
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:50.190
get your feet broken in and your jungle boots broken in and so you go the water.

1764
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.450
We did some of our in country stuff. We were in the rice patties. Oh my God.

1765
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.260
But they would dry out quicker in have to worry about the socks.

1766
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.930
So no helmet, never

1767
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.810
<v 3>no body armor. Nope. And your body armor sucked back back to its big clothes.</v>

1768
01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:10.790
Just heavy. It didn't work well. It didn't work. Uh,

1769
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:14.980
no intervention tool. Never. No bayonet,

1770
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.870
no sleeping bag, no hammock, no Poncho, no Poncho liner, no ground pat. Correct.

1771
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:26.800
You are not traveling for comfort. Never. We had to carry it.

1772
01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.890
As you know, you don't have that feeling.

1773
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:32.760
What you take into the field you're carrying. You don't have your Mave with you.

1774
01:47:33.250 --> 01:47:38.100
Yeah. That that rucksack gets heavy too. So quick. Yeah.

1775
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:42.360
<v 2>And ours is like small. We had the indigenous rucksacks s and w.</v>

1776
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:47.240
And so once you put the radio and put the sweater underneath the radio so it

1777
01:47:47.241 --> 01:47:51.960
protect your back and they throw some rations, master a couple of extra ammo,

1778
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:53.130
magazines and air.

1779
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:58.850
And then extra hand grenades am setting nine rounds and a battery for galock

1780
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:03.720
<v 3>man. Yeah. You guys, uh,</v>

1781
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:08.190
no dog tags, no military id or idea of any kind. No rank, no name tags,

1782
01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:11.550
no jump wings, no CIB, no patches, no unit identifier, nothing.

1783
01:48:11.850 --> 01:48:15.270
No pictures of Mama. No pictures of Mama. Right? Totally slick.

1784
01:48:15.271 --> 01:48:20.100
So those are the things you didn't carry things you did carry car 15. Ah,

1785
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.030
love it. You love the car 50.

1786
01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.090
<v 2>Oh yeah, sorry. Back my second tour. A rock Myers was an s four. He's healed.</v>

1787
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:30.440
He had been wounded. I came back, he says, you're back.

1788
01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:34.580
Said I got a present for, he gave me a brand new car. 15. It was in a box.

1789
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:39.440
Take it out. Stillness, audit, tinfoil and all the oils and greases and stuff.

1790
01:48:39.441 --> 01:48:42.740
And he'd take it out. Took it down to range. It was perfectly zero.

1791
01:48:42.741 --> 01:48:44.150
Never touched that with crazy.

1792
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.270
Just put a little a cloth strap on it and went to work.

1793
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:52.670
<v 3>And, and you never had problems with that weapon? Never. Yeah,</v>

1794
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:55.940
they uh, did yours have a forward assist on it?

1795
01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.710
Did you support assist? Yeah, so that was uh, that was a car 15.

1796
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:05.780
Wow. So the name 16 would it with a classical stock and a short and barrel.

1797
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:07.820
Yeah. See it's weird.

1798
01:49:07.821 --> 01:49:11.030
So many people and myself being one of them complained about the car,

1799
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:15.680
the car 15 or the end four frame and now the enforcer a lot nicer.

1800
01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:18.630
I made them forge a lot heavier till you got two rails and everything. Oh yeah.

1801
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:21.650
Yeah. We can load things those out. They look like,

1802
01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:24.620
I think about a cigarette later on here. Some guys,

1803
01:49:24.621 --> 01:49:26.420
I wouldn't be surprised that they didn't have that on there too,

1804
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:30.530
so that's awesome. You use the Cravat for your sling?

1805
01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:34.240
<v 2>Yes. Sato well, yeah, I did that a door.</v>

1806
01:49:34.241 --> 01:49:37.920
My second tour could it had to crevasse quiet and, and then, uh,

1807
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.700
God forbid if he ever needed a cravat and closed Caribou.

1808
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:45.690
I always wore one around my neck, had one on my head. And then one on the car,

1809
01:49:45.691 --> 01:49:48.000
15 of course you carried, we

1810
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.990
<v 3>had Corvettes in case as a very bottomed, a rucksack we would get is sort of a,</v>

1811
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:56.320
one of those things that never wear a sling.

1812
01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:01.330
And some guys would say that get caught up. And that's just, man,

1813
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.710
especially when you're in a leadership position, you need a sling,

1814
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.950
cause you gotta look at your map, you've got to pull out, you know,

1815
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:08.230
you've got to do stuff, you know.

1816
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:12.240
And the other thing is you don't have a slang and you get blown up. Yeah. Get,

1817
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:17.140
where's your weapon? You have no idea when you wake up. So, yeah. Um,

1818
01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:20.860
but then there's some, you know, some people just, they wouldn't carry a slang.

1819
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.750
Mark Leaves one machine gunner seed, just no slang. Nope. That was like, man,

1820
01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:26.080
the thing to do was no slang.

1821
01:50:26.970 --> 01:50:30.970
All of them 60 or these days of mark 48 really? Yeah. Yeah.

1822
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.960
Uh, how strong this guy strong, strong,

1823
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:40.240
and the 79 you carried sawed off. Oh yes.

1824
01:50:40.241 --> 01:50:43.960
I cannot believe that. Me and my guys did not think of selling off our,

1825
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:46.150
I'm 70 guys cause I guarantee guys would've sought off the end.

1826
01:50:46.151 --> 01:50:50.620
I said well yeah, my first self afflicted wound was from a solid off m 79.

1827
01:50:50.621 --> 01:50:53.830
What'd you do? Well we're in a process of cutting them down.

1828
01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.440
So the question was how far he cut the barrel down.

1829
01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:01.560
So we finally cut it right down to the last hinge where on?

1830
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:07.300
It's the last one that's to the bottom of the frame. Got It. So you crack it,

1831
01:51:07.301 --> 01:51:11.500
put the round and so we kept bringing it back. So we're down to range.

1832
01:51:11.501 --> 01:51:15.310
We're there. And the question was, because you cut the barrel off,

1833
01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.000
it needs the number of rotations. Now are our weapons guys knew that.

1834
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:20.680
But I was,

1835
01:51:20.681 --> 01:51:24.520
me and Rick Howard were comma guys and I didn't really ask the question was

1836
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:28.960
fired. She, so on this day I fire it fairly close,

1837
01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:34.620
it goes being popped in I noise instead of nine makes and then it went all like

1838
01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:38.500
pop bang like that. And I go, Oh damn.

1839
01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:42.540
So I go to Rick Harrison, I think a B just hit me. He pulled my strips,

1840
01:51:42.541 --> 01:51:47.230
he had dumb ass usually shot yourself. My first self-inflicted moon.

1841
01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.980
But the good news was that I'm sitting,

1842
01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:52.300
I worked and then of course we cut the handle down to just have enough to you

1843
01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:56.740
could hold on to because that way is less less weapon.

1844
01:51:56.910 --> 01:52:01.240
You still had all the firepower that cut that weapon down by half. Oh yeah.

1845
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:03.310
I was looking at the pictures you have, but in your book it's,

1846
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:08.350
that thing is tiny, tiny but effective. Charlie hated those things.

1847
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:12.490
And at one point you had a, you had a holster for that thing. Yeah.

1848
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.270
John Wayne. That's still, that's still in layoffs with my a saga knife.

1849
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:21.650
A I had it, somebody had crafted it and I put it on. It's, yeah,

1850
01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:25.270
that was perfect. But uh, never had a dull.

1851
01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.800
But from that point I just like everybody else, we just carried on those d-ring.

1852
01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:32.620
We taped it. So be quiet though.

1853
01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.200
You carry 34 20 round mags each path,

1854
01:52:38.230 --> 01:52:41.890
each with 18 rounds each. So that's 612 rounds for good luck. Yeah.

1855
01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:45.010
And so that's how he carried extra like a,

1856
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.230
with a couple of extra clips and in case we needed to reload the uh,

1857
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:52.430
34 magazines. And you went on,

1858
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:56.900
you mentioned you had few missions where you are down to your last one or two at

1859
01:52:56.901 --> 01:52:59.360
least twice. I remember echo four was the first time.

1860
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:05.410
Did you always hang onto your magazines when you are out at dependent on the

1861
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:11.870
degree of intensity of the firefight. If I had time, we keep best for a happy,

1862
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:15.170
I'll bring back my damn magazines. Did you stuff on your shirt? Yeah.

1863
01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.170
Yeah cause the web gear would be tight. So uh, I don't know.

1864
01:53:19.210 --> 01:53:22.820
Our jungle fatigues. We're out. Yeah.

1865
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:26.600
So you had the pants, but then the harness from the, uh,

1866
01:53:27.210 --> 01:53:30.710
in a web gear with everything in when I came in we'd stuffed magazine,

1867
01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.670
our shirt and then, but with body armor you can't do that.

1868
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:38.480
So now guys carry like pouches or just dropping their leg cargo pockets or

1869
01:53:38.481 --> 01:53:39.350
whatever. Yeah.

1870
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:42.470
And our preferred thing would have bar bells because you could put four

1871
01:53:42.471 --> 01:53:46.280
magazines in and one across the top. And it was a nice pouch.

1872
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:48.710
The bar belts that they have from World War II,

1873
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.350
perfect for the a 20 round magazines, that's a lot of just,

1874
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.921
you know,

1875
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:59.921
we would normally carry seven to 10 30 round mags.

1876
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:04.610
So we carried like, I mean sometimes I guess more than that, but not no,

1877
01:54:04.670 --> 01:54:08.310
600 rounds where you were anticipating being alone for awhile. No,

1878
01:54:08.410 --> 01:54:10.820
we weren't fighting divisions worth the people either. So

1879
01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.770
yeah, it, you know, and I guess we did,

1880
01:54:15.771 --> 01:54:18.740
what we did have is we always had heavy machine guns, you know,

1881
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.190
so that makes a big difference too. I guess. You know,

1882
01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:26.150
we would have mark 48 which is seven six two and then the mark 46 which is five

1883
01:54:26.151 --> 01:54:26.984
five 60 let's,

1884
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:32.620
that's basically like a little stoner and a and m and 60 the modern versions of

1885
01:54:32.811 --> 01:54:36.080
those two things. But yeah, so we had assault too, right? Yeah.

1886
01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:39.950
Well that's the mark 46 is a song. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um,

1887
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.480
yeah. So we had those and those guys would carry a lot of browns,

1888
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:49.790
a lot arounds like 800 to a thousand sometimes more on the kid like that.

1889
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:53.600
Over a thousand. Yeah. And I had guys go,

1890
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:57.470
Winchester go run out of bullets. Really? Yeah. With that many.

1891
01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:01.550
So yeah, I guess maybe that was the differentiator.

1892
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:05.300
You carried 10 to 12 frag grenades.

1893
01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.630
That's a lot of frag grenades,

1894
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:11.510
I guess when you're going and picking fights with divisions,

1895
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.550
you've got to carry a lot of for aggregates. Oh yeah.

1896
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:17.270
And they always kept the last one. That was the one up here,

1897
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:23.510
just in case it'd be appealed. W uh Huh. Oh yeah, absolutely.

1898
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:28.850
We would carry, I don't know. Well I would carry like a one or two.

1899
01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:34.210
Well, how often would you be? I just got laughed at it's official. Don't laugh.

1900
01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.830
How often would you, how often would you need more than two then?

1901
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:42.380
Hopefully never, you know, and especially I'm in a leadership position,

1902
01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:45.840
I'm hopefully hucking grenades, but uh,

1903
01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:50.940
yeah, no, you know, the big difference, especially in Ramadi, I mean in Ramada,

1904
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:54.420
I remember explaining to the guys that relieved us, you know,

1905
01:55:54.421 --> 01:55:58.500
we had a big overhead imagery and I put my hand on the map and I said,

1906
01:55:58.650 --> 01:56:00.600
no matter where you put your hand on this map,

1907
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:04.500
you'll be touching a friendly unit. So like in, you know, this is, you know,

1908
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:07.990
probably within three to 500 meters of you anywhere you were in reminder,

1909
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.670
there's a friendly unit. Really. So that's why, you know,

1910
01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.750
you are going to get reinforcement, you're going to get tanks,

1911
01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.930
you're going to get Bradley fighting vehicles. So yeah.

1912
01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:20.850
But in between that time, you earned your pay half to earn your pay. Yeah. Uh,

1913
01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:24.840
yeah, I was talking to late life. That's another thing.

1914
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:26.190
So it was Lafe Lafe Scout,

1915
01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:30.180
a chapter in dichotomy of leadership where he's talking about preparing over

1916
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:33.930
prep, over preparing for too many contingencies and he talks about,

1917
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:36.420
it was his first patrol out on,

1918
01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.090
outgoing out with the marine corps and a daytime patrol.

1919
01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:41.610
And he's talking about how much stuff he cared, he cared all this stuff.

1920
01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:42.810
But one of the things he carried as you know,

1921
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.980
eight grades or something like that and you know,

1922
01:56:46.981 --> 01:56:51.540
he reflects on how that was. We just way too many. I was like, hey man,

1923
01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:54.840
you know, tilted, go out in the field with less than 10

1924
01:56:57.870 --> 01:57:02.310
so definitely a io did are grenades.

1925
01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:06.150
I wonder how much you would have changed if you had to wear body armor or if you

1926
01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:09.150
would have decided not to or whatever. You know, it's interesting.

1927
01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.530
That's an interesting development.

1928
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:15.540
If we even had today's stady art never would have worn it to,

1929
01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:19.180
it's just too much weight and you have to be able to move. I mean, you know,

1930
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:23.230
eventually you're so damn lucky, no bullets are going to hit you. Yeah.

1931
01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:30.120
That's why I crawled a lot trying to keep the little profile, but uh, no,

1932
01:57:30.121 --> 01:57:34.830
I probably would have declined it because of the weight as it was, uh,

1933
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:38.970
in our AAO. Maybe another AOE with different situations,

1934
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:42.910
more flexibility with assets. And the,

1935
01:57:43.110 --> 01:57:46.950
the thing that's interesting is one of the reasons why you wear a helmet now

1936
01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.360
isn't just to protect your head.

1937
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:51.240
It's because that's where your nods mount onto your night vision.

1938
01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:53.570
My vision mount onto your, so you,

1939
01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:57.060
they do have a contraption that's like a headband looking thing.

1940
01:57:57.061 --> 01:58:00.960
I don't even think they make it anymore, but, but where you could wear that,

1941
01:58:00.961 --> 01:58:04.080
but you know, your nods mount on your, your night vision mounts on your helmet,

1942
01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.880
your, that's just the way it is. I've seen those.

1943
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:09.060
Ciliates we've got fist down and dogs. That's really cool. I want one too. Yeah.

1944
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:12.990
Yeah. That's go time when those thoughts flipped down. All right.

1945
01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:15.810
But instead of wearing a helmet, you wore a corvette,

1946
01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:20.490
the green for that green curve out on your head, one around your neck. You had,

1947
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.820
you wore regular army fatigues. Yeah.

1948
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.310
There's sterile fatigues that had, um,

1949
01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.230
a Tupacs up top with an angle and to pockets down here to hung out.

1950
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:34.740
And then we customize them. We had, um,

1951
01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:40.050
the tailor put in pockets here. So for mirrors, maps,

1952
01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.970
morphine, serviettes, Sasol close

1953
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.813
<v 2>right here.</v>

1954
01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:47.250
And then we had a pockets on each arm that put other things up.

1955
01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:51.710
<v 0>There were pinned flares, other things from Google that,</v>

1956
01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:56.270
that we did too. So we did even before, even the nineties before the everyone,

1957
01:58:56.450 --> 01:59:00.770
because now the fatigues come issued with pockets on the arms and everything,

1958
01:59:00.771 --> 01:59:05.550
but we used to take them off and so I'm on. And that's where you'd keep your,

1959
01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:09.770
your pans and your notebooks and your pen flares near and your signal mirror.

1960
01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:12.740
Yeah. And then on the ones on your chest, you had maps and morphine,

1961
01:59:12.741 --> 01:59:16.190
your extra notebook, your, you are see 10 emergency radio.

1962
01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:17.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:21.170
<v 0>And then you had a, you wore a watch. A Seiko. Yeah.</v>

1964
01:59:21.710 --> 01:59:25.790
Aluminous watch you work gloves. Always.

1965
01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:27.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:31.800
<v 2>Just cut out the thumb index finger. Then the middle finger, just cut it to tip.</v>

1967
01:59:32.010 --> 01:59:35.880
So you grabbed a tape on the magazine sort of firefighters? Yep. Same thing.

1968
01:59:35.881 --> 01:59:38.640
Same thing we would do, but you always wear gloves or gloves.

1969
01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:42.300
Otherwise your hands are just getting destroyed out. Oh jungle. Forget about it.

1970
01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:45.960
Yeah Cause Lot of times we wind up get, get a new pair of gloves.

1971
01:59:46.770 --> 01:59:51.330
We just get torn up so much in the jungle and fatigues those, wait a minute,

1972
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:55.940
wait a minute of vines and the thorns because you know there are, wait a minute,

1973
01:59:56.030 --> 02:00:00.510
when you get caught into it, if you walk into your leg, goes into the pins,

1974
02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:01.500
just come together.

1975
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:04.740
So you had to stop and then get the pins to get your leg out.

1976
02:00:04.741 --> 02:00:07.890
Otherwise it goes deeper into your, into your leg.

1977
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:12.070
<v 0>What about, did you carry any kind of mosquito net for your head? No. How come?</v>

1978
02:00:13.110 --> 02:00:13.850
<v 1>Cool.</v>

1979
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:15.980
<v 2>Never thought about it. And mosquito net for the head.</v>

1980
02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.280
<v 0>Yeah. Well I used to, this was like the most brilliant thing.</v>

1981
02:00:20.281 --> 02:00:23.640
I think it was an Australian guy told me this you I would to have like a little

1982
02:00:23.641 --> 02:00:28.641
square of mosquito netting [inaudible] and when we would stop patrolling,

1983
02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:32.310
I would take out that little square, put it over my head,

1984
02:00:32.311 --> 02:00:36.390
right over my right over my floppy hat and talk it in and all of a sudden you're

1985
02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:38.040
not getting chewed apart by mosquito.

1986
02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.340
<v 2>Oh yeah. Good. One night we,</v>

1987
02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:44.260
the one time we did a practice mission east of the Asheville in the morning I

1988
02:00:44.261 --> 02:00:47.850
couldn't, I couldn't open, my eyes have been bitten so much. Great.

1989
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:52.520
By mosquitoes. My face was puffed out. You need that mosquito. I needed to help.

1990
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:56.740
Had I only known, I sort of thought about her. Talk about that. Yeah.

1991
02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:57.690
<v 0>I had a guy,</v>

1992
02:00:57.691 --> 02:01:02.100
we were doing some training and none of us had mosquito netting except for the

1993
02:01:02.101 --> 02:01:06.660
officer. And so the officer was sleeping heartedly like just fully.

1994
02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:12.080
And one of the other young listed guys was catching mosquitoes and putting them

1995
02:01:12.121 --> 02:01:14.910
inside this guys, while he was asleep,

1996
02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:19.430
he woke up covered in this valley.

1997
02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:22.700
Those mosquitoes were trapped in there with them. They were trapped in there.

1998
02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.620
They couldn't get out. They were just having a feast trapped Hungary,

1999
02:01:25.621 --> 02:01:30.030
mosquitoes, mosquitoes. Yeah. So, but no, not for you know,

2000
02:01:30.031 --> 02:01:33.300
mosquito net. No, I hadn't thought about that one.

2001
02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.333
Leeches.

2002
02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:36.963
<v 1>Oh</v>

2003
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:39.800
<v 0>you guys ran into a lot of leeches. Always.</v>

2004
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:42.560
<v 3>Yeah, we had the a bug repellent for that.</v>

2005
02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.980
And so would even read the bug repellent on him once you got sucked on by a

2006
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.460
Leech. Yeah, they would instantly fall. But you always try to wait,

2007
02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:54.440
try to see if he could jiggle them off because you knew that wee bugbee pound

2008
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:57.650
could be smelled by bad guys. So

2009
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.820
then you had your on your web gear,

2010
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:05.270
which was the old World War II web gear you had on your left harness.

2011
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:10.271
You had your k bar handled down or a saga knife or saga knife until you lost it

2012
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:15.530
too. I love, that's what we need to do. A recovery mission four.

2013
02:02:15.531 --> 02:02:18.200
Get that site back. Yes.

2014
02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:23.750
A handle down. Sure. That's how you rolled it.

2015
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:26.480
Cause this way you pull it out and you're ready. What's up period?

2016
02:02:26.481 --> 02:02:30.080
He's deployed out in the jungle. You might get caught up in the vines. Got It.

2017
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:32.540
Got It. Uh,

2018
02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:35.660
you had hand-grenades there cause you were basically covered in hand grenades.

2019
02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:40.160
Oh yeah. Uh, smoke you had there,

2020
02:02:40.190 --> 02:02:44.090
you had some, some bandages there on your right harness.

2021
02:02:44.091 --> 02:02:47.090
You had your strobe light, you had more hand grenades,

2022
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:51.560
you had your d ring and you had more smoke grenades.

2023
02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:56.420
Then on your belt you had one canteen. Usually

2024
02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:01.880
depending on the target, sometimes it'd be maybe two, but usually one.

2025
02:03:01.881 --> 02:03:06.410
And then one I had a second one in my, in my backpack rucksack.

2026
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:08.750
You normally wouldn't get, what'd you get thirsty?

2027
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:13.400
Was there normally enough water in the jungle? Wasn't as bad as Cambodia.

2028
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:18.170
So, but yeah, you get thrust cause you're humping up and down. Um,

2029
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.200
there's a couple times we particularly in that day we went straight up with the

2030
02:03:21.201 --> 02:03:24.290
orchids. That was a day we got we all out of water.

2031
02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:30.110
Not Fun. No. So you had one canteen, you had a Willy Pete grenade,

2032
02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:32.150
you had your survival acts,

2033
02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:36.650
which was the Franklin Warren survival acts type two and d.

2034
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.620
That's type one wasn't mine. I wanted to type two.

2035
02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:44.400
I looked him up and had like a hook at the top. Yeah.

2036
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:48.080
Another Blaine you went through when you came back on the, on the back pool,

2037
02:03:48.081 --> 02:03:52.310
you could try to make it effective to cut up, particularly with cutting vines.

2038
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:56.330
That thing came with you all the time. Every mission.

2039
02:03:57.650 --> 02:04:00.860
I got it home onto my desk right now, a case and the tutor comes in, I'm ready.

2040
02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.130
I like, it just isn't true.

2041
02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.010
There's feeling lucky luck.

2042
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:11.150
You meet Mr. Tilt compass around your neck.

2043
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:14.600
You used a corvette for your belt. Yes.

2044
02:04:15.170 --> 02:04:17.750
So the belt I was talking about before is the belt of your web gear,

2045
02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:20.770
but just the health of your pants was just a, was a corvette.

2046
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:25.310
You carried a Swiss army knife, you carry the gas mask always.

2047
02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.950
You always carried a gas mask.

2048
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:32.080
We had teams that got hit and the in camps that had been hit by the enemy used

2049
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:34.700
to. Yes, sure. And they use,

2050
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:38.070
I forget what the incidents war, but there

2051
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v 2>were a couple times that the enemy had used gas on our people in Lagos as well</v>

2052
02:04:43.891 --> 02:04:47.070
as with a CIA operation. Now, we weren't told that,

2053
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:52.430
but we had cold evidence that they had done it and that they could hit one of

2054
02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:55.890
our recon teens. So we had to carry that bulky ass thing at all times.

2055
02:04:55.970 --> 02:05:00.740
<v 3>I was going to say, but, and this is, this was the, the concern was tear gas.</v>

2056
02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:05.040
Well, tear gas or who else knows what they had? I mean these are common.

2057
02:05:05.041 --> 02:05:07.380
It's tough to play by rules of engagement. Yeah.

2058
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:09.410
I mean I'm not in Laos cause yeah,

2059
02:05:09.411 --> 02:05:12.350
that's what I was thinking with all this crap that you're carrying.

2060
02:05:12.770 --> 02:05:15.960
And a gas master. Just huge and bulky. Yeah.

2061
02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.620
Left hip out to where I got all the time.

2062
02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:22.880
<v 2>Had to and we used them uh, twice. And uh,</v>

2063
02:05:24.190 --> 02:05:28.450
um, we in, we had designed a mission, one of our missions was to,

2064
02:05:29.770 --> 02:05:32.800
when we got distracted from a target, an m, a target,

2065
02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:36.070
we saw a road to had, um,

2066
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:41.530
little guard station, a guard station, but it was north of the DMZ river.

2067
02:05:42.250 --> 02:05:45.610
So the quest for getting, um,

2068
02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:47.420
alive pow.

2069
02:05:48.010 --> 02:05:52.640
We found out that he had one of our guys that did a VR and flew a couple rooms

2070
02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.640
and he saw these little waste stations along the way.

2071
02:05:54.641 --> 02:05:58.690
So our thought was we'll get gas, gas him. And they said he had a,

2072
02:05:58.930 --> 02:06:01.120
a knockout gas at the time. Right.

2073
02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:06.190
So we practiced for a couple of days with tear gas and he had to get the

2074
02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.870
helicopter policy and the gun crews,

2075
02:06:07.871 --> 02:06:10.080
everybody would do mass and didn't have master.

2076
02:06:10.090 --> 02:06:13.990
They could talk to each other and then talk to us. And um,

2077
02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:18.490
so we practiced for several days training with the helicopters coming in the Ed

2078
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:22.660
and the mission plan was go up in the middle of the day,

2079
02:06:23.170 --> 02:06:27.340
go to one of those camps, hit it, gas it, go in and scarf mountain, go home,

2080
02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.690
get a five day pass and a hundred bucks. Yeah. But they, uh,

2081
02:06:31.691 --> 02:06:35.320
and they had a special knockout cast that were supposed to use and at the end

2082
02:06:35.321 --> 02:06:36.820
they, they, they wouldn't let us,

2083
02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:39.400
they wouldn't give us the gas or I don't know if they had it,

2084
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:42.010
but they wouldn't give us the knock out kiss.

2085
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:44.470
So then another mission came up too.

2086
02:06:44.471 --> 02:06:47.830
We had a bright light to run and we never got back to the concept of doing it.

2087
02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:52.580
<v 3>And you carried, uh, you usually carried one grenade for your 40 Mike, Mike.</v>

2088
02:06:52.581 --> 02:06:57.470
That was tear gas. Always sure case we needed it. And that was, what would your,

2089
02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:01.850
what would your tactic be on using that? Usually it would be two, uh,

2090
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:03.643
<v 2>um,</v>

2091
02:07:03.650 --> 02:07:08.650
no to create disorder because you hit somebody with tear gas eva as far away

2092
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:12.290
[inaudible] that would distract them for a second,

2093
02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:16.400
take her mind off of business or at least make them have a harder time to kill

2094
02:07:16.401 --> 02:07:20.840
us. And we also carried a grass gas grenade, local. Okay.

2095
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.720
So we had in our sop, uh,

2096
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:26.780
procedure that the word will have to go to Hegel was,

2097
02:07:26.781 --> 02:07:30.080
but we had a signal or a sign for his cs gas.

2098
02:07:30.590 --> 02:07:34.580
So if we're getting so overrun to where the papa cs to break the break the

2099
02:07:34.581 --> 02:07:37.350
charge with of our teams dead, um,

2100
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:41.890
they used it in and the operation tailwind quite effectively save your bacon.

2101
02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:46.370
<v 0>So the idea would be, hey, this is going to linger.</v>

2102
02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.350
Whereas a frag grenade, it goes off.

2103
02:07:48.351 --> 02:07:51.050
You either wound guys or you don't you the kill guys or you don't,

2104
02:07:51.051 --> 02:07:51.980
but that's it. It's over.

2105
02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:56.420
Whereas gas you can really disrupt them because now you got guys coughing and

2106
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:57.830
puking or whatever

2107
02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.450
<v 2>and as an and hangs to the ground and then it hangs around as long as the wind</v>

2108
02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:03.710
is going to let it hang around.

2109
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:09.130
<v 0>Got It. Left pant pocket. You had a marking panel. Large and small,</v>

2110
02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:15.010
right pant pocket pen flares, d d hydrated alert ration,

2111
02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.450
bug repellent for Leeches, an extra caveat and extra bandage.

2112
02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:21.430
Did Anybody Carry Ivy?

2113
02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:26.970
<v 2>A several guys did. Okay. Uh, Lynn black did and um,</v>

2114
02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:32.160
we had I think South Carolina, one of our in ditch carry one.

2115
02:08:32.161 --> 02:08:36.840
We had an IB and the um, St line solution that came in a canister,

2116
02:08:37.110 --> 02:08:38.760
she always had one in case we needed it.

2117
02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:45.300
<v 0>In your rucksack, you got your, you got your PRC 25,</v>

2118
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:47.970
which you guys called the district 25. Yeah, I think I was,

2119
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:52.500
I think I was outlawed from calling it a prick that, that PRC 25.

2120
02:08:52.501 --> 02:08:57.501
So the PRC 25 was replaced by the PR 77 the preps 77 and I want to say it was

2121
02:09:00.001 --> 02:09:03.210
1969 or something like that. When I got to seal team one,

2122
02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.370
that's what I used was a pew.

2123
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:07.680
It was one of the radios that we had in our inventory. It was a PRC 77. Yeah.

2124
02:09:08.370 --> 02:09:11.400
Which came directly from the PRC 25. So you'd carry that,

2125
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:13.350
you had the big whip antenna, but you wouldn't,

2126
02:09:13.351 --> 02:09:17.040
you'd have the little tape antenna on there so you don't identify it as the

2127
02:09:17.041 --> 02:09:18.600
radio guy cause otherwise you're gonna know,

2128
02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:24.450
<v 2>pulled it over. In our case, the antenna, we just get it and bend it down,</v>

2129
02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:28.560
come up with your arms, stick it into the fatigues. So be low profile on.

2130
02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:34.460
<v 0>Then you had a, your your one sea rat of fruit. Oh,</v>

2131
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:38.270
that was like your, that was, that was your, your goto indeed.

2132
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:42.020
And you'd carry one of those, two of those, something like that.

2133
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:45.280
<v 2>Uh, usually just one. Cause after a while, you know,</v>

2134
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:49.000
we kept getting shot out so often it's like, okay, I'm not too much weight.

2135
02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:53.370
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Uh, yet, act, do you add your extra mags and every,</v>

2136
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:55.900
you got an extra m 79 browns,

2137
02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.630
you had your army long sleeve sweater, you had a plastic rain jacket,

2138
02:10:02.170 --> 02:10:04.930
toilet paper, even though you apparently never used it. Correct.

2139
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:09.370
But you could also use it to pack wounds. There you go. Uh,

2140
02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.070
extra battery for the,

2141
02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:15.040
for the prick 25 and the URC 10

2142
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:21.280
extra smoke grenades, uh, extra canteen, water,

2143
02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.690
extra ration.

2144
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.200
And then you had your claymore or claymores with five and ten second fuses.

2145
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:32.980
And on top of that, the 22 caliber hush puppy on some operations sometimes.

2146
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:37.130
Yeah. And all this, when you'd weighed yourself, you'd be about 90 pounds heavy

2147
02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:40.770
<v 2>right around there. Yeah. And it was a, it was an old brick SKL scale.</v>

2148
02:10:40.771 --> 02:10:44.170
So I just jumped on it and everything just to see what it,

2149
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:48.240
<v 0>well that's a heavy load out. I'll tell you right now, that's a heavy load out.</v>

2150
02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:51.450
That is absolutely all of 90 pounds.

2151
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:54.450
When you start talking about 600 rounds of ammunition and we start talking about

2152
02:10:54.451 --> 02:10:59.220
10, 10 to 12 hand grenades, smoke, smoke, grenades are heavy as hell.

2153
02:10:59.790 --> 02:11:04.110
They got all that material in them that smokes. Sure. They're big giant beasts.

2154
02:11:04.111 --> 02:11:06.780
And a Willie Peter was the Willie piers heavy too.

2155
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:12.590
Uh, uh, crazy mouth. Um,

2156
02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:15.780
and I guess like I said, and like you said,

2157
02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:19.530
you're carrying all that fire power because the operations,

2158
02:11:19.650 --> 02:11:22.420
you're carrying a crazy amount of fire power cause you're doing crazy

2159
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.340
operations.

2160
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:27.870
<v 2>Yeah. And again, from talking to other ones, Zeros, pat walkers and McGovern,</v>

2161
02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:30.540
cause initially I don't know what the loads were,

2162
02:11:30.541 --> 02:11:35.010
but they kept increasing it because there were several times and he ran out of

2163
02:11:35.011 --> 02:11:39.330
ammo already got close to running out as the last thing in the world. You want,

2164
02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.193
you know?

2165
02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:44.320
<v 0>Yeah. Awesome. Well,</v>

2166
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:50.590
you know, that's a little over two hours right now and it's been a quick night.

2167
02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:54.040
Yeah, indeed. Indeed. But, um,

2168
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:56.980
you got any, you got any closing thoughts?

2169
02:11:58.770 --> 02:11:59.790
<v 2>No. Uh,</v>

2170
02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:04.350
just to thank you for have me in three times and we've gained some extra tech.

2171
02:12:04.351 --> 02:12:06.270
Like I said before, uh,

2172
02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:11.360
we were just chatting is say the stories always felt war significant in terms

2173
02:12:12.121 --> 02:12:16.680
of, uh, the stories about what saga did and the men, more importantly men.

2174
02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:20.820
And also, like I said to you earlier, my stuff is hairy,

2175
02:12:21.210 --> 02:12:24.180
but if you had a Harry scale on one to 10,

2176
02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.830
I mean I feel I put myself at a five or six compared to the guys that got the

2177
02:12:28.831 --> 02:12:32.250
metal bond, a guys that didn't come home that went down fighting,

2178
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:35.250
getting over run buddy and VA. And we,

2179
02:12:35.730 --> 02:12:39.660
we can just talk about metal Bonner missions of guys standing there just

2180
02:12:39.661 --> 02:12:44.140
fighting off and dying on Elz putting their people on a hill,

2181
02:12:44.141 --> 02:12:49.080
a copter first John Kaedan Berg, Johnny Gal Hoon time and again,

2182
02:12:49.230 --> 02:12:52.380
RSF God would take care of the little people, even get 'em on to chopper,

2183
02:12:52.381 --> 02:12:54.930
get 'em out. And uh,

2184
02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.770
so those stories I felt with great valor. And um,

2185
02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:01.210
so I thank you for the little extra [inaudible]

2186
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.090
<v 0>to your audience. Well, we appreciate that. We'll, we'll,</v>

2187
02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:07.120
we'll bring you back on and we'll get,

2188
02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:11.380
and I know you and I are talking about other guys that were going to come on and

2189
02:13:11.530 --> 02:13:13.870
all those stories of those heroes. We'll,

2190
02:13:13.871 --> 02:13:18.250
we'll get them out there because people want to know. I want to hear them.

2191
02:13:18.251 --> 02:13:23.030
I want to know as much as I can about them and, and, and you know, we'll,

2192
02:13:23.050 --> 02:13:23.980
we'll get you back.

2193
02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:27.660
<v 2>Well, I'm ready to roll, so thank you. And I thank you for the time.</v>

2194
02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:32.040
<v 0>Also, you're on a, you're like Mr social media now. I didn't realize that you</v>

2195
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:35.510
<v 3>have to give me a full briefing when we're done. So you're on Twitter,</v>

2196
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:37.560
you and Echo Charles. Get me squared away. You're on Twitter.

2197
02:13:37.561 --> 02:13:41.030
We haven't quite figured out Twitter yet. Apparently you're,

2198
02:13:41.370 --> 02:13:42.870
that makes two of us. You're old.

2199
02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:47.220
Your old Twitter handle was at saga chronicles.

2200
02:13:48.090 --> 02:13:52.420
Your new Twitter handle is at John Stryker Meyer.

2201
02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:55.800
That's, that's where it's at right now. Yes sir. That's right. All right.

2202
02:13:55.801 --> 02:14:00.570
So people will start trying to communicate with you on that. Good luck.

2203
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:04.290
I'm going to call it a presence aid president Trump.

2204
02:14:04.291 --> 02:14:07.830
Could you help me out on my Twitter for president Trump tweets all the time to

2205
02:14:07.831 --> 02:14:12.290
king of Twitter. He is. He is. Hey, I was, I'm sorry. No,

2206
02:14:12.370 --> 02:14:15.420
you'll be able to, you'll be able to you when you,

2207
02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:19.320
that's the incredible thing about Twitter is everybody has a platform.

2208
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.380
It's incredibly good. Sometimes it's in PR incredibly bad,

2209
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:27.330
but everybody has a platform so no. The cool thing about it is people have been,

2210
02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:28.253
you know,

2211
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:32.010
talking to me and hitting me up and just thanking you for your service,

2212
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:33.600
thanking you for coming on.

2213
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:36.270
Thank you for sharing the stories so it will be cool that they'll be able to

2214
02:14:36.271 --> 02:14:37.021
actually thank you.

2215
02:14:37.021 --> 02:14:39.600
Instead of just telling me to tell you things and just go to a website,

2216
02:14:39.710 --> 02:14:42.090
they've got the link in there for email for the old fashioned route.

2217
02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:45.710
Saw chronicles.com saw chronicles.com airborne. Yeah.

2218
02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.620
People were the people on there. I wanted to close out reading. One last thing,

2219
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:50.661
and this is your,

2220
02:14:50.661 --> 02:14:55.110
your dedication for the book saw chronicles one and it said,

2221
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:55.681
it says,

2222
02:14:55.681 --> 02:14:59.670
this book is dedicated to the SOG men and they're courageous indigenous team

2223
02:14:59.671 --> 02:15:03.870
members who went across the fence and to allow us Cambodian north Vietnam during

2224
02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:08.610
the eight year secret war and to the and to the brave aviators and crew members

2225
02:15:08.611 --> 02:15:09.444
of

2226
02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:14.100
the Army Air Force Marine Corps and our fearless allies from the 219th south

2227
02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:17.280
Vietnamese Air Force Special Operations Squadron,

2228
02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.280
the legendary King Bees who supported who supported SOG teams on the ground.

2229
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:29.090
This book is also for every man in SOG and the aviators who made the ultimate

2230
02:15:29.371 --> 02:15:34.371
sacrifice far outside the boundaries of conventional Vietnam War that America

2231
02:15:35.251 --> 02:15:38.190
saw reported on the nightly news.

2232
02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:41.490
A good two closing note apps today,

2233
02:15:41.670 --> 02:15:46.670
1,598 Americans that are mia and Southeast Asia from the Vietnam War.

2234
02:15:49.530 --> 02:15:53.250
50 Green Berets alone in layoffs are still mia,

2235
02:15:53.970 --> 02:15:58.740
including 140 plus avs at dyes strictly supporting our mission.

2236
02:15:59.190 --> 02:16:00.060
And this week,

2237
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:05.300
the National League appeal w Mia Found was having his 50th annual meeting in uh,

2238
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:10.780
Arlington on this topic. They'd been diligent and uh,

2239
02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.430
and mills Griffiths is the CEO. She's putting it all together.

2240
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:16.170
They work with the Pentagon.

2241
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:19.920
She had been on this mission from day one and our prayers are with them to

2242
02:16:19.921 --> 02:16:24.120
continue because they're pushed to bring our people home. Absolutely.

2243
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:27.720
And if you want to put that out either on SOG, chronicles,

2244
02:16:27.721 --> 02:16:32.140
put a link to how people can support that cause people will absolutely support

2245
02:16:32.141 --> 02:16:36.820
that cause. Oh, okay. We'll do that. So they deserve, yes, absolutely.

2246
02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:41.350
We can make that happen. Oh, thank you. Airborne. All right, well like I said,

2247
02:16:41.351 --> 02:16:43.960
you haven't opened an invite on here. Anytime you want,

2248
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:48.490
you let us know we're here and we'll get some of your friends on and thanks for

2249
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:49.450
coming on yourself.

2250
02:16:49.510 --> 02:16:53.230
Thanks for sharing your stories and most of all more than anything else,

2251
02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:56.380
thanks for your service and sacrifice. Likewise brother, you've been there,

2252
02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:58.720
you've seen Neil often appreciate it.

2253
02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:03.040
And once again,

2254
02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:09.730
John Stryker Meyer has left the building. Tilt kilt has left the building.

2255
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.903
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2256
02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:17.600
<v 5>Finishing up three podcasts with John Stryker Meyer.</v>

2257
02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:18.913
Yeah.

2258
02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:24.540
Sappers sappers I asked them what sappers was where,

2259
02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:29.120
cause there was various references for a second and this past one,

2260
02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:32.510
two sappers end more notably one.

2261
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:35.090
If you remember the movie Predator,

2262
02:17:35.091 --> 02:17:39.260
the first one he says sappers those sapper has been on a sense, blah, blah,

2263
02:17:39.261 --> 02:17:42.320
blah, whatever. The interesting, and I always wondered what's a sapper.

2264
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.983
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2265
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:46.190
<v 5>Special Group, Vietnam,</v>

2266
02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.640
North Vietnamese group of anti American fighters trained specifically.

2267
02:17:52.281 --> 02:17:53.114
Right,

2268
02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.200
<v 3>right. I got that right. Right. Did I remember that correctly? Yeah, that's,</v>

2269
02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:01.600
that's the definition that John Stryker Meyer just gave you

2270
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.510
anyway. All right, cool. What else Jocko? Well

2271
02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:11.960
I would say no. Awesome. Awesome.

2272
02:18:11.961 --> 02:18:16.961
To have a John Stryker Meyer on here and just to hear him talk about what human

2273
02:18:21.291 --> 02:18:25.460
beings can do, right. What people,

2274
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:27.920
human beings can do.

2275
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:30.590
And it's interesting cause you ever look at dogs and you think, oh,

2276
02:18:30.591 --> 02:18:35.510
there's a little tiny Chihuahua and then there's like a, a German shepherd.

2277
02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.560
Yeah. And you think those are the same animal, right? Yes. They are.

2278
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:40.663
Technically,

2279
02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:46.120
technically human beings seem like you look at John Stryker Meyer.

2280
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:49.200
He's like a German shepherd. Yeah.

2281
02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:51.110
And then you've got people running around there. Chihuahuas,

2282
02:18:51.590 --> 02:18:55.190
no offense against the Chihuahuas, but you're sure why was not gonna yes.

2283
02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:59.360
Fend off hoards. Chihuahuas, not calling in airstrikes,

2284
02:18:59.361 --> 02:19:01.190
danger clothes. No.

2285
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:06.790
So I guess my point is that human beings do have capabilities and I think that

2286
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:11.300
when you listen to tilt,

2287
02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:16.070
you realize that I can probably do better. I know.

2288
02:19:16.071 --> 02:19:19.370
That's what I realized. I think, yeah, I can do better than I'm doing right now.

2289
02:19:19.610 --> 02:19:24.080
Yeah. I think I can, I can push the envelope a little bit. Yeah.

2290
02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:25.773
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

2291
02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:30.740
<v 5>move further toward the potential.</v>

2292
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:36.670
The part that kind of will probably will stick with me is how he didn't carry

2293
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:41.760
Poncho, like the sleeping style company. It was just like, Oh,

2294
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:45.570
if we have to go sleep, I'm just going to sleep right here in who? In the end,

2295
02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:47.980
on the ant hill, this, whatever.

2296
02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:51.890
See that part when I was a kid,

2297
02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:58.820
when I was a kid that was viable. But now you need comfort.

2298
02:19:59.210 --> 02:20:01.190
Yeah. I'm weak. Yeah.

2299
02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:04.340
So that part that maybe I have to mentally maybe work on that, you know.

2300
02:20:05.050 --> 02:20:08.720
All right, let's face it, there are ways to get better.

2301
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:13.220
Yesterday there is maybe sleeping without a ground pad is one of them. Yeah.

2302
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:17.600
Maybe another one is train Jujitsu. Oh yeah, big time.

2303
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:22.700
That's a, I mean, so I was training the other day with Noah Oliver, right.

2304
02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:25.880
And Noah's been training and he's kind of sorting out, you know,

2305
02:20:25.881 --> 02:20:28.820
how you go in phases of training partners. You know, he'd been bad man.

2306
02:20:28.930 --> 02:20:31.130
I've been training with Andy for like the last like three months,

2307
02:20:31.180 --> 02:20:33.950
you know more than so man.

2308
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:38.951
But he's been like beat me down the other day yesterday,

2309
02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:42.260
yesterday, day before whatever. And Yeah, he beat me down.

2310
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:46.390
But at the same time I didn't leave thinking like, oh my gosh,

2311
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:50.270
get your socks. You know when you get beat down you think of, okay,

2312
02:20:50.271 --> 02:20:54.590
what do I need to do to that's the correct data. TF. Well especially,

2313
02:20:54.591 --> 02:20:57.400
well when you have training partners that you like and you trust and you,

2314
02:20:57.401 --> 02:21:00.290
you know, you enjoy what you get from the training or whatever.

2315
02:21:00.291 --> 02:21:03.590
Regardless you got beat down or not, I think you might audit.

2316
02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:05.480
We'll start to automatically go to that.

2317
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:09.950
I think most of the time it's usually when, I don't know other circumstances.

2318
02:21:09.951 --> 02:21:13.790
Then you'd be all salty and make excuses or something like that. Either way.

2319
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:16.130
So I'm thinking, you know,

2320
02:21:16.131 --> 02:21:20.630
of all the things and then I arrive at the concept of men in any other

2321
02:21:20.631 --> 02:21:25.160
situation. You take that kind of like just physical turmoil.

2322
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:29.270
Not only do you get beat, but it was like kind of hard, you know?

2323
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:32.570
Usually I don't feel this good about it.

2324
02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:36.050
I'm not looking forward to the next time, you know like come on, let's face it,

2325
02:21:36.051 --> 02:21:38.750
you do a hard metcon, you're like boom. I'm glad that's over with.

2326
02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:41.030
But in this case you are looking forward, Tom. Excellent. Yeah.

2327
02:21:41.031 --> 02:21:42.280
You're looking forward to the next one.

2328
02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:44.840
You look forward to just training more in general.

2329
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:51.030
There's a short term and long term pay off for this Jujitsu thing.

2330
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:53.690
Interesting. Oh yeah. Very true.

2331
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:56.810
Not to mention the capability that you wind up with.

2332
02:21:56.811 --> 02:21:59.190
So we're pro Jujitsu is what we're dedicated.

2333
02:21:59.330 --> 02:22:02.720
We're a hundred thousand percent short term and longterm there's no,

2334
02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:07.070
there's no dichotomy. There's just short term gain. Longterm game. Yes,

2335
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:11.930
in my opinion, but it could be argued that, oh, it's hard. What about the Dagon?

2336
02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:14.270
What about sometimes when people don't want to train,

2337
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:19.340
they let the Jujitsu window close like we confirmed as a thing. It is a thing,

2338
02:22:19.341 --> 02:22:21.650
but that's, you know what I kind of arrived at as well.

2339
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:25.920
The days that you actually don't want to train are way rare

2340
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.980
than you might think. Like have you ever said, man,

2341
02:22:28.981 --> 02:22:32.190
I really don't feel like training. And then you make the drive to the gym,

2342
02:22:32.191 --> 02:22:33.840
you get to the gym, your training partners show up.

2343
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.530
You right when you go to shake hands and you still feel like,

2344
02:22:37.531 --> 02:22:40.440
oh I really don't want to train her in August. That's never happened. Never.

2345
02:22:40.441 --> 02:22:43.740
Right. Hardly ever. I can't think of one single time I've thought.

2346
02:22:43.770 --> 02:22:46.710
I came to the gym one time and I got there and I was like,

2347
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:49.560
I still don't want to train.

2348
02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:52.620
But it was because there was only like three people there and they were like

2349
02:22:52.621 --> 02:22:54.580
really brand new at the time and then I was like, oh,

2350
02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:59.140
and I just went home one time in my whole life. But wow,

2351
02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:02.940
I did. I legitimately did not feel like training anyway. Legitimately.

2352
02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:05.220
Usually if you don't feel like training,

2353
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:07.260
it's not that you don't feel like that's never happened.

2354
02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:11.580
It's not that you don't feel like training, it's,

2355
02:23:11.610 --> 02:23:15.930
you don't feel like getting off the couch, getting into your car,

2356
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:18.840
getting your gear, getting, you know, doing that.

2357
02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:21.060
That's what you don't feel like doing. Oh,

2358
02:23:21.061 --> 02:23:22.920
you feel like training because when it's time to train,

2359
02:23:22.921 --> 02:23:25.490
it's good fun every single time. That's what I think.

2360
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.300
It's a weird aspect that you do too, is fun. This is very fun. It's fun. Yeah.

2361
02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:32.800
I have a feeling something I was going to trade. You did too,

2362
02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:37.810
where I'm literally like kind of beside myself with how fun that just,

2363
02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:40.230
you know,

2364
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:44.150
and that's sometimes I'm getting beat down and I'm thinking that sometimes I'm

2365
02:23:44.270 --> 02:23:47.840
winning and I'm thinking, but either way I'm like, God, that was, yeah, it's,

2366
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:52.460
it's kind of like, uh, a feeling that's very hard to,

2367
02:23:52.850 --> 02:23:56.960
to describe even. Yeah, I would,

2368
02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.390
I would agree with that. Yeah.

2369
02:23:59.110 --> 02:24:03.540
Cause you have that obviously the physical part of it, right? Exercise. Yes.

2370
02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:06.740
That's always good. And you know that. But this is like, it's like press,

2371
02:24:06.741 --> 02:24:09.130
especially if he roll with like guys who are like, good,

2372
02:24:09.570 --> 02:24:11.620
then they're not good because they're so athletic.

2373
02:24:11.650 --> 02:24:14.650
Even though they might be athletic, they're good because they know what to do.

2374
02:24:14.651 --> 02:24:18.430
Like a dean lister, like Greg McIntyre, these guys who like Greg Trey,

2375
02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:19.420
if he Greg chain,

2376
02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:23.680
if you don't think your way into or out of the situation you want,

2377
02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:26.710
man, you're, you're just not going to do it. You know?

2378
02:24:26.711 --> 02:24:31.711
So it's that problem solving task that's just intertwined in the whole thing.

2379
02:24:32.411 --> 02:24:36.790
I think that's what makes it fun. That's what I think agree. Anyway. G,

2380
02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:42.010
Nogi streets, whatever. If you want to do, Gee, you're going to need a g,

2381
02:24:42.390 --> 02:24:47.390
you get a g from origin or do you mean.com as we can get to keep very selections

2382
02:24:48.610 --> 02:24:52.240
on there. The best made in America by the way. Made in America. Yeah,

2383
02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.680
and just kind of massive shipment of cotton and I'm not,

2384
02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:00.400
I'm talking not talking to woven. I'm talking unwoven little strands of cotton.

2385
02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.780
Check out, check out, check out the Instagram.

2386
02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:08.770
There's pallets and pallets that are there and it's just you think, okay,

2387
02:25:08.771 --> 02:25:13.390
this cotton is going to get woven and then turned into gifts that I'm going to

2388
02:25:13.391 --> 02:25:16.210
wear. What does cotton look like when it comes from pallets?

2389
02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:19.930
Because we want to just little spools of, and it's not even,

2390
02:25:19.931 --> 02:25:23.110
it's not just cotton by the way, it's, it's a blended,

2391
02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:27.790
so totally modern spring, like a spool, but it's thick, a little bit thicker.

2392
02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:29.830
That all gets woven together.

2393
02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.930
We used to grow cotton when I was young in her yard and quiet. Really?

2394
02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:38.420
[inaudible] for what purpose? That's just how I guess, I don't know.

2395
02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:43.720
Did I do something with, I dunno, random. It was there.

2396
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:48.460
It was a row of cotton trees. So cotton is like a,

2397
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.290
it's like a, almost like a pod that turns inside out like a popcorn almost.

2398
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:56.980
Yeah, if I remember correctly. And so that cotton would be balls of cotton,

2399
02:25:56.981 --> 02:25:59.610
you know, like you get, you know when you buy cotton balls, right? Yeah.

2400
02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:02.890
I'm sure you always buy cotton balls, but when you buy the cotton balls,

2401
02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:06.130
they're in balls. They're kind of like that, but more like, uh, there's not,

2402
02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.820
they're not in a ball. They're in a big clump. Okay. There's seeds all in there.

2403
02:26:09.821 --> 02:26:12.730
You gotta pick out the seeds and the seeds are all stuck to the content.

2404
02:26:13.210 --> 02:26:15.640
I thought that's how they came. But they're,

2405
02:26:15.641 --> 02:26:20.430
they're twined in or spun into string. All right.

2406
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:25.690
We got cotton, we've got geese, we got jeans also. I got jeans by the way.

2407
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:26.860
Oh Sir. You're in the game now.

2408
02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:31.410
I'm totally in the game and I'm surprised how good. Okay, good American Dan.

2409
02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:34.960
I'm sure the buttons, brass origin buttons. I was impressed with that.

2410
02:26:34.961 --> 02:26:37.780
When I saw the pictures, when I see them, I'm impressed,

2411
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:43.030
but I'm maybe I'm more surprised on top of the impressed of how they fit next

2412
02:26:43.031 --> 02:26:43.450
level.

2413
02:26:43.450 --> 02:26:46.990
I thought they were going to be like the kind of older just generic fitting

2414
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:49.570
worker jeans, which is fine. I get it,

2415
02:26:49.810 --> 02:26:53.680
but that's not really what I was like deep down hoping for.

2416
02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:57.220
I was hoping for the kind that, you know, I can put on, I can wear to, you know,

2417
02:26:57.550 --> 02:27:00.010
if I go somewhere special with my wife or something like that.

2418
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:04.600
You're just putting on those origins jeans. Stoke. There's good. Yes.

2419
02:27:04.601 --> 02:27:07.530
They're very good. They fit good. Hand it to Pete. Yeah,

2420
02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:11.030
that stylish fashioned dude. Little bit

2421
02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.290
skinny. Nice tee shirts, jeans,

2422
02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:22.540
Ghees rash guards, joggers, supplements. Yes. Supplements.

2423
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:26.740
Get your joint warfare, get your Krill oil,

2424
02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.130
get your discipline, get your discipline,

2425
02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:34.990
go get these things. They will. They will.

2426
02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:38.560
They will make your life better. As crazy as that sounds,

2427
02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:43.780
they will make your life better as will moke. Yes,

2428
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:47.620
and some people say, what is smoke? And the answer is very clear. Mulkey is

2429
02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:51.240
Moelleken's moment. That's right. MOCA smoke.

2430
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:53.740
You can't just call it something you can't call.

2431
02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:59.290
You can't call a knife by some other name. Right. It's a rash tonight,

2432
02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:04.180
so you can't call milk. You can't say milk is something else. No,

2433
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:07.120
milk is milk. Then again, I'm in Hammond Devil's that picky.

2434
02:28:07.121 --> 02:28:11.560
You can't call the knife up shank. Okay, I'll bleed. Yeah, you're right.

2435
02:28:11.561 --> 02:28:14.330
Cold Steel. You know there's a lot of words for knife cutting.

2436
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.550
So there's other words for for milk then is what you're saying? No,

2437
02:28:18.551 --> 02:28:19.830
I'm not saying that. As you know,

2438
02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:24.960
just say Mark [inaudible] is a dessert in the shape of a protein powder that's

2439
02:28:27.711 --> 02:28:31.460
healthy. Okay. So you can either call it that or you can call them milk.

2440
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:35.810
It tastes like dessert and yet it's good for you and gives you protein.

2441
02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:39.330
Strawberry is delicious. Mint chocolate chip. I had to,

2442
02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:44.730
I had so much strawberry, I had to go back to men and I was like, good Lord,

2443
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:48.730
man. It's crazy. Men is delicious. What do you want?

2444
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:51.470
Mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake or do you want a mint milk? Oh,

2445
02:28:51.471 --> 02:28:54.740
I'll take the mint milk all day long. Oh yeah. Short and longterm payoff.

2446
02:28:54.741 --> 02:28:58.220
Short and longterm payoff. Peanut butter. Reese's cup.

2447
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.530
I don't know if you're allowed to say Reese's cup,

2448
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:03.590
but that's basically what it is. Peanut butter. Reese's cup.

2449
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:07.780
But it's peanut butter and chocolate milk. Tasty. You know,

2450
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:10.160
what am I missing? Vanilla. I'm not a vanilla guy.

2451
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:15.020
I don't like the Vanilla Yogurt. I don't like the vanilla. The vanilla milk is,

2452
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:19.100
it's, if you like vanilla, you're good. If you don't really like vanilla,

2453
02:29:19.310 --> 02:29:23.900
you know, don't get it. There's a whole hoard of Vanilla Lakers. Yeah,

2454
02:29:23.901 --> 02:29:26.180
for sure. And the thing that's cool about vanilla, I guess,

2455
02:29:26.181 --> 02:29:30.380
is that you can do other things with it. Jason Gardener put it in your morning.

2456
02:29:30.381 --> 02:29:35.330
Coffee. Yeah. Hit it with the, he likes to say, hit it with the blenders stick.

2457
02:29:35.810 --> 02:29:40.370
Right. You know people, some people like to say things, he's like,

2458
02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:43.880
I hit it. He gets all fired up through. I hit it with that blender stick.

2459
02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:49.130
He calls it a blender stick. So there Jason Gardner. So, and,

2460
02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:54.220
and Jason Garners in great shape getting after it.

2461
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:55.890
Yeah. So maybe it a,

2462
02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.050
maybe it's a positive thing and don't forget that there's warrior kid milk.

2463
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:04.820
Cause do you want to feed your child poison? No.

2464
02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:08.210
Do you? I do not. Okay, cool. Then you get a milk.

2465
02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:12.320
Do you want your kid to to be miserable when they eat because what you're

2466
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:16.220
feeding them tastes disgusting. Let me think. No. Okay cool.

2467
02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:17.960
So you gave give him milk and you know,

2468
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:20.570
being healthy and you're taking care of your kid and you're actually being a

2469
02:30:20.571 --> 02:30:23.350
good parent. Yeah.

2470
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:28.430
Otherwise you're neglecting your child's welfare. Don't do it. Yeah. Milk,

2471
02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:31.910
strawberry milk, chocolate milk, get some, it's true.

2472
02:30:31.911 --> 02:30:33.620
My daughter in this phase,

2473
02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:38.030
hopefully short where like she's comparing her body with like other people's

2474
02:30:38.031 --> 02:30:42.020
body. Oh yeah. That'll be a short phase. It only lasts like 500 years.

2475
02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:46.670
So man, it kind of makes you think like, oh shoot,

2476
02:30:46.671 --> 02:30:50.630
she's paying attention now that she's looking at your guns. Like whatever.

2477
02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:57.770
Anyway, uh, so more you over in the corner doing curls,

2478
02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:00.940
pushups and actually she does burp. Like you know what I tell her it's,

2479
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:04.040
it's kind of a trick. I don't know. Tell me if you think this is a lie.

2480
02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:07.940
So she'll be like, hey, I don't really feel like doing the workout today.

2481
02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:09.891
So I say, okay,

2482
02:31:09.891 --> 02:31:14.891
you don't have to do the workout if and only if you do burpees,

2483
02:31:15.351 --> 02:31:16.184
input ups,

2484
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:19.860
kind of like burpees and push ups are not gonna work even though that is the

2485
02:31:19.861 --> 02:31:23.190
workout. Oh yeah. It's like 70 burpees in uh,

2486
02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:26.670
like 40 pushups or something like that. That's the whole workout.

2487
02:31:26.671 --> 02:31:29.910
I make a six year old. Do you know, full on metcon or nothing like that.

2488
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:32.160
But I say, you don't have to do the workout.

2489
02:31:32.161 --> 02:31:35.040
You only have to do the push on them versus he's like, okay, you know,

2490
02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.140
kind of like she escaped the workout even though that is where he is.

2491
02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:40.710
That lying, this flanking, right? Like yeah. Hell yeah.

2492
02:31:41.370 --> 02:31:44.070
Then the last one point that's authorized. Good. Yes. Anyway,

2493
02:31:44.071 --> 02:31:48.030
my point is that yeah, once you know when, when you know you a still girl,

2494
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:52.050
being conscious of how her body looks in all this stuff and be makes utilizes

2495
02:31:52.051 --> 02:31:52.884
six man.

2496
02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:57.900
And I kind of feel this overwhelming responsibility, like,

2497
02:31:57.901 --> 02:31:58.111
hey,

2498
02:31:58.111 --> 02:32:01.680
if she starts like putting on weight that she doesn't like or something like

2499
02:32:01.681 --> 02:32:06.680
that, it's Kinda my fault. You know? At this point it is for sure. So the milk,

2500
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:10.680
you can, I feel real good about it, especially that she likes it, you know?

2501
02:32:10.890 --> 02:32:14.820
And that stuff, everyone is, I don't know how they did that, but keep doing it.

2502
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:18.480
That's what I know. Anyway. Also, Jocko white tea. Yes.

2503
02:32:19.170 --> 02:32:23.970
Can you get addicted to Jocko white tea? The answer is yes. Yeah.

2504
02:32:24.350 --> 02:32:26.520
Yes. It's psychological JP to know.

2505
02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:32.400
JP knows my brother currently addicted to talking about about him.

2506
02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:35.640
I'm saying the boys got a little bit of an addiction problem with the juggle it.

2507
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:37.920
All right, well, there you go. And I mean,

2508
02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:39.630
I'm sure I haven't thought about it that much,

2509
02:32:39.631 --> 02:32:43.170
but I'm sure there is some drawbacks to being addicted to Jocko at Haiti.

2510
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:47.340
I don't know. But from here, I mean, the intuitive thought is that men,

2511
02:32:47.341 --> 02:32:51.110
that's all upside addicted to good stuff. You know, it's like I,

2512
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:53.800
I'm addicted to Jocko white tea and I have an 8,000 pound deadlift.

2513
02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:58.410
How's it going? Yeah, probably way more now. Yeah. Like 1200 or something. Sure.

2514
02:32:58.570 --> 02:33:02.840
I'll ask them anyway. You talk white tee is available cans as well. Uh,

2515
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:06.620
tea bags as well on the store. It's on the store. It's on Amazon.

2516
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:09.480
It's everywhere. Get it. But it's up there. Yeah, for sure.

2517
02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:13.540
Get your addiction on something good. Also, we have our own store.

2518
02:33:13.541 --> 02:33:15.600
Speaking of the stores called Jocko store,

2519
02:33:15.601 --> 02:33:19.380
this is where you can get this willing equals freedom shirts. Like I said,

2520
02:33:19.381 --> 02:33:23.430
Jocko white tea is on the store that's on the store. Tens refills,

2521
02:33:23.431 --> 02:33:27.960
all that stuff. Hoodies, lightweight and heavyweight hats. Rash guards,

2522
02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:30.470
rash guards. Oh, big time. Yeah. Well yeah,

2523
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:34.020
if you want to represent the path while you're on the sport and a rash guard

2524
02:33:34.021 --> 02:33:37.500
today, when I was doing ring workout wearing, I was,

2525
02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:40.740
we're using the rings and if you don't wear a rash guard when you're doing

2526
02:33:40.741 --> 02:33:44.790
rings, if you do high reps, you'll start to chafe your arms a bunch,

2527
02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:47.520
which is no big deal. But then you get like, you know, you're,

2528
02:33:47.521 --> 02:33:50.220
if you're doing Jujitsu and then you're starting to get a little infection

2529
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.030
exposures going on. So just words, rash card. Yeah. Also, you know,

2530
02:33:54.031 --> 02:33:59.031
if you work at the bank or somewhere where people sort of half deaf have at

2531
02:33:59.221 --> 02:34:00.870
least a little bit of trust in you.

2532
02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:03.690
If you're willing around with chafed hands and arms and stuff,

2533
02:34:03.691 --> 02:34:05.520
they're like not brown. What's up with this kind of, you know,

2534
02:34:05.610 --> 02:34:09.660
they don't know that you're doing well. Yeah. You, but you're like,

2535
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:13.190
you're like one, two levels, like beyond, you know, like in fight club when,

2536
02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:16.290
you know, will this movie fight club where like, yeah. You know,

2537
02:34:16.291 --> 02:34:18.320
when he's at the restaurant he sees it that the two black guys,

2538
02:34:18.380 --> 02:34:21.070
his broken nose and he trusts them more. He's like, he gives him the nod,

2539
02:34:21.310 --> 02:34:23.650
but a known portion. It's like pro, who's this guy with two black eyes,

2540
02:34:23.651 --> 02:34:28.270
broken nose, chafed arms, all this stuff. Who is this guy? He's a Weirdo.

2541
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:31.540
He's doing weirdo stuff. He's doing deviant stuff, that's for sure.

2542
02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:35.440
So you don't want that. You don't want that on the surface is what I'm saying,

2543
02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:38.920
even though you like it. So basically what you're saying is get a,

2544
02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:43.600
get a rash card from the Jocko store so that you're not weird to other people.

2545
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:46.590
That's what I just heard. Correct. Just to break it down correctly.

2546
02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:53.320
Also subscribe to the podcast. Uh, as I was, uh, my kids,

2554
02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:22.690

2555
02:35:24.010 --> 02:35:27.280

A warrior kid podcast too. Let's not forget about,

2573
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:32.110
let's never forget it. Never. It's, it's hibernating a little bit. Sure.

2574

Some people have been to commenting now. Yeah.

2575
02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:38.170
Somebody posted a picture of like someone that was like undead.

2576
02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:43.060
The warrior kid podcast is by no means dead.

2577
02:36:43.061 --> 02:36:47.530
It lives on and since I have just wrapped up a major project,

2578
02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:52.560
I will have some time hopefully before certain people are not available to

2579
02:36:52.601 --> 02:36:57.130
record. To record. Yeah. So there'll be some more common, yeah.

2580
02:36:57.210 --> 02:37:01.240
Good podcast. And actually that Kinda is important to note because you know,

2581
02:37:01.241 --> 02:37:03.670
if they're like, hey, yeah, it's done, then they won't even,

2582
02:37:03.671 --> 02:37:06.220
it won't be on their mind. No one's even on the lookout for it.

2583
02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:08.350
Then he could go on notice when it doesn't come back.

2584
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:10.600
Nonetheless it's going to come back cause it's doesn't have to come back.

2585
02:37:10.601 --> 02:37:14.380
It's there right now. We'll listen to an episode that's not, that's there.

2586
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:18.180
Alright, cool. Some people are just discovering that warrior kid podcasting.

2587
02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:22.610
I dig it anyway. We're used to going to where your kids Aiden's making,

2588
02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:25.220
so that's right. But a goat milk.

2589
02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.860
Various other ingredients in America by the way.

2590
02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:33.170
Irish oaks ranch.com is where you can get a trooper soap and Jocko. So wait,

2591
02:37:33.171 --> 02:37:36.620
does it still have the trooper soap or was that just a special edition? Yeah,

2592
02:37:36.621 --> 02:37:40.770
man. And that's legit. No one's on a rope, but yeah. And what's the slogan? I,

2593
02:37:40.771 --> 02:37:42.920
I'd say the slogan you said, but we've been, let me go ahead.

2594
02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:47.900
The slogan is simply stay clean. There you go. Outstanding.

2595
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:49.070
Uh,

2596
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:54.070
we have a youtube channel and what we would like is for you to smash the,

2597
02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:58.430
Hey, we got a youtube channel. If you want to watch the youtube videos,

2598
02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:01.430
if you're not getting inundated with enough youtube videos,

2599
02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:06.700
wasting your time watching videos of street fights,

2600
02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:12.500
watching videos of car crashes,

2601
02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:17.980
watching videos of acrobatic people climbing around in the city.

2602
02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:21.410
Oh, the park world. You know what's funny?

2603
02:38:21.411 --> 02:38:25.340
It's like you're just totally putting yourself on report about all the videos

2604
02:38:25.341 --> 02:38:27.440
here. For sure. These are the things like, oh,

2605
02:38:27.470 --> 02:38:29.030
you like to watch street five videos.

2606
02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:31.280
The thing is youtube knows what you like to watch.

2607
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:36.500
So it just puts up a three on one jujitsu involved.

2608
02:38:36.501 --> 02:38:39.860
I'm like, oh, somebody, somebody made that video for me.

2609
02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:45.740
So what I'm saying is subscribe to the Youtube Channel if you want to see the

2610
02:38:46.371 --> 02:38:47.480
videos that we put out.

2611
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:51.500
Otherwise go watch some more drunk girl fails.

2612
02:38:51.890 --> 02:38:56.690
I don't really watch that one, but I will watch like fast tactical reloads.

2613
02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:02.840
So anyways, there you go. Boom. There it is. Yeah. Tube.

2614
02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:05.030
Also psychological warfare. If you don't know what that is,

2615
02:39:05.031 --> 02:39:09.110
it's an album with tracks of Jocko telling you how to get past moments of

2616
02:39:09.111 --> 02:39:13.640
weakness if they may arise, if they may arise. I went to a,

2617
02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:16.460
I didn't go to the donut shop. I passed it.

2618
02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:19.820
There's a bank and there's a donut shop right by where it isn't that weird that

2619
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:22.370
doughnut shops exist. They don't anymore.

2620
02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:27.010
That was going to be my 0.3 people in there. The lady in there, you winning.

2621
02:39:27.470 --> 02:39:30.140
We're winning. We're going to win. I even heard a,

2622
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:33.860
what do you call Krispy Kremes is like either out of business or going out of

2623
02:39:33.861 --> 02:39:37.730
business, like, I don't know, record rate or something like that. But men,

2624
02:39:37.731 --> 02:39:40.250
the lady in the donut shop was um,

2625
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:45.410
on her laptop in one of the customer like tables on the seat, you know,

2626
02:39:45.411 --> 02:39:48.980
it was, she wasn't behind the counter on and she was just coming in here. Yeah.

2627
02:39:48.981 --> 02:39:52.190
No one's coming here at awesome. Dang. Anyway,

2628
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:56.870
what should they replace all donut shops with steak houses?

2629
02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:01.850
Yeah. Well. Yeah, I guess there's less chances. Jujitsu studios?

2630
02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:05.060
Yeah, just like a vacant, you know what?

2631
02:40:05.061 --> 02:40:09.400
They should do a vacant building. They clear out all the donut, uh,

2632
02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:11.850
material and machines.

2633
02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:14.580
I don't know how you make donuts but clear out all that stuff.

2634
02:40:15.130 --> 02:40:19.050
You just put one like a mat space, one mat space. That's it.

2635
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:22.710
[inaudible] paper and a pencil. You just sign your name. Boom. I came in,

2636
02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:25.950
use this, met me and my partner. Boom. Sure. Come in, leave.

2637
02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:27.990
I didn't really think it through,

2638
02:40:27.991 --> 02:40:30.420
but nonetheless psychological war for what I was saying.

2639
02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:33.220
This album tracks by Jocko. Can you through your moments,

2640
02:40:34.050 --> 02:40:36.840
the report says that that psychological warfare,

2641
02:40:36.841 --> 02:40:41.760
the album has done massive damage to the donut industry apparently is what's

2642
02:40:41.761 --> 02:40:43.720
going on. That's what I'm hearing. Yes.

2643
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:47.490
Big Time evidently is if you don't want the audio version of that,

2644
02:40:47.491 --> 02:40:50.910
but you want a visual version, you can check out flip side,

2651
02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:19.560
campus.com also on it is a good one.

2652
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:24.510
Fun at.com/jockos where you can get your kettlebells, your battle ropes,

2653
02:41:24.511 --> 02:41:27.360
various fitness equipment. This is good. You could also get socks.

2654
02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:30.200
Didn't seem like it. I know and I've said it before. He gets socks, socks,

2655
02:41:30.201 --> 02:41:33.050
socks or a thing I guess. Well I, you know,

2656
02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:35.880
I'm one of those guys who I kinda like cool socks.

2657
02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:36.960
I don't buy them all the time,

2658
02:41:36.961 --> 02:41:41.280
but I don't know what kind of guy likes cool socks. I don't know, it's just,

2659
02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:46.530
but there's a whole industry out there used to be and for me it's still is socks

2660
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:51.010
means one thing. Pair of white socks. That's what socks means. Yeah.

2661
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:55.440
Well you're, you and I don't have it. Darth Vader socks like you do or whatever.

2662
02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:59.010
No, I've Darth Vader kettlebells, but no, nothing. No. Dan,

2663
02:41:59.250 --> 02:42:02.070
where'd you get the Darth Vader kettlebells from on it? Of course.

2664
02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:04.290
Cause they got Darth Vader, they've got iron man.

2665
02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:05.880
They got some good ones on there also.

2666
02:42:05.881 --> 02:42:07.800
They have like the thing called an elk bar.

2667
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:11.760
It's the same thing as a warrior bar, but it's made an elk high in protein.

2668
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.720
Really good. Like a um, almost like big beef jerky sticks. Good.

2669
02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:20.010
You might get that. A lot of good stuff on there. A on it.com/jocko.

2670
02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:22.170
You'd like something, get something. Also,

2671
02:42:22.171 --> 02:42:25.770
we've got some books that the books that were written by John Striker Meyer,

2672
02:42:26.110 --> 02:42:30.780
the books, but written by tilt. You can get those on Amazon across the fence.

2673
02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.560
The secret war in Vietnam on the ground,

2674
02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:39.510
the secret war in Vietnam and SOG chronicles volume one.

2675
02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:43.800
Check those books out there. They're really amazing to read especially,

2676
02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:45.930
and they're kind of books that when you read them,

2677
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:51.270
you have to actually slow down. Think about what the hell is actually going on,

2678
02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:54.570
man. Because when you think about what's actually going on,

2679
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:56.580
you'll realize that the,

2680
02:42:56.581 --> 02:43:00.120
what these guys were doing was just absolutely completely insane.

2681
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:03.600
So check out those books. Also check out,

2682
02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:06.210
weigh the warrior kid three where there's a will.

2683
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:10.980
That book is live and ready for you to read or for ready for your kids.

2684
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:12.010
Read also got way the

2685
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:14.530
<v 3>warrior kid won the and way the warrior kid two marks. Mission.</v>

2686
02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:17.800
These are good books to get kids on the path.

2687
02:43:17.801 --> 02:43:20.020
All those little things that you want kids to know,

2688
02:43:20.021 --> 02:43:22.810
but they don't really listen to you because you're their parent.

2689
02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:27.910
This is the ultimate flank. And if you listen to JP Denelle,

2690
02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:31.900
he says that these warrior kid books are a flank on the parent to thing.

2691
02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:35.560
Yet they are 100% as is Mikey and the dragons,

2692
02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:40.810
which is a book for kids to learn how to overcome fear.

2693
02:43:40.930 --> 02:43:44.260
So check those out. Then we've got the discipline equals freedom field manual,

2694
02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:48.880
which will tell you how to get after it. You don't need to ask.

2695
02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:54.100
You can just get the manual. Well that'd be nice. Yeah. Oh, it's true.

2696
02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:57.010
It is nice. Yes. You get that field manual and you're good to go.

2697
02:43:57.011 --> 02:44:00.520
If you want the audio version of it, it's on iTunes, Amazon music,

2698
02:44:00.521 --> 02:44:03.880
Google play and other MP3 platforms.

2699
02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:07.180
And then of course you've got extreme ownership and that dichotomy of

2700
02:44:07.181 --> 02:44:07.720
leadership.

2701
02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:12.610
The two books that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin talking about everything

2702
02:44:12.611 --> 02:44:17.140
that we've learned in combat and how you can take those lessons and you can

2703
02:44:17.141 --> 02:44:21.700
utilize them with your business, with your team,

2704
02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:25.810
with your life. So check those out. Also, we've got echelon front.

2705
02:44:25.811 --> 02:44:27.190
That's my leadership consultancy.

2706
02:44:27.191 --> 02:44:31.240
And what we do is solve problems through leadership.

2707
02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:36.010
Every problem that exists in your organization is a leadership problem.

2708
02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:41.140
So if you need help fixing that leadership problem and thereby fixing the

2709
02:44:41.141 --> 02:44:42.970
problems that you have inside your organization,

2710
02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:48.270
go national on front.com if you [inaudible]

2711
02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:54.270
need further instruction, if you want something beyond this podcast,

2712
02:44:54.271 --> 02:44:56.850
if you want to come to the muster,

2713
02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:02.670
the monster is a leadership training seminar,

2714
02:45:02.700 --> 02:45:03.750
I guess I'd call it.

2715
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:09.230
It's a leadership convention and what we do is go deep dive,

2716
02:45:10.321 --> 02:45:12.000
get granular on leadership.

2717
02:45:12.270 --> 02:45:16.650
The next one is September 19th and 20th in Denver and then after that it's

2718
02:45:16.651 --> 02:45:21.180
December 4th and fifth in Sydney, Australia, every single we've done seven,

2719
02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:24.620
they've all sold out. These are going to sell out too, so if you want to come,

2720
02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:27.780
go to extreme ownership.com and sign up and if you can't come to that,

2721
02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:33.140
you can go to EMF online.com and that's our leadership training,

2722
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:41.000
interactive online platform where you can get the skills,

2723
02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:46.050
you can reinforce the skills, the skills that I talk about on this podcast,

2724
02:45:46.051 --> 02:45:48.030
the skills that we wrote about in the books.

2725
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:52.710
Those skills need further training all the time.

2726
02:45:53.170 --> 02:45:56.700
You never master these things, so go to Yaffe online.com and check that out.

2727
02:45:56.910 --> 02:46:01.910
And then there's of course GF Overwatch where we've been taking proven leaders,

2728
02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:07.910
tested leaders from special operations and from combat aviation and putting them

2729
02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:12.560
into companies in the civilian sector that need leadership.

2730
02:46:13.310 --> 02:46:14.840
So if you're looking to hire,

2731
02:46:14.841 --> 02:46:18.020
don't always hire just because someone has experience,

2732
02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:20.330
hire for character,

2733
02:46:20.331 --> 02:46:24.110
hire for leadership capability and then you teach them this,

2734
02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:27.800
the industry specifics because that's easier than trying to teach someone

2735
02:46:27.801 --> 02:46:29.480
character. We're trying to teach someone leadership,

2736
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:35.050
the f overwatch.com if you need leadership and if you want to converse with us

2737
02:46:37.791 --> 02:46:38.624
further,

2738
02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:43.550
then we are on the interwebs all on Twitter,

2739
02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:48.560
on Instagram and on that show face you boy hush.

2740
02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:50.260

Thank you for being there for us.

paramedics and EMT ts and dispatchers and correctional officers and border

you might be scared and you might be tired in,

2755
02:47:49.471 --> 02:47:54.471
you might be surrounded by the enemy who is preparing to attack,

2756
02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:58.470
but you know what? You're still alive.

2757
02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:02.410
So get the high ground,

2758
02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:07.740
set up your perimeter lock and load your weapons and go get after it.

2759
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:11.120
And until next time,
