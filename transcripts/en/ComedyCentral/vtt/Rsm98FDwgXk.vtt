00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.841
HOWEVER, ABRAHAM LINCOLN

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.944
WAS REQUESTING
EDWIN PERFORM SHAKESPEARE

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.113
AT GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.848
AM I [bleep] IT UP, GUYS?

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.783
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.352
WHAT--IS IT [bleep] IT UP?

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.188
OKAY, OKAY.
[mumbling]

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.824
OKAY.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.826
AT THE FORD'S THEATRE,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.328
WHEN JOHN WILKES BOOTH
WAS GESTICULATING,

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.464
ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SISTER-IN-LAW
IS LIKE,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.100
I THINK HE'S POINTING AT YOU,
ABRAHAM.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.601
AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS LIKE,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.271
IT DOES SEEM LIKE
HE'S POINTING AT ME.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.473
UHH...

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.041
THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.378
HE SHOULD, UH, YOU KNOW,

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.014
NOT BE POINTING AT ME
DURING THIS PARTICULAR LINE

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.552
BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF...
AGGRESSIVE.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:56.190 line:0%
 
IN NOVEMBER 1864,
EDWIN BOOTH IS LIKE,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.859 line:0%
 
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I WANNA GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.360
WE'VE HAD SOME HARD TIMES.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.130
LET'S DO A PLAY
TOGETHER AGAIN,

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.834
FOR ONE PERFORMANCE ONLY--
<i>JULIUS CAESAR.</i>

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.237
JOHN WILKES' FAVORITE ROLE
WAS BRUTUS,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.875
THE MAN THAT EXECUTES
A TYRANT.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.879
AND EDWIN BOOTH IS LIKE,
I GET TO PLAY BRUTUS.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.582
[trumpets sounding]

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.350
FOR ONE PERFORMANCE ONLY,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.353
IN THE PRODUCTION OF
<i>JULIUS CAESAR,</i>

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:31.091
EDWIN SAID,
<i>"SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS,"</i>

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.427
AND EVERYONE LOVES IT.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.695
CRITICS SAID THAT IT WAS

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.866
THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOW
OF ALL TIME.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.169
SO JOHN WILKES BOOTH
STARTED GETTING INVOLVED

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.905
WITH A SECRET
CONFEDERATE SOCIETY

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:50.744
AND HAD MASTERMINDED A PLAN
TO KIDNAP LINCOLN.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.014
UHH...

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.682
MM-MM.
