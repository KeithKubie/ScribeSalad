00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.710
It’s no secret that people love theorizing
and speculating about Star Wars.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.720
And with new movies coming out every year
for the foreseeable future, there’s no shortage

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.780
of discussions to be had.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.000
Even before The Force Awakens, the franchise
had numerous questions that were never answered,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.690
and now with an all-new canon that includes
novels, comics, and TV shows, just about anything

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.690
is possible.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.710
As we wait to see what the future films have
in store, here are 10 Star Wars mysteries

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.149
that can’t be answered (so far).

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.170
Is Kylo Ren Redeemable?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.429
Darth Vader’s arc in the classic trilogy
was turning back to the light side through

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.339
his relationship with Luke, so viewers are
wondering if something similar is in store

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.710
with Kylo Ren.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.690
The new villain is obviously torn between
the two sides of the Force and seeks to consume

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.449
himself in the darkness.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.800
He even commits an ultimate act of evil when
he murders his father, Han Solo.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.960
For fans, that’s an unforgivable transgression
and the filmmakers seem to be setting up Ben

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.350
Solo as someone who cannot be saved.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.020
That would be a nice change-of-pace for the
franchise, but it’s still early to say for

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.040
sure.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.230
Who Is Snoke?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.690
Given J.J. Abrams’ shaky history with keeping
character names a secret, many were convinced

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.610
that Episode 7’s Supreme Leader Snoke wasn’t
really Snoke.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.350
From the moment the character was announced,
theories ran rampant, with the common belief

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.380
being that he is Darth Plagueis, the Emperor’s
former master.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.940
Though, in the finished film, there’s no
misdirection with his identity.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.210
Still, questions about Snoke have only increased
since Force Awakens’ premiere, and there’s

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.110
sure to be more of his backstory revealed
in the coming episodes.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.530
At the very least, how he rose to power is
a subject worth exploring.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.170
What Is Luke’s Mission?

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.110
The opening line from the Episode 7 text crawl
informed fans that hero Luke Skywalker has

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.810
vanished, and both the First Order and the
Resistance are searching for him.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.070
Since his screentime in Force Awakens is all
too brief, why Luke disappeared is something

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.810
not really touched upon.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.009
It sounds like it was Ben Solo’s turn to
the Dark Side that forced Luke into isolation,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.780
but that doesn’t explain what Skywalker
was trying to accomplish.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.780
Why he chose Ahch-To and what he intends to
do while there is something fans are dying

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.730
to know, and with Mark Hamill getting a meatier
role in Episode 8, they’ll most likely learn

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.140
the answers.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.250
Forgetting the Droids

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.610
By including R2-D2 and C-3PO in the prequel
trilogy, George Lucas created some retroactive

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.670
plot holes in the originals.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.820
Chief among them is the oddity that nobody
recognizes the droids, despite having multiple

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.250
interactions with them.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.621
C-3PO served on the Lars family farm years
before the Jawas sold him to Uncle Owen, and

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:47.990
R2-D2 served with the Republic in the Clone
Wars, fighting alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.181
They could just be playing dumb, but it creates
an unnecessary distraction when watching the

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.310
complete saga.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.150
Unlike droids, humans seemingly can’t have
their memories erased, so their forgetting

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.660
fairly recognizable droids is a head-scratcher.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.349
What Happened to the Ewoks?

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.209
Without the Ewoks, the Rebel Alliance may
not have won the Battle of Endor to defeat

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.810
the Empire, meaning they were a huge part
of the original trilogy.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.280
So what happened to them?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.800
Due to the Death Star exploding right over
the forest moon, some say that the species

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.870
experienced a nuclear winter and faded into
extinction following their celebration.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.240
That’s a bit dark for Star Wars, and even
though the Ewoks aren’t beloved, fans hope

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.400
their fate is a little more pleasant than
that.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.970
Hopefully they’re mentioned in a canon book
so those who do enjoy them can get some peace

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.350
of mind.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.599
Who Is Ben Mendelsohn Playing?

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.100
Talented character actor Ben Mendelsohn was
a great addition to the Star Wars universe,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.630
and many fans are excited to see him play
the main villain in Rogue One.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.410
Just as they did with The Force Awakens, Lucasfilm
is keeping the new character names largely

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.410
under wraps; meaning the identity of his character
is still a mystery.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.500
The only clue is his Imperial uniform, which
strongly resembles that of a Grand Admiral.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.220
Could Mendelsohn be playing the canonical
version of EU evildoer Grand Admiral Thrawn,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.000
someone people want to see in the movies.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.879
His physical appearance is different from
the blue alien, but he’s obviously an important

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.069
figure.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.930
Who is Jyn Erso?

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.250
The Rogue One trailer revealed that Felicity
Jones is playing Jyn Erso, but her introduction

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.250
is somewhat confusing.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.410
She’s being escorted through a Rebel base
in handcuffs before receiving an assignment

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.570
from Mon Mothma.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.350
Originally, viewers believed that all the
heroes would already be affiliated with the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.150
Rebel Alliance, but it looks like Jyn is being
recruited to the cause and is a newcomer.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.130
Her backstory will be interesting to learn,
given her importance in the Galactic Civil

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.130
War.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.910
Why the Rebels seek Jyn out despite her criminal
record is a big question, and hopefully the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.120
film has a good reason for it.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.110
The New Stormtroopers

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.130
Rogue One features more than just the classic
stormtrooper design, showcasing all-new Death

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.110
Troopers decked in black, as well as ones
with tan armor.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.900
Their inclusion is somewhat surprising, since
these soldiers are not featured in the three

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.270
installments of the classic trilogy.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.050
Their inclusion has raised some questions
as to why that is, with one possible answer

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.300
being that they are plot-specific and are
not needed in the main saga.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.030
While it isn’t a huge deal, it would be
nice to see the film provide some kind of

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.090
explanation as to why these new stormtroopers
are needed and why they disappear from the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.000
fight afterwards.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.990
Is Vader in Rogue One?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.240
It’s long been rumored that Darth Vader
would make his big screen return to wreck

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.530
havoc in Rogue One, but the teaser did not
make any mention of the Sith Lord.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.130
Choosing to spotlight the new characters,
some fans have started to wonder if it’s

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.780
a sign that Vader will not be in the spinoff.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.570
With Ben Mendelsohn’s character being positioned
as the chief antagonist, it is a possibility.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.430
On the other hand, Lucasfilm waited until
the second Force Awakens trailer to show Han

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.860
Solo and Chewbacca, so they could be holding
back for a great reveal.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.160
Star Wars sells itself after all, there’s
no need to rush.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.520
Who are Rey’s Parents?

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.110
Sequel trilogy protagonist Rey has a mysterious
backstory that will most definitely be explored

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.040
in the upcoming installments.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.940
Since fans first saw her, they’ve been wondering
who her parents are.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.770
Since the numbered episodes chronicle the
Skywalker family saga, the most prevalent

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.340
theory is Rey is Luke’s daughter.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.389
That may be too obvious, but there’s enough
evidence to support it.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.340
It’s frustrating for viewers to be left
in the dark, but it gives the upcoming movies

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.900
material to explore and the filmmakers have
promised a satisfying answer.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.060
After all, nobody knew Luke’s true heritage
until The Empire Strikes Back, so it’s best

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.310
to let it all play out.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.680
Those are our picks for Star Wars mysteries
that haven’t yet been solved (but could

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
be soon).

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.620
Are there any we missed?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.520
