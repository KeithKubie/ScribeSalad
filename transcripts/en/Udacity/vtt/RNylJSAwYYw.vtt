00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, everything is in place so that you can compute

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how to rescue Apollo 13, which is homework too.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can use sine and cosine to make the moon go around the Earth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You can use the differential equation to describe the motion of the spacecraft.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You know how to fire the rocket to decelerate the spacecraft

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to take it to a low trajectory around the moon and you can compute

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
by how much to boost the rocket to guarantee a safe return to Earth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The method to be using for that would be Heun's method

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because we need a quite amount of accuracy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This diagram is really not to scale the Earth and the moon are far more distant as shown here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This figure 8 loop is much more narrow.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The packing orbit is pretty close to the surface of the Earth.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And this loop around the moon is much closer around the moon as you see here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Actually, for the stimulation, we have to make this loop around the moon a little wider

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to not spend that much computation time on that.
