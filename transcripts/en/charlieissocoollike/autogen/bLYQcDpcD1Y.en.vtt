the best thing you could do on the
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.820
the best thing you could do on the
island and it was incredibly beautiful

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
island and it was incredibly beautiful
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.100
island and it was incredibly beautiful
and there were also a lot of other

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
and there were also a lot of other
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.110

people who wanted to see it most of the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
people who wanted to see it most of the
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.310

time we just sort of chilled out on

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320
time we just sort of chilled out on
 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.170
time we just sort of chilled out on
Santorini but there was that one day

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
Santorini but there was that one day
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.760
Santorini but there was that one day
when we went on a pirate ship to go

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
when we went on a pirate ship to go
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.640
when we went on a pirate ship to go
visit a volcano so let's chill we hiked

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
visit a volcano so let's chill we hiked
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.140
visit a volcano so let's chill we hiked
up to the top of the central island in

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
up to the top of the central island in
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.520
up to the top of the central island in

Santorini which has only been recently
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.160
Santorini which has only been recently
created by the volcano and I will admit

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
created by the volcano and I will admit
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.540
created by the volcano and I will admit
that the whole time we were hiking up

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
that the whole time we were hiking up
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.340
that the whole time we were hiking up
there I did think that we were on our

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350
there I did think that we were on our
 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.440
there I did think that we were on our
way to see an actual volcano crater with

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
is very very deep underground so instead
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.130
is very very deep underground so instead
we saw some steam which was still pretty

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140
we saw some steam which was still pretty
 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.590
we saw some steam which was still pretty
cool less dramatic though and finally we

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
cool less dramatic though and finally we
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.630
cool less dramatic though and finally we
kept off our trip by taking our pirate

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640
kept off our trip by taking our pirate
 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.550
