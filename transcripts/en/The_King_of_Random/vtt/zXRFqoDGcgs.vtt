00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.020
Hey what's up guys

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.600
Welcome back

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.500
I brought you out to the Arizona desert again,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.840
It's a little bit cold and windy today

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.520
But that's ok

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.880
Because we are here for the view

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.540
Now I found a location where apparently it's okay to break glass and that's a good thing because

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.700
I have a potentially deconstructive experiment that I've been wanting to try with this glass vaccuum chamber

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.040
Now I got the idea of using a glass cookie jar from my cousin Ty Moser

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.100
But there was a concern that it could implode violently

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.780
So the purpose of this experiment is to push the boundaries and get them to go off

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.500
So we can see when they do implode

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.480
How violent and how far reaching is that shrapnel gonna be.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.800
So let me show you the setup we got rigged out here today

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.500
The idea is to assemble the vacuum chamber and pull 25 inches of mercury to create the strongest vacuum that we can get with this system

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.580
Then I'm going to shut off the valve to keep the vacuum pressure, turn off the pump and use a hammer to gently tap the side

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.320
So we can test just how much force it will take to get the side walls to crack and make the whole system implode

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.120
Now normally if you were to put something into a container and make it explode it will shoot shards in every different direction

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.360
Now this is a little different because we are sucking all the air out of the jar and it's creating a vacuum pressure sucking everything inside

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.520
If the structural integrity of the jar fails everything should pull in and smash in the middle

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.200
I've also a face shield and extra layers of clothing and some really thick gloves

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.440
Because even if it does smash inward I do expect shards of glass will still spray in every different direction

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.760
So lets suck out the air, grab a hammer and see how everything turns out

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.460
What does a GoPro do in a vacuum chamber we're going to find that out too

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.520
Alright guys its action time and truthfully I'm a little bit nervous cause I'm not sure what to expect so we're just going to have to jump in and find out

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.660
Let's get that gauge rising

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.740
Hey see the gauge is rising right now we're pulling about, we're coming up on 20 inches of mercury

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.240
25 inches of mercury is the highest we can go with this vacuum pump, that's the strongest vacuum we can get

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.520
This one is designed to suck out air conditioning units so it's actually a very strong vacuum

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.140
Once it hits 25 inches of mercury I'm going to turn off the valve so it maintains vacuum pressure in the jar

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.080
Then I'm going to turn off the vacuum pump so it stops making noise and we can get the full effect of the implosion

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.840
Alright it looks like its time

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.320
I'm not really sure how close I should be to this thing so I'm just gonna attack it from a distance

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.060
And start off with some gentle taps and then see exactly what it takes to crack it and make it go off.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.100
(Taps glass)

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.920
There's a gentle tap let's try that again

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.700
(Taps glass)

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.460
(Taps glass)

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.060
Okay (Taps glass) it's actually holding up pretty well  I'm going to tap it a little bit harder

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.280
(Taps glass)

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.620
A little bit harder

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.440
(Taps glass)

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.980
A little bit harder

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.620
(Taps glass)

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.960
I think I actually chipped the glass on that one it's still holding up

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.940
I'm going to hit it even harder

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.380
(Breaks glass)

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.620
Whoa!!!!!(Breaths heavily)

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.460
(Breaks Glass) (In Slow-Mo)

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.380
Winding up...

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.940
And there it goes.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.720
And there's like a mist of glass dust that shoots out of the top and just blows with the wind

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.960
Even if I wasn't wearing any protective clothing I think I still would have been okay

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.120
Because any glass that would have come at me would be so low energy it would just bounce off

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.160
With with not much difficulty but it's always a good idea to be wearing safety equipment though

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.580
Check this out guys

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.840
Check this out

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.720
My proto putty looks like it's stayed intact we could just pop that off and reuse it on another jar

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.680
So looking at the damage down here guys you can see the bottom of the jar is completely annihilated

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.340
There's chunks of it over here, chunks of it over there and about a billion pieces of it over here

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.240
But I am pretty encouraged because most of it stayed in one spot there weren't any jagged pieces that shot out

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.840
And that's what I was worried about

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.740
I might have to make a new one of these lids now  because I ruined the finish that's too bad

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.520
I think it took just as much effort to crack the side wall as it would if it was at standard atmospheric pressure

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.120
If you went to the hardware store and got one of those one-foot concrete pavers and tried to smash that with a hammer

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.140
I think it would take about the same amount of force to crack that in half as it would break this jar

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.220
That's just based on feeling, that's not scientific that's just my opinion

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.040
That was the large jar how will the small jar do will it be able to withstand more force because its smaller

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.840
Let's go find out

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.320
I can't tell if this thing is actually working right now the LCD screen is completely shot

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.820
But the red light is flashing so I'm going to stick it in and see if we can get another shot

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.520
With a smaller vacuum chamber

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.500
Alright I got the vacuum pump off lets smash it

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.580
(Taps glass)

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.260
(Taps glass)

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.900
(Taps glass)

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.100
Alright I'm going to give this one a pretty good whack here

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.800
(Taps and breaks glass)

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.440
Whew!

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.440
Very nice, very nice

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.120
So every time we have a rapid decompression it seems like my GoPro just shuts off

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.380
The LCD screen has imploded

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.040
Eh it's gone completely dark and I can't see anything I'm just hoping we recovered some of that footage because that would be cool to see

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.080
If you look down here though the Proto putty gasket just popped right off

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.600
And its still in really good condition we could just pop that onto another jar and reuse it again

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.120
The only difference is look really closely here and you can see a very fine mist of glass dust so when this thing imploded

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.340
It made a cloud of dust that pops up the top and covers everything

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.920
I can't tell if the ground was shaking or if it was just the pressure wave but the camera jumped there

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.540
It almost looked like the dirt does suck up from the bottom that's really crazy

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.620
It just kinda rises and falls in the same spot

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.860
Now since we got one more small jar left let's switch things up a little bit so rather then smashing it with a hammer

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.200
Let's try lifting it up and dropping it on a rock instead

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.480
Alright we're at 25 how high do I have to drop it before this thing will break

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.720
Lets just start off at about 6 inches

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.720
Haha that was enough to do it

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.240
Hehaha

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.140
Maybe I should have started off at 6 inches that was more like a foot

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.240
And it just crumbles when it hits the rock it just completely disappears

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.460
Gotta see that again

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.340
There's the drop

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.140
And booom

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.340
That's amazing yup no explosion it just completely disintegrates and the lid keeps falling at the same rate that's very cool

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.940
So why would you even use a cookie jar for a vacuum chamber well for me its just to be able to see inside and look at the reactions going on

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.120
You could spend hundreds of dollars  on big professional glass bell jars that are designed for that purpose

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.280
But after testing here today I personally be pretty comfortable moving forward with glass cookie jars from now on

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.960
As long as you're not dinging them denting, throwing rocks at them or hitting them with hammers

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.500
They should hold up relatively well

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.540
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't wear safety equipment

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.720
It's good to be prepared

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.120
So there you have it guys it looks like I'm not going home with any extra holes in my body today so I think we can call it a successful test

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.240
It's really cool to see just what happens when a glass vacuum chamber implodes

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.880
And don't worry about this mess we will be cleaning it up before we leave

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.860
