00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.535
- Surpr--oh, it's just Brooke.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey, is Chasey
coming down soon?

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.139
'Cause I'm illegally parked.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.306
- You got him a car?
- Yeah.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.042
- He's 14.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.611
- Hey, well, everybody's gonna
get him a car when he's 16.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.113
- Oh, whoa, sick ride, baby.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.615
- I got it for Chase.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.916
I think he's wheely
gonna like it.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.051
You know,
'cause of the wheels.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.586
- [laughs]
- Hi, Lance.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.655
This guy's with me,
Brooke Dubek.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.991
- Sorry, you're not
on the list.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.392
- Oh, family doesn't need
to be on the list.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.427
I know that
'cause I made it.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.195
- It doesn't matter.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.197
If you're not on the list,
you have to go in standby.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.002
- With the losers?
- [scoffs]

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.637
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.938
- It's so good to see you.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.407
You're so tan.
Did you go on vacation?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.377
- Oh, no, I went on
"Watch What Happens Live."

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.978
- You did?
- Yeah.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.248
It was stupid but,
you know, it was cool.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.751
- God, this party's crazy.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.053
Your brother's gotten so huge.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.522
My students would die if they
knew I was here right now.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.724
- I can get you a picture
with him if you want.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.160
- Oh, um...

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.428
- Or with Esther Lay.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.596
I just met her.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.298
She's really, really nice.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.667
I mean, it's weird that
she's here, but, you know,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.036
it's helpful
to know people like that.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.571
- Why, is she a director?

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.539
- No, she's a chip heiress.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.241
- Oh.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.877
- Supris--ah, damn it.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.679
Hey, uh, is ChaseDreams
still up there?

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.314
Because I got him a present.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.682
I think he's wheely gonna--
[horn honking]

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.785
Hey, go around.
Just go around me!

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.588
- Can't believe I'm in line for
a party that I planned.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.856
- I know what
could cheer you up.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.657
Check out my new shoes.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.260
They're dry-erase, so you can
make 'em any kind you want:

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.596
Nike, Adidas, red.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.198
Right now, they say,
"Happy birthday, Chase."

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.135
Actually, they say
"Hap irthda, Cha."

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.504
I ran here.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.007
- Yeah, someone named
@CaryDreamsFeet started

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.979
following me, which is so weird
because my feet are fine.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.047
- You should get
the foot filter app.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.484
- Yeah, it really smooths out
your feet and toes for pics.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.319
- Oh, that's a good idea.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:01.954
- I'm Jeremy, by the way.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.056
- Oh, sorry, that's Jeremy.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.926
- [gasps]
Hi, you're Jeremy?

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.194
- Yes.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.829
- Are you really gay?
- Yes.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.264
- [gasps]

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.634
Cary, this is so good.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.736
- Thanks, Mom.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.437
- Mona, I wanna
go over there.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.006
- Okay.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.242
I love gay guys.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.312
- So you been
DVRing "RHONY"?

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.047
- No, Lance, I'm
a businesswoman now,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.383
so I don't have time for
"Real Housewives of New York."

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.051
- That's why I DVR.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.419
- Okay, two more.

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:35.955
- Oh, thank God.
I have to pee so bad.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.557
- Oh, ow.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.058
Remember to send Chasey down.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.494
I don't want him to forget
about me tonight.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.629
Or whatever.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:46.299
- Why is the women's line
so long?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.967
It's like, use the men's.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.502
That's what it's for.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.605
See, totally empty.

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:53.773
[gasps]

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.342
Oh, Chase.
- Little man.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.510
- [moans]

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.680
- God, he looks like shit.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.014
Do you think
anyone saw him?

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.083
- No, we took him
out the back, B.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.286
No one will ever
even know he left.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.989
- Any minute now.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.958
- This is ridiculous.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:15.361
I was downstairs for 30 minutes
and he got this wasted?

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.196
You know, sometimes
I feel like I'm the only one

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.197
that's looking out for him.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.565
- What about Care?

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:20.933
- I mean, yeah, he's great,

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.070
he's just--he's a little
orange right now.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.071
- You mean like tan?

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.640
- No, like orange inside.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.242
[both laugh]

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.577
I think he's just
going through something.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.145
He's not the only one.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:34.480
I didn't see my mom
once tonight.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.149
Like, where the [bleep]
was she?

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.420
- Girl, you are
loving these nuts.

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:44.557
You mom is my friggin'
spirit animal right now.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.392
- Very cool, Mona.

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.028
- Wait, I have to tell you
what happened this week.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.697
I joined a gym,
as you can see,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.166
and my first morning
on the treadmill,

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.068
one of my students
got on next to me.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.037
- No.
- Yes.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.272
I was too embarrassed
to let him see me run,

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.007
so I hid in the locker room

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.142
and watched clips of dogs
feeling guilty on my phone.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.111
- The same thing
just happened to me.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.479
I had to start working out

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.282
'cause I was on
"Watch What Happens Live."

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.516
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.018
- Yeah, I mean,
like, it was stupid,

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.288
but, you know, some people
said I was good on it.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.857
- Well, I can't wait
to watch it.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.126
- Oh, I could pull it
up right now.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.595
- Oh, um...
- Just--yeah, I mean, just--

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:24.797
Just--yeah, okay,
here we go.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.466
It's still loading.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:28.968
Still loading.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.403
I think
it's taking a long time

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.139
'cause I'm downloading
that foot filter app.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.641
- I can't believe Chase's
first time getting drunk

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.410
was in a club.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.512
I just wanted him to have
a typical teenage experience,

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.914
like mine.
- What was yours?

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:44.016
- I got wasted on a thing
of peach schnapps under my bed

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.519
and my mom found the bottle
and grounded me

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.988
and then I told her
I wished she was dead

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.456
and we didn't talk
for a month.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.558
Chase'll never get that.

00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:54.193
- What, don't worry,
cook Brooke,

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.695
he'll have plenty of firsts.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.930
Maybe he'll lose his V-card
the way you did.

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:59.365
- To the drummer
from Snow Patrol?

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:00.766
Ew, Lance.

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.702
- [vomits]
- Ew, Chase.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.036
[tires squeal]

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.871
- Out, everybody out.

00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:08.974
- No, sir, we're about
to get on the bridge.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.743
- I don't care.
Out!

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.712
- All right, it should
load better out here.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.047
- Surpri--oh, God damn it.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.049
- Streeter?
- God damn it.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.784
- Did you get Chase a car?

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.853
- Yes, I got him a car,
and it's a great deal too.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:23.756
He only has to say Chevy Camaro
in his next three songs.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.725
- Uber for Jordan?
- Uh, what?

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:26.926
- Uber for Jordan.
I'm Jordan.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.561
- This isn't an Uber.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.096
- Sorry, I don't like it
when the drivers talk to me.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.598
- Yeah, this is good.
You're cute.

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:33.699
- Yeah, thanks.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.568
- Should we go back inside?

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.337
- Oh, no, was it--was it weird
that I made you watch that?

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.106
- Yes.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.575
- Okay, uh, well,
we want to go back inside.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.609
CaryDreams.

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.578
- You're not on the list.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.680
- Try gay brother.
