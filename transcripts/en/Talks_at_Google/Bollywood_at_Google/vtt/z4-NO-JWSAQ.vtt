00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.030
VIKAS MARWAHA: So
as you all know,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.940
Ayushmann is not only a singer,
actor, television personality.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.930
At the age of 20, Ayushmann
won "MTV Roadies 2."

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.600
You know how hard
it could be, like,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.390
winning "MTV Roadies
2" at the age of 20,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.860
which is a great accomplishment.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.886
And then we saw him
an ever popular VJ

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:23.510
for MTV and "The
Voice of Youngistaan,"

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.120
with which he won the
hearts of millions of youth.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.760
A native of Chandigarh, he has
become a national heartthrob,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.560
bagging critical acclaims
for movies like "Vicky Donor"

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.040
and "Dum Laga Ke Haisha."

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.260
Welcome to Google.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.222
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Hi.

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:47.232
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.440
Frankly speaking, I was not
expecting this gathering.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.940
I thought it was
just a Google chat,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.660
I'll be online
chatting with people.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.710
But this is in real
flesh and blood.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.837
Good to see you guys.

00:00:57.837 --> 00:00:59.420
VIKAS MARWAHA: Welcome
to Google, bro.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.090
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Thank you very much.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.410
VIKAS MARWAHA: It's
great to see you,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.000
like, your energy is just great.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.645
I love it, man.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.270
That's awesome.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.379
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Were
you there last night?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.180
VIKAS MARWAHA: I wasn't there.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.827
But--

00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:08.243
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: You have
no idea about my energy then.

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.610
AUDIENCE: We are real
friends over here.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.086
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: You
were there, of course, yeah.

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:15.460
VIKAS MARWAHA: So this is your
first North American tour.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.350
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: How
has your tour been so far?

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.850
VIKAS MARWAHA: In
fact, technically,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.326
it is not a first visit to
Frisco this is and Jose.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:22.700
This is the second
time I'm here.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.350
I was there for the
Independence Day parade in 2013.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.190
But the performance, I think
the energy was amazing.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.020
There is a sizable size of
Indian diaspora staying here.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.860
And it's always good to see
Indians away from India.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.250
I think the connect that
they have with the country is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.080
through music, through cinema,
through cricket, through food.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.917
So I think I'm glad
of those four things.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:48.000
VIKAS MARWAHA: We have a
lot of questions for you.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.920
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.780
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.040
How old are you?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.300
VIKAS MARWAHA: I'm 34.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.360
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
You're older than me.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.010
VIKAS MARWAHA: You're probably
three years younger than me.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.457
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: You
look younger than 34.

00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:03.140
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.120
OK, so Ayushmann, how
did your childhood

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.060
go, your family shape
you who you are today?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.530
Like it was your parents
a lot supportive in you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.572
becoming a singer, actor.

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:15.071
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I seriously feel

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.790
you are combination, or
amalgamation, or maybe

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.900
sum total of whatever experience
the experiences you go through

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.210
in life, be it your
friends, your family,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.390
I think your peers, your
family, the shape you are,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.930
the person you are
when you grow up.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.030
I had a very middle
class upbringing.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.014
And though my father
was pretty well to do,

00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:34.180
but he [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.182
He never used to give me a bike
or car [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:42.390
So I think it really helps
you a lot when you grow up

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.350
and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.870
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.520
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.050
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.580
And she was like, no,
you can't be an actor.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.380
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
I don't know.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.422
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] acting,

00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:02.672
singing, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.160
Then they are like--

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.618
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I used to sing.

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:11.160
I used to act, and my dad used
to say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.300
But I think now, I'm sure
she must be proud of me.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.100
She's no more.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.815
I'm a singer because of her.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.460
She used to sing
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.611
And my father plays flute.

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:24.610
But of course they were
not professional singers

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.710
and musicians.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.890
But I think the genes
trickled further down.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.680
And I'm blessed, probably.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.480
VIKAS MARWAHA: So tell us,
you went to "MTV Roadies 2"

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.740
at a fairly young age, like
around 21, the "MTV Roadies."

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.120
How did you manage to let
your fame not affect while you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.204
went to school after that?

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:46.953
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I
think when I was 20,

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:48.230
I became really high-headed.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.790
I broke up with my girlfriend.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.040
That was the first time I
was getting female attention

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.720
in life, and I was 20.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.070
And before that I
used to wear braces,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.660
glasses, I was very skinny.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.014
But the Roadies were.

00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:01.430
And I thought, you
know, I started

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.280
getting attention-- I broke up.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.462
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:06.920
Start to think I'm
the biggest star

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.253
in country, something like that.

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:09.960
I'm glad I started young.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.460
I can digust fame now.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.650
And I have a stable
head on my shoulders

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.490
now because I started
young, probably.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.060
First time I tasted fame
was when I was 19 or 18,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.450
during "Pop Stars." "Roadies"
was the second reality

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.950
show for me.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.140
VIKAS MARWAHA:
Yes, that's right.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.530
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
But I think it's always

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.395
good to start young.

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:27.728
VIKAS MARWAHA: Yeah, how was it.

00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:29.571
Yeah, you were facing Raghu.

00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:31.420
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.360
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.650
He's a nice guy.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.080
He's very sweet.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.510
And you'd be surprised, Raghu
has a great taste in music.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.224
He plays the guitar, and we
jammed together a lot of times.

00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:42.390
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.056
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
So I think that he's

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:46.789
like an elder brother to
me, and he guides me a lot.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.830
And he's a very nice guy.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.780
I think it's just
an image on screen

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.649
that people think
that he's very rude.

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:52.440
VIKAS MARWAHA: So--

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.120
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.990
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.010
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.170
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.900
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Why don't
you just guys ask questions?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.195
And I think this position
is slightly weird here.

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:03.070
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.480
I think we should just stand.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.100
VIKAS MARWAHA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.073
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I think I'm standing.

00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:11.476
This is much better.

00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:13.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.473
VIKAS MARWAHA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:18.180
AUDIENCE: When did you decide
to become an actor, or a singer,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.600
or both at the same
time, did you decide?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.930
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.830
AUDIENCE: Hey hey.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.830
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.970
I think I always
wanted to be an actor.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.250
I think the first film I saw
was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:42.150
So I thought, I can be
[INAUDIBLE] without a mustache,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.576
maybe the full beard.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.950
But I think I always wanted
to be an actor, and a singer,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.290
and actor, singer both.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.970
I always idolized
[INAUDIBLE], in fact.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.105
AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:52.990
Nice.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.571
Thank you.

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:54.820
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Thank you.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.236
AUDIENCE: I actually
wanted to ask

00:05:56.236 --> 00:05:59.150
you a question from the earlier
days, when you joined MTV.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.970
I recently came across
a [INAUDIBLE] video--

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.907
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
please go check it out.

00:06:08.907 --> 00:06:10.100
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: No.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.969
No.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.010
AUDIENCE: It's hilarious.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.090
I just wanted to know
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.070
because I know, [INAUDIBLE] you
were new there and [INAUDIBLE],

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.486
and everyone
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.509
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.300
Frankly speaking, have
you seen that video?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.883
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:30.760
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Good for you.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.640
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.640
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: It's
called MTV [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.490
I think there's two.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.664
Yeah.

00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:39.080
Emotionally, I think you are
vulnerable when you're young.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.050
So I think I was just too
vulnerable when I entered

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.341
[INAUDIBLE] for the first time.

00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:44.540
That was my first job,
in fact, on television.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.370
So yeah.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.110
It happened.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.970
I've grown up.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.130
I was 24 that time.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.302
Yeah.

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:53.046
I'm 31.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.490
I'm 32 this year.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.552
AUDIENCE: I was also
watching, the making of video.

00:07:01.552 --> 00:07:05.460
Though you suggested
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.420
And it was very
ahead of its time.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.780
So are there any other
songs that you're composed

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.670
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.194
How were you
introduced to singing?

00:07:16.194 --> 00:07:17.610
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I think, yeah,

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.530
we used to compose
our own songs,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.060
we used to do
theater in college.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.737
Or a college
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:07:21.737 --> 00:07:23.820
I think "Pani Da Rang,"
"Saddi Gali," [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.020
they are all college
compositions.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.980
And "O Heeriye" was recent.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.159
"Dil-e-Naadan" was also
a college composition.

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:31.950
But I think now we are
composing new stuff.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.320
I'll be coming up with
a single very soon.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.930
Next month, we're recording it.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.690
And yeah, I think, I always
wanted to be an actor, and then

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.321
a singer.

00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:42.320
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I
formed two theater groups

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.240
in Chandigarh.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.710
And we used to compose our
own songs for own productions.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.594
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:48.760
Acting career, music career.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.040
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.081
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Yeah.

00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:51.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.160
AUDIENCE: I don't
have a question,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.640
but I just want to say amazing
performance last night,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.416
really loved your show.

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:57.640
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: That doesn't
sound right, actually, you

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.520
know that, right?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.220
AUDIENCE: What?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.700
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Nothing.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.430
Just kidding.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.740
AUDIENCE: I just want to
say, I've been a fan of yours

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.490
for a long time.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.910
And I loved "Pani da
Rang," and "Saddi Gali."

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.030
And I love to sing, but I'm
a fantastic bathroom singer,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.420
and nothing more than that.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.580
But if I were a man I
would love to sing--

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.885
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I was
almost a living room singer,

00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:21.304
until I was [INAUDIBLE] but
then discovered I should sing,

00:08:21.304 --> 00:08:22.970
and I started taking
classical training,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.530
but never took it too seriously.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.299
AUDIENCE: I admire your vocals.

00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:28.590
You're a great performer and
a dancer, too, apparently,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.170
but what I admire the most
is really your humility.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.081
You're so down to earth,
and all my friends

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:34.539
that were there
with me last night,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.059
they're like Ayushmann
Khurrana, he's so down to earth.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:37.940
Anybody can connect with him.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.440
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
You know, I just

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.130
hope this mask doesn't
drop off of being humble.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.390
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.093
AUDIENCE: But I hope you
stay like this forever.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.676
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Thank you so much.

00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:49.330
Thank you so much.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.954
Wish you were there
for the performance

00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:53.540
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.660
Are you working here?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah I
do work for Google.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.473
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Call your friends?

00:08:56.473 --> 00:08:58.931
AUDIENCE: Are you ever planning
to sing full Punjabi songs,

00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:01.680
like join the Punjabi industry,
act in Punjabi movies?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.680
You are from Chandigarh.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.500
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
You'd be surprised,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.833
my Hindi is better than Punjabi.

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.690
Because my mom can't
speak in Punjabi.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.672
I can read and write
in Punjabi because it

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.690
is part of the
curriculum in Chandigarh.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.077
But I think in Indian
English more than Punjabi.

00:09:13.077 --> 00:09:14.035
But I write in Punjabi.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:15.220
I sing Punjabi songs.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.810
I think every
regional language has

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.950
a texture which stands
out when it's introduced

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.940
in the mainstream culture.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.340
That's why I think Punjabi is
the most acceptable language

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.594
in Indian film industry.

00:09:26.594 --> 00:09:28.010
Like everybody
wants to be Punjabi

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.370
in Indian film industry.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.230
It's crazy.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.960
But I think now we've over
discovered Punjab, and Dehli,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.310
and moving towards Bengal now.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.800
Yeah, I'm playing a Bengali
character in my next film.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.240
So I think, yeah, as I
said, I think every language

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.870
has a great texture.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.970
It just makes a song unique.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.260
It's makes it sound
better, in fact, in a way.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.410
Otherwise, it becomes
too generic, Hindi songs.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.450
I've sung two Hindi
songs, in fact.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.390
One is "Yahin Hoon
Main," my last number.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.840
And the other one
is "O Heeeriye,"

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.887
which is almost Hindi.

00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:01.220
Only the [INAUDIBLE] is Punjabi.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.730
The rest is Hindi.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.512
AUDIENCE: Hey Ayushmann.

00:10:04.512 --> 00:10:05.470
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Hi.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.420
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.330
AUDIENCE: Gujarat.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.120
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Gujarat
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.030
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.738
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:20.230
A vegetarian guy is walking.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.446
His spirit is so vegetarian.

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:22.280
AUDIENCE: That is true.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.190
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: You know,
my soul is very vegetarian,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.010
but I'm a non-vegetarian.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.950
AUDIENCE: So OK, you are
vegetarian still, right?

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.944
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Huh?

00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:28.150
AUDIENCE: You eat vegetarian.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.733
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I love vegetarian.

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:31.270
AUDIENCE: When you
ask him where he

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.250
is, he normally
replies depending

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.277
on the girl and friend.

00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:35.610
[INAUDIBLE] depends on the
girl and the friend, usually.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.070
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I didn't hear you.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.236
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I
think-- can you just increase

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.550
the level of the sound more?

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.340
I just--

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:47.451
AUDIENCE: I'm saying
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:49.428
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:51.636
AUDIENCE: You're very smart
sometimes, you know that?

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:53.055
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:53.212
[?

00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:54.001
AUDIENCE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] ?]

00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:54.850
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.570
AUDIENCE: I have a mask, too.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.070
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
All right, yeah.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.140
AUDIENCE: So I want to
ask you, so do you still

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.080
follow "Roadies."

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.907
And if so, what are
your opinions about it?

00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:03.490
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
No, I don't follow

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.580
that reality show anymore.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.770
In fact, during my time,
"Roadies" was very different.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.850
It was just a
journey from point A

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.476
to point B. And
used to have tasks.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:13.475
There was no bitchiness.

00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:16.100
There was no gossip.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.420
There was no backbiting.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.010
It was slightly different.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.843
That's why the [INAUDIBLE]
also [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.712 --> 00:11:25.170
Like "Roadies 2" was, I think,
the most boring season ever.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.770
I think it became
interesting after that.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.000
And you'd be surprised,
during my season,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.020
there was one girl from National
Law School of Bangalore.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.270
Then there was another girl
who were the London School

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.610
of Economics from "Roadies."

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.750
So we were a bunch of nerds
and gave no content at all.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.440
I was also a nerd in college.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.010
So I think "Roadies" is becoming
interesting now, but I hardly

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.836
get time to follow.

00:11:47.836 --> 00:11:48.960
AUDIENCE: Right, right, OK.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.835
So you appreciate more
the task in "Roadies."

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.543
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Of course, of course.

00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:53.740
I think that's pure.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:04.450
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.725
AUDIENCE: I have to say, I
have lost track of my question

00:12:07.725 --> 00:12:08.890
for sure.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.160
I have to say.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.930
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: OK, so
what's your answer, then?

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.260
AUDIENCE: But still, I
can think of something.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.840
So when did you realize
to explore your acting

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.367
capabilities, like
singing and then acting?

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:25.700
So when did you actually
realize to go ahead for acting.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.990
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I
was in St. John's High

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.040
School in Chandigarh.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.610
And I was the co-curricula
captain of the school.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.760
I was interested in
music and theater.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.530
And my first musical was "Joseph
and His Amazing Technicolor

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.910
Dreamcoat," which is an
Andrew Lloyd Webber play.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.120
So I sang in that played
as well, performed

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.040
as one of the lead cast.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.890
And I started young, as I said.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.480
And I'm a very
self-conscious person.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.520
I'm quite shy.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.840
But my father used to
really push me to perform.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.977
AUDIENCE: I can feel that.

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:51.811
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] Her

00:12:51.811 --> 00:12:53.935
birthday party, we made
her dance with [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:55.850
because my father
used to force me.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.580
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] because
I am intrinsically a very shy

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.609
person.

00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:02.150
So I think, to come
out of the shell,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.525
my father really
helped me a lot.

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:06.430
I think your parents really
need to discover your talent

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.090
and hone in a certain way
that your intrinsic character

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.790
doesn't come in the way.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.660
So I guess that
shell was broken,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.380
and I became a natural
over the years.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.320
I don't try too hard.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.970
I just be who I am.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.390
I it's easier to be like that.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.450
If you're being
somebody else, then I

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.530
think you may not last forever.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.020
And if you take
your life as it is,

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.970
if you're simple as a person,
you have minimalistic needs

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.780
to fulfill your life, I think
it's easy to be like that.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.110
AUDIENCE: OK, can I tag
along one more question.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.400
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Yeah you
can, question number two.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.649
AUDIENCE: So what do you enjoy
doing more, singing or acting?

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:42.940
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I'm more
of an actor than a singer.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.076
I'm not a trained singer.

00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:45.660
I used to get classical
training as a kid,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.993
but never took it too seriously.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.781
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:51.030
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I was
always interested in acting.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.250
And I thought, I'll always
become an actor who sings,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.620
not a singer who acts.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.130
And I also think that singing
is more difficult than acting.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.713
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:13:57.713 --> 00:13:59.100
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: But singing.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.225
Music [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:14:02.061 --> 00:14:03.352
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:04.352
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Huh.

00:14:04.352 --> 00:14:11.490
Acting [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So
I think singing music is more

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.930
technical than acting.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.220
Acting is more subjective.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:21.170
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
Its as simple as that.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.110
AUDIENCE: I have to say, I loved
your pairing with Yami Gautam.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.420
And I'm really looking forward
to your acting with Parineeti.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.484
And I love your "Dum
Laga Ke Haisha" the most.

00:14:30.484 --> 00:14:31.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.770
Thank you so much.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.610
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Thank you so much.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.318
I think it's, again,
a personality trait.

00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.860
I am a very laid back person.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.640
I'm not hyper ambitious.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.710
I like living my life.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.999
I like discovering new
places, new people.

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.790
And apart from that,
it's always good to be

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.956
under-rated than over-rated.

00:14:46.956 --> 00:14:49.590
I think, at the end of the
day, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.265
It's OK.

00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:57.660
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
it makes no sense.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.820
So I think it's all right.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.922
But I think I
should do, ideally,

00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:02.005
at least two films a year.

00:15:02.005 --> 00:15:04.850
As of now, I'm doing just a
one film, just one film a year.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.450
So let's see.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.075
It also depends on
the scripts and also

00:15:07.075 --> 00:15:08.830
depends on the kind
of films that I get.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.990
So I am slightly
picky and choosy.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.970
I just follow my heart.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.640
I don't follow my mind most of
the time. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.190
I think I just do
what I want to do.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:20.884
That's it.

00:15:20.884 --> 00:15:23.050
AUDIENCE: I think your first
movie is "Vicky Donor."

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.550
So what was your first reaction
when you heard the story and--

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:31.000
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: I
think the first reaction

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.573
was, I know this, how to do it.

00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:37.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.500
Second reaction was
that-- there was

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.881
a task in "Roadies."
it was a sperm donation

00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:43.630
task in "Roadies."

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.440
Serious, true story.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.210
When I was 20 in Allahabad,
I donated sperms, for real.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.280
Out of five contestants,
three samples were selected.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.605
I was one of those.

00:15:53.605 --> 00:15:54.940
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.565
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
So technically, I'm

00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:57.300
a method actor.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:00.750
So I did not cringe at all
because I knew that this

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.130
was the need of the hour.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.020
And people are
going through that.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.150
And when I read the
script it was quite clean.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.217
There was nothing creepy
or cringy about it.

00:16:12.217 --> 00:16:14.550
And Shoojit Sircar was a
National Award-winning director

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.820
already.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.340
So I guess I trusted
the director.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.720
And the script was so good.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.390
And since I had done
that thing in the past,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.530
it was just karmic, I think.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.290
AUDIENCE: But the best part is,
you acted so well that I never

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.000
realized it's your first movie.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.583
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Thank you so much.

00:16:29.583 --> 00:16:32.230
I could sleepwalk the character
because I am from that milieu.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.775
I am from Delhi, Chandigarh.

00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:36.170
So the language was easy.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.350
The thing was also quite OK.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.843
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:41.610
AUDIENCE: So are we going
to your "Vicky Donor"

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.580
type of movies more
in some time future,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.820
like that's one of the
best movies I've ever seen.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.159
Like [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:53.450
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: First of
all, nice testicle-- sorry

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.517
spectacles.

00:16:54.517 --> 00:17:00.879
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:01.420
I don't know.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.930
I think, if the sequel
in the making, definitely

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.970
I'll go for it.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.460
But otherwise, I
think it's always

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.810
good to go for quirky subjects
which are slightly edgy.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.260
And I'm sure the audiences
are prepared for it.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.430
And we live in a
day and age when

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.260
people are experimenting a lot.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.094
Either there's a
superstar, or super script.

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:20.801
Till the time I don't
become a superstar,

00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:21.859
I'll go the super script.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:22.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ayushmann.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.339
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
Hi, how are you.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.047
AUDIENCE: So, for
stuff like [INAUDIBLE],

00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:26.980
for the last movie, like
"Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.940
you were awesome in that movie.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.390
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: Thank you.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.320
AUDIENCE: So my question is that
you played a character of '90s

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.310
in that movie.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.539
And you've grown up by
listening some of Kumar Sanu.

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:37.080
So how was your experience like
performing a dance of a Kumar

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.457
Sanu sung song?

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.040
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I love Kumar Sanu.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, same.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.860
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.520
I just feel I should dance.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.990
We are '90s kids
and nostalgia holds

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.340
a lot of value in my life.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.750
We live in the past.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.820
We think about those--
I think every song,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.700
you have a memory attached
to it, to every song.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.380
And I think it was quite an
eager subject, "Dum Laga Ke

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.617
Haisha," fat wife, this husband,
intelligent, illiterate.

00:18:08.617 --> 00:18:10.950
So I think there's a clash
of personalities in the film.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.310
Both want [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.320
And when I read the
script for the first time,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.070
and I was blown away.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.270
And I guess it worked.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.330
I'm glad it worked.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.580
It was not a big budget film,
just like "Vicky Donor,"

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.770
and did pretty well.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.412
So you I hope I continue to
make such choices in life.

00:18:25.412 --> 00:18:26.620
AUDIENCE: So I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.960
I'm from Delhi.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.530
So I just want to ask
you, being an outsider,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.030
how difficult was it for you
to make a mark in the Bollywood

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.000
industry in the beginning?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.666
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I think the industry

00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:37.550
has become more open now.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.315
It has become more
accepting now.

00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:40.190
I'm not the only one.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.530
There are other actors
also, like [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.710
who are not from the
industry and doing well.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.680
And I'm glad I'm
born in this era.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.710
I read this book
called "Outliers."

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.700
It says that, if
you're fortunate,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.790
you have to choose
the right era.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.740
And if I was an aspiring
actor in the early 2000s,

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.710
or '90s, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.650
I'm glad I became
an actor in 2012.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.550
It was the correct era.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.764
And it just worked.

00:19:05.764 --> 00:19:07.930
And I think this is the
time when, every year, there

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.220
will be debutantes making
their way from television,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.800
other mediums, modeling,
or maybe, people

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.229
who are from outside
the industry.

00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:17.520
So I think it's a great time--
not just for the actors,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.250
also for the directors,
scriptwriters, producers.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.790
There are new
producers coming up.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.835
So I think it's an open world
now, in Bollywood especially.

00:19:23.835 --> 00:19:25.650
It was infested with
nepotism earlier.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.190
But now it's become more open.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.160
AUDIENCE: Just
one more question,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.284
which one is your favorite?

00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:31.512
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
or "Vicky Donor."

00:19:31.512 --> 00:19:33.220
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
I think "Vicky Donor"

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.450
made me a household name.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.616
The character had
a lot of spunk.

00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:39.690
"Dum Laga Ke Haisha"
was despicable

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.910
in the first half the,
character of Prem,

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.611
and became positive
in the second half.

00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:45.777
But I think I've worked
really hard for "Dum Laga Ke

00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:48.960
Haisha," because the language
was not naturally coming out

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.810
for me.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.630
I'm a Punjabi.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.667
"Vicky Donor" was
just a sleepwalk.

00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:54.334
"Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"
I really worked

00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:55.750
on the language,
the body language

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.800
because Prem is not me.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.650
I was playing somebody
else in the film.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.750
AUDIENCE: Ayushmann, your latest
movie, "Meri Pyaari Bindu"--

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.458
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.820
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.779
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:17.070
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.390
AYUSHMANN KHURRANA: This film
is about a Bengali writer who is

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.050
in love with his
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.320
So it's about that.
