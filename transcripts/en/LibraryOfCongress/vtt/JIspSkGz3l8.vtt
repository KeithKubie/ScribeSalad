00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:39.450
[ Music ]

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.460
&gt;&gt; Eilber: I'm Janet Eilber
and I'm the artistic director

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.130
of the Martha Graham Dance Company.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.130
And, it's an important anniversary

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.970
because the company has hit
its 90th anniversary season.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.720
We've been curating the
Graham legacy and a big part

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.420
of that curation has been the
commissioning of new work.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.370
The classics bring a certain
context to the new work

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.000
and the new work brings fresh
eyes to the Graham classics.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.370
There's a real conversation
going on.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.650
&gt;&gt; Lidberg: My name is Pontus.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.150 position:56%
I'm a choreographer and a filmmaker.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.650
I'm creating a new piece for
the Martha Graham Dance Company

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.230
&gt;&gt; Eilber: Martha Graham was part
of a movement in all the art forms

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.000
to sort of find our
country's own voice.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.300
She took America's frontierism

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.140
and created a new forceful
style of dance.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
It was so influential that
around the world today directors

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.130
and choreographers-even

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.080
if they don't know it-have
built upon techniques

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.380
that Martha Graham pioneered.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lidberg: I can't even say all the
influence Martha Graham's had on me,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.170
because it's probably
more than I can name.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.360
But, for example, the first
contemporary dance schooling I had

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.660
was Graham technique.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.480
&gt;&gt; Eilber: Her movement is very
percussive, geometric-based

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.910 position:56%
on her famous contraction and
release, which comes from the center

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.740
of the body, from the torso.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.060
She was also interested
in sculpting the space.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.380
This was part of her revolution to
not just dance on an empty stage,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.320
in particular with her
work with Isamu Noguchi.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.410
The Noguchi sets-of course-would
create pathways for Martha;

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.350
would create different
levels she could use.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.440
The emotional message of her
work was not only in the movement

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.140
of the dancers, but in the
overall look of the stage.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.700
The relationship with the Library
of Congress began when once

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.110
of the first men in Martha's
company wrote to the Library

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.040
and got them interested in
commissioning new works with some

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.030
of the top composers of the day.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.590
Aaron Copland, Hindemith, ChÃ¡vez,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.960
Milhaud- a remarkable
series of commissions.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.250
And, for our 90th anniversary
season the Library has proposed

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.310
that we choose a choreographer
who will then choose some

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.720
of the music of Irving Fine.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.540
Irving Fine was a contemporary
of Aaron Copland.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.560 position:56%
In fact, he was at the premiere of
"Appalachian Spring" at the Library.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.460
So, Pontus Lidberg
agreed to this challenge,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.570
to take music from the
mid-twentieth century

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.040
and make a twenty-first
century piece.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:41.360
&gt;&gt; Lidberg: I was asked to
create a new dance to the music

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.230
of Irving Fine and I'm using the
"Notturno" for strings and harp.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.810
To work with a mid-century
artist like Irving Fine,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.110
I thought it was important

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.160
to also put a contemporary
comment into the creation.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.830
So, I chose the "Notturno" and
expanded it by reordering the music

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.010
into a cyclical structure
rather than a linear one.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.070
You can always put in a comment.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.410
You can always be in
relation to the music rather

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.100
than being literal about it.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.090
And that's what I'm trying to do.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.790
&gt;&gt; Eilber: Sometimes
I will give an impetus

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.340
and then I will see
what the dancers do

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.140
with that impetus and
start guiding them.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.990
And it's more fun for me,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.670
because that way their
personality is really part

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.970
of the creative process.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.790
And the Graham dancers are...I
mean virtuous in what they do.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.420
These dancers are not afraid
to express with their faces

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.080
and their bodies-they go for it.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.660
It gives me a lot to work with.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.170
My understanding of Irving Fine is
he is someone who made a synthesis

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.470
of various ideas throughout
his career.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.180
He was very much interested

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.020
in neoclassicism, but
also serial music.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.490
He scored different modalities.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.530
So, in a way you could say the
Graham Company [and Library

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.170
of Congress] commissioning
me to create something

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.410 position:56%
to his music is also a synthesis of
different ideas and different times.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.730
&gt;&gt; Lidberg: The Library of
Congress has a long history

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.410
of commissioning dance and music,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.750
and they have a long
history with Martha Graham.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.420
So, I feel very honored to
be part of this tradition.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.850
&gt;&gt; Eilber: It's just a wonderful
bridge to the commissions

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.520
of the past to one that's
today in the 21st century.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.920
We're going to premiere
Pontus' work of course

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.220
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.360
And then it will be a part of our
New York season on April 18th,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.890
which is the date 90 years ago

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.020
when Martha Graham had her
first concert in New York City.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.510
It's the Martha Graham Dance
Company's actual 90th birthday.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:30.080
[ Music ]

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.910
&gt;&gt; Announcer: This has
been a presentation

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.950
of the Library of Congress.
