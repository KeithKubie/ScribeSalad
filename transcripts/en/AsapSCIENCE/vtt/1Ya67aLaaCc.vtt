00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.050
Sexual tastes of vary from person to
person.  But with the current pornography

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.790
epidemic as some call it.  One has to
wonder how exactly this may effect our

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.250
desires and perception of sexuality.
Moreover, how does it affect our sex

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.999
lives.

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.230
Pornography constitutes about twenty
five percent of all search engine

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.359
requests, and is the fourth most common
reason people give for going on the

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.189
internet.  And well may seem to simply
facilitate an instinctual sexual

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.489
response linked to millions of years of
evolution.  The truth is pornography has

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.329
dynamically changed over time ultimately
molding our tastes and desires.  The not so

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.300
shocking truth is that pornography has
profound consequences for the brain and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.160
acts in many ways like a drug.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.880
With prolonged exposure your tolerance is
increased and many often find themselves

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.740
addicted.  Though it is not a physical substance,
it leads to the same general loss of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.110
control, the compulsiveness to seek out
the activity despite negative

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.180
consequences

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.670
and withdrawl when it goes away.  Much like
that of gambling or running for example.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.059
The issue is that continued exposure can
cause long-term or even lifelong neuro-plastic

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.960
change in the brain. Dopamine is
released as a reward whenever we

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.690
accomplish something whether it be
eating to sustain life or sexual

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.790
activity to produce future life.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.119
And this dopamine consolidates neural
connections in order to drive us to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.770
perform the same activity in the future.
In other words, it alters and forms the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.070
brain cells to motivate certain actions.
It rewires your brain.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.380
The national institutes of health
measure drug addictiveness by testing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.360
rats.  The rat is trained to press a button
in order to get a drug, and the harder it

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.119
works indicates how addictive the
substance is.  It turns out that the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.200
more addictive a drug is the more to
dopamine we see released.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.650
And while there is unfortunately no rat porn
that we can give to them, we do know that

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.020
dopamine is also released during sexual
excitement which pornography plays right

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.820
into.  The more time you spend doing it,
the more dopamine gets released which

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.890
reinforces the behavior and makes you
not only desire it in the future but

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.100
require it.  And as you begin to imagine
these images away from the computer or

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.440
while having sex, they become reinforced.
Furthermore each orgasm releases even

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.740
more dopamine which consolidates the
connections made during the session.  It's

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.090
a feedback loop that becomes harder to
escape and just like a drug your

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.580
tolerance for visual stimulation has now
compounded, making it more difficult to be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
turned on by reality.  Pornography
addiction can often lead to finding your

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.330
mate less attractive, the good news is
it doesn't have to be permanent.  Usually

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.250
when people understand the mechanism and
realize it's affecting their

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.299
relationships, they can stop.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.249
The brain is often described as a use
it or lose it system because the neural

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.169
connections you stimulate grow
stronger and desire to be activated while

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.270
the ones you ignore become weakened.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.400
Much like your muscles which if sitting
still all day itch for activity but

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.280
after prolonged non-use they become
complacent.  Luckily, because of this "use it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.550
or lose it" brain, the same neuro-plastic
system that proliferate these habits can

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.139
also be used to acquire healthier ones.
