00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.278
- [Voiceover] A cable
company with a reputation

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:05.388
for poor customer service
is losing subscribers

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.668
at a rate of approximately 3% per year.

00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:10.654
The company had two million subscribers

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:12.871
at the start of 2014.

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.578
Assume that the company
continues to lose subscribers

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.888
at the same rate, and that
there are no new subscribers.

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:21.489
It's truly a bad situation for them.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.697
Which of the following functions, S,

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:26.266
models the number of
subscribers, in millions,

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:30.029
remaining t years after the start of 2014?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.982
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:33.513
So S of zero.

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:35.858
When t equals zero, this is zero years

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:37.797
after the start of 2014.

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:39.213
So this would be the number of subscribers

00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:42.882
they had at the start of
2014, which is two million.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.292
So S of zero is going to be two.

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:47.336
Remember, S is in terms of millions.

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.778
They tells us that, so S of zero is two.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.107
What is S of one going to be?

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.732
When t equals one?

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:55.555
Well, one year has gone by,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.132
so they're going to lose
3% of their subscribers,

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:02.032
and losing 3% is the same
thing as retaining 97%.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:05.940
So it's going to be two times 0.97.

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:10.443
Now what happens at t
equals two after two years?

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:12.145
Well, they started with two million.

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:15.963
In one year, they were
able to only retain 97%.

00:01:15.963 --> 00:01:17.426
And then another year goes by.

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.338
They're only going to retain 97%

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.438
of what they had the year before.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:27.080
So another 97%.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.409
I think you see the trend.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.064
You're going to multiply by 97%

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:36.707
as t times, I guess is
another way to think about it.

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:39.310
If you say S of three,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.423
you started with two million subscribers.

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:45.534
After one year, you retain 97% of them.

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:48.551
After another year, you're
gonna retain 97% of this,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.690
and after another year, at t equals three,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.260
you're gonna retain 97% of that.

00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:58.159
97% of that.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.179
So in general, S of t is going
to be what you started with

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.635
times 0.97

00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.507
to the t power.

00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:09.644
However many years have gone by,

00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:12.964
you take your, I should say
retention rate to that power,

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:14.938
and of course, you then multiply that

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:17.260
times your initial starting subscribers,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.979
and that's how much you're
going to be left with.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.454
And let's see, which of
these choices have that?

00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:24.807
That is this choice right over here.

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:26.827
Now another way you could have done it

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:29.481
is you could have tried to
rule out some choices here.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.426
This one actually has
the subscribers growing.

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:35.713
If you multiply by 1.03 to the t,

00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:38.557
1.03 times 1.03 times 1.03,

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.195
it's going to get larger than one.

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:42.489
You're gonna have more than
two million subscribers.

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.800
So as t increases, so you
can rule that one out.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.735
In this one, every year
you're only retaining

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.675
70% of your subscribers.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.300
You're losing 30%, not 3%.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.074
So that one's even worse than
this already bad situation.

00:02:57.074 --> 00:03:00.639
And then this one, this is a linear,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.329
this is kind of a...

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:07.134
They're saying you're multiplying by t.

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:08.963
One way to realize

00:03:08.963 --> 00:03:10.686
that this is gonna to break down very fast

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:12.095
is t equals zero.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:13.720
This is gonna give us zero.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.555
But if t equals zero, you
don't have zero subscribers.

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:19.758
At t equals zero, you have
two million subscribers.

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:20.635
The other way to think about it

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.880
is this was gonna increase as t increases,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.400
while we didn't have a
decreasing number of subscribers.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.666
So you could rule that one out as well.
