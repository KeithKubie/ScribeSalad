think this expressive individualism has
been combined with the sort of the

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539
been combined with the sort of the
 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.779
been combined with the sort of the
benefits of being in an oppressed group

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789

you know the moral high-ground that
comes with that and the and the strong

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649
comes with that and the and the strong
 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.880
comes with that and the and the strong
identification that comes with being

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
identification that comes with being
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.469
identification that comes with being
