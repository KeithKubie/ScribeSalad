she said they've gone to every
restaurant in the near vicinity multiple

restaurant in the near vicinity multiple
times they know the menu by heart they

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
times they know the menu by heart they
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910
times they know the menu by heart they
can't find anything exciting to do that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
can't find anything exciting to do that
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519
can't find anything exciting to do that
they agree on and because of that they

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
they agree on and because of that they
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530
they agree on and because of that they
either end up watching TV which they

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
either end up watching TV which they
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720
either end up watching TV which they
both don't like or they go to one of the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
both don't like or they go to one of the
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.069
both don't like or they go to one of the
restaurants that they've been to too

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
restaurants that they've been to too
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.650
restaurants that they've been to too
many times so think about this question

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
many times so think about this question
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319
many times so think about this question
and say okay it's not just about husband

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
and say okay it's not just about husband
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030
and say okay it's not just about husband
and wife I said look if we take a step

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
and wife I said look if we take a step
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.410
and wife I said look if we take a step
back and we think about what this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
back and we think about what this
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569
back and we think about what this
question is all about it's a question

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
question is all about it's a question
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970
question is all about it's a question
about finding a mutual solutions a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
about finding a mutual solutions a
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.580
about finding a mutual solutions a
mutual solution you have two parties and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
mutual solution you have two parties and
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.529
mutual solution you have two parties and
the two parties are trying to find

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
the two parties are trying to find
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.549
the two parties are trying to find
something now that would be better than

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559
something now that would be better than
 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.000
something now that would be better than
every restaurant or TV but you don't

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
every restaurant or TV but you don't
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709
every restaurant or TV but you don't
seem to find that you don't have

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
seem to find that you don't have
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320
seem to find that you don't have
something that you both enjoy more than

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
something that you both enjoy more than
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030
something that you both enjoy more than
something else that come easily to mind

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
something else that come easily to mind
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280
something else that come easily to mind
so what happened is you do nothing

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
so what happened is you do nothing
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500
so what happened is you do nothing
interesting right so I said what if we

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
interesting right so I said what if we
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.469
interesting right so I said what if we
change this a problem from a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
change this a problem from a
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109
change this a problem from a
simultaneous solution to a sequential

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
simultaneous solution to a sequential
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.410
simultaneous solution to a sequential
solution what if instead of looking

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420
solution what if instead of looking
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.609
solution what if instead of looking
every day for something that you both

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
every day for something that you both
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.740
every day for something that you both
enjoy why don't you look for something

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
enjoy why don't you look for something
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630
enjoy why don't you look for something
that at least one of you really love

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
that at least one of you really love
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.390
that at least one of you really love
maybe it would not maximize your mutual

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
maybe it would not maximize your mutual
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.999
maybe it would not maximize your mutual
happiness every day but every other day

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
happiness every day but every other day
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.380
happiness every day but every other day
one of you would get to do something

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
one of you would get to do something
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.469
one of you would get to do something
that you really enjoy so imagine for

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
that you really enjoy so imagine for
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690
that you really enjoy so imagine for
example that I have one set of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
example that I have one set of
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.770
example that I have one set of
preferences and you have a different

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
preferences and you have a different
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899
preferences and you have a different
preferences in the simultaneous solution

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
preferences in the simultaneous solution
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.550
preferences in the simultaneous solution
we're looking for something that we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
we're looking for something that we
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370
we're looking for something that we
would both like more than TV but if that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
would both like more than TV but if that
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190
would both like more than TV but if that
thing doesn't exist is TV always the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
thing doesn't exist is TV always the
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.679
thing doesn't exist is TV always the
right thing to do or should we one time

you really love and sometimes go to a
book club which is something I really

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
book club which is something I really
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999
book club which is something I really
love and each of us would not be as

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
love and each of us would not be as
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.880
love and each of us would not be as
happy on that particular days when the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
happy on that particular days when the
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.889
happy on that particular days when the
other person preferences coming about

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
other person preferences coming about
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.830
other person preferences coming about
but together we will do more things and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
but together we will do more things and
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240
but together we will do more things and
more fun things and then on top of that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
more fun things and then on top of that
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.250
more fun things and then on top of that
I said add some random experiences into

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
I said add some random experiences into
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.130

of new things because of loss aversion

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
of new things because of loss aversion
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.700
of new things because of loss aversion
because if the idea that if something is
