00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.490
Let's go over that example, that
I gave in the last video,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.170
where I'm in this village and
I start a bank to match up

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.700
savers with investment
opportunities.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.130
And I actually want to do it,
one, to hit the point home a

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.360
little bit more about how
a bank makes money.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.860
And I actually think this
example is a very good

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.040
instrument to teach you about a
new financial statement that

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.480
I don't think I've covered
at all much.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.890
And that's the income
statement.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.490
So far, you're familiar with the
balance sheets, hopefully.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.410
And now, we'll learn what
an income statement is.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.680
So let's say that this is my
balance sheet at the beginning

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.640
of my first year of operation,
the beginning of year one.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280
And let me see if I
can recreate it.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.930
I think I had said that I had
originally capitalized this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.520
company with $1 million.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.180
That was coming from
my savings.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.520
Or maybe I went to 10 of my
friends and they gave me

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.300
$100,000 each.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.480
But we don't care about how
that equity was raised.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.230
All we know is that
we had $1 million.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
And then, I had bought a
building that I could put

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.510
money in, that looks
really safe.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.830
And people would feel secure
giving that money, putting

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.200
that money into that building.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.330
So let's say I had $1 million
of real estate.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.610
And then, the rest of the
village saw this nice big

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
fortress I had constructed.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.790
And so they gave me
at least part of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700
their savings as deposits.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.320
Saying that, wow, that's a safer
place to put my money

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.270
than in my mattress or buried
in my backyard.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.110
And, this bank of Sal says that
he's going to give me

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.480
some interest. And he seems to
be a fairly reputable fellow

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.020
in our village.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
So let's deposit some of
our savings with him.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.715
So I get $10 million
of deposits.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.530
And, of course, I told them,
look, this isn't a loan.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.810
Although, it kind of is.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.470
I'm not borrowing this
money from you.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.960
You guys can use this money
whenever you need it.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.650
And because of that, I need to
set some of these deposits

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.100
aside, in case someone comes the
next day and says, I gave

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.855
you that dollar yesterday.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:59.840
I actually need that dollar
now to pay for my teeth

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.060
cleaning or something.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.360
So I need to set aside
some of it.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.010
And I figure, well, if I set
aside 10% of it, that's the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.970
most that anyone would ever
come in one day, unless

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.070
there's some type of strange
run on the bank.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.790
So I'm going to set aside
10% of it as reserves.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.030
So it's cash reserves.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.025
So let's say, $1 million
of cash.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.850
If I thought, for some reason,
that there's a higher

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.360
likelihood of everyone coming at
once for their money, or a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.760
large percentage of the people
coming at once, I'd want

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.660
larger reserves.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.810
And then, finally, I'm
left with $9 million.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.310
They gave me 10, I had
to put one aside.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.490
I'm left with $9 million
to loan out.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.520
This is productive capital.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.580
And when I say, capital,
that's just a claim on

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.810
someone's goods and services
that can be used to construct

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.950
or perform something that adds
value, that creates more value

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.290
than was used.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.130
So that's $9 million of loans.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.700
And I know I always keep talking
in those terms. And I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.270
do that because I think, in our
society today, we get so

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.210
fixated with the points, and
that's money, or the dollar

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.570
bills, that we often forget
what the points represent.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.350
The points, or the money,
represents claims

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.410
on goods and services.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.670
I've actually met people who
become obsessed with-- Well

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.900
actually, like on
[? Connicet, ?]

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.310
I get emails from people who
want to get extra points on

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.710
their account.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.510
And they're obsessed with it.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.730
And it's just a number.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.820
But what's important is, what
does a point system

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.890
really do for you?

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.840
And in money, those points
represent future claims on

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.840
goods and services.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.990
So this is how my balance sheet
looked at the beginning

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.390
of year one.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.980
And I said, well, I'm going
to be getting in

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.230
10% on these loans.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.320
And let's say that I'm very good
and none of them default.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.870
And I really do get my 10%.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.140
And I said that I'm going to
pay these people out 5%.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.230
So what happens over the
course of that year?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.486
So how much interest income
am I going to get?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.090
I'll call that interest, Int
Inc. So 9 million times 10%.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.399
I'm going to get $900,000.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.360
And then, what's my
interest expense?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.640
I probably should have
done this in green.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.950
Well, I have to pay out
5% on the $10 million.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.690
So it's $500,000.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240
I'll put it as a negative
number, just so you know it's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.300
an expense.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.048
Although, since I said it's an
expense, you might want to put

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:43.620
it as a positive number.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.900
But that's just an accounting
convention.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.540
But I think you get the idea.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.770
Let me put it as
minus $500,000.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.190
And then to operate this bank--
I had this building. it

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.610
had to be cleaned.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.990
It has to be maintained.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.720
I had to hire bank tellers
and security guards.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.140
And I had to buy my security
guards machine guns.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.890
I have expenses, above and
beyond just this little

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.100
interest transaction
that's going on.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.590
So let's say that
I have salaries.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.840
So I have some other expenses.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.950
Let's say it's minus 50K
a year in salaries

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.100
that I have to pay.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.750
And let's say, upkeep of the
building-- you have to paint

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.000
it every now and then.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.280
Have to install new marble
tiles every now and then.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.470
Because I have to project this
impression of the shining,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.885
impenetrable fortress.

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.090
So upkeep is actually a
big expense for me.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.350
So I spend 50K on upkeep.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.540
And so, what am I left with?

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.220
Let's see, 900 minus 500 is
400, minus another 100.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.760
So I'm left with 300,000.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.120
But even though this is a
primitive village that I live

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.220
in, it's not so primitive that
it does not have taxes.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.540
And so, this is my
pre-tax income.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.340
[PHONE RINGS]

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.636
My cellphone is ringing,
but I'll ignore it.

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:13.460
Actually, it's very
hard to ignore.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.460
But anyway, this is
my pre-tax income.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.720
But my local village government
says, well, you

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.800
have to pay for the army and all
of the other services that

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.850
we provide.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.100
So they take 30%.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.350
So income taxes.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.585
Let's say they take one third.

00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:37.530
So they take 100K.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.480
And so, what am I going
to be left with?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.670
What is my net income?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.910
300 minus 100, I'm
left with 200K.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.190
Fair enough.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.720
And, just so you know, this
is the income statement.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.450
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about how all

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.380
of these match up.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.940
So let me let me draw big,
nice box around it.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.920
So it looks like a proper
statement of something.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.620
So what is my balance sheet
going to look like at the end

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.720
of the year, given that this
is how much money I made?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.040
Well, let's say those loans
haven't been paid off, just

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.760
people paid the 10%
interest on them.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.230
So I still have those loans
on my balance sheet.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.210
Let me draw the loans.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.830
So I still have $9 million of
assets, which are those loans.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.180
They haven't paid them off.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.280
I still have the building.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.220
And actually since I spent
50,000 on upkeep, all of the

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.450
wear and tear was made up
for, with my upkeep.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.600
So it's still worth
a million dollars.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.650
So I still have a million dollar
building, 9 million of

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.980
loans outstanding.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.980
I had a million dollars
of cash.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.410
And now, how much
cash do I have?

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.440
Well, I had that million
dollars before.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.610
And I'm assuming that my overall
level of deposits do

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.870
not change over the course
of the year.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.240
So I had a million dollars of
cash, and nothing dramatic

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.590
happens with the deposits.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.180
Over the course of the
year, I show right

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.600
here, I made $200,000.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.930
And this 200,000 is,
essentially,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.340
going to be cash now.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.495
So now, I have 1.2
million of cash.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.860
My deposits haven't changed.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.375
I still have 10 million
of deposits.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.140
Those are liabilities, because
I owe them to the people

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.830
who've deposited their
money with me.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.810
I owe them money.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.890
And so what am I left with?

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.800
What is my equity?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.030
My equity was 1 million.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.549
What is my equity now?

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.870
Well, equity is just total
assets minus total liability.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.200
So what are my total
assets now?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.669
9 plus 1 is 10, plus 1.2.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.830
I have 11.2 million
of total assets.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.370
Minus my total liabilities,
minus 10.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.880
So I have 1.2 million,
now, of equity.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.220
Now, something interesting
has happened.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.000
What has been my change
in equity?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.900
I had $1 million of equity.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.640
Now I have $1.2 million
of equity.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.370
So my change in equity-- so $1
million to $1.2 million.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.400
So we could call it, if you're
used to the math notation, you

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.820
could use that delta notation.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.520
Triangle just means change.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:29.390
My change in equity is
equal to $200,000.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.630
And that is the same thing
as your net income.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.610
So what is an income
statement?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.510
Well, first of all, this
is an income statement.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.740
But how does it connect with
the balance sheet?

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.940
And later, we'll talk about
the cash flow statement.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.910
Well, a balance sheet is just
a snapshot of what you have

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.180
and what you owe at any
given point in time.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.430
This is the balance sheet at
the beginning of the year.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.870
This is the balance sheet
at the end of the year.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.970
This is a snapshot of what
you have and what

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.250
you owe at the beginning.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.470
This is a snapshot of what you
have and what you owe at the

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.470
end of the year.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.560
The income statement tells you
what happened over the course

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.520
of this year.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.590
So it essentially tells you
how did you get from this

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.970
balance sheet to this
balance sheet.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.932
Another way to think about it,
the income statement, at the

00:10:11.932 --> 00:10:14.160
end, it'll tell you all
of your inputs.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.350
What money came in.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.710
What money came out in
the form of expenses

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.040
and taxes, et cetera.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.020
And then, you get a
net income number.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.680
And that net income number is
actually the change in equity.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.040
So if you have a positive net
income in a year, the balance

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.430
sheet's equity will increase
by that amount in a year.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.850
And if you have a negative net
income, your balance sheet's

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.560
equity will decrease
in a year.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.480
So you could actually call your
net income is the same

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.530
thing as your change
in equity.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.410
And, another thing you want
to talk about, what's

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.260
your return on equity?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.590
Well, your initial equity
was $1 million.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.390
How much money did we make?

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.110
Well, it grew by $200,000.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.500
So 200,000 over 1 million.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.140
Well, we could call that
1,000 thousands.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.950
That equals a 20%.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.520
That was our return on equity.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.310
We put in a million, and we
got 20% more than that.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.420
That was our return on equity.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.830
Equals ROE.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.240
And notice, the return on equity
is really-- that's the

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.280
same thing.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.620
That's change of equity divided
by starting equity,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.945
which is the same thing as
net income in the period.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.470
Well, I'm defining it
as starting equity.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.510
Sometimes people talk
about it as average

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.360
equity, and all of that.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.230
Anyway, I thought that this was
a good tool to at least

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.380
introduce you to the notion of
an income statement, and show

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.240
you how to all connects.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.590
Because that's the beauty
of accounting.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.280
It's that you have these
different financial statements

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.500
that are very intertwined
with each other.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.880
You give me two balance
sheets.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.150
And then, I can actually
construct the income statement

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.160
that must have happened
in between them.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.480
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
