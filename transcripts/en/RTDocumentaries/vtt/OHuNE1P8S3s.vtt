00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.400
The British discovered this region's treasure after

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.160
making India one of it's colonies

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.800
And building a road from Calcutta to Dheli

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.720
It provides hundreds of thousands of people

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.740
with their source of income

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.640
It can be applied to sensitive skin

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.200
doesn't clog the pores and is entirely natural

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.180
Without it the locals would starve to death

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.080
60% of the world's Mica deposits lie on

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.060
either side of this road

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.000
Under local law

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.040
digging for the mineral is forbidden

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.280
India's state of Jharkhand is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.640
the riches of nature reserves

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.380
But everyone who lives here

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.100
knows that people still extract Mica anyways

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.340
Illegally

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.900
The process is based on slave labor

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.680
often involving child exploitation

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.660
Is anybody here?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.820
Come here please

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.980
Hello

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.560
Suddenly two people appear

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.100
at this makeshift mine

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680
The boy's father and their neighbor

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.800
from the village

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.780
The boy's called Vishal

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.300
and according to his father

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.000
he's 18

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
although he looks no more than

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.060
14 or 15

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320
The adults seem to be scared that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.260
the boy might let something slip

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.780
that should remain unsaid

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.860
Are you afraid of going down?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.780
No Why?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.160
At least one or two fatal

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.840
accidents are recorded in the Jharkhand Mica mines every month

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.640
It's not only adults who die

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.800
but children too

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.920
His body is covered in scars from contact with Mica

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.420
it's razor sharp

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.340
and working in a mine

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.560
the dust rises in thick cloud like

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.440
blooms

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.740
There's no time to talk

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.420
Vishal goes back down into the mine again

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.180
The mineral is extracted using the most dangerous method

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.780
It's scraped off the ceiling

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.900
where the rock looks as if it might collapse

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.940
at any moment

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.360
There's another fatal danger here

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.360
inhailing Mica dust often

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.640
causes lung cancer

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.420
The number of oncology  cases in Jharkhand is growing

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.080
at the alarming rate of 10%

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.920
every year

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.500
This is where people work

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.500
rest and hide from the heat

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.100
Average earnings for workign here

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.460
amount to no more than $3 a day

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.760
and all for extracting Mica

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.380
the material that is commonly used in

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.680
manufactured cosmetics

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.960
In 2014 the world's largest cosmetic

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.660
companies announced that they had stopped

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.640
buying Mica that had been extracted

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.300
illegally or by using child labor

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.300
They promised to bring in strict controls

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.860
over their supply chains

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.780
saying their Mica production

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.160
should never involve child labor

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.860
We're going to visit one of the biggest open mines in Jharkhand

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.720
It was once developed by a state company

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.960
but was abandoned when Mica production was prohibited
