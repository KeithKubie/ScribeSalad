00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, so now that you've seen an example, let's do a quiz makes things a bit more general.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For this quiz we have two sets--A and B.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A is represented by the blue circle, B by the red.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I want you to match the set operation, and these are the four set operations.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to the appropriate Venn diagram.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've shaded in in each of these diagrams a section,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that section corresponds to one of these operations.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I want you to enter the appropriate number into the appropriate box.
