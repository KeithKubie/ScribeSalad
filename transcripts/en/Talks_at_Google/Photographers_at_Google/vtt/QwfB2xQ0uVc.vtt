00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome to another

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.190
outstanding Photography at Google talk. It's
our deep

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.800
honor today to host Moose Peterson. He's a
nighttime

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.380
legend to host behind the lens. And he's our
elite

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.680
photographer. But he's mostly known and remembered
for

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.650
his iconic images. He was one of the first
wildlife photographers

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.570
to use the digital medium. And his pictures
are some of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.390
the most celebrated wildlife shots to this
day. And so,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.310
he'll be speaking to us about his new book,
Captured, and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.859
just in general observations from his life
as a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.010
photographer and an equipment designer and
just adventurer

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.560
around the world. And so, you can also follow
Moose on

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.770
Google plus, where all cool photographers
are. And

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.121
without further ado, please join me in welcoming
Moose to

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.121
Google. Thanks.
[Moose chuckles]

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:45.121
[Applause]

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:51.580
&gt;&gt; Moose: Thank you sir. Google plus where
all the cool

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.070
photographers are. [laughter] Wow. Hi. I'm
Moose. Thanks for

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.890
having me here. It's a pleasure to be here
again. I

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.670
love coming to the land of innovation. It's
a good place

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.460
to -- if you're a photographer -- to go and
try to push

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.570
beyond the norm. Now, I'm not really going
to talk about

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.640
my book, Captured, because to be honest, if
you don't know

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.119
about the book, Captured, at this point or
the 400 page paper weight that I

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.229
created, my hour talk isn't going to get you
there. In

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.590
fact, more importantly what I want to do today
is get

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450
you involved in not just photography, but
sharing those images.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.299
That's the bottom line. Not putting them on
some cloud or

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719
some hard drive. Bet getting them in front
of people to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.609
do what? Change our world. Now, before I get
going, I

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.039
just want to make sure you understand,I really
don't take

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.469
myself that seriously, okay? It's important
that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.789
photographers don't lose perspective on the
fact that,

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.389
you know, if we don't make the picture today?
Guess

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.780
what? The sun will still shine tomorrow. It's
amazing,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.900
you screw up today and you can still screw
up tomorrow.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
[laughter]
[techno music begins]

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.900
&gt;&gt;Moose: Alright, beautiful, beautiful, okay?
Little closer, okay?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.209
That's it. Work a little bit to the side.
There we go. That's

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:05.700
it. Hold it. Time for a closeup. Brad, I need
a tuner up on 2. Can I get that hair

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.409
adjusted, please. All right. Hair's looking
good.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.360
Looking good. Work the hair. Work the hair.
Come on. That's it.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.470
Give it to me. Beautiful, beautiful. Work
the hair.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.840
Look at the eye. You have no idea how many
people ask us

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.720
how hard it was to get a bison into the studio.
And I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.340
said I work for the guys at photoshop world,
okay?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.330
Figure it out. It's not a real bison in the
studio. But

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.310
that's the idea to take what you might think
is about

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.780
impossible. What might be totally outside
the realm and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.630
go after it. That's really what it's all about.
That's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.740
why photography should be, a constant push
of what you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.490
know technically. More importantly what you
feel

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.700
passionately and then put it out there for
people to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.671
enjoy what we're really very fortunate and
lucky to go

00:02:53.671 --> 00:03:04.170
out and see. Now, I do tend to push that technology
thing. I don't sit still very often. I’m

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.681
always looking
for ideas. I'm always looking for, well, what

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:10.400
can I do.
How can I take people into the next realm

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.540
and make them look and
see things. Here's an example. I've gone into

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.710
aviation
photography for the last few years for a number

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.590
of
reasons. The main one was, the incredible

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.540
generation of people who flew
these planes and fought the wars that give

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.880
us the
freedoms we have today. They're perishing

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.620
at 1200 a day right
now. A year ago it was 1500 vets were passing

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.150
away
a day. And with them was a lot of stories.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.990
And some
of them are really quite grim. Some of them

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.251
have just
hilarious. The biggest thing most of these

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:44.290
men we see
today who are 91, 93. They're 18, 19, 20,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.600
flying these hot
rods. So how does this generation understand

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.230
that?
That's one of the things I wanted to do. Cockpits

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.150
of
airplanes. Usually you know, this is a four

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.880
million
dollar Corsair aircraft. They just don't want

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.400
the public to walk
into the plane and play with the buttons and

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.610
dials. You
know once it's rocket launched. I'd love to

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.790
see what
that does. Be that's not possible. So how

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.240
does that
experience get in. Well, first of all, you

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.140
have basic
photography. You get the shot. You look at

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.830
it first of
all you notice in very bottom right corner,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.660
there's a
very hard shadow from the stick. If you're

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.660
a
photographer, you should look at that and

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.120
go okay, there's a hard shadow.
That means we've got a hard light source.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.480
How do the word
hard come about in photography first of all?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.020
You look at
that shadow line. See how it's a very hard,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.130
sharp line?
That's how the word hard light came. Because

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.841
if it's a soft light
source, that shadow is what? Very soft. There's

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.340
no hard
line on it. Okay, so if you see that there

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.590
in the
corner, then you look and you see underneath

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.900
the dash,
you can see the word VAT on those pedals way

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.250
back in the
shade you go, wait, if there's hard light,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.190
how can I see back in the shade? If you know
anything about light,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.370
it knows what? It can hold five stops with
a single

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.270
click. Obviously something's going on there.
In this

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.150
case, we've got some flash fill going on,
all right? But if

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.930
that's the case, then where is the flash?
There's the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.971
sun. There's the flash. There's no flash over
there. So

00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:14.180
my whole quest was to bring the cockpit experience
to

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.250
person who had never seen it before, okay?
Getting into

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.080
the fine detail of the shot or not into the
shot. So I'm

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.590
constantly pushing. What you see here is 150
images.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.450
It's HDR flash filled combined to create that
what we call

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.530
bubble. That full experience of that cockpit.
So I'm

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.760
constantly pushing photography. I'm never
settling. I'm

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.270
always going further and further beyond that.
Now,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.940
you're probably saying, "I came to hear about
wildlife

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.080
photography." People come to hear about wildlife
photography? It's the same as portrait photography

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.889
or still life photography or any other kind
of

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.180
photography, because you're dealing with one
very common

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.570
important element. That's light . Once you
understand

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.710
light, no matter what you put in front of
that lens, it's

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.330
the same. The only variable between that light
and that

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.310
subject is what? It's really you. That's what
most

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.680
photographers tend not to focus in on. It's
that it's you

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.760
that makes the big difference, not the technology,
not

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.080
the subject matter. It's what you you're bringing
to

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.050
that. Because as photographers, we are story
tellers.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.360
And that's the really cool thing about photography.
And

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.100
every time you go click, most photographers
don't

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.800
understand is that one important thing is
that click is the

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.910
summation of everything you've done to that
point in

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.020
time. For example, if we were to sit there
and say a

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.090
bald eagle. Everybody picture a bald eagle
in your mind?

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.040
And how many people have actually seen a bald
eagle in

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.251
the wild. So even though not everybody has
seen one in

00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:56.000
the wild, they can picture a bald eagle. Those
experiences totally, totally determine every

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.290
time you go
click what that picture is going to be. Now,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.280
here's the
whole trick in the thing. You don't get to

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.290
learn that
right away. I've been doing this 31 years.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.600
When I
started out, I didn't have all these insights.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.810
I didn't
know all this stuff. Like a lot of photographers,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.449
I did
that really bad thing. I read too much. You

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:12.919
read those
magazine articles that tell you you shouldn't

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.670
do this,
you shouldn't do that. When really you should

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.690
just go
out and have fun. And when you have fun, the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.229
rest of it
falls into place. So with that in mind, I

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:26.570
happen to have
a very lucky situation four years ago and

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.040
I got into
aviation photography strictly by chance. It

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.229
was not by
design. Most of my photography has been by

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.870
chance.
Somehow I get nudged in the right direction

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.600
and I have
enough sense to follow it till it doesn't

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.260
work anymore
and then I follow in another direction. In

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.550
aviation, I
have had quite a bit of success in a very

00:07:46.550 --> 00:08:46.360
short period of time
looking at one single thing and that's light.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:09:42.830
[silence]

00:09:42.830 --> 00:10:39.300
[Applause]

00:10:39.300 --> 00:11:38.810
&gt;&gt; Moose: So I've never done anything conventionally.
Everything I've done has been definitely on

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.000
the
unorthodox side. That included my delving

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.970
into the
digital back in the day. It's real simple

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.940
to do a search
and find some very disparaging remarks about

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.649
me back in
1992 or 1999 and 2000. I was gonna be the

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:57.420
death of photography because I
was bringing in this thing called digital.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.100
Oops. So I
never had done things normally. So right off

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.300
the bat,
I'm going to continue that tradition. Who's

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.230
got a
question? Who's got a question. Anyone got

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.680
questions?
This is when participants in the audience

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.610
stand up and
go to the mic and -- not a one. There we go.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.610
Break the
ice.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.220
&gt;&gt; Male #1: All right. So I'm curious. What's
the next crazy

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.060
thing you're thinking about doing photography
wise.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.140
&gt;&gt; Moose: Next crazy thing photography wise?
Well, if you follow

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.209
me on Google plus, I'm putting up a video
clip of me

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.560
hanging out of a plane photographing another
plane.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.390
People think that's pretty nuts. But most
of the things

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:40.440
I do photographically right now -- I'm not
exploring

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.480
anything radical other than I'm still working
with the VR

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.041
panels -- with the cockpit panels are called.
If you go

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:51.120
to the U.S. Air Force website, they have an
amazing

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.900
virtual walk through. And what's always getting
us is

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.650
the fact that complete panels you can walk
around. But

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.040
somehow they managed to tag it so you can
walk through and look at

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.290
panels in spots. The mathematical headache
of the HTML

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.850
is only by all the photographic panels you
have to build

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.350
and then lace in to make that happen. So we're
actually

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.881
working on that. I might not live to see it,
but we're

00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:20.190
working on it. Somebody's done it. Sir.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.710
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Assuming you've come to this point,
when and how did

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.860
you decide that digital had completely supplanted
film?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.120
&gt;&gt; Moose: Well, when it comes to deciding
between digital and

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.029
film, one of the criterias was the fact that
back in the

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:38.920
day with film, you would send your precious
slide into

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.450
the photo buyer and photo buyer looked at
it and said I'm

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.060
going to use it. This is all old stuff so
I'm dating

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.390
myself. You have that [inaudible] sleeve on
there. They take their grease pencil and they

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.880
figure
out how big they want it for the magazine.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.370
And they go to their
art department. They sit there and go okay,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.610
and they
figure it out. Then they send it to the gorillas

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.560
in the
lab. The gorillas are the big guys down there

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.339
with the exacto knife
and here's your cardboard. And they go to

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:06.850
slice open the
cardboard mount and they pop open your slide

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.620
hoping your
slide didn't go hit the floor. [makes mouth

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.650
noise] They put it in this little drum and
fill it full of oil

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.040
and SSSSSSSSSST they make separations. And
then, they send that

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.670
slide back to you. It's like it was a picture,
you know,

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.921
so that was the first thing about digital
is that you can

00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:26.589
make infinite amount of copies and it's still
original.

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:29.300
That was one of the first things. Next was,
I didn't have

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.100
to go out with grocery bags of film to sit
there and shoot a

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.079
project. All of those things were part of
it as well as

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:39.060
the fact that, when it comes to sharing an
image.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.570
Especially as we know today and it's only
been a decade, sharing an image on a camera

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.399
can be
instantaneous. So I can take people to places

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.940
they
aren't as fortunate to go to as I am and I

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.570
can instantly
share it. I'm well-known for the office series

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.290
that I
put out there. It's just quick iPhone pictures

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.820
of places I
happen to be at that I call the office. So

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.480
all of that
for whatever reason when I first saw digital

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.890
and it got put into my
hands, it was meant to be. And people ask

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.910
what is the
first digital picture I took? It was my big

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.160
toe. [laughter] I
wanted to see the thing work and it was handy,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.510
so that's
what I did. Any other questions? Oh, Lord,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.900
it's going
to be loaded.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.370
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Oh no, I think it's interesting.
I'm curious. How did you get to aviation photography

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.079
coming
from the wildlife and landscape background.

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.649
&gt;&gt; Moose: That's a good question and actually
how I got into

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:37.850
aviation or get into wildlife or any of that
stuff all had

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.459
the same kind of general past. The first has
to be, you gotta have the desire to do it.

00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:43.980
It's got to be
something you have a passion for. That's the

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.769
first
thing. Once you start following your heart,

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:49.930
you'd be
surprised the places you can go. And once

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.140
you get past
that basic barrier, there is, of course, the

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.330
photographic
barrier -- making the shot. That's kind of

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.050
important.
And then, once that happens, all you have

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.279
to do is share.
It's biologists and pilots and plane owners

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:08.680
all cut from
the same cloth. And it just blows me away

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.139
how many
photographers out there do not share their

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:14.490
images with
these people. And that's what I've done since

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.160
day one.
I used to have, back in the day, my own duping

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.050
machine and
I'd be working on a project and I'd these

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.890
critters. I'd
get slides back and send those off to the

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.040
biologist.
Today, it's a lot easier. The Epson 4900 is

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.760
kicking out
prints and I'm sending those to the plane

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.649
people. And
that's it. That sharing of that world that

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:38.959
we can do as
photographers opens all the doors. It opens

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.269
all the
doors to people you want to work with, the

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:43.260
people you
want to influence.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.519
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Copyright issues tend to be a big
issue for artists

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:53.570
especially photographers I had a photographer,
you know,

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.840
finding a wedding photographer who will give
you

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:02.050
copyright to the pictures of your own wedding
is apparently a hassle. You want to share

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.589
pictures. How do
you reconcile that.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:08.600
&gt;&gt; Moose: Well, I'm probably not the best
person to ask because

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.750
I'm kind of flippant about the whole thing.
To be

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.600
serious with you, when you buy my print, I'll
sign it because

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.500
people want me to, but I don't think my name
is that

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.449
important. It's the image that's important.
So

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:20.810
copyright. Yeah, it's a very legal thing that
we have in

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.880
this country. Protects our intellectual properties.
And

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.050
that's okay. And if you're going to take my
photograph

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.100
and use it for a commercial purpose in which
you're going

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.120
to sell a product and you do it without asking
me, we're

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.740
going to have issues. The rest of the time,
personally, I

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.050
think life is too short to worry about it.
Yeah,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.490
everything is copyrighted. And that's just
to avoid the

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.920
hassle if it ever does get stolen, having
to deal with

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.990
courts. Because as soon as I'm not spending
time behind

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.870
my camera, I'm not only not happy, I'm not
making money.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.720
So I don't worry about it. A lot of people
seem to worry

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.179
about copyright. And I think there's more
important

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.299
issues we need to worry about than copyrighting
our

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:01.630
images and enforcing it. That's my two cents
worth.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.851
It's kind of flippant, but it's just I don't
care. For

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.270
lack of better terms. I mean, you got to understand
--

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.910
I've seen it all. In our 31 years, Sharon
and I have seen it all.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.600
It happens at least once a quarter. Somebody
will take

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.740
one of my images. You got to realize it's
a 90K file on

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.950
that website. And they print it out 8 x 10
and they mail

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.710
it to me and say, "can you sign it and send
it back to

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.049
me?" I'm like all I see these big squares
on a piece of

00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:30.900
paper. I can't even tell what the hell the
thing is. Do

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.460
you realize not only is it this look horrible,
you like

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.120
stole my image. [laughter] So you just can't
worry about those

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.410
things. Life is too short. They mean well
and bless the

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.031
fans. But what they're doing is simply illegal.
Life

00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:48.660
goes on. All right. Let's talk a little bit
about

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.360
critters. That's what everybody wants to hear
about. No

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.600
matter what you see me doing, I'm still a
wildlife

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.620
photographer. I always will be. Most of my
work is with

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.990
threatened and endangered critters. What does
that mean?

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.530
These are critters that are about to be extinct.
Most of

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.290
the time that status of threatened and endangered
is a political one,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.640
not biological. If it was biological, we'd
have a whole

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.540
lot more on that list and be more concerned
about them

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.220
probably. I have 7 species in my files that
are extinct.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.010
As in you can't see them no more. They're
gone. And to

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.130
me, that is absolutely criminal; that in my
own lifetime, in

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.710
the state of California, where I'm native
that they are

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.220
gone. You cannot go out and find them and
see them.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.560
Because it's not really ours. It was handed
down to us

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.220
and I think it's our responsibility to hand
it to the

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.220
next generation. And I have no doubt that
I'm kind of

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.290
preaching to the choir here. I understand
that. But you

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.150
have the ability, three different mechanisms,
to put the

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.169
word out there in very many different ways
that we should

00:19:47.169 --> 00:20:42.169
care about this wild heritage.

00:20:42.169 --> 00:21:36.140
[silence]

00:21:36.140 --> 00:22:30.110
[Applause]

00:22:30.110 --> 00:23:26.169
&gt;&gt; Moose: So a real common question is how
do you get those

00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:29.702
pictures? It's a great question. Very valid
when it

00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:32.670
comes to wildlife photography. That's why
I wrote a 400

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.690
page book to try to answer that question how
do you take

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.000
these pictures. It's not like there's a recipe
that I can

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.990
provide you that can just instantly make things
happen. What I can do is try to give you insight,

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.130
hope and the possibility that you can do it
as well. Anybody can do

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.809
this. This is not a special person kind of
pursuit. It just

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:57.080
takes a big heart. So the way I try to answer
that

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.650
question how do you do it is just tell you
some stories

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.790
about how I was fortunate enough to be able
to do it. I actually

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:06.040
started off with this little bird here called
Least Bell's Vireo. When I started

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.549
working with them back in '80 and '81, there
was about 130

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:14.271
on the planet. That was entire world population.
This

00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:17.211
particular -- I've always had this sixth sense.
I can

00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:22.490
find bird nests. I've always been able to.
It's not like a challenge. I can, like a heat

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.809
seeking missile, just
find them. Foresters hired me to go out and

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:28.240
find these guys. I
they needed me to survey them. So the deal

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.490
was they provided
me a vehicle and access the place in the morning.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.539
I
found the nest. The afternoon was mine to

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.610
photograph them.
This photograph was here kind of start the

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:43.730
whole thing.
In that in April of '83, California, Outdoor

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.920
California,
a local magazine put out by our DFG here,

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.799
ran this article and these
photographs. This is truly kind of an artsy

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:54.450
fartsy
photograph not what most scientists are looking

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:58.070
for. In
the article, I talked about this bird and

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.630
where it was. There
were two gentlemen down in southern California,

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.441
in Oceanside.
They walk together every morning. And they

00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:07.299
saw
these -- you can really especially hear them

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:10.960
in the early spring
when the males come back from South America

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.200
and they
always wondered what they were. Gentleman

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.230
had my
magazine, came to his friend's house knocked

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.190
the door and said “hey I
know what those birds are”. They go, “really”.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.039
He showed
him the article. And he goes “Wow, you know

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:24.300
what? That place we see them
down, that piece of riparian forest right

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.130
there, they are actually bulldozing it today.”
So they got on

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.280
the phone, called Fish and Wildlife Service
and actually told them the story. And there's

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.050
a little clause in our
Endangered Species Act, kind of a big loophole

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.571
about destroying stuff when things first get
listed. Still

00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:40.270
hasn't been closed. Anyway, they did stop
it. And

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.520
I've been credited from saving the species
from

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.800
extinction. That's how I started my career.
Kind of a

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.120
tease of what's possible with just a photograph.
Now, I do have

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.580
my favorite critters. There's no doubt to
it. Kind of

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.531
obvious why. My brothers in the north and
I, we spend a lot of time

00:25:58.531 --> 00:26:01.700
together. They're very unique. They're very
curious.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.720
For example, that big rack. That's a big giant
radar

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.061
dish. And they use those big ears and they
move them

00:26:08.061 --> 00:26:10.320
around inside that. They're listening for
one thing and

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.550
that' females moaning in fall for rut. That's
all that big rack

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.870
is for is to hear those moans from a long
distance. So

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.039
that kind of trivia has always driven me to
go out and

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:26.370
find out more answers. You know, the polar
bear. It's an

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.750
iconic animal which it's kind of sad to see
what's in the

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.809
press because most of it's not accurate about
this

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:36.110
information. The time we were up there photographing,
this is off of Alaska. I refuse to go do

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.590
them in Hudson bay. This is off the Beaufort
Sea in Alaska. And there was a female that

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.240
drowned
because her ice pack which a couple of years

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:50.860
before. So
this was taken in 2003, so in 2001, the ice

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.929
pack was
about 150 yards offshore. But at this point,

00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:59.909
at this year, it was two miles
offshore. She drowned trying to get back in.

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:02.929
So they
are getting hit by the thing called climate

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:07.070
change. And
that is really kind of -- really changed a

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.710
lot of things
that Sharon and I do for the simple reason

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.809
that a lot of
the places we have tried to preserve over

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:14.230
our three
decades of work in California. A These little

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.481
islands of habitat
people don't think about much but as the climate

00:27:17.481 --> 00:27:19.630
changes, but
these little islands of habitat the endangered

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.170
species called home now it won't be there
anymore.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.340
Climate change will completely change it and
they'll blink out. Blink out is

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.860
kind of a hopeful term for extinction. So
like Fresno Kangaroo Rat. You're not going

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.559
to see them anywhere else but
there. It's gone. Hasn't been seen since the

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:40.520
photograph
was taken in 87. So extinct. Can't find it.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.070
They've
been trying hard. So that's one thing that

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.610
we're trying to do
with our mission is to not only, I get these

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.010
phone calls.
Not only really more phone calls, it's usually

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.820
text. It's amazing how it
evolved. It used to be phone calls. Then,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.120
it got faxes.
Then it got to be e-mails and now it's text.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.460
I get this
message. “Can you show up. We found this.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.539
We need you to
photograph it”. And I do that quite a bit.

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:04.659
And that's
where the photographic expertise comes in.

00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:08.730
You have to
bring in the camera and tell the story not

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.630
only
biologically and historically correct but

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.360
technically and
communicatively very effective. So I just

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.470
want to tell
you about this one story and how things kind

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.161
of evolved.
It's how wildlife photography in my book it

00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:24.780
should work and how it's always worked for
us. I work with biologists extensively. I

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.870
have since
day one. They are the keepers to the keys

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.260
of the
kingdom. They are the ones that -- in seriousness,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.230
I
don't have time to go out and sit somewhere

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.700
and wait for
the things to happen. It's just -- in a business

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.559
sense,
that's not a good business plan. So I've been

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:43.270
very
fortunate. Biologists are saying, "hey, we're

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.030
seeing it
here now. Can you photograph it here now?"

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.470
And that's what
I've been doing for 30 years. So in this case,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.050
UAF --
University of Alaska, Fairbanks, doing a lot

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.250
of work as
you might imagine on this thing called climate

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.900
change. But they don't do
it in a conventional way. They do it very

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.961
old-fashioned
way. Because of the the head prof there. He's

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:06.490
kind of
old-fashioned. So we had a Ph. D. Candidate,

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.809
Hayley, and she went
around. 53 years ago, this biologist went

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:13.770
around and
sampled all the Collared Pika which you see

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.260
on the screen
now. He sampled the entire world population

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.440
which is down
in Canada all the way up into Alaska and sample

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.090
means [makes shotgun noises]
okay? Take a skin, do the skulls, basic sampling

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.961
which is
what science has been doing for eons. Science

00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:34.640
is as
science should be -- it's a very regimented,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.570
formula
oriented, this is my hypothesis, can I prove

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.670
it scenario.
So she went back with this incredible sample

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:46.679
from 53 years ago
went back and did it all again. And what she

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:50.440
found
out, was two things. In the entire population

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.660
of Collared Pikas, one thing is a little bone
in the skull had changed. The entire

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.039
population. They don't have fax. They don't
have

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:00.429
e-mail. They don't have a way of saying 'okay
everybody, change this

00:30:00.429 --> 00:30:03.970
bone in your skull to be this long'. They
evolved within 50

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:09.830
years this one thing. At the same time, they
live at a very special

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.630
altitude and that's because, they're active
365. So right now in their world,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:19.659
it's 24/7 darkness and it's about minus 30
degrees plus or

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:23.710
minus 5. And so, they need this density of
snow to keep

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.360
them going. Well, that density of snow isn't
the same at

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.059
that same altitude. So the entire population,
they all

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:34.429
moved up the slope. They all moved up the
slope. This is

00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:38.260
direct because of the change in the climate.
They don't

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.150
have, in the summer time, where they were,
the warmth they

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.630
need to grow the forearms they have to grab.
And what they do.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.630
This is Number 6 and he was a character. Now,
a Collared Pika

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.240
is about the size of tennis ball. They're
little guys,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.700
all right? And they live on talus slopes . Talus
slopes are what you see a lot

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.600
in the Sierra. It's where you have all that
border of boulders borders and all those rocks

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.179
and
rubble on the side of a slope. That's a talus

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:06.980
slope and
they live in that. And they bounce around

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.740
like a tennis
ball on these rocks. They're just these dynamos

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.029
going every which way, in part so they don't
get preyed upon. They have

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:16.880
no defenses. They can't like scare anything.
They're

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.039
commonly called rock rabbits. They're cute.
They're

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:23.430
fuzzy. They go oink, oink. That's the noise
they make.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.460
They're just one of a kind, kind of critters.
We have the American

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.620
Pika down here. It should be listed. It's
now in such a

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.440
peril, they're thinking about listing it as
threatened. And this is the thing called Collared

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.820
Pika, which
is the far reaches of North America. Well,

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.280
Number 6 -- what
he's doing here is what they normally do in

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.760
the summer
time. They're constantly going out to get

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.600
greeneries and bringing through these rocks.
They're constantly creating hay pails, hay

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.809
piles just like you might think
a farmer might do. And this is what it looks

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:57.160
like Number 6
jumping the Grand Canyon. Probably, maybe

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.880
18, 20 inches and this
photograph in print form is in everything

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.600
from Harvard and
Smithsonian and Yale. It's actually around

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.409
the globe, these prints
have gone out because it's kind of like what

00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:12.471
they use as
a mascot to talk about climate warming. Because

00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:16.450
what's
happening with that change in altitude -- they

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.010
only have
so much mountain they go to and then there

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.429
ain't no more.
That's the issue. On this particular mountain

00:32:22.429 --> 00:32:26.080
where Number
6 lived -- it was a small colony up in the

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.020
Alaska range
and there's probably I'm going to say 33,

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:34.710
36 Collared Pika
on this entire slope. They only had about

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.520
another 40 feet, vertical
feet to go up and then there was just sky.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.659
And there's
no more place for them to go. So we worked

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:45.890
on this project. This was one of the projects
Like most of my projects, they're all self-funded.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.710
There's no funding for these projects. The
biologists

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:54.460
need this documentation. Their hands are full.
They're busy doing what they do in their research.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.450
So
it's up to me to get not only the photographs

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.140
but
anecdotal evidence. As a photographer, I'm

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.240
not seeing
things over and over again and I'm not recording

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.130
that so
it's a one time thing so it's called anecdotal

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.550
even
though it's a photograph that's part of the

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.080
process. So
I'm out there not only to make the picture

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.090
record all
this information, but then it's my goal to

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.429
bring that
story back. That's the whole goal. Because

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:21.070
how many
people here have heard of a Collared Pika

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:25.640
before? That's my
point. It's just not known, not seen. Well,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.501
this
project we worked on for about ten days. We

00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:33.360
is my youngest son
Jake and myself. So Link -- the head prof

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.880
said, "hey,
we're going to go after a critter that is

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.390
in worse shape
than the Collared Pika up there." And I said,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.070
"really?" He goes,
"yeah." So two years ago, we started planning

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:48.310
this three week trip up the Haul Road
Many people have seen the Haul Road trucker

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:53.880
thing on Discovery. It's
horrible. Anyway, this is the Haul Road, okay?

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.130
It's an
amazing transportation corridor up through

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.030
the arctic up
to the Beaufort Arctic Ocean and people know

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.789
it basically because of the
trucks that go back and forth. It's just,

00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:09.520
you know, it's
very inviting kind of place. That's a joke

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.929
folks. It's
okay. [laughter] So we landed in Fairbanks.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.230
And at Fairbanks we
sat there and basically after a year of planning

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.109
our
three week trip, because of political reasons

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:25.919
more than
anything else, got down to three days. So

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:29.500
all we had to
do was three days of work. So we got on the

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.079
truck. And
we drove. We went north of the Yukon river.

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:35.139
And that's
important because what we're going to go find

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.010
is only
found north of the Yukon river now. And we

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.720
kept on going
up to a place called Slope Mountain. It's

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.049
about a
12-hour drive up the Haul Road which in itself

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:48.940
is a crazy
amazing experience. What you see up there

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.539
is just
unbelievable. It's not barren by any stretch

00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:55.489
of
imagination. It's full of life. Full of activity

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.479
and
it's strategy for the critters and plants

00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:01.759
to survive in
this environment is really just a little bit

00:35:01.759 --> 00:35:04.670
more than
the mind can comprehend that they do survive

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.069
in such
incredible, spectacular way. So we kept on

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:12.240
going up. And we are going
to the place that literally has just been

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.530
named on
the USGS the week after we came back. And

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.869
it's called Slope Mountain. You ever been
to Alaska? There's got to be 1,000 Slope Mountains.

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:22.459
I
don't know why they can't get past that name.

00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:24.559
I can tell
you Slope Mountain. You can Google it, ha

00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:27.869
Google it, and you'll find
all these spots and you'll never know where

00:35:27.869 --> 00:35:30.390
I was.
That's kind of the cool thing. Maybe that's

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.710
why I do it.
All the hunters I know say, “I went to Slope

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:38.319
Mountain.” "Uh, which
one?" And so, we got up there. And this is

00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:40.509
what we
found when we got up to Slope Mountain. Slope

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:43.609
Mountain
is there in the fog and the rain. This is

00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:49.229
late July.
Looking through that fog is the arctic plain.

00:35:49.229 --> 00:35:53.569
It's an
amazing location. You know, you're talking

00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:56.410
about
everything from wolves and grizzly bears and

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:01.009
caribou to
Siberian birds that are over summering in

00:36:01.009 --> 00:36:06.849
Alaska. Now, one of
the first things that I was told about this

00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:11.940
critter in
when I Link first sent it to me, he said,

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.130
“it's never been
photographed before”. I said, “Say, what?”

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.559
He said, “Well, there's one picture”.
I said

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:23.940
“okay”. He said, "it's a Sarah Palin story.
OK? There you go.” You all

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.259
start laughing right off the bat. Anyway,
they decided

00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:30.140
they need to have a official ground hog for
Alaska

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.089
Groundhog Day and there's four ground hog
species in Alaska

00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:37.049
so off they went on a goose chase to see which
one was

00:36:37.049 --> 00:36:43.130
the most charismatic, photographic looking
marmot, ground hog, for Groundhog Day. It

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.289
only gets worse from there so I'm going to
stop. But

00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:47.460
this one guy went up there and he went with
the biologist

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:53.729
I'm working with. He put his Coolpix onto
a spotting scope, and shot through the fog

00:36:53.729 --> 00:36:56.160
and got this picture. So prior to us, that
was the only

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.650
photograph of the Alaskan marmot before we
went up there.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.640
So that was part of the challenge. And then,
there really wasn't much known about the Alaska

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.309
marmot.
Still isn't. A lot of the basics just aren't

00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:09.749
there. So
that truck was clean. That is the Alaska pipeline

00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:13.459
behind
us as we head up and over. The Alaskan pipeline

00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:19.700
is an amazing corridor.
Engineering wise, biological wise; the misinformation

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.220
about
that whole thing still boggles my mind. But

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:29.640
that Slope
Mountain once the fog and clouds disappear.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.799
And we're
going to climb that thing. And we have to

00:37:32.799 --> 00:37:36.309
climb it when
it's sunny, because that's the only time these

00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:39.969
guys
are out. Well, that evening and that evening

00:37:39.969 --> 00:37:43.829
being about
12 p.m., 1 a.m., you can still see the sun

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:47.819
on the slope.
We were good. All is fine. We checked out

00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:51.140
the creek
because that creek there we had to get our

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.450
stuff across.
We actually put a rubber raft on that creek

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.650
with a rope
that we could pull ourselves across to get

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.729
from this side
to the other side to get up the slope. We

00:38:00.729 --> 00:38:05.569
had permission by Alaska to camp right there
by the pipeline.

00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:07.950
There's our rubber rope. That's where we're
camping.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.759
It's not one of those warm, cozy Alaska lodges
that you

00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:15.229
would think of. It is the basic kind of biological
camp.

00:38:15.229 --> 00:38:19.660
The biggest tent is the food/animal prep tent.
And from

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.720
there we just went across. As you can see
it's raining

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.209
again. It was pouring. Didn't stop. We had
three days

00:38:28.209 --> 00:38:31.499
to get out and do this. And I had to have
sun for these

00:38:31.499 --> 00:38:36.511
guys to show up. It was just horrible. Get
out of the

00:38:36.511 --> 00:38:40.779
tent that morning, have our cold pancakes
with bacon.

00:38:40.779 --> 00:38:44.960
And we three days -- off you go. Now, this
is one of

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.460
those -- people asked me if I have done stupid
things in wildlife

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.089
photography. This has to be right up at the
top five. This slope

00:38:51.089 --> 00:38:56.839
wasn't just some little walk up a foothill.
And the biologist I'm working with,

00:38:56.839 --> 00:39:00.920
he had tried out for Survivor, the TV show,
and he actually

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.700
had won and gotten on there and he was on
that show. But

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.920
when they started taping, it said it was going
to take him

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.109
into the season, he bailed out from the show.
This is the guy I'm going

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:15.400
to follow up the slope, okay? Not smart, okay?
So I've

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.810
got the 600 millimeter body on my shoulder.
We're going up this

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:24.329
slope that's about a 38 percent grade. It's
loose shale.

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:28.339
We're going up this thing. Mr. Jackrabbit
he's on top in a

00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:31.739
heartbeat. I'm like “Holy--”. And I'm
at the bottom. Take a step ,

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:35.749
slide back two. Take a step, slide back two.
600 on the back. It's raining my son's going

00:39:35.749 --> 00:39:37.650
up.
And so, the old man is the back. Should never

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.479
have been up this
hill. We go up there and this is what we see.

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:45.049
I mean,
this is all we're seeing. There's no sun.

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.959
Means there
ain't going to be any critters. But we sat

00:39:47.959 --> 00:39:50.709
there for
five hours in the rain hunched over anyway

00:39:50.709 --> 00:39:55.079
because you
have three days. That's it. Well, they went

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:57.499
to the very
top and they're kind of shooting was a little

00:39:57.499 --> 00:39:59.250
bit
different than ours and they did manage to

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.640
get one
sample. Now, you might be saying and asking

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.190
yourself is
it possible it could be going extinct, if

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.549
it's in trouble why would you be shooting
and

00:40:08.549 --> 00:40:12.869
sampling these? Well, it's like anything in
biological

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:14.910
field. If you don't have answers, it's hard
to figure

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.390
out solutions. And without knowing much about
the

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:22.900
critters, simple basic thing is what do they
eat? Things

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.039
like that. It's hard to make calls about what
needs to

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:30.609
be done on their behalf. And that's part of
the project.

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:33.150
And that's one of them. It's not alive any
longer. How

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.619
many have they shot in the entire breadth
of this

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:38.680
project. I think it's like number 13. It's
not like they're shooting

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.019
out millions of them. They take very select
samples from

00:40:42.019 --> 00:40:45.980
select areas. And then, the biology starts.
And the guy

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.180
on the right -- he's the the Survivor champion.
And he

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.609
is also the curator of the biggest DNA depository
for

00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:57.390
critters on the planet up at UAF. So his pedigree
for

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.729
knowing this stuff is amazing. And it's a
lot they learn

00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:04.069
from these guys. But it's only so much. They
need to be

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:06.829
able to sit there and find out what I do best
-- that

00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:11.230
anecdotal evidence. So the next day we went
out and it

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.119
was obviously going up that slope wasn't going
to work.

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:16.910
I can't believe I'm hear to talk about it
anyway. Had to

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.760
find another slope that was easy to egress.
We had only

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.049
three days and now we had only two. We had
to find

00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:25.319
critters who would come out. So we went to
another spot.

00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:28.200
Weather still didn't cooperate. This is all
the Alaska

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.259
range which is an absolutely spectacular part
of this

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:34.710
planet. It's hard to describe the life that
goes on

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.829
here. And the critters aren't what you might
think. The

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:42.550
caribous, they come in. They do their thing.
They love to follow that pipeline

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.049
because the heat that's generated from it.
Oil is going

00:41:45.049 --> 00:41:48.359
through that the at 10,000 PSI and it's getting
shot down that tube.

00:41:48.359 --> 00:41:51.039
The heat that's generated from that is amazing.
And the

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:55.509
life that comes around that in the form of
forbs and

00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:58.709
stuff feeds a lot of critters. But they'll
come right up

00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:01.279
and just say hello. They have absolutely no
inhibition

00:42:01.279 --> 00:42:05.420
to us like you might think. And I saw everything
I could

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.269
imagine up there from peregrine falcons and
wolves and grizzly bears and caribou but

00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:12.809
I still hadn't gotten the main critter I was
after. And

00:42:12.809 --> 00:42:17.329
that was the Alaska marmot. And then finally
about an

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:20.740
hour or, so we got to see our first one. Now,
Alaska

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.690
Marmot -- it's not like the Yellow-bellied
Marmot you might

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:29.069
see here in the Sierras or up Denali National
Park even. They're

00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:32.930
big hogs, okay? They have been harvested for
food.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.119
You'll see pictures of them underneath the
wing of a

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:38.029
Cessna. And they're longer than the wing of
the Cessna is wide.

00:42:38.029 --> 00:42:41.359
They're big things. They're massive. At the
same time,

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:44.180
they are the longest true hibernators of any
mammal on

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.259
the planet. Their period of time above ground
is just

00:42:48.259 --> 00:42:50.700
nothing. And in that period of time like a
lot of

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.190
critters they come up, get fat, make babies
and they go

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.170
back to sleep. You know that's it. Well, so
we got a

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.130
couple clicks of them, but that's it. I'm
sitting on the

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.859
ridge looking. That's what I did for the whole
day.

00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:07.269
Couple pictures. So okay, first one to photograph
the

00:43:07.269 --> 00:43:11.369
marmot. Not enough. So it rained again the
next night.

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:13.459
And remember I got to have that sunshine.
Sunshine is

00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:16.010
everything. So we had to find another spot.
The next

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.799
day, we thought, okay it's starting off with
a good omen. So off we

00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:24.579
went, went up the hill. Went up a different
hill this time and this time we had

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:27.890
no threat of rain. It rained, it was gone
and we were

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.440
out. And we're in a part of the world even
these

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.569
satellite phones don't want to work. We're
up there at the top curve where there's no

00:43:34.569 --> 00:43:36.630
communication.
There's no way of looking at radar pictures

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.249
to see what
storm fronts are coming in. It's the last

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:42.160
day; we go for the gusto. So up the hill we
went and

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.469
Jake and I went up to the top of the hill.
This is our

00:43:45.469 --> 00:43:50.309
view. And for three hours, we watch the view.
And just

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:54.680
watched the view. And watched the view. And
the clock

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.130
is ticking. And the day before four marmots
had been

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.680
seen at this burrow. And we're like okay,
they got to

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.119
come out. So three hours are gone into it.
We watched

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:06.770
everything. Helicopters going back and forth
watching

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.010
looking at the pipeline, doing its survey
work. We watch

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.759
a brand new Camaro go up the Haul Road. This
is a brand

00:44:14.759 --> 00:44:19.519
new, bright yellow, Transformer kind of Camaro,
the probably some military guy just bought

00:44:19.519 --> 00:44:23.319
in Fairbanks and decided
to go for a ride. It had to be destroyed.

00:44:23.319 --> 00:44:26.289
The Haul Road
is these big pebbles and we've lost as many

00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:29.980
as 9 tires on one
trip up this road. So that Camaro was like

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.310
the highlight of
entertainment after sitting on a rock for

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:37.079
three hours.
And then finally, one came out. And had the

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:40.400
opportunity
of starting to actually do what it is I do

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.800
and that is to
photograph the biology of a critter. That's

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.569
my
specialty. Asking questions in my mind and

00:44:46.569 --> 00:44:49.109
trying to
find it in the view finder to bring back answers

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:51.630
to
biologists is what I've done for 30 years.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.130
Now for
critter that sits there and basically hibernates

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.230
most of it's life,
activity is not really what it's striving

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.680
for, okay?
They're like -- it's a simple thing with critters.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.769
Calories in, calories out. I want to get fat.
Means I

00:45:06.769 --> 00:45:11.529
don't do anything. Well photographically,
can get boring

00:45:11.529 --> 00:45:14.339
real fast, okay? You're sitting there been
sitting on a

00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:17.989
rock. We haven't moved. Haven't moved an inch.
We're stuck because you

00:45:17.989 --> 00:45:21.369
don't know if your movement is going to keep
them from coming out for another five minutes.

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:24.670
So we're just stuck. No
matter what biological thing is calling on

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.170
us to go find
another rock or anything else, you're stuck.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:32.049
And then,
they come out and this is what they do. Now,

00:45:32.049 --> 00:45:34.079
as I
typically do, I take a lot of notes. I have

00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:37.690
a GPS in the
camera so it's tagging all my images. That

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.849
information
goes right to the biologists. They can sit

00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:43.190
there and figure out where I was
and with our software digital probing sit

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.259
there and
actually -- because I'm using the auto focus--

00:45:45.259 --> 00:45:47.619
know how far
I am physically from that critter. So they

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:51.859
have that information.
It's carved in stone from EXIF data. But I

00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:55.499
still take a
lot of paper notes. I take a micro-cassette

00:45:55.499 --> 00:46:00.579
recorder. Taking
verbal notes and I'm watching and shooting

00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:04.589
that whole
time. Now, for a critter that has nothing

00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:07.769
known about
it, anything that we saw or we photographed

00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:11.680
was new. It was
like innovative. It was like unbelievable.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.329
So how they
moved across the slope. How the four of them

00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:18.160
interacted was all
important. But really what got to them was,

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.999
I'm shooting this
D3X. It's a 2X on the 600. I'm sitting there

00:46:21.999 --> 00:46:25.359
shooting. That's the burrow.
And after awhile, I simply said, “okay,

00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:28.359
I think I've got
this shot”. So I watch the clouds and I

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:33.210
watch them. Then I
put the D 3 S on a camera and I shot a video.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.249
I shot a
total of about four hours of video and the

00:46:37.249 --> 00:46:41.479
big thing was
everything in that video had never been seen

00:46:41.479 --> 00:46:44.740
before.
They had not seen any of this part of it.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.920
Because
biologists don't have the luxury of time to

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.259
just sit and stare at
something. It's long gone from our biology

00:46:51.259 --> 00:46:56.589
and our
system. It's just time and money. It's that

00:46:56.589 --> 00:47:01.059
real simple. I
got here just a simple nine minute clip of

00:47:01.059 --> 00:47:05.150
all that video
I shot. That's because I know at about minute

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:08.270
30, you going are
all going to start wiggling and going, “Okay,

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:12.059
time to change the
slide. Time to move”. And this is only nine

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:16.789
minutes of
my 14 hours on that rock that afternoon. That's

00:47:16.789 --> 00:47:19.000
what I
do. I sit on my ass on a rock and I stare

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.190
through a lens
at critters. Not real glamorous sounding,

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.989
but this video
clip became a feature in Nature magazine.

00:47:28.989 --> 00:47:32.381
The whole clip
went around and has gone from Russia all the

00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:35.989
way through
as people try to understand what it is these

00:47:35.989 --> 00:47:39.809
guys need
and what is driving them to the point where

00:47:39.809 --> 00:47:43.439
they might go
extinct. That Slope Mountain where we were

00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:46.630
going the
first day we camped -- that's the last mountain

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.920
going up
the globe. The marmots have no further north

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.739
they can go
to get away from climate change. That's it.

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:56.130
They're
going to be possibly their last stronghold.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.569
Who knows?
That's their biggest problem. I can put out

00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:02.660
more questions
than I have answers for as well as the biologists

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:08.299
about
the marmot. Now, their biggest predator perhaps

00:48:08.299 --> 00:48:12.699
the
Golden Eagle. Perhaps they're not like numerous.

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:15.589
They
don't have a lot of enemies. They're big.

00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:18.530
They're not
something like a Golden Eagle can really easily

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.630
deal
with. They have these burrows they can go

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:26.079
down into real quick. They're on these semi-rocky
slopes, not talus slopes. They have some

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:30.079
places to hide. But they do seem to like to
stare out

00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:32.160
looking out to the direction he's staring
right now, it's the

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.170
NSF station that's up there in the arctic
that's doing a lot of work on climate change

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:40.319
and arctic critters. It's that big lake back
there that right now is frozen

00:48:40.319 --> 00:48:43.620
solid and aircraft are actually are landing
on it. And what

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.519
happens is this is basically who knows why
but they go up

00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:49.209
and down like periscopes and all of a sudden
you'll see

00:48:49.209 --> 00:48:51.699
the second one come up and more importantly
you'll see

00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:54.640
him start eating grass and that was the biggest
thing we

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.479
recorded the whole day that got everybody
excited was

00:48:57.479 --> 00:49:00.820
seeing them eating those forbs because it
was not known what they

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.910
were eating. And that is a very important
part of any

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.869
critter's biology. So we're into maybe about
four

00:49:07.869 --> 00:49:12.801
minutes of this video and many of you are
tired of it already. 14

00:49:12.801 --> 00:49:20.380
hours on a rock. 14 hours. Click, click, click.
14

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.549
hours. So how do you get that picture?Well,
you

00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:26.189
know, I wrote 400 words in a book called Captured
to try and

00:49:26.189 --> 00:49:29.181
explain it but the only way I can really be
really honest about it

00:49:29.181 --> 00:49:31.430
is to have passion for it. That's the only
thing that's

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.609
going to keep you on a rock for 14 hours.
A lot of

00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:40.059
people go you must have a lot of patience.
I said you haven't talked to my sons. Patience

00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:43.890
isn't part of this
deal, okay? I get very impatient. I want things

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:48.009
to
happen. I want to see things go on, but that

00:49:48.009 --> 00:49:50.059
doesn't
always happen. But when you have a passion

00:49:50.059 --> 00:49:55.689
for it, you can sit
there for a lifetime and watch it. Now, the

00:49:55.689 --> 00:49:59.259
thing that's
intrigues me about a lot of wildlife photographers

00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:01.170
starting out is the thing is you think you
have to have a

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:06.100
big lens. You really don't have to have a
600mm with a 2X to do that. Why

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.499
do I use that in this example here? Because
it was

00:50:09.499 --> 00:50:13.960
totally unknown. We knew nothing about the
marmots. There was no research.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:19.329
Google Alaskan marmot. You'll see line drawings.
You'll see very spattered little “I saw

00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:22.660
it” here kind of things, anecdotes and that's
it. It's

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.430
just not known. So when you don't have a known
entity

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.130
that you can, like, refer to and say, “okay,
we kind of got an

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.019
idea; we'll do this, we'll do that” so I
can use this lens; I can

00:50:32.019 --> 00:50:35.859
go this close; it'll react like this, react
that to me. We don't have

00:50:35.859 --> 00:50:38.989
the information, you got to go completely
on the side of

00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:43.479
safety, of error, of worst case scenarios
and start from

00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:46.869
there. Because what happens if I sit there
my

00:50:46.869 --> 00:50:51.069
third day and got no pictures. No pictures
wasn't a

00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:54.410
problem. It was no data. I had no data for
those

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.570
biologists who were trying to work on these
guys. These

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.349
video clips. They've gone over them and they
found all

00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:02.131
sorts of things that I'd love to repeat to
you, but they're

00:51:02.131 --> 00:51:04.520
all in Latin. I don't do Latin, you know?
But they

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.309
found these little bugs and little things
and little

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:11.749
behaviors and funny tooth growths and all
this kind of

00:51:11.749 --> 00:51:14.670
stuff in this video; they've gone through
it in a million different ways.

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:19.930
And that's the whole point of photograph.
At the same time, a lot of

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.440
wildlife photographers, for whatever reason,
don't share or

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.549
give back. And that's another thing that just,
it just

00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:28.479
seems to drive me nuts. Because seriously,
what are you

00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:29.971
going to do with that picture on your hard
drive. It

00:51:29.971 --> 00:51:35.229
sits there and then what? You back it up,
you do checks on it every month. It's still

00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:41.099
there. Right? You give someone
that photograph, and right off the bat what

00:51:41.099 --> 00:51:43.650
happens? A
lot of times, the first thing you're gonna

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:47.190
get is a smile.
That's pretty damn cool, right? And then they

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.869
put it on their wall. They put your art on
their wall, they'll

00:51:49.869 --> 00:51:53.130
never forget you. And whatever it is that
story about the picture you told

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.489
them, they'll share it to the next person.
That's cool.

00:51:56.489 --> 00:51:59.079
The next person. That's even better. So this
whole

00:51:59.079 --> 00:52:02.430
thing that I've done since day one is something
that I

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.200
think -- if we're fortunate enough as photographers
to go

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.321
out and witness this kind of stuff that we
should have the

00:52:07.321 --> 00:52:10.709
responsibility to go back and share it. So
we're coming

00:52:10.709 --> 00:52:13.359
up on minute 8 and some of you just got the
wiggles like

00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:17.749
crazy. All I can say is 14 hours. 14 hours.
We're

00:52:17.749 --> 00:52:24.589
supposed to go back this summer and go back
and work

00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:30.119
with these guys again. It was shut down. Political
reasons. Supposed to be going back again 2013.

00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:34.180
And so far, the
politics are pushing hard, but I think we

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.910
can go back
doing it again. It's -- there's a lot of things

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:43.209
in our
lives that are forefront issues. Our wild

00:52:43.209 --> 00:52:46.400
heritage does
not seem to still get on the radar scope except

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.589
for a few
enlightened ones. So to try and change that

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:52.289
is another
reason I wrote the book, Captured. You know

00:52:52.289 --> 00:52:55.029
what I do,
anybody can do. You just got to go out and

00:52:55.029 --> 00:52:58.170
do it. Right
here in the San Francisco Bay area, how many

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.920
people saw
that mouse that was on a bus? Anybody see

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.201
that's going
around Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse photograph

00:53:04.201 --> 00:53:08.849
it was on a bus. It was a picture of ours,
taken in Palo Alto Baylands, just up the road

00:53:08.849 --> 00:53:14.259
from here. And all summer it was
on a bus going through San Francisco. Again,

00:53:14.259 --> 00:53:17.660
just trying to get people involved in what's
in your own backyard. Palo Alto Baylands,

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:22.660
how
many people go visit that? Shame on you folks.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.380
You
don't have to be a photographer to go there.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.609
Clapper Rail.
Anybody ever heard of California Clapper Rail?

00:53:27.609 --> 00:53:30.680
It's an endangered
critter lives in the Baylands. Unbelievable

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.709
clown .
Hilarious to watch. And you don't have to

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:37.619
take a picture. You'd be surprised, you go
there how you get sucked into that, the black

00:53:37.619 --> 00:53:43.390
rail, the shore birds, the terns, the gulls
and sooner or later then you get into birding

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:46.559
and
then you get to see it and you go seeing it's

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:50.849
not enough.
A picture. And then, the bug hits. That's

00:53:50.849 --> 00:53:54.349
what I'm here
to do. I'm here to get that bug to bite you.

00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:57.509
Bite you
hard -- get you into any form of photography.

00:53:57.509 --> 00:54:00.239
Wildlife
photography, of course, is still my greatest

00:54:00.239 --> 00:54:03.009
passion. But
any kind of photography. Get you out there.

00:54:03.009 --> 00:54:05.400
We're the
fortunate ones. We get to see this – we

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.469
get to go out and witness that . So
I think it's upon us to share that with those

00:54:09.469 --> 00:54:12.650
who are not
as fortunate. Yeah, the video clip is coming

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:18.099
to an end
here. I know you're dying, but 14 hours on

00:54:18.099 --> 00:54:23.239
a rock. And
I'm crazy enough to go back and sit on that

00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:27.529
rock some
more, okay? To get back and bring back the

00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:31.309
story of the
Alaskan marmots.

00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:32.529
[silence]

00:54:32.529 --> 00:54:41.429
&gt;&gt;Moose: It's kind of weird to see my picture
20 times around

00:54:41.429 --> 00:54:44.019
the room. It's kind of like giving me a little
bit of

00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:51.480
[funny sound] On the technical side, I still
use my Nikon shooter; have been since the

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.640
very beginning. I shoot the D3x the vast
majority of the time. That's the big ass camera

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.180
that shoots
big ass files. That's about as fast as a crayon

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.859
when it
comes to writing those files. It's kind of

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:07.239
like the old
sharp shooter mentality, one shot; they're

00:55:07.239 --> 00:55:10.449
gone.
That's kind of where I've gone to with my

00:55:10.449 --> 00:55:15.260
photography. I do
love the sound of the D3S, [mouth noise] 9

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:19.819
frames a second. That's sexy. I
can deal with that. But I'm working more at

00:55:19.819 --> 00:55:22.779
and have been for
more years to get that one solid click to

00:55:22.779 --> 00:55:31.000
tell the story. That means that if it's wildlife
or landscape or it's a plane or a person,

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.859
the
whole thing is to tell a story. And you sit

00:55:32.859 --> 00:55:34.049
there and
you have to think about a lot of things. Everything

00:55:34.049 --> 00:55:38.109
from the minds eye. In
this case, that brightness -- that lake behind

00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:41.400
the marmot
makes it pop out. That green above it gives

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.750
it a place of space as
well as visual depth. Gives it a, for you,

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:51.089
visually a place to
anchor and see. All of those elements of the

00:55:51.089 --> 00:55:54.579
way our eye
works are all basically the same. So you have

00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:57.499
to think about
what's light and bright and what's sharp.

00:55:57.499 --> 00:56:00.269
The two main
things the mind's eyes goes to and then use

00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:03.839
those to either bring the eye to the subject
or make sure they're not in the frame so the

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:06.759
eye is not pulled away from the subject. Shooting
video or

00:56:06.759 --> 00:56:10.779
stills, that basic premise is in there. Next
I think all

00:56:10.779 --> 00:56:14.161
the exposure, okay? Exposure to me equals
emotion. It

00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:19.429
doesn't equal histogram. Doesn't equal blinkies.
Doesn't equal anything except the emotion

00:56:19.429 --> 00:56:22.890
you want to
express the moment you go click. In my way

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:27.079
of looking at exposure and looking at light
is vastly different from other photographers.

00:56:27.079 --> 00:56:29.680
I don't look at those
mathematical things. I look at those things

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.569
that are
important. How do I grab your heart strings

00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:37.260
and make
things happen. Because not many of you are

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.130
going to get
up there. You're not going to sit 14 hours

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.890
on a rock on
a hillside looking for something. And more

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:46.920
than likely you
won't have the opportunity to see these guys.

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.599
They're
saying by 2050, they'll blink out. They'll

00:56:50.599 --> 00:56:55.900
be gone. It's
my son three days of walking up those hills.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.539
We did
survive. It was kind of an amazing time up

00:56:58.539 --> 00:57:02.489
there. And
that's what's waiting for anybody who wants

00:57:02.489 --> 00:57:05.049
to venture
with their heart and a camera into any part

00:57:05.049 --> 00:57:08.859
of our globe
and bring it back and share it. That's the

00:57:08.859 --> 00:57:14.380
important
part. Anybody have any questions? Yes, sir.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:18.799
Got to go
to the mic.

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:23.839
&gt;&gt; Male #5: I was just wondering how you feel
about HDR

00:57:23.839 --> 00:57:27.099
photography or also kind of doctoring a photo
in photo

00:57:27.099 --> 00:57:29.170
shop whether that ruins authenticity.

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:32.119
&gt;&gt;Moose: Photographers love controversy. I
guess that's the

00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:34.730
human nature thing right. Well, first of all,
comes the

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:36.930
photoshop when it comes to my critters, they
never see

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:40.769
photoshop. What you see is what I shot, period.
And I

00:57:40.769 --> 00:57:43.509
don't crop no matter what it is. What you
see is what I

00:57:43.509 --> 00:57:46.289
saw in my view finder. This is my own personal
standard.

00:57:46.289 --> 00:57:48.819
Has nothing to do with anything that is right
or wrong or written down in

00:57:48.819 --> 00:57:52.029
stone. But when you're dealing with critters
or history

00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:55.950
or biology, as far as I'm concerned, that
click has to be

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:59.650
valid. And since it's going to science, that's
what I

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:02.539
have since day one. My landscape, my aviation
work --

00:58:02.539 --> 00:58:05.679
yeah, it sees photoshop. Kind of know it pretty
well can

00:58:05.679 --> 00:58:08.270
do whatever I can to bring in the elements
to grab your

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:12.989
eye and attention. HDR. HDR is HDR. Anybody
here know

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:20.589
when HDR was invented? 1898, all right? We
didn't

00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:23.079
invent it. We just made it simpler for the
masses.

00:58:23.079 --> 00:58:24.900
People didn't realize back in the day they
had glass

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.750
plates. They had a glass plate, one with the
clouds on it. And they take that

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.680
glass plate and they put it in their camera
and they take

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.900
the picture of the person and the person was
under

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:37.130
clouds. Well, glass plates have even smaller
exposure

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:41.039
range than digital. So HDR in many ways has
been around

00:58:41.039 --> 00:58:43.910
since the dawn of photography. And today,
if somebody

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:48.099
wants to do what I call “Elvis on Velvet”
and it makes them happy, rock on. Okay?

00:58:48.099 --> 00:58:51.979
Because this is photography. We're not curing
cancer.

00:58:51.979 --> 00:58:56.589
We're not creating world peace. It's photography,
okay?

00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:59.959
And why people have such dividing lines about
that. But

00:58:59.959 --> 00:59:02.359
you probably -- you're all too young to remember
things

00:59:02.359 --> 00:59:03.359
like aperture priority. You remember when
aperture

00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:07.229
priority came out? That was going to be the
death of

00:59:07.229 --> 00:59:09.640
photography. Everybody remember when auto-focus
came out?

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.609
That was going to be the death of photography,
okay?

00:59:11.609 --> 00:59:14.799
Digital came out -- death of photography.
HDR --

00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:17.940
seriously, it's just photography. So I don't
care. As

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:22.660
far as my own -- I've been part of the digital
HDR since

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.410
1998. But the way Kelby likes to explain mine
it's

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:29.269
realistic HDR. Camera can do 5 stops. But
5.1 you're

00:59:29.269 --> 00:59:32.519
going to see blinkies, okay? Instantly you
got to say

00:59:32.519 --> 00:59:36.059
that information I need it or I don't need
it. If I do need it,

00:59:36.059 --> 00:59:38.089
what tools do I have to bring that information
back. You

00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:40.860
have underexposure. You have split grad filter
And if you get

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.650
up to the 7 and 9 ranges, you got HDR. The
only way

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.219
you're going to be able to bring back into
that

00:59:45.219 --> 00:59:49.160
photograph the magic that our brain and eye
can communicate.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.249
And it's the tool we're all measuring against
is this

00:59:51.249 --> 00:59:55.460
thing. And cameras are the stone cold, computer
bastard that

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.499
doesn't want to get there because it has no
heart. So

00:59:57.499 --> 01:00:00.899
HDR is a great way to get there. Yes, sir.

01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:05.119
&gt;&gt; Male #6: You've always only used available
light in your

01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:07.079
wildlife photography or do you have a lamp.

01:00:07.079 --> 01:00:09.160
&gt;&gt;Moose: Love the complement. He wants to
know if I do

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.680
available light or something else. There's
a lot of

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.380
flash fill going on in the pictures you saw.
And I've

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.799
been using flash since the beginning. And
it's a very

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:20.210
important part again of compressing that exposure
so the

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.400
camera can see all that information. It's
part of it.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.359
And then, birds by their very nature. The
color in their

01:00:26.359 --> 01:00:30.480
feathers. It's the angle reflection, okay?
So their

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.599
whole feathers -- the way they all different
species are

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:35.779
is to show themselves off with all that color.
And if

01:00:35.779 --> 01:00:38.329
you want to show that color off with the photograph
and

01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:41.140
you only have one light source -- the sun
-- or no light

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.730
source, the flash is the way to do it. Yeah.
Yes,

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:45.730
ma'am.

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:50.200
&gt;&gt; Female #1: I realize this is more of a
question for the biologist

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.519
you work with, but the marmots -- not knowing
how many

01:00:54.519 --> 01:01:01.479
existed, anything about them -- what was learned
from the

01:01:01.479 --> 01:01:04.839
samples taken that couldn't have been learned
from a live

01:01:04.839 --> 01:01:07.890
capture with the radio collar and a blood
sample and

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:08.890
fecal sample.

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.619
&gt;&gt; Moose: That's a good question. What could
be learned from

01:01:11.619 --> 01:01:15.539
the -- well first and foremost it's called
money. So a

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:20.799
live capture. You're talking about minimum
one day 800

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:26.870
to 2000 dollars one person live capture, okay?
I don't know if

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.349
you know, but money is like tight and no one
gives a

01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:32.299
squat about Alaska marmots. So getting funding
just to

01:01:32.299 --> 01:01:35.002
go out for our three days of survey work to
do was

01:01:35.002 --> 01:01:39.181
impossible to do. That's the first real world
answer to

01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:42.859
that question. And then, the next -- having
a marked

01:01:42.859 --> 01:01:46.019
population works when you have a population
you can

01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:47.941
actually deal with. And you're talking about
critters

01:01:47.941 --> 01:01:50.609
who for basically two and a half months out
of the year,

01:01:50.609 --> 01:01:53.180
other than that you can't get to them. So
that marked

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.239
population isn't going to work. Lastly is
technology. When

01:01:57.239 --> 01:01:59.519
you're working with a critter that's living
in minus 30,

01:01:59.519 --> 01:02:04.380
minus 40, batteries in a portable device that
fits around the neck or implanted

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.400
in the abdomen, we don't have that kind of
viable

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.489
technology. So it's a lot of technical issues
as well as

01:02:11.489 --> 01:02:14.859
anything else. John James Adam Audubon. Anybody
know

01:02:14.859 --> 01:02:18.529
about the artist. John James Audubon. Anybody
know who he is? You know he

01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:24.089
shot everything he painted? Okay? It's a lineage
in

01:02:24.089 --> 01:02:27.849
science -- there's a recipe that, if you're
a scientist

01:02:27.849 --> 01:02:29.709
and you have to prove your point, you go,
“I went and

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:32.950
follow rowed this regimen and this regimen;
this protocol, this protocol” and

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:34.900
so, if you did all those things and you made
this

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:41.319
conclusion, then the logic and the facts can't
be argued so that must be accurate.

01:02:41.319 --> 01:02:44.710
So that's part of the science regime as well.
Like I

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:47.920
said, the number of specimens they have shot
is nothing

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.599
compared to the world population. And in this
day and time,

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:53.959
it's the only way we're going to get answers
especially probably

01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:57.789
in the period of time we have allotted to
us. Yeah. [female in audience comments off

01:02:57.789 --> 01:03:00.719
mic] I
know. It's a cute little thing that got shot.

01:03:00.719 --> 01:03:04.130
You'd be
surprised how many deer in the eastern Sierras

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:09.049
who are run over
every year because of our cars and that's

01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:11.880
not even in the
name of science. So it does seem cruel, but

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.779
that's the
process. And to be honest with you, if a scientist

01:03:15.779 --> 01:03:17.930
53
years ago had not sampled all those Collared

01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:21.509
Pica, if he
hadn't done that and those bone collections

01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:24.429
weren't in
the Smithsonian, Harvard, Yale, Berkeley.

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:28.099
If those
specimens weren't here for us to look at,

01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:33.059
there's no way that Hayley could have gone
now and said that bone changed.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:37.990
Everybody goes, “and there's proof”. So,
there's the flip

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:41.519
side too. Without that proof, that whole thing
would not

01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:44.979
have opened up and a whole another study of
science as

01:03:44.979 --> 01:03:49.549
far as climate change would have progressed.
So it's the

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:52.059
hard facts and then, yeah, I know it's cute
and it's dead,

01:03:52.059 --> 01:03:54.229
but there's a reason.

01:03:54.229 --> 01:04:00.229
&gt;&gt; Male #7: All right. I have two questions.
First one is you

01:04:00.229 --> 01:04:02.919
talk about knowing what the story you want
to tell when

01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:06.239
you take your pictures. How often does your
story

01:04:06.239 --> 01:04:08.079
develop while you're taking the picture while
you're

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:11.169
looking at the critter and how much is it
before you

01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:13.059
start climbing the mountain you know what
you want to

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:14.059
shoot.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:16.809
&gt;&gt; Moose: That's a a great question. I, first
of all, do all the

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:20.109
homework I can on anything I'm about to work
on. So I have

01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:23.869
a basic idea about what I want to photograph
and how I

01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:26.169
want to say it. Now, do the photo gods always
provide it

01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:30.200
and does mother nature always cooperate? No.
You know

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.910
going out and getting skunked is a big part
of it.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.369
That's why I went out and sat on a rock 14
hours. That's

01:04:36.369 --> 01:04:39.241
part of the process. When everything does
fall into place

01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:42.019
like you hope it will, then most of the time
my

01:04:42.019 --> 01:04:45.499
preconceived ideas of how I'm going to tell
a story will fall

01:04:45.499 --> 01:04:48.630
into place. That's what allows me to go up
a mountain

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.789
with just the minimal camera gear I need to
get the

01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:54.039
job done for example because I don't walk
up the hill

01:04:54.039 --> 01:04:57.180
with a backpack full of gear. Not only does
it beat your

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.519
down, but by the time you get up there, it's
so clumsy that

01:04:59.519 --> 01:05:02.160
you're probably going to scare something off.
So it's

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.410
very much part of the process. At the same
time, solving

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:07.369
problems is very much a part of photography.
You got to

01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:09.479
be able to do it.

01:05:09.479 --> 01:05:11.119
&gt;&gt; Male #7: The other question is which organization
have you

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:15.719
found to be effective in helping us preserve
the wild

01:05:15.719 --> 01:05:16.719
heritage we have.

01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:20.739
&gt;&gt; Moose: Can we turn off the camera for a
second? I'm kidding.

01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:25.119
Be serious, very few. They all have a good
heart. But

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:28.400
the word compromise is not in the system.
It's just not

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.529
out there. And it's very disheartening. A
lot of times

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.669
the information -- I work a lot behind the
scenes

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:40.160
anymore. And it's very disheartening, because
no one can

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.589
compromise. It's like I want to grab them
and go,

01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:45.250
do you realize things are
disappearing while you argue over this?”

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.660
Seriously. We
can compromise. You don't have to lock everything

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.289
up
behind walls. We don't have to bulldoze it

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:54.459
all either.
There's a lot of avenues proven, you know,

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:57.900
in the data
that would work. And compromise is difficult.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.369
Well, I
know it's getting around the time. I'll just

01:06:00.369 --> 01:06:02.099
leave you
with one last thing. I showed you some of

01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:06.689
my aviation
work, showed you some critters. I also do

01:06:06.689 --> 01:06:12.430
that thing called landscape
photography, which when you're out photographing

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:15.309
critters, you can't help but see some of the
most amazing spots on

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:18.919
this planet. And often we sit on a rock for
14 hours.

01:06:18.919 --> 01:06:22.079
Something good tends to happen out there.
And that's

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:25.299
kind of what generates my landscape photography.
I just

01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:29.089
want to leave you one last note that you can
make a

01:06:29.089 --> 01:08:16.890
difference.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:10:04.680
[silence]

01:10:04.680 --> 01:11:52.480
&gt;[Applause]

01:11:52.480 --> 01:13:42.100
&gt;&gt;Moose: I want to thank Cliff and Mike for
having me here and

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.900
I'll be around if you have any questions.
Have a great weekend

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.969
folks.
