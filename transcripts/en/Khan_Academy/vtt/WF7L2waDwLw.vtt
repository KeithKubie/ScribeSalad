00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.520
We're asked to subtract,
simplify the answer and write

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.710
as a mixed number.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.170
So we have two mixed numbers
here, and like when you're

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.300
adding mixed numbers, you
can do it two ways.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.370
You can either turn both of
these into improper fractions

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.480
and then subtract, or you can
subtract the whole number part

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.470
and then the fraction part,
so let's do it that way.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.100
So just to remind ourselves,
5 and 5/8 is the exact same

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.280
thing-- let me write it here
in yellow-- as 5 plus 5/8.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.240
These are the exact
same thing.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.640
And subtracting-- let me write
this subtraction sign in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.230
blue-- and then we're
subtracting 2 and 1/5, but 2

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.390
and 1/5 is the exact same
thing as 2 plus 1/5.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.710
That's what 2 and
1/5 really is.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.540
Now if we're subtracting, that
means we have to subtract 2

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.360
and we're subtracting the 1/5.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.410
Distributive property.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.330
We're subtracting
both of them.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.690
So we get 5 plus 5/8, and then
we distribute the negative

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.010
sign, minus 2 minus 1/5.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.440
And now we can rearrange it.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.090
We can say this is the same
thing as-- let me do it in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.270
orange-- as 5 minus 2, that's
the whole number parts, and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.330
then you have plus
5/8 minus 1/5.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010
Now, 5 minus 2, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.120
That's just 3.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.820
But what's 5/8 minus 1/5?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.720
Let's do that over here.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.930
So we have 5/8 minus 1/5.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.700
Now, just like when you're
adding fractions, when you're

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.950
subtracting fractions, you
have to have a common

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.370
denominator.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.000
8 and 5 are not the same
denominator so we have to find

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.940
the least common multiple
of these two numbers.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.850
If we do a prime factorization
of 8, you get 2 times 4.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.750
4 is 2 times 2.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.620
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.390
That's if you break it down into
its constituent primes.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.180
5 is just 5, because it
is a prime number.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.180
So the least common multiple of
8 and 5 has to have a 5 and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.350
three 2's in it.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.380
Or another way of saying it, it
has to be 5 times 2 times 2

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.900
times 2, which is the same
thing as 5 times 8.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.680
So the least common multiple is
going to be-- because these

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.900
guys share no common factors
other than 1 really.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.850
The least common multiple is
just going to be 8 times 5.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.790
So the least common multiple
is going to be 40.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.970
It's going to be 40.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.510
Now, to go from 8 to 40, you
have to multiply by 5.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.970
Then we have to do the same
thing to the numerator.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.690
If we multiplied 8 times 5,
we have to multiply 5

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.790
times 5 to get 25.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.420
So in either case, we're
multiplying times 5, the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.290
numerator and the denominator.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.840
Now, to go from 5 to 40, we have
to multiply by 8, so we

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.780
also have to do that for the
numerator, so 1 times 8 is 8.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.710
So now we have 25/40 minus
40/40, which would be equal

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.420
to-- we're going to have
40 as the denominator.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.860
25 minus 8 is 17.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.350
So 5/8 minus 1/5, which is the
same thing as 25/40 minus

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.260
8/40, is equal to 17/40.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.790
And 17 is a prime number so it's
not going to share any

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.400
common factors with 40, or at
least 40 isn't divisible by 17

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.140
either, so this is as simplified
as we can get.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.590
So this part, the fraction part,
is 3 and the fraction

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.150
part is 17/40.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.960
And we're done.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.040
And this worked.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.250
We were able to separate this
out and do it pretty

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.380
straightforward, because in this
situation, the fraction

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.530
part that we're subtracting from
the other fraction part

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.350
was smaller.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.430
If it was larger, it would've
gotten a little bit messy.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.460
Maybe we would have ended up
with a negative number and we

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.650
would've done all this other
stuff, so that's why sometimes

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.880
it's easier to go straight
to an improper

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.770
fraction for both of them.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.240
But in this case, it worked
out doing it this way.
