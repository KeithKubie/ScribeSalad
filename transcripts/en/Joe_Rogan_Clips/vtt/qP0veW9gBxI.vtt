00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.520
The Joe Rogan experience.
Do you have anything in this book about the Omex?

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.360
No,
not really.
Um,
I,
I mentioned,
I mentioned them briefly.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.340
I explored the old Mac mystery,
uh,
in considerable depth.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
Could you explain that to people that maybe in the fingerprints of the gods?
Yes.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.920
So it's considered to be the earliest high culture of Central America.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.160
Everybody's heard about the Aztecs,
everybody's heard about the Maya.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.510
But before the Aztecs and before the Maya,

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
there were a culture who are referred to as the old Mex.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
Again,
we don't know what they called themselves.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.610
That's what the Aztecs called them.
They called them the old Mexican.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
It means the rubber people because they see a rubber producing area of,
uh,

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.803
of Mexico.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.170
They worked in a giant megalithic constructions that what they're most famous

14
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.260
for is these huge carved human heads,

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.270
which can be on a scale of up to 20 to 25 tons in weight,

16
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.160
uh,
and,
and which have curious features which have been interpreted variously as

17
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.790
Polynesian African don't look like classic,
uh,

18
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.510
native American features.
But one of the things,

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
one of the things I've realized is that there is no classic native American

20
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.310
feature that that Nate native Americans are a very,

21
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:24.580
have a very complex genetic story with very many different elements,
uh,

22
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.830
brought into it and we shouldn't be necessarily surprised by the supposedly non

23
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.210
native American look of these Ahmed.

24
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.720
What do we think those helmets were that they were wearing?

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.790
Nobody knows because no physical example of such a helmet has ever been found.

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.730
Just like no physical example of an Egyptian Pharaohs Helm,

27
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
a crown has it has ever been found.
All we see is the stone,

28
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.040
the stone reproductions of them do.

29
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.240
They're universally wear these helmets in the sale.
They,

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.090
they pretty much all wear these helmets in,
in,
in,
in the ohmic stonework.

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.590
There's another fascinating figure from La Venta one,

32
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.450
one of the Omex sites,

33
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:05.451
which is the earliest ever image of a plumed or feathered serpent.

34
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.830
The feathered serpent is a famous icon in Central America.
Quotes,

35
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.520
I'll collateral who's the god of peace,
the bringer of civilization,

36
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.910
who is associated,
for example,
with the famous pyramid of,
of cuckold con,

37
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.170
which is just another name for quotes,

38
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.440
all collateral at Chichen eatsa where on the spring equinox or a shadow effect

39
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:30.330
creates the image of a serpent coiling down the stairway and joining with the

40
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.270
carved head of the serpent or the bears,
the image from La Venta.

41
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.420
That's the earliest image of a plumed serpent,
uh,
in the Americans.

42
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.300
And sitting in the middle of it.

43
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.420
And I made a big deal out of this cause I think it is a big deal in magicians of

44
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:46.200
the gods sitting in the middle of it is this human figure who's holding this

45
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.600
strange bag in his hand.

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840
And it's just a fact that those identical bags are found in ancient Sumeria,

47
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.380
in the hands of individuals who were considered to be civilization bringers.

48
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790
And they also show up on pillar 43 at Gabelli tappy,
uh,

49
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.090
I call the man bags.
Uh,
and in that case that go back to Tempe,

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.440
we know they're at least 11,000,
600 years old.

51
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.260
So I wonder if we're looking at a sort of badge of office of a group of

52
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.100
civilizes who traveled around the world trying to bring back to life at loss.

53
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.000
When I interrupted you talk about quartz or quad or what were you about to say?

54
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.690
I can't remember.
I'm in California.
I had been smoking dope.
You know,

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.480
we were talking about different things in the Amazon.

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.440
Should we rewind and figure out what we said,

57
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.450
the serpent guy you were talking about before?
Quite so quantum before that.
Um,

58
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.920
I have another question.
The omex did you,

59
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.960
you were talking about the genetics of these,
um,
uh,

60
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
people that live in native Americans that they vary widely,

61
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.670
but the Omex seemed to have very similar features,
the thick lips and noses.

62
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.910
Why do we think that is?
Well,
this is part of,
uh,

63
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.030
a curious mystery that is not unconnected to the genetic mystery.

64
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.660
Uh,
it's been known by archeologists for quite a long time,

65
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.210
that there are anomalous skulls,
uh,

66
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.880
in parts of Brazil,

67
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.540
which appear to show a very strongly Polynesian or African features,

68
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.850
very much like the features that we see on the,
on the old mech heads.

69
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.270
And a number of archeologists who got into trouble with their colleagues for

70
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.910
this have used that to argue many years ago,
30,
40 years ago,
that,

71
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.990
that the settlement story of the Americas is much more complicated than we've,

72
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.440
you know,
than we,
than we've realized.
And,
and what the,

73
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.650
what the DNA is doing is it's telling us that there was something really weird

74
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.540
happened,
happened with settlement.
They see what happened with those,
um,

75
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.080
African or Polynesian looking skulls was that they were tested for Dna,

76
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250
uh,
when DNA technology was not as advanced as it is today.

77
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.050
And what that DNA showed was that they were more closely related to modern

78
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.650
native Americans than they are to any other people in the world.

79
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.880
So the notion that there was some connection with Polynesia or Africa was

80
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.743
dismissed,

81
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.960
but now that we have very firm evidence of an Austria lazy and genetic signal,

82
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.430
Aussie Australian aborigines,

83
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.930
Papua New Guinea Melanesians with those kinds of features now that we had the

84
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:24.870
genetic evidence that that is found in the Amazon,

85
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.440
we have to go back to that old evidence and and reconsider it.
Wow.
Yeah.

86
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.640
I would love to find out what that is.
They've always fascinated me.

87
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.420
The OMEX,
it's always been such a strange image.

88
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.480
The the large heads with helmets on them.

89
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.080
And how do they universally look like that?
I mean all the,

90
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.840
all of the features are very,
very similar.
Very,

91
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.410
very similar always and almost always I won't,

92
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.320
I won't claim that every single on that cared has a helmet on it.

93
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.930
Cause I think I've seen one that didn't,

94
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.760
there's quite a while ago since I explored the,
the Olympic area.

95
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.800
But what's fascinating about them is they are,

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.610
they are supposedly the first high civilization of Central America that they

97
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:09.110
create structures on the massive scale that you can see connections between
them.

98
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:10.700
And the later,
the later Maya,

99
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.510
that whole mystery of the Mayan calendar was clearly inherited from the Omex.

100
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:18.410
It wasn't something that Maya made up.
The old mex used that same symbolism.

101
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.770
So the Mayan calendar is actually an all Mac calendar,

102
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.010
and if we then consider the possibility that that all makes,

103
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.610
may just be the latest that the earliest surviving manifestation of that

104
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.130
calendar,
it could go back much further than that.

105
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
