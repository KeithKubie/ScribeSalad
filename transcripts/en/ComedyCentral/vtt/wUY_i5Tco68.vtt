IF YOU ANSWERED YES,

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.040
YOU'RE PROBABLY CARICATURE
ARTIST GREG DOHLEN.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.376
HE WAS THE ONE THAT DREW IT.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.612
AND AFTER TWO DECADES
OF DOING CARICATURES,

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.047
HE HAS YET
TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.249 line:0%
 
- IT'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.683 line:0%
 
AND I'VE KIND OF--

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.352 line:0%
 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE '89.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.621
- BUT SOMETIMES
THE SOLUTION IS AS SIMPLE

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.756
AS KEEPING UP
WITH THE TRENDS.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.725
- YOU DREW ME HERE.
- YEAH.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.193
- IT'S ENJOYABLE
TO SEE YOURSELF

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.895
PORTRAYED AS A CARTOON.
- YEAH.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.531
- BUT I DON'T THINK
IT MAKES ME LAUGH.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.700
CARICATURES
ARE INSULT COMEDY.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.269
- WELL, YEAH.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:36.937
- IN THE CATEGORY
OF INSULT COMEDY,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.939
JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S
CURRENTLY POPULAR RIGHT NOW,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.774
HERE, JUST WATCH.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.477
- I LIKE YOU, JASON ALEXANDER.
I FIND YOU SEXY.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.112
KISS ME, YOU FAT [bleep].

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.647
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.615
WHAT JERRY SEINFELD'S
[bleep] TASTES LIKE.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.051
- I SHOWED HIM A CLIP
OF THE WILDLY POPULAR

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.653
<i>COMEDY CENTRAL ROASTS,</i>

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.289
WHICH PROVED THAT TO BE
A HIT IN INSULT COMEDY,

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.291
THE MEANER YOU ARE,
THE BETTER.

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:58.592
THE PLAN:

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.595
TO RE-BRAND GREG
AS "THE KING OF STING."

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.065
- UM, I'VE GOT--I'VE GOTTEN
MORE NEGATIVE REACTIONS

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.936
FROM GOING EXTREME
THAN POSITIVE REACTIONS.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.771
- NO ONE LIKED ELVIS
WHEN HE FIRST CAME OUT,

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.905
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.473
PEOPLE WERE OFFENDED.
- RIGHT.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:14.975
- BUT YOU HAVE
TO POWER THROUGH THAT

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.610
IF YOU WANNA BECOME BIG.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.513
AT FIRST, GREG SEEMED
RESISTANT TO THE CONCEPT.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.148
BUT AS WE STARTED
BRAINSTORMING IDEAS...

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.850
- YEAH, IT MIGHT BE FUNNY
IF HE'S CHINESE,

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.918
AND I MAKE HIM A PHOTOGRAPHER
WITH THE BIG BUCK TEETH.

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.353
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.121
- LITTLE SQUINTY EYES
AND BIG BUCK TEETH.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.289
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.091
HE QUICKLY BEGAN
TO EMBRACE IT.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.660
I LEFT HIM WITH A FEW EDGY
CONCEPTS OF MY OWN TO WORK ON,

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.429
AND HE STARTED
SKETCHING THEM OUT.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.498
THE NEXT DAY, I RETURNED
TO SEE THE RESULTS.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:41.435
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
THE IDEA I HAD FOR A COUPLE,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.103
AND YOU HAVE TO DRAW A COUPLE.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.671
SO THAT'S YOU, THE ARTIST,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.540
UH, DOING THE WOMAN
OF THE COUPLE FROM BEHIND,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.776
DOGGY STYLE,
SHE'S SAYING, "I LIKE THIS."

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.146
HER BOYFRIEND IS LOOKING
AT A HUMMINGBIRD'S PENIS

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.982
AND THINKING, "THAT'S HUGE."

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.017
YEAH, THIS IS GOOD.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.552
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:03.457
THIS IS, UM, YOUR VERSION
OF AN ASIAN BUSINESSMAN.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.829
UM, DO YOU THINK
THIS ONE, UH...HMM...

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.398
- SEE, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SURE, UH,

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.833
WHEN YOU PRESENTED
AN ASIAN PICTURE

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.301
WHICH DIRECTION
I SHOULD GO WITH IT.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.736
I WENT ALL DIRECTIONS REALLY.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.738
WE COULD TRY IT OUT,
SEE HOW IT GOES.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.373
- SURE, YEAH.
I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA GET--

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.175
YOU KNOW, IN ART, YOU KNOW,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.643
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
IN PEOPLE'S WAY OR ANYTHING,

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:24.678
SO I'M NOT GONNA--
BUT, YEAH.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.480
I MEAN,
THIS IS DEFINITELY--

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:29.750
I MEAN, THE PEARL HARBOR THING
IS ALMOST NOT EVEN A JOKE.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.818
THE REST OF GREG'S NEW EDGY
CARICATURES LOOKED GREAT,

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.987
AND I COULD TELL THAT
HE WAS READY TO TRY THEM OUT

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.223
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.098
- DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.501
- I LIKE TO BIKE
AND SURF A LOT.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.437
I LIKE SWIMMING, DEEJAYING,
PLAYING THE TROMBONE.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.545
- THINGS WERE OFF
TO AN OKAY START,

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.114
BUT I GOT KIND OF WORRIED
WHEN AN ASIAN MAN SAT DOWN.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:05.719
- I DRAW CARICATURES THAT ARE
A LITTLE MEAN AND EDGY.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.120
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:08.956
- DEFINITELY.
- YEAH, OKAY, GOOD.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.798
HOW'S THAT?

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:20.267 line:0%
 
YOU LIKE IT?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.635
- YEAH.
- OH, GOOD.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.904
- BUT I WAS WRONG.
THE GUY LOVED IT.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.874
YOU LIKE IT?
- YEAH, YEAH, I LIKE IT.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.510
- AND FROM THEN ON,
IT WAS SMOOTH SAILING.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.719
- OH, NICE, MAN.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.121
- WILL THAT WORK?
- THAT'LL WORK, DUDE.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.128
[both laugh]

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.734
- GREG WAS HITTING
NOTHING BUT HOME RUNS,

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.703
AND IT WAS AMAZING
TO WATCH HIM WORK.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.511
- OH, NICE.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.225
[laughter]

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:24.097
- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
IT ALL WENT TODAY?

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.499
PEOPLE LAUGHED.
I SAW PEOPLE LAUGHING.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.167
- PEOPLE LAUGHED.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.469
LIKE, THE DEEP SIDE
OF PEOPLE'S HUMOR COMES OUT

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.338
WHEN YOU SHOW THEM SHOCK.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.073
- YOU KNOW, AT THE BEGINNING
OF ALL THIS,

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.942
I HAD YOU DRAW ME,
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.811
SO NOW WITH EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE TAUGHT YOU,

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:42.182
I'M SAYING GO AS HARD
AS YOU WANT ON ME,

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.350
AS MEAN AS YOU WANT.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.651
- YOU WANT THE KING OF STING?

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.353
- I WANT THE KING OF STING.
- OKAY.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.988
- 'CAUSE I WANNA LAUGH.
- OKAY.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:07.040
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS FUNNY,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.077
BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO SEE MY GRANDPA

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.513
DEPICTED IN THAT WAY.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.715
HE'S A CANADIAN WAR HERO,

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.350
AND HE'S, LIKE, A VERY--

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.219
HE HAS, LIKE, A VERY IMPORTANT
ROLE IN OUR FAMILY,

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:21.221
SO I DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
DEPICTED LIKE THIS.

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:24.258
IT JUST--

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.494
IT WAS A REAL SHAME THAT
GREG CHOSE TO END THE DAY

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.062
ON SUCH A TASTELESS NOTE.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.064
BUT REGARDLESS
OF MY FEELINGS,

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:33.734
HE TRULY WAS
THE KING OF STING.
