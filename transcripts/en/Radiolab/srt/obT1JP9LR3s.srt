00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and
I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,210
the podcast hugged podcast. And one of
the things that we do on this program,

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:10,870
of course, look at big ideas, try
and figure out how the world works.

4
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:15,490
And to do that, we often
talk to scientists who are,
you know, asking questions,

5
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:18,490
doing experiments, giving
us data and statistics.

6
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:22,150
But there are some questions that
science just can't get to. Well,

7
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:22,990
this just holy week.

8
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:26,470
So there's Easter being celebrated
and then we're going to hear over.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,690
And so it seemed like inappropriate time
to not ignore the fact that for most of

10
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:32,111
the world's,

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,111
some of the deepest and the
most unknowable questions
are examined through Bible

12
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,830
stories. That's right. And Robert,

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,350
this is a sermon that you
gave it a synagogue, right?

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
It's my attempt to try to reason to try
and make sense out of one of the darkest

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,050
and most difficult stories, ways that
humans have ever told each other.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,650
The chapter in the Bible begins with
the question. It's only one word, long.

17
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:02,090
One word. Abraham was at home with
his family, his surfing, his wife.

18
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:03,560
We don't know what he's
doing at this moment.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,700
The story doesn't say it's probably
an ordinary day and day in his life.

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,280
And suddenly Abraham hears a
voice and the voice says to him,

21
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:18,140
one word, Abraham and
Abraham answers, here am I.

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,000
This is not just a voice.
This is the voice of God.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,110
The Bible says God,

24
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:28,580
the creator of the universe calling
down to one man calling to Abraham,

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,900
not for the first time, not at
all. When Abraham was younger,

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,530
God appeared to him and told him to
leave his home, which Abraham did.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,330
And then God told Abraham to go
to a strange land, which he did.

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,590
And then God and Abraham exchanged
promises and had a covenant together.

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,540
And God told Abraham to send his first
son Ishmael away into the desert,

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,220
which Abraham did.

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,440
And God told Abraham he had a plan to
destroy the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.

32
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,790
And this time Abraham argued with
God and they went back and forth.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,631
Abraham and God,

34
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:06,380
can't we save those cities or some
people in those cities or anyone in those

35
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:10,460
cities? And later God sent angels
to tell if the coming of Isaac,

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,320
so it was not completely out
of the ordinary. It wasn't.

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:17,240
I get down on your knees miracle when
God came to where Abraham was and asked

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,930
Abraham and Abraham answered, here am I.

39
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,410
It was just the start
of another conversation,

40
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,130
another in a series
until the next sentence

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,160
with God's next utterance.

42
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,750
This conversation changes shape and
becomes like no other conversation in the

43
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:40,751
Bible like no other story in the Bible
like no other story because God says take

44
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:47,771
now thy son by an only son whom now love
is even Isaac and get the to the land

45
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:51,770
of Moriah and offer him there for a
burnt offering upon one of the mountains,

46
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:56,150
which I shall tell thee of now. Most
of us know the circumstances here.

47
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,781
The back backstory.

48
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,160
We know that when Abraham was a young man
living in Uber with his father and his

49
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,994
brother,

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,530
God came to him and told him that if he
left door and traveled west away from

51
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:09,490
his home, far from the places he
knew God would give him children,

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,240
and from those children would come and
mighty nation as numerous as the stars in

53
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:18,040
the sky. And Abraham obeyed and traveled
West and settled in a strange land.

54
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,030
And he waited for his first child, the
child who would spawn this mighty nation.

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,640
And Abraham waited and
he waited and he waited.

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,200
And his wife Sarah waited.
And nothing happened.

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,820
Nothing happened until Sarah
was very old and old woman.

58
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,290
Well past childbearing age.

59
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,920
And that's when three angels
appeared at Abraham's tent and said,

60
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,220
now is the time for Sarah to have the
baby. And Sarah said, oh, come on.

61
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,670
Even laughed out loud at
the craziness of that idea.

62
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,540
But in fact the baby was
born. Isaac was born.

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,130
His arrival was a little awkward because
there was already a boy in the house,

64
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,190
Ishmael, also Abraham son
by his servant, Hagar.

65
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,260
But God had his mysterious priorities.
And Ishmael was banned from the house.

66
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,080
And God made it clear that the
future of Abraham's people,

67
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,650
the seed of this great nation lay
not in Ishmael, the oldest boy,

68
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,280
but inside Isaac. So Isaac,

69
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:19,090
for the purposes of nation
building was Abraham's only son,

70
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,080
the one whom thou love
is even Isaac. But now,

71
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:27,230
years later on this day, now
that Isaac was almost a grownup,

72
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,170
now God says, take now thy son,
nine only son who that lovest,

73
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,530
even Isaac and get the into the land of
Moriah and offer him there for a burnt

74
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,220
offering. By which he
means a human sacrifice.

75
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,940
The Hebrew word is law, meaning an
offering which is totally consumed.

76
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,960
So Isaac is to disappear,
to be reduced to ashes.

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,820
This the boy who was to be
everything, one male be nothing.

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,420
And what does Abraham do
when he hears this command?

79
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:02,710
What does he say in the
story? He says nothing.

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,233
Instead it says,

81
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,350
and Abraham rose early in the morning
and saddled his ass and took two of his

82
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,090
young men with him and Isaac his son,

83
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,050
and he cleaved the wood for the burnt
offering and rose up and went under the

84
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:18,190
place of which God had told
him. He does not argue.

85
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,190
He does not question.
He does not hesitate.

86
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:25,150
He does what he's told
and he does it in silence.

87
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,670
It is hard to fathom really. How
could he not at least tell Sarah,

88
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,790
his wife that he's going where
he's going, why he's going.

89
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,790
He has to know that when she hears
Isaac has been killed by her husband,

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,800
if this is going to happen, if
it's really going to happen,

91
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:46,801
he has to know that it will be the single
most terrible fact of her life and of

92
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:52,390
their marriage. May Be Abraham is
hoping it won't happen. We don't know.

93
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,050
All we know cause he leaves early,

94
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,690
early in the it says maybe to
avoid being questioned by his wife.

95
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,130
Where are you going with the chop wood?

96
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:06,131
Why Isaac and Abraham and Isaac walk
side by side with the donkey and the two

97
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:11,150
servants heading to this place
that God had chosen in the text.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,790
They don't speak, at least not out loud.

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,340
So much of what happens in
this story happens in silence.

100
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,010
In silence. They walk for one
day, two days, three days.

101
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:28,340
On the third day he says
to his servants, stay here.

102
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,280
And I in the lad will go
yonder indicating the mountain.

103
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,860
And he puts the wood on to
Isaac shoulders and his back.

104
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,620
He takes out a knife and some hot
embers. And now the two of them,

105
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,850
the father and the son, they walk on
alone. And that's when Isaac stops.

106
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:45,620
And for the very first time he asks his
question, his heart rending question.

107
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,330
Father, he says, and Abraham
and shoes, here I am my son.

108
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,470
And Isaac asks, behold
the fire in the wood,

109
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,170
but where is the lamb
for the burnt offering?

110
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,720
And Abraham says,

111
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,620
God will provide himself the
lamb for a burnt offering.

112
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:08,220
My son and Isaac doesn't answer.

113
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,210
At least there's no answer in
the text. And the two of them,

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,510
they keep walking together.

115
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,630
Two Isaacs in dilation saying nothing.

116
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,070
Why no protest, no argument,
no questions. Why this quiet?

117
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,530
There are few silences in the Bible,
so troubling, so hard to understand,

118
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,060
but there is another one.

119
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,780
It's also in the Bible and maybe the
two silences speak to each other.

120
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:41,400
This other silence occurs
earlier in the story of Noah,

121
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,140
Noah and the RQ member.

122
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,430
The God sees too much wickedness in the
world and decides to destroy what he has

123
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:51,990
created except for one good and righteous
man named Noah and his family and a

124
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,010
collection of animals. Two of every kind
that Noah will gather on board a boat,

125
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,420
a big boat, the Ark.

126
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,640
So Noah builds the arc and he brings
all the creatures on board to buy two.

127
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,410
Actually few of them came in sevens,
but mostly it's to buy, to add on.

128
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,490
They come. There's a beautiful children's
book about this by the Dutch artist,

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,890
Peter's spear. It's gorgeously
illustrated in simple,

130
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:18,210
delicate line drawings with small
splashes of color and in spears book.

131
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,470
Then in my imagination,

132
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,170
Noah is kind and hardworking and
comfortable with animals better than

133
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,990
comfortable. He can handle them
and comfort them and tend to them.

134
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,730
He's a lover of living things

135
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,090
and then the rain starts and
Noah in Zooey, confusion,

136
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:40,530
rushing from Tamarind to baboons to us
sprays, feeding and caring and managing.

137
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:44,130
He looks out the window
and he closes the hatch.

138
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,630
Now's the time to batten down,

139
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:50,580
keep the living cargo dry and in Peter
Spirits version as the rain puddles

140
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:54,990
around the ship, as the clouds mount
up and darkened and flash promising,

141
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,320
annihilating rain, very quietly,

142
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,190
animals begin to appear
out from the forest.

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,510
They come down from the hillsides and
out of the ground and down from the sky

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,920
and they gather first. It's a little
group and then a large one by the arc,

145
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,040
but the big closed silent arc.

146
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,150
I mean you're not there
in two by two by twos. No,

147
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:22,140
they come in haphazard combinations.
Three drafts, seven gorillas,

148
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,720
30 Armadillos, then a Robin,
a panda, a dozen lionesses.

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,730
These are the animals who are
not going to travel on the Ark,

150
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,860
who are not going to be protected.
We're not going to live.

151
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,280
And together they stare up at the clothes
dark at the boat that contains the

152
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,870
survivors, the lucky one,
and there is no sound

153
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,090
in my imagination. And in spirits
book, you see them all so quiet.

154
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:57,390
Just the jaguars staring and getting
letter in the camels and the elephants in

155
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,750
the mice who had one could
argue, never been wicked,

156
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,160
who outnumber the humans on the planet
by hundreds of thousands, by millions.

157
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:09,161
They stand there silently accepting or
maybe just enduring this in explicable

158
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,293
end

159
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,910
and in the silence I imagine a chimpanzee
baby nuzzling its mother in the light

160
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,210
rain asking how long will it rain Mama?

161
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,370
Just as Isaac asks his father, where
is the lamb for the burnt offering?

162
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,020
Okay.

163
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,470
And there is no answer. A parent
can give to that question.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,050
There is silence

165
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,310
and the animals stand in the silence
and make no noise of protest.

166
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:44,260
They don't cry out. They just stand
there as the sea level rises in the drip,

167
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,190
drip, drippy, endless drip of
Lorraine is the fish, the Octopi,

168
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,980
the macro where they less guilty.
Why did they get to survive?

169
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,590
Maybe even thrive in an
expanded watery environment.

170
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:58,591
There there aren't any answers to these
questions and what of Noah tending to

171
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,980
his creatures, feeding them,
keeping them warm and dry,

172
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:05,500
caring for their babies and
nursing them and their sickness.

173
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,730
What would he have thought just
before he closed down the ramp,

174
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,320
when the slow tortoise or the last two
snails are a pair of lazy worms were

175
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:16,390
scuttled inside with Noah, the good man,

176
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,400
the righteous man looked out on all those
creatures all over the world settles

177
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:26,050
to death by drowning and starvation.
What did this righteous man say?

178
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,040
The Bible doesn't tell us it's safe to
conclude that he turned away and he said

179
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,843
nothing.

180
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,980
Had he closed the ramp and he walked
onto the ship and remained silent.

181
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,480
I imagine it was a pregnant silence,
but the Bible doesn't tell us.

182
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,580
Here's life. Life we're told is precious.

183
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:52,960
Life is dust touched by the breath of God
or life is chemicals that somehow know

184
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,880
to attach to each other chemicals that
link and bond and split and bind and

185
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,120
become a jellyfish. Pulsing
in the Sea of butterfly.

186
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,950
Flittering in a forest that can form
the shy gaze of a Fox pop ready to play.

187
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,660
That can become the glance of a boy
carrying wood. Who asks his father,

188
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,490
where is the lamb for a burnt
offering to take that boy,

189
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,540
that Fox, that butterfly
to extinguish that life,

190
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:24,370
that breath you would think would wound
the universe, would Payne the creator.

191
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,980
We know this pain.

192
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,710
I think of Abraham Lincoln down
at the war office in Washington,

193
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,820
D C checking telegrams from the front,
reading the names of casualties,

194
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,550
sometimes known to him of people
who'd been killed or wounded.

195
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,790
A newspaper correspondence
saw President Lincoln there,

196
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,850
watched him reading the list as he wrote
with bowed head and tears rolling down

197
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:49,600
his furrowed cheeks, his face pale and
land his heart heaving from emotion.

198
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,990
And when the president walked out of
the building, he was in such a daze.

199
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,400
He and I'm quoting, almost fell
as he stepped into the street.

200
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,160
A good man knows the weight
of hurt. When someone dies.

201
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,390
Abraham Lincoln sent other people's
children to kill and to die,

202
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:12,310
and when they died, he shared
their hurt. And this image,

203
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:15,730
the image of Lincoln in anguish
is our image of a good man.

204
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:20,200
That's what we admire, to have a heart
big enough to feel another's troubles,

205
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,660
to sigh with others, to cry with others,

206
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:27,340
to join their suffering or indifferent
circumstances when the occasion is right,

207
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,450
to laugh with them, to share their
joy and every so often to love them.

208
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,590
That's the best of all to step
out of our lonely cells. However,

209
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:39,820
briefly as the poet Paul Ceylon is
written at times when only the void stood

210
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:42,940
between us to get all
the way to each other,

211
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,180
that's the highest
expression of ourselves.

212
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,780
There's nothing more sublime between two
people, between parents and children,

213
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,660
between friends and for
those lucky few who feel it.

214
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,890
To experience it between man
and God and to feel the other,

215
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,130
to be touched, to be heard, to be loved.

216
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,550
And yet here in this chapter of the Bible,

217
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,770
in this moment between God and Abraham,

218
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,120
God who loved Abraham and
Abraham who loved God.

219
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,440
And if this is a love story,

220
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,830
this is the most twisted love
story you have ever heard.

221
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,190
A loving God wants to test
his favorite disciple,

222
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,520
the man who loves him the
most. And so he says that son,

223
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:25,360
the son I promised you that would be a
nation that would grow and multiply the

224
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,670
son. You and your wife
waited for all your life.

225
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:31,540
The Sun that was so improbable that
when angels came down and told Sarah,

226
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,350
a boy was on the way, she laughed.
That son, the one you nurtured,

227
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:39,460
promoted over the other boy, Ishmael,
the one who will be your future.

228
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,690
In spite of all the things I told you
what I promised, what you counted on,

229
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:46,960
what we agreed upon, I
want you to kill him.

230
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,190
Would you do that? And Abraham.

231
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,330
Father Abraham, who had
discovered this, God in his heart,

232
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,170
fought with his father, Terah
destroyed idols honoring other gods,

233
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,160
left home fought battles for God.
Abraham who had contested with God,

234
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:07,340
bargaining over the lives of
Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham,

235
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,180
here's this command from the God
that he loves and he doesn't argue,

236
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:14,360
he doesn't hesitate, he doesn't refuse.

237
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,270
His love is so great.

238
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:21,190
The sages say so powerful
that he saddles up.

239
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,060
He takes his son and walks
to mount Moriah in silence.

240
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,060
He doesn't say yes. He
just goes without a word.

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,190
What are we supposed to make of
this story? What's it telling us?

242
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,990
What kind of God would put his creation,
his favorite to a test like this?

243
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,960
And what kind of man would pass the test?

244
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,650
Here's a guy who wants a human sacrifice
as proof of devotion and a father who

245
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,020
would kill his son for God.

246
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,520
Both parties got an Abraham
turned devotion into murder.

247
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,070
Why doesn't Abraham say, why?

248
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,320
Why does a Noah say why and the sage,
you say, we should admire their devotion.

249
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:10,910
To which I say, I don't know
what is there to admire here.

250
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,783
[inaudible]

251
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,430
it's interesting to see what happens to
these righteous men, Abraham and Noah,

252
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,290
after they do as they're commanded.

253
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,020
When Noah rides out the flood and releases
his cargo back into an empty world to

254
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,330
start over, what does he do?
Well, he plants a vineyard.

255
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,980
He presses those grapes into wine
and he drinks. He drinks hard.

256
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,930
His children find him half naked
in a silent stupor. And Abraham,

257
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,700
he comes down from Mount Moriah and
returns to his servants and he heads home,

258
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,020
but not with Isaac.
Isaac is somewhere else,

259
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,160
not with his father.

260
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,120
The silence between them has deepened
Abraham returns alone to Sarah.

261
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,490
And what of Sarah? Well,
presumably she heard what happened.

262
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,250
It would almost happened, but
as soon as Abraham returns,

263
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,780
in the very next sentence of the
very next chapter, Sarah dies.

264
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,010
She dies and Abraham is alone and he
stays silent and Noah stays silent and God

265
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,230
says to Abraham, because of what you
were willing to do. The Bible says,

266
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,130
I know that thou art a God fearing man,

267
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,950
seeing that thou has not withheld
thy son, they only son from me.

268
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,840
And God goes on to promise Abraham that
he will multiply thy seed as the stars

269
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,860
of the heaven and in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed.

270
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,980
And to Noah, God creates a rainbow,

271
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,940
a sign that promises never to
destroy so much life again.

272
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,460
These stories describe remarkable men
who put their faith in God over their

273
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,400
deepest instincts, over
their horror of suffering.

274
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:50,820
And we're rewarded Noah with a
rainbow. Abraham with a blessed nation,

275
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,500
but at what price?

276
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,030
The thing that makes this story
so alive to me is the silence.

277
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,230
Abraham seeing nothing.
Noah saying nothing.

278
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,050
And I am a hunch about these men,

279
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:12,051
their silences look respectful or maybe
due to four fearful or maybe hopeful

280
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,690
that the suffering they were about to
allow it somehow be explained away or be

281
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,740
justified later on.

282
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,740
But I don't think of their silences as
acceptance or submission or an expression

283
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,720
of blind devotion. They were
says the Bible, good men.

284
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,520
And because they were good and
caring and above all human,

285
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,820
they could feel the suffering of others.

286
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,820
Like President Lincoln
did like good people do.

287
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,480
Abraham felt for the people
of Sudan and Gomorrah,

288
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,910
Noah for the animals that he
noticed and he cared for it.

289
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:45,870
And so I have to believe that beneath
their silence is barely contained,

290
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,280
was the furious roar
of two wounded, angry,

291
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:55,281
voluptuous human hearts filled
with questions and worry
an insult and wonder why

292
00:18:56,011 --> 00:19:00,730
my son? Why Isaac? Why slaughter so
many innocent creatures in a day lose?

293
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:05,430
Why is this happening? Why
is this necessary? I can't
do this. I need a reason.

294
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,190
I need an answer. I need to know.

295
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,550
And I believe Abraham and
Noah had those feelings,

296
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,360
but they had something
else too. They had a hope,

297
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,480
a deep hope, that beyond reason,

298
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,560
that beyond understanding that somehow
there was good in these terrible deeds,

299
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,860
that God is merciful in
ways we can't understand,

300
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,470
that we are not meant to
know or built to know.

301
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:33,471
And their hope barely just barely
contained their harbor and their anger and

302
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,273
their insult.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,720
But I have to think it was in both of
them a mighty struggle to smother what

304
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,501
their hearts felt,

305
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:44,250
to put their hope in a power that was
beyond their understanding because the

306
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:48,270
other part of being human and being a
good human beyond our capacity to love and

307
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,500
to care is that desire for
answers, for explanations,

308
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,850
a desire to know why,

309
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,250
and here I think is the key to this
story's power because all of us,

310
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,110
not just Noah and Adam,

311
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,450
all of us live with this paradox
to see things that seem wrong,

312
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,870
that seem cool and do
wonder, is there a logic,

313
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:13,980
a higher logic to explain what we
see and if we can't know that logic,

314
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:18,780
if we can just hope for it, hope
there's an explanation. Is that enough?

315
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,300
Can we live with the fact that we may
never know that all we have is hope?

316
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,020
Can we face the terrible silence of the
universe with just hope in God in good?

317
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,630
This is a powerful question. When
cosmologists study the universe,

318
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,540
they also tell a story,
a story about silence.

319
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,190
Their story says that everything we
are, all the particles, all the forces,

320
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,350
the duct tape of our
existence popped into being,

321
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:55,351
they say entirely by chance out
of agreed quiet out of nothing,

322
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,330
out of flux, a quantum flux.

323
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,850
Suddenly with a bang that made no
sound matter and energy appeared and

324
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:04,720
eventually formed.

325
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,290
Adams and the Adam stitch themselves
and the compounds and the compounds hung

326
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:13,150
around for a long time and spun themselves
into stars and then into planets and

327
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,520
seas and clouds and air and at sometimes
somewhere somehow maybe God breathe

328
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:22,270
life into those molecules or maybe the
molecules assembled themselves according

329
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,890
to some deeply rooted plan,

330
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,500
but cells beget cells and life began
on earth and maybe elsewhere and those

331
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:33,790
cells. Then we combined to form newer
and newer forms of life and for a long,

332
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,520
long time for billions of years,

333
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,500
sea dwellers and then land dwellers
and evergreens and flowers.

334
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,020
None of these creatures,
none of them had evolved.

335
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:46,930
The ability to appreciate
what was happening,

336
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,250
to have a feeling for the beauty and
elegance and chemistry around them.

337
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:55,450
To ask the question, why
are we here? Until very,

338
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,740
very recently say the
Darwinians life produced mind,

339
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,990
a creature with a brain who
could ask, where do we come from?

340
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,480
How are we made? Why is the rose
red? And what a lovely, velvety,

341
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,530
beautiful red.

342
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:16,531
So the universe at long last got and
appreciator after 14 billion years of

343
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,230
self-assembly,

344
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:25,180
we now have physicists and one way to
think of a physicist is to say that a

345
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:28,450
physicist is the Adam's way if
admiring themselves. After all,

346
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:32,740
a physicist is made of Adams and can say
what a good job those Adams have done.

347
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:36,880
But a human brain not
only appreciates beauty,

348
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,340
a human brain has a moral sense,
a desire for justice for good.

349
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,740
A human brain can suffer and love and
care and feel the suffering of others.

350
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,510
We may come from silence, but mind,

351
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,060
mind breaks. The silence of the
universe. Mind introduces meaning,

352
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,890
or at least the search for meaning.

353
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,120
Maybe this is in the master
plan because with our minds,

354
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:07,390
we can ask if love and
mercy are good things,

355
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,010
why are they missing so much?
At the time? Abraham can ask,

356
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,830
Noah can ask, and I can ask,

357
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,090
how dare you kill those
animals, all that innocent life.

358
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,350
How dare you ask a father
to que his son, his own son?

359
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,540
How dare you kill that boy in
Darfur and Treblinka and Baghdad?

360
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,590
I hope there's a reason.

361
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,880
I sometimes think there's a
reason for the life of me.

362
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,440
I can't think of what the reason could be.

363
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,440
I know enough of life to know that God,

364
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:45,140
you don't always send angels down to stay
the hand of the killer as you did with

365
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:48,170
Abraham. Sometimes the killer kills.

366
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,540
Often the killer kills and get
against that awful indifferent.

367
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,390
Somehow we survive and we hope,

368
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,900
which brings me to the last and the
most interesting player in this story to

369
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,020
Abraham's son, to the boy who was bound,

370
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,360
was tied to a rock while
his father stood above him,

371
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,210
holding a dagger ready to use that dagger,

372
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:14,840
ready to kill Isaac saw his father's eyes,

373
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,670
saw his father's will,
and then Isaac survived.

374
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,320
What was Isaac thinking when he went
down alone from mountain Mariah when he

375
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:30,830
walked into what was left of his long,
long life. He must have asked himself,

376
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,840
why was I tested? Why was
I spared? What's the point?

377
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,030
Am I an accident? Am I alive because
my father passed a test? What?

378
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,110
I'd be dead if he didn't pass the
test. Do I matter? Am I precious?

379
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,620
I don't know. I don't know.

380
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,270
So what do I do? I go on. I grow older.

381
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,850
I marry Rebecca. I have children
of my own. I make mistakes. I have,

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,870
I saved for my love for Jacob
and for Esau and for sunsets.

383
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,330
I hope that I'm here for a reason.
One day. It'll make sense. Sometimes.

384
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,430
I believe it does make sense. Sometimes.

385
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:14,030
Now I've seen cruelty
and I've seen kindness.

386
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,950
I hope the kindness wins, but
I don't think about it much.

387
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,910
I just hope in silence.

388
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,303
[inaudible]

389
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,610
[inaudible]

390
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,370
alright, well,
