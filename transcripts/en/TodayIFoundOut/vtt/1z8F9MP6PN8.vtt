00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.360
Adolph Arthur “Harpo” Marx was a brilliant,
delightful, completely original comedian.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.559
Any fan of the Marx brothers and the wonderful
movies (as I am) knows this.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.960
In the Marx brothers movies, Harpo played
a childlike character, a kind of ethereal

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.269
spirit who lived in his own world.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.840
He wore a curly wig, a big raincoat, a plug
hat, and he went around honking a big taxi

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
horn.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.869
And of course, he loved to play the harp.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.029
Harpo never spoke in the Marx brothers films,
existing as a happy-go-lucky mute in a world

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.550
of voices and sound.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.800
In real life, Harpo had a few childlike characteristics
too.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.260
For instance, he was a grown man who was completely
comfortable in public without clothing on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.260
(much like a young child.)

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.399
This is probably why there are more “Harpo
Marx naked stories” than any other comedian,

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.410
a few of the more amusing of which I’ll
presently share.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.140
The first Harpo naked story involves Harpo
and his brother, Groucho.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.699
Harpo and Groucho were going to attend an
all-male “stag party” in a hotel.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.350
As they entered the hotel elevator, they were
each carrying an empty suitcase.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.480
Why?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.140
As a gag, they thought it would be hilarious
to walk out of the elevator nude and surprise

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.140
the guys.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
Thus, they stopped the elevator and quickly
undressed and put all their clothes in suitcases.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
However, in their excitement, they pushed
the wrong floor number and walked in, completely

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.470
naked, to an all-women bridal shower.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.370
In the late 1920s, Harpo met the classic writer
Somerset Maugham.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.920
As Maugham was giving Harpo a tour of his
house, Harpo saw that Maugham had a swimming

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.860
pool right below his bedroom window.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.979
Inspired to go for a swim, and wanting to
take advantage of this excellent opportunity

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.880
afforded by the house design, Harpo stripped
off his clothes and leaped out the window

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880
into the pool.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.890
During this same period, Harpo was scheduled
to have dinner with the famed writer George

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.920
Bernard Shaw.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.829
Relaxing before the meal, Harpo was swimming
in the nude down on a beach, when he heard

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:46.829
voices up above him.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.049
He threw a towel around himself, climbed the
hill above and realized it was Bernard Shaw’s

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.049
voice he’d heard.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.350
Harpo put out his hand to shake the great
author’s, when Bernard Shaw got a mischievous

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.350
smile on his face and snatched away Harpo’s
towel, leaving Harpo standing au naturel.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
“From the first moment I met George Bernard
Shaw, I had nothing to hide,” quipped Harpo.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.679
When the Marx brothers were filming their
movie “Horsefeathers” in 1932, they were

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.800
shooting a scene featuring the movie’s big,
climactic football game.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.130
After several takes, the huge stadium crowd
of extras was growing restless and disinterested.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.950
“I’ll wake them up,” Harpo reportedly
said.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.370
He then proceeded to take off all his clothes
and ran laps around the stadium completely

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.400
in the buff.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.220
When the Marx brothers went to MGM Studios
to make movies in 1935, they had a hard time

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.720
getting in to see producer Irving Thalberg.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.350
Although they had scheduled meetings, Thalberg
kept them waiting outside several times and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.680
the boys got fed up.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.300
Thus, they decided to sneak in when he temporarily
left his office.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.570
When Thalberg returned, he discovered all
three Marx brothers (Harpo, Groucho, and Chico)

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.730
sitting naked on the floor of his office.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.530
Not just naked, the boys had started a little
fire in the fireplace and they sat roasting

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.790
potatoes over it.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.460
A good sport, Thalberg told them to get some
butter from the studio commissary, which Harpo

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.210
did, and they all ate the potatoes together.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.020
(It was not recorded whether Harpo put on
his clothes before going to the commissary.)

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.020
Incidentally, after this incident, Thalberg
reportedly never kept the boys waiting again.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.390
After Harpo married in 1936, he and his wife
Susan tried to adopt children.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.400
During one adoption process, the lady who
interviewed Harpo and his wife rubbed Harpo

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.560
the wrong way.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.920
He may have been offended by her anti-semitism,
but Harpo, uncharacteristically, was very

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920
angry.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.760
On the next scheduled meeting, she came to
the Marx household and rang the doorbell.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.710
Naturally, Harpo answered the door completely
naked, but with a bow tied around his manhood.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.930
For the record, though, the couple were able
to adopt four children, Minnie, Alex, Jimmy,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.930
and Bill.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.060
When asked how many children he was going
to adopt, Harpo stated, “I’d like to adopt

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.980
as many children as I have windows in my house.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.320
So when I leave for work, I want a kid in
every window, waving goodbye.”

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.840
In his later years, Harpo lived a happy life
of semi-retirement in palm springs.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.480
Harpo loved to play golf in the palm springs
heat (in fact when he died his ashes were

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480
sprinkled over the seventh hole’s sandtrap
at the Rancho Mirage golf course).

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.420
It should be noted, though, that his golf
routine was quite unusual, but fitting.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.170
The elderly Harpo loved to play a bit, then
strip off all his clothes and jump into the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.950
nearest palm springs swimming pool to refresh
himself from the desert heat.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.340
He’d dress himself again and play a few
more holes before repeating.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.120
Harpo’s Palm Springs neighbors, aware of
their aged uninvited “pool guest”, never

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120
complained.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.320
It seems everyone knew Harpo and loved him
for his unique eccentricities.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.859
Speaking of golf, one of Harpo’s goals towards
the end of his life was to make the first

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.449
naked hole-in-one.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.650
He would bring a bucket of golf balls, take
off all his clothes, and hit them, one after

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.650
the other, toward a hole.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.050
Unfortunately, in spite of his trying and
trying, he fell short (supposedly within a

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.760
foot on one shot) of achieving his naked golf
ambition.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.170
Mr. Rogers was a vegetarian.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.580
He didn’t smoke or drink or seem to have
any major vices.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.319
He also stayed married to the same woman until
his death; their marriage lasted 47 years.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.949
Why am I talking about Mr. Rogers in an article
about Harpo Marx’ propensity to drop his

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.009
drawers in public?

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.762
About the only even slightly “scandalous”
thing Mr. Rogers seemed to do (with an emphasis

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.320
on “slightly”), which he revealed in an
interview, was that he swam laps completely

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.710
in the buff nearly every morning of his adult
life at various clubs that allowed nude swimming

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.350
at certain times of the day.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.520
As to why exactly he did this instead of wear
a swim suit, this isn’t know, but it’s

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.250
thought it was simply because public swimming
pools nearly always used to require people

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.120
to swim in the buff due to the cloth commonly
used in old swimming suits having fibers that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.030
would clog up the pool filters (think wool).

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.979
Today, with modern materials and pool cleaning
systems this isn’t an issue, but perhaps

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.970
as he always did it as a young man, he simply
decided to continue as an old, despite it

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:51.919
no longer being necessary.
