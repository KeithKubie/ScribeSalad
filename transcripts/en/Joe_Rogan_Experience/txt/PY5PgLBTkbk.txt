Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Boom. Here we go. Yeah, buddy. Good to see you. Great. Good to be here. We were talking before the podcast about, uh, people who get mad when I have you on. Like as if you're some sort of a monster. You're a mean person. Like I didn't need her to say you're a New York Jew, you're snarky. You say funny things, but this idea that you're a Nazi or something like people have gotten soap. This is this ice breaker. Hey, by the way, why do people think you're nuts? Someone sent me, I don't read comments on Twitter, but someone sent me something like, you having this guy on today and I'm like, that is so hilarious. I go, this guy is, yeah, there's some shit you say. I don't agree with. Sure. You're very reasonable and very intelligent. Yeah. The last chapter of the book A's me arguing with the Nazi conversation folks.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       It's not bad. It's not bad. I talk that I, well, it's, it's kind of for them a religious thing, right? If someone is a sinner, you can't acknowledge that they have to be outside of the fort. That's a good way to look at it. That is what it is. You know what's interesting? It's, I know these people don't mean to do this. This is not their plan, but if you wanted to keep Donald Trump in office, the w the way the people that oppose Donald Trump are behaving is the perfect way to keep them in office. If you tell high schoolers if you smoke, you're parents are going to get upset and the teacher didn't get upset. That's the biggest question. Right? Right. Yeah. So you tell these kids, Hey, if you go to these websites and read these books, then your parents and the establishment and the teachers are all gonna be afraid of you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Well, sign me up. I mean, it's as simple as that. It's the same exact psychology and they're driving people to the fringe they are. And the the D platforming things fascinating. Because the way this stuff works folks, is when people get DDI platform. The first people that will get deep platform are people that you agree with getting d platformed. People like, you know, I'll go real Nazi. Like someone who's a, an avowed white supremacy, like yeah, d platform, that guy, and that's a little slippery because then it's like this guy's a suspected Nazi, or this guy is friends with a Nazi, or this guy hadn't rights. He on his show, this guy had a white supremacists onto this show. This guy had a guy who thinks it's okay to be white on his show and then it gets, it gets more, as it gets more and more progressive, it gets more and more preposterous, but it really is great.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       It's once you accept one grade, then you drop below in a little bit more preposterous and then that's acceptable and then a little bit more and then that becomes accepted. And it's a double standard between people who are Orthodox and people who are unorthodox. Barbara Walters sat down with Castro. She sat down with Kadafi, who's killed how many people? Yeah, that's fine. You could sit down with the murderers dictator if you're Kadafi. If you sit down with someone on a podcast with someone who has all point of views, that is somehow different. Well, it's a new thing, right? Platforming and d platforming and you put putting this guy on your platform like all this, this, this kind of communication is very new. I just didn't exist. No one was saying that to Mike Wallace. No, no one's saying that. As you're saying to Barbara Walters, that was my argument to the Damien's data and society lady.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       I said, Jesus, I said, Barbara Walters interviewed Fidel Castro. Does that make her a communist? Like all right, I interviewed Milo. Am I a gay conservative provocateur now? I don't think so. You need to go to a doctor for sure. I mean, what, what, what, what they, what they're trying to do is thanks to social media. They no longer have a monopoly and I don't mean they have just been like Orthodox thought isn't he left wing and right wing Orthodox thought no longer has a monopoly on the microphone. And that's very dangerous if you want to basically set the boundaries of what acceptable discourse is. Same thing with, forget politics. Look up music, right? If you want to say these are the co you shouldn't have lyrics like this. People shouldn't dance like this. They shouldn't, you know, dress a certain way. This is what they would like.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       I mean back in the nineties you remember they'd had the warning labels on cds and says this has explicit lyrics and that way Walmart could with clean hands say we're not being involved. Politics, we're following their rules. So that's what this data was society ladies trying to do. It's like, okay, I'm giving you target whatever company and excuse, these are the people you don't need to deal with. And then they could say, well, it's not up to us. We're looking at this from an external point of view. Well, and also my perspective on it is that there's certain subjects that I think that we can all agree we need to cover and we need to deal with in terms of laws and in terms of the way the government is run. But a lot of these disagreements aren't on that. A lot of these disagreements seem to be just on political ideologies and like liberal versus conservative ideologies.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       And people think differently. They have different styles of behavior and thinking. This is why like if you had a station that played hip hop and all of a sudden you just got a bunch of Aerosmith songs playing, he'd be like, what the fuck is this? This is not what I want. Get this off the station except for walk this way. That's good. Well the one with run DMC, that was one exception, but that that's sort of how a lot of people seem to be approaching conservative versus progressive thinking is it's like once you have this mindset, you don't want to hear other opinions as if they're going to influence you or if you don't like the way they sound, you don't like what they're doing and you want to get them off the channel. And this is what it seems like is happening with social media platforms, right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       Is that the social media platforms are like, we're a country station. We don't play heavy metal. Get that shit off our network. Like we are a progressive network. We don't play conservative. Get that stuff off. Well if they had said that we're progressive in that way, it's like a server that would be honest and fair, but they, the claim is no, we are banning people who are doing x, Y and Z. Yeah. And you know for people that are like, oh my God, they're talking about this again, two fuckers, listen, this is really important shit. This is going to decide how we, this is, this didn't exist before. Okay. And now it does. Now we have this unbelievable

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       ability to communicate and I'm enjoying it right now talking to you. Right? We're all enjoying it if you're tweeting about this or writing comments about this, but it's, if this really branches off into a one side get to do it and one side doesn't, we're going to have a fucking tremendous problem in this country. If you think that this problem that we have right now and it's, it's just starting to be an issue over the last couple of years. If you think that this is what this could escalate, it's like a serious conflict, which I mean almost like it's, it's absolutely reasonable to think that violence could come out of this. Well, the Trump presidency was the escalation before Trump. It was okay [inaudible] fake news with this left idea that like this, you know, this new sites of putting out lies your, if your point of view is different to mine, it's not just wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       It's illegitimate. Right? And a lot of people in that voting booth and said, you want an illegitimacy? Okay, I'm voting for Donald Trump for president and now he's in the White House. So for you to say that, if people to say that these ideas, you know, are evil and shouldn't be discussed, those are separate concepts. Cause even if you think they're evil, if from your point of view, it's in the White House, are you going to pretend this isn't the most powerful man in the world? It's, there's a big contradiction there, but one of the things progressivism offers many people is this idea of truth and certainty. Knowing you're one of the good guys and knowing you're in the majority and when you find that that is not always true. I think that caused some cognitive stress, you know? No, I would absolutely agree with that. I just think there's a real problem that's happening now with some of the accounts that I'm seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       Getting banned without reason, without reason, for things that are like parody accounts. Carpay docked them. So I interrupt you. He's the one who made this great meme during the state of the Union where he, ted, president Trump and all the, he said footage from the state of the Union of the Democrats looking pissed and he put it over the song. Everybody hurts, right? There's two minute video. It's a joke. It's fun, right? You could see on second life, you don't have to be Republican or Democrats to laugh at Saraf pluses. They got a copyright strike cause it's like you don't have the right to use the music. Trump had retweeted it. He put out another one, he just got suspended for a week. He did the video from my book. So they don't, here's the thing, if someone is a name, you can say, hey, delete this tweet. It violates our guidelines, right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       You give them warnings, you could call their manager. They don't do that. You're just vanished overnight. And there's something very Soviet about this because when they vanish you, your entire archives get managed to, and it's like, wait a minute, this person's bad and dangerous. Don't you want to show other people as an example of what to avoid? Like this will get you banned so you can modify your behavior accordingly. But what they want, apparently it looks like what they want is for everyone to be self censoring and to be afraid. And that way it's like, uh, instead of saying we're since, sure. Yes. It's like you made that decision on your own. Well, I know Trump has been talking about this now because it affects so many people that are supporters. Right. And he's, um, been discussing that the idea that these people need to abide by the first amendment and then there's your argument will either they're a private company, they can put on whatever they want and they

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       can decide whatever they want or they're protected by the first amendment. You know, I had Tulsa Gabber don the other day. She was running her love her. I love her too. And she's running. I asked her, do my Shushu wouldn't reply. Really? Yeah. Why? I don't know. She didn't reply. I don't know. Having that say on compound media, Guest Digital, Oh, you're already has digital. That's even more disgusting. And compound media. That's the problem. And all that good ways. It all the good ways. Listen, I love Lewis. I love all those guys are savages lose. She's probably like, oh fuck. I forgot I'm savage Jason. Like I'll have those guys. You know what I mean? I have officially gotten permission that the room we all recording. It's called the gas chamber. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. You could say that. I could say that. Yeah. You're alone. Yeah. Where you guys put that privilege.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       Yeah. That's privilege. Do Frivolous. Yeah. Yeah. Um, maybe she will, um, I'll, I'll look, tell her about it. But she was on her and I are besties, tele slash two by the time I really do respect the shit out of her. I really do. Um, you know, I'd love to call her madam president. I think that'd be dope. She's smart, man. She's, she's, she's so measured. I mean, she doesn't have all the answers. And some of the things that she says are things that you say, you know, I'm not sure we're going to, we're going to have to work to create more jobs. Like those kinds of, that kind of talk. It's like politician talk and I go, okay, well what would that mean? And we'll have to figure that out. And I, I think she's sincere, but these answers, you know, don't really exist.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       Like how to fix the inner cities. Like how to like, these are the like some that some of the big issues that you discussed. We talked about, um, like horrible neighborhoods that have always been harmed, right? Like, how was this? Like we're going to fucking Afghanistan trying to fix their, yeah. And we're not trying to fix Chicago, the south side Chicago. What's happening now? Why? Why are so many people getting shot? How come we can't fix it? It's funny. Back in the day they had something called slum clearance and the idea was if you tear down these old buildings and build new buildings, somehow the crime's going to go away. And this was a big nation. It's just like, yeah, it's the buildings fall fucking content houses, they have decades and decades of crack and bullets flying through them. That's so crazy. But she's great because she, my biggest issue is anti war.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Yes. At anyone for me whose first priority isn't let's stop killing people. Yeah. That I'm a fan of. Yeah. And she's also a veteran. Yeah. 16 years. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan. Um, but you know, I think, um, this country needs more, you know, we need a, we need real plans. We need like someone, we just, the way we engineer software systems, um, you know, search engines, operating systems for cell phones, they should engineers society. I mean we should really be looking at it in terms of the potential for prosperity opportunity, all these different things that we don't cover. We just sort of leave so much up to chance because we buy the, the bullshit that like, I mean, I think we all know at this point then not everyone's on an even playing field, which is not, but we don't think a lot of people know that. Well, they're fucking crazy. And that's the problem. Yeah. Yes, they're fucking, if you don't think

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       that being born in a crime or in a neighborhood with violence all around you and being exposed at an early age fucks your head up. I don't even mean that. I think the fact that said, admit that a lot of people aren't hardworking. Oh yeah, there's that too. And I like to say that out there as shocking to many people. It's like, yeah, some people are bad. Some people think that just because they show up at work and they don't want to, that they're working hard. Right. It's hard for them. You fucking, you just go lucky or you do the, you know what I read, that was one of the more hilarious things that I've ever heard of crazy progressive person. Right. If you are successful, it is because someone else got fucked over. That's so disturbing. But it's such a crazy way to look at it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       It's like, okay, somewhere down the chain already, if you have an iPhone, someone got fucked over that logic, right? No, no, no, no. The logic is someone had to work as a slave and Foxconn to make these fucking iPhones for like 15 cents a week or whatever they make over there. But if it wasn't making 15 cents a week, that slave would be dead. That's what they're saying. It's squirrely. Right. Cause, but yeah, but is that okay? Like when they go to third world countries and set up these sweatshops and uh, like I knew someone who had one and they were like doing fucking mental gymnastics to try to justify. And I was like, wait a minute, how much he paid his people and they were like, they were going to starve to death if it wasn't for us. Mike, are you sure they were there? Right? They were there.

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       They probably been there for thousands of years. Like where'd you go? Like Guatemala, where was it? Argentina? Like where are you said I'll give you two examples that are, maybe I can't speak to specific second world examples. North Korea, which has obviously my beat. Yeah, that's your beat. So there is a, um, a zone between north and South Korea where they work together. DMZ, motherfucker. No, but it's like this enrichment zone. And in your case all work together, right? So the North Korean has worked at the South Korea has kind of put it together. Oh. And the government takes like 95% of your money. And also North Koreans who work in Russia in logging camps where the government takes like 95% of your money. They're slaves. They're 100% slaves. But they're beating down their doors to work in these locations because they're providing for their family and they're still wealthier than the alternative.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Now, this is a very extreme situation. This isn't like, I don't know, third world what country your, your friend has a sweatshop in. But there are circumstances where a lot of people on the left and on the right don't understand often that politics and economics is about, often you have two bad choices. Like what is the alternative? It's like, what do you like? For example, you're going to put forth the law. What are you going to do about people who are going to look at this law? Not In good faith. Like there was that guy was named zoomies Judy who said, I'm trans and he just made a video break. Newbies. Zov Yeah, he just broke the woman's dead referees like, Oh man, here we go. By the way, they took those, uh, records away from that. An Australian woman that you see guy there was Australia, right? Wasn't the world. The power lifting woman's world records. She broke like three of them. So it's not even about trans stuff. It's like, what do you do

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       with any law when someone is going to act in bad faith? And if you can't account for that, you're not being a responsible with your proposal. Yeah. This isn't even a law though. We're talking about with the Trans Athletes. It's just, it's loopholes. So some weird people don't want to be seen as trans phobic in today's climate. So that allowing preposterous things. What was that like for you? And you were talking, I remember when you're talking to Adam on this show that got pretty heated. Oh yeah. Adam ruins everything. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it didn't get heated. We just, I mean, I never got upset. We, we've absolutely disagreed, but he had some crazy notions about competition that didn't make any sense either. Like that somehow or another, the sports are designed to favor men. What? Yeah. It didn't make any sense. It was a lot of it was progressive rehashing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Okay. In my opinion, I think it sounded good to him, but I don't know how much actual thought is put into it. What's actually interesting is like in his show he's well researched and no one's opposing these, this data that he's putting out. So he gets to say these things is one of the problems with like writing a blog or making a video about something where no one goes. Actually that's not really true. This is why that's not true. Let me explain and this is why you're wrong. And now continue. See when you could just go on these long unchecked rants. That's where you get like flat earth believers. That's what that shit from. Cause they watch those videos and they go, oh this makes sense. But this is why it's so important that unorthodox voices don't get the platforms. Because even if that person is proposed putting for things that are completely full of shit, they're criticism and their perspective, they might have some truth in it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       And at the very least, like when I was at Charlottesville and I talked to these people by talking to them, it makes me think through why do I believe what I believe? Why is my truth, the actual truth? And I'm going to be challenged on my views. And I'm going to have a better grounding for them as opposed to, like you're saying, if I'm sitting here just giving a monologue and no one ever calls me out on my bullshit. Yeah. I think I see what you're saying. And I think what they think is you have to silence these bad voices. Like the Anti vaccs movement. That's a big one right now. People are saying, you've got to silence NTP. So they're taking an anti vaccs videos down there, taking into vax pages down. You know, I don't know how much they actually know about the science, you know, I don't, I mean, vaccines are incredible for health in terms of what they've done to protect us from diseases.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       They've stopped smallpox, they've stopped polio. And when you see these outbreaks of measles, that is a direct result of people not getting vaccinated. You know? Does that mean that no one's ever been hurt by vaccines? No. No, it doesn't, man. There's a vaccine court. People been injured. People have died. That's a fact. But that's, I think, just a part of medical procedures and human beings. Men, a lot of kids die every year from circumcision. Yeah. They get infections. They lose their penises. Yeah. Yeah. It's like very common, like way more common in terms of like the numbers per year than you would ever want to hear. Oh God. Okay. People die from things. They get infections. People get, have allergic reactions to certain chemicals. Then the problem is now those vaxxers can say we're being covered up now. They're honest. It's the truth. They are being covered or being covered up.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Yeah. So it's a very, I would think it problem is who's right and who's wrong. Like if you're a person and you have a child and you terrified, can you go to these websites and like, oh my God, um, I don't want my kid to get autism. Like what they're saying that vaccines cause autism. I'm not vaccinating my kids. I'm not going to take the chance. And that's where a lot of it comes in. If you watch those videos and you watch a video that's not done by a scientist, that's not up to date on what we know about what causes, like I had Peter Hotez on who's um, very knowledgeable about vaccines and very knowledgeable about diseases in general and he was describing the, the what they think the causes of autism are. That how it takes place in the womb and how what's most likely happening is it's just expressing itself at the same time that the kids getting vaccinated and you're correlating the two things together.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Well there's also the movement of not regarding autism as a problem or, or door a Cota, you know, children of deaf adults, you know, you have these parents whose kids are deaf and they refuse to get them cochlear implants to give them the ability to hear cause they think that's losing deaf culture. Now to me, you never heard this? No. This is a thing. Yeah. For me, everything is a thing because you can see it when you think about it for a few seconds, you can understand where they're coming from because you're going to be like, well, you're saying I'm bad because I'm deaf. I know it's like, but then you hear people that are like Trans Disabled. Do you know what that is? Whether they cut their hand off because they feel like they're supposed to have no hand, no. Oh yes. Oh yeah. See these things.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       This is what I'm saying. Like they're all, I'm lumping them all together because what they are is all of them are these weird variables when it comes to human behavior and thinking and patterns and biology. Oh, he's weird variables where you get so many numbers and if you have all these people, 300 whatever million we have in this country, you're going to have a few thousand of almost every fucking variable, every weird variable. Good Lord I lord. Yeah. I'll, I know is the politics that the health stuff, I don't even want to wait into that too. That was why I was, there was an old, a website that I was going to, um, what was that body modification? Extreme [inaudible] that guy BME, he died the Lizard Guy? No, the cat guy. His name was Shannon Shannon, I think Shannon laureate is how you say his name, but B m e x body modification extreme was the website.

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       Um, he and I became like a, uh, pen pen pals going back. Like he sent me some stuff on, I wrote something once about body modification. Like what kind of weird shit people do it. And he's like, hey man, if you ever have any questions, feel free to ask me. This is my website. He sent me a to his wet cause it was like one of those six he had to pay for a membership and I was like, Holy Shit, you go to this website and it's just, it was just, this was in the 90s. Okay. And the, the most freakish, weirdest fucking body modifications. And there's a whole culture behind it. People putting horns on their heads and doing weird shit to their skin, making them sold out and tattoo in their whole face. Melissa, she had magnets implanted on her fingers. I don't know why.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       We never know what I would, I think the magnet, well you have to pick things up. You don't want to close your hand. Fuck is wrong with the frog magnets. Well, people think that magnet like where magnets is a wristband supposed to be good for you cares autism, but you get the vaccine magnet. You know, it sounds stupid, but they use magnetic therapy for veterans that have PTSD and CTE because um, there's areas of the brain that can actually stimulate with these very powerful magnets. A Cat Zingano UFC fighter. She went down there when she was having some serious repercussions from her fight with Amanda Nunez. She got really battered badly in the first round and her hormones are out of whack for months afterwards. She was all fucked up. Her Cortisol levels were all fucked up and finally she went and got some milk. Sparring was off her time.

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       And these options are, I just have to rush people. I didn't have any sense of timing. Oh yeah. She was on real problems with their brain and they fixed it. They fixed it with magnets. These, these electromagnetic pulse on, I'm just saying words that I don't understand. So if you're a scientist and you're like, well, shut the fuck. Are you saying this side? Just tweeting at you? Feverously call. Listen, angry scientist come with you. I'm, I'm, I'm retarded. Listen, they throw these, these, these waves at the brain and somehow know that these electromagnetic waves stimulate areas of the mind and it actually forces brain cells to grow in forces neural connections. It's really interesting stuff. Cats Ganos played it pretty, pretty, pretty in depth, but it really helped her. So it's weird that a magnet would work for that, but those are like really strong ones.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Okay. The little ones around your wrists. But it might, I mean, I don't know the fuck do I know? Yeah. I'm not spending that 24 99 in that fucking bracelet, but it's kind of an English guy that's selling it. That's how you know it's legit and it comes with a mop, comes with a free shammy. Remember the sham? Wow Guy. He's dead, isn't he? Yeah. Didn't you guys Israeli? You get bit by a hooker. Yeah. What's the other one? Who got the oxyclean guys dead? Billy. Whatever. Shamwows alive. Yeah. Billy was tooting up. Yeah. Is that what it was? Yeah. He had a lot of coconut system apparently. Oh, Playtech. Right. Well listen, I got that oxy money that clean your sinuses up. Do you want to fucking party? Who's probably had a yellow Lamborghini Dick Implant. Just kidding. I made that part up. I'm sure he was a great guy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       Wasn't in the middle of doing a television show. They were doing a television show about him. Uh, yeah, he was, well, he had the pitchman. It was like a sitcom or something. It was like a reality show. Reality type show. They're following them around doing pitches and stuff. There's an art to that shit. Those guys, he's, he got me to realize shark tank before them. I think they were helping people do stuff sorta like kitchen nightmares. Yeah. I'm friends with the son. The shark tanks on the no sham. Well really made friends with Billy May son. Yeah, I went to school with, Oh, I'm sorry. I said all this. What's his son's name was just joking around. Bellamy's Jr he's the third. Oh, the problem. Mad. We're talking to his dad. He's, I'm sure Billy Mays was a good guy, but didn't eat well. Yeah. He's your friend.

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       Whatever. Yeah. That's why he couldn't respond anyway. Dude was partying. Um, the sham wow guy was the guy who got bit, I tried to track it. I actually think he bit someone. Yeah. I'll look at it. Someone like Marv Albert. Did Marv Albert Bite someone? Yeah. Did he bite the lady? I thought she bit him to get my stories all confused. He comes to dude dudes fighting too many vaccines. That's your problem. That they saved me from the measles, but I got into a big fight with them. They made me dumber. What happened? Oh, there it is. Oh God. Oh, he bit her. It's happened a few times I think with shamwow pitch man. Brutal beat down. Yeah. So they just went to war. Oh my God. He did that to her eyes. Is that real? I don't know what I mean, that might not be real. That looks like makeup though.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       That looks crazy. That's like smoking. Yeah. No, it didn't look like your makeup to me. So symmetrical. Sorry. Black eyes. That's what happens. Feet smashed in the nose. That's the look. Make Up. You know, she uh, she had his tongue and so he started punching her until she realized system. Oh my God. Her hand on her mouth. Tongue or in the consciousness in the face. Oh my God. People are crazy. That's math, right? I had to guess what's involved there. No, it's something crazy at the meth. Really like PCP or like a on bath salts. Oh, remember that? If you're grabbing someone's tongue, it's bath salts. Think Beth salts were Metho. No. Yeah, I think it was, I think what it was was math with the UN. The, I think they altered the molecule so that it doesn't fall into the protected schedule one drug c that you can do things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       Like, uh, that's why DMT was illegal. But five methoxy DMT wasn't, which is actually stronger. Huh? Um, what's that? Um, they missed that one. Here it goes. What's that drug? The last 10 minutes. Oh, why does this best salts? I, well, first of all, here's another thing. I think there's a bunch of different kinds of bath salts for sure. Yeah, for sure. You got the lavender. I mean there's got to get the lemon, but I mean nobody, uh, I don't think anybody has a patent. You can't call that bath salts. Wait, cause that's all they got high on that it's best salts. Cause the name bathy own. It's no, no, no. The bath salts is cause they were selling it in stores as Bateson. Not for human consumption wick who end up like you just planted the chemicals bath he owed no, Kath. Oh, I'll can I misread it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       Okay. But what I'm saying is that labeled it bass also, they could sell it, but everybody knew it was Matt. Phil. Okay man. This bath salts over, they should try smoking that. But isn't that how Salvia was around for a long time? Salvia was around for the same reason. Five methoxy DMT was around, but I missed it in the sweeping schedule. One drug, uh, drug act of 1970 they missed that one. Two of the most potent ones. They missed Salvia divinorum and five methoxy DMT. And that's why they're always changing it. Cause if it's slightly different than you could say it's not that exactly. So see if you find that like bath salts is meth because someone, there was a guy, there was a guy who got a, who's a homeless guy that I think they shot him. He was biting someone's face off in Florida. Yeah. You remember that? Yeah. And they said that he was on bath salts. That's the first time I heard of it. Yeah. And I think someone said that it was meth that he was like, cause like that cat stuff. But it's like your thing, it's just a bunch of different things. You can call it a sound that are made with mephedrone.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       You could basically sell whatever you want if you're selling it as not for human consumption. And also I'd probably, they'd probably put smell into it so they can say no. Well, you know, they probably threw some fucking, so they have like a little cat and mouse game going on for a while where they would have a, it's the same thing. What's going on with that k two spice stuff like yoga. We have synthetic THC, there were spraying all over it and stuff. Supposed to be terrible for us. Awful. Yeah. Way Worse for you than actual, but they would outlaw one little chemical and then those guys would figure out, okay, tweak it and make a t h three, seven, nine. Okay. And now next week is three 80 and they just would keep doing it every single week literally. And by the way, that's the same shit that they did with steroids with like the clear when Barry bonds and all those guys that balco scandal, that's what all that stuff was about.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       Oh, they just changed the like the points after the trucks and stuff around a little and then it doesn't show up in this, in the test because it's not the thing that you're looking for. The way it's been explained to me is a lot of tests for things were very specific. So when the testing for something and it's just a little bit off, I was like, you test negative for it, but it has a similar result or approximate result in a different way, Huh? Yeah. I will say though, with the bath salts, people were breaking into any place that had them. Gas Stations, any store that had bath salts, if they think they had them, what? Your windows are being broken. Your doors are being broken. You're not going to have that stuff tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Those are methods. That's meth head activity. Jesus Christ. Do you knew what? Did you ever know anybody? There's a method. No. Yeah. I haven't known a few people. Uh, it's weird to see because it's a visual. The results. Well, not always. That's what's interesting, what you're seeing when you see people that are completely fucked up and picking the skin off their face and they weigh five pounds and they're falling apart. That is worst case scenario. There's some people that I would call functional methods and what these people are people that are on amphetamines every day or

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       almost every day, they're constantly on amphetamines. So some of them get prescribed by doctors. They get really irrational. They start thinking that everyone's out to get him. Um, they get real mean and nasty towards other people. Very defensive. They're always, they're always attacking and thinking. They're persecuted, thinking that someone's attacking them. It's very strange. And these people could function like this for years, years and years. And you get the same with the Adderall addicts. Yeah. Yeah. But that's just speed, isn't it? Same thing. Yeah. It's very similar to math. It's amphetamines. It's just a different release. Like what Adderall is. Duncan Trussell has a great joke is like as if as a scientist took cocaine and went, I can fix this.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       Just makes people talk active and aggressive and insulting and mean and nasty because it like, it highlights some of the worst aspects of people. The bitchy pettiness. I love that stuff. That's my bread and butter, but it's not, that's why you do it. You do it with a smile. Thank you. That's true. Snarky people need to be having more fun. Yeah, but you are, your positions are always even fun on agree with them. The rational. I see your thought process. I see where you're going. Well, thank you. That's a huge compliment. Not a method that well. Yeah. Why do you say the Jews are doing what? What's happening with the Nazis or one big one? I guess. I interviewed uh, a Nazi for the book and I said to him, I go, look, what do I supposed to do when they see your people come at me and say, the only reason you care about North Korea and its concentration camps is because they're anti Israel.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       And he goes, why do you want me to tell you there's idiots? And every group as I'm like, all right there separate because they're anti Israel. Jeez. The idea that Israel has to go through with Korea, it's just absolutely amazing. But I get that online people connect to everything, right. That are really into the nutty conspiracies. There's a network of connections. So fall then if you're not talking about it, what they think is the most important issue, you're clearly being dishonest because it's the most important issue. Must be a shill. Yes. That time over there in Korea. Interesting. I did break American [inaudible] over there, North Korea. Hey, I wanted to talk to you about this. I don't know if you know anything about it, but, um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       actually Google has pulled the plug on Huawei today, meaning they're no longer a allowing android updates on waterway phones and they're not allowing the Google app to work on, on Walway phones or excuse me, the g mail app to work on Walway phones. If you had an old Walway phone with the Gmail App, you're fine. But going forward, no walkway phones will be allowed to have a Gmail anymore. W what's the reasoning? It's a very good question. Uh, Marcus Brownley, who's Marcus has been on the show before and he's probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite, um, tech reviewer on youtube. He, uh, had a point about it. He, you know, he put it up on his Twitter and then I followed the feed. He's like, this is very important. And I followed a fee and there's tech people, they're saying there is no reason for this. There's no evidence. Did not point to anything. But then when I talked to people that are experts in foreign policy and they explain the way China works and China's relationship between the government and industry, how they're inextricably connected and the, Oh yes, every business works for the government. They were saying, well no, there's a reason why they're doing this. Like this is the, these guys are playing in this real long game. And to aid them in any way is extraordinarily bad for our country.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       Yeah. I had a Marian Smith when these, you know, communism on my show and uh, since my focus in North Korea, I wasn't that much flux in China. And He, and we all think in the West that, you know, China has gotten so much better than it was, which is true, but he goes, it's still really, really, really bad. And one of the big, I think fair criticisms or the corporate press is how much their po focused on Putin and Russia. And it's like you calling him a dictator. The shit they're pulling in China is an order of magnitude worse and something that they're doing now they stole from North Korea. North Korea has a southern called Sung button and everyone on been s o n g B when Sung won, everyone in North Korea got interviewed and there are several iterations of this and you've got a score based on your family.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       So if you are family was born in South Korea or a priest or land owner, that's a low score. If you, your grandfather fought with the great leader Kim Il Sung, that's a high score. It's divided into favored class, wavering and hostile and there's like 51 sub categories and this determines everything about your life, where you live, where you go to college and is China's now starting to do this. They're trying to implement a social credit system based on your loyalty to the government, which will allow things like leaving the country and all sorts of other opportunities and that's scary, scary stuff and that's what needs to be, I think covered much more in the west. The problem with that as it becomes like a game and people are going to want to have a really high school. Of course that's, people are so weird when it comes to score in games, but we get, so you have to have a high score or else you're not getting food.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       That's our job. Right, right, right. Yeah. But it's also like people covet it. Oh, but they don't tell your score. Oh Geez. You have to intimate it. Oh yeah. It's scary. Oh yeah. Yeah. So you got to fly. Right. And so you're always nervous euro. That's what they want. You're always nervous. It's not a transparency self-censoring as well. Yes. It forces a system of self censoring. Like Twitter. Yes. Are you saying that Twitter is like China? Did you just say that Twitter's like communism, those words? Yes. No, we've got a ways to go for communism, but some of the techniques they use are very disturbingly totalitarian. Yes. Disturbingly. So. And the other thing is yes, they are a private company. It's funny how the left is like, as soon as you criticized Twitter, they're private company. They can do they want, but any other private company, whatever it, a private company can be criticized. And if you know you're were perfectly

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       appropriate in a free market to say what you're doing is screwed up and give us answers or we're going to use another company. I think when I talked to Jack about this, one of the things that he was saying is that they're considering an open Twitter, like they're going to have Twitter where it's like a safe neighborhood and Twitter where it's like the wild west. Okay. And I said please do that. Yeah. I said please do that. You know, I mean if he does is to block people, there's ways to avoid people. Black people liberally. You know, it's weird. They'll block lists when you never even had an interaction with someone. It's like a black list. Yeah. And you go to their page and their blocked, you're just blocked. Just [inaudible] reasons. People have block lists for anyone who follows president Trump. Yeah. And it's like if I'm a journalist, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       I sure as hell better be falling the fucking precedent right now. He's saying, first of all, he says hilarious shit. Yes. On the reg. Look, he does do. What's your favorite Trump tweet? Rocket Man, when he was calling my favorite one. Hold on, Jim. John Own Rocky man. What's the one about the haters and the losers? Yes, that's a great one. But he did that before he was president. It was like 2013 it's still my favorite Trump tweet by far. Oh yeah. Every time I speak of the haters and losers, I do so with great love and affection. They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up. I would like if he said that now as president. I know that's one thing he's really doing. Done a great job as president, not swearing. Yeah, it's amazing. Well, did you see what CNN did to him during the campaign?

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       He said, boy, that's really up. So he didn't say it. They played the clip that they believed him. Yes. We talked about this before. Yeah. It's very dishonest. Yeah. They bleeped it to make it look like he said something that he didn't did, but he's cursing blue streak in the White House. Anyway, we all know this, but it's funny. I liked it. I think that part is funny, like I'm not, I'm not happy with a lot of what's going on, but I'm very happy that he's this ridiculous person. I think it's funny and I think it's very healthy for us to have less reverence for the president because when a precedence on a pedestal, he's in a position to send our sons and daughters to die. Whereas if you look at him as a clown, you're going to be much less, more skeptical of, is this man going to war for the right reasons?

Speaker 3:          00:37:43       Is he doing these things for the right reasons? And I think that's very, and that's what the founding fathers wanted to, they didn't want the president to be looked at as a god. Yeah, that's an interesting point that I think you're correct and I think this idea that it's behavior unfitting for a president, that's what we're thinking, that a president is a special person, very special job, and they'll act accordingly like a gentleman. And they're human beings. It's a stupid job. It's a ridiculous job for anyone. You saw Biden went after Trump and says, oh, being presidential is always, yeah, by definition he's always being presidential cause he's the fucking president and you're not well Biden's a weird guy. Do you see all this videos? Him Sniffing those kids? Oh, what is that about? I mean it could just be a sweet old grandpa, but switch some sweet old GRANDPA's don't want to fuck kids.

Speaker 3:          00:38:26       They do do that. The thing is it would in a sense be make more sense to people if he was just like Hanzi right. It's like okay, you're all right. Right. This is like, I don't even know where to put this. Right. Where do you put sniffing? Yeah, it's so fucking weird thing. He's just a weird guy. Did you know about um, the, the plagiarism from back when he was running for president? He ran three times. Yeah. I think he's fucked in the primary because his track record is pathetic. So the first time you ran was an 88 cycle, right? He announced this in July. He has to fold by September cause this plagiarism scandal, right. He runs again in oh eight comes in like what sixth in Iowa has to pull. So he, in terms of his history of running for presidency, it's been very, very poor.

Speaker 3:          00:39:10       He's a good backup man. He's like right, right. Cause you steady, reliable results. Yeah. Stay the fuck out this look it's, they're going to eat him alive. It's ugly. It's going to be ugly. You're going to hate it bro. And you're not going to win. They're getting the, I don't think he's going to raise the front runner. And you look at the democratic polls in terms of the Democrats who was a fun run or at this point in 2003 Oh Joe Lieberman. Ah, because he was the vice presidential candidate from Gore. You, everyone knew his name. What happened with that guy? He lost and he reads. He went right, didn't he? He, he lost the primary in his State of Connecticut. Then he ran as an independent Democrat one again, I got elected, he killed universal health care cause they needed 60 votes and he's like, fuck you, we're not doing it. So they had to have this Obamacare market system. It's because of him and now everyone hates him. Didn't he turn it into a Republican though? No. No. But he endorsed the, became a Nazi [inaudible] Joe Lieberman, Joe Lieberman, invention peer or Nazis. Yet God sees the new, right. Yeah. The fact that he gets called one, that's the funniest shit ever while I was wearing a Yamaka people calling them or not. So that you'd never suspected. Yeah. Sneaky. We're sneaky.

Speaker 3:          00:40:23       I just think if we had to design a system from scratch, there's no way we'd have one person at the top of the pyramid. Right. Doesn't make any sense. It doesn't need to be a pyramid. Yeah. Doesn't, it could be a series of silos. Yeah. No reason. I mean, I guess the good thing would be that person can veto stuff and get things done. So if there is some sort of, if he's a reasonable person and he really works well with those and doesn't abuse that power, one thing he has done, those, the what I mean, I'm just going to sound ridiculous, but when he, as Kim Kardashian bring in cases of people that were unjustly prosecuted, are unjustly imprisoned and he releases them. I liked that. I liked it. She does it and I liked that. He does. It takes a lot for me to get angry.

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       But when people were clowning them and I'm like Kim Kardashian, you can say a lot of shit about her. She saved people's lives. She's helping people in a tremendous way. You're going to tell those families that Kim Kardashian is, fuck you. She's helped 17 people be released from prison in the last three months. And I think it's also very disturbing how Glib, a lot of people are about prison and it's a really, I don't know what it's like and I don't want to know what it's like. You don't want, it's no joke. Yeah. But it is a punchline and it's like you're laughing about people being traumatized for life and possibly having no possibility of returning into society if this is, people used to be able to laugh about stuff like that cause it would be like laughing at work, you know, you go to work and you're like, hey, oh Jay's in the can and he's going to take it into care and you would go to work and you'd say something stupid like that and it wouldn't go anywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:42:02       But when you say something like that on Twitter or Facebook like oh boy, you remember. Um, I mean people find out and you say the inappropriate thing. You remember that with Justine sacco south. I was flying here for this show and someone tweet at me Hashtag has malice landed yet because that was the Hashtag for her. Oh yeah. Cause she tweeted out a joke. She gets out of flight and it blew up while she was on the flight and when she lands where life is going down for a dumb joke. Yeah. That jump, Joe could have been something that you would just say. And then the next day be like, oh, the fuck is wrong with me. I was on Ambien and alcohol and trying to be funny. And that is something that the evangelical left is very scary about, about being, about if you're tea, if you take a joke and that's inappropriate in some sense, and they're the ones judging, it's inappropriate.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       Your life should be ruined. That is crazy. And a totalitarian. Yeah, it's um, it's also, it smacks of deep insecurity and fear that you experienced personally and you want to turn it on other people. The same feeling that people have when they're bullies. The reason why someone's a bully is almost always because they're not confident of their own abilities. So they want to somehow or another by being cruel to someone else, they exercised this power on someone else and it's somehow or another relieves them of a certain portion of this inadequacy. They feel the stress they feel. That's why one of the reasons why a lot of people are saying that bullies, contrary to like what would think would be a logical thing. You should teach them how to fight and they wouldn't, they wouldn't want to do this. The reason why they're doing this to people's cause, they're insecure.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       And that's the same thing I think when you're, when you see these Twitter moms and people at attacking people, the thing they fear most is that they're going to be attack themselves. The thing that they feel, what they feel, social ops, they fear social ostracization the fee. They fear that the theory being standing up on their own two feet and being an individual. And I have a whole chapter on dark humor in this book and I was shocked that they let me publish it because Bobby McFarland, great comedian, she has, she, she was roasting Jim Norton and she says to him, uh, your show is selling, listen to bubble. I'd rather hear my daughter drowning. And it's like, are you going to 12 it? But let's say let's break this down. Are you going to tell her as a comedian or as a mom that that's not appropriate? She, so far they only made me cut one joke. I have everything else in there. And the point I make is something might not be funny for you if you're an assault victim. Right. You don't want to kind of thought that's right, but it's not,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       that means something's not for you. Doesn't mean it's not for anyone. What is, uh, the new, right? This is the, the title of your book. Yeah. A journey to the fringe of American politics. What, what inspired you? Uh, so the circles I was swimming in started going into developing to the scene as it was happening that culminated in like the Trump presidency in Charlottesville. So I was there as this was happening. What circles we discussing this kind of the anarchist circles, the, the uh, what they call 'em race realism, the racist, you know, uh, the alt right and seeing a lot of it happening. Just being discussed in the press and people not knowing what they're talking about. I'm like, all right, someone's got to write this book who's been there and understands it and it might as well be, how do you understand it?

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       Like what, what, what about at doing the race realist? Because I, the, one of the points I make is this is not one scene where everyone's in agreement. These people often completely hate each other and disagree. The only thing that unites them is there opposition to progressivism. And this is you looking at this as a journalist when you say, sure. Yeah. With the way you're saying it is like you're a part of these groups. Well, I was the, I, I, I'm like, all right, I went to all the meetings, you know, I'd go to Charlottesville and interviewed all the types I had. I, you know, and it's what their points of view are. And if you're gonna engage with this kind of thinking, which is somewhat prevalent on the fringes, you have to at least understand where they're coming from and being dismissive. And that gets a power for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       But what I want to say is, cause I don't want people to misconstrue you so someone could listen to this and inadvertently misscans or purposely misconstrue and think that you're a part of these groups. Oh No, no. So it's very clear in this book who I agree with that. Absolutely. Yeah. In the book, but the way we're discussing it in this conversation, you're saying the circles that you run in. Yeah. Cause a lot of the people who I was friends with fell down this rabbit hole. They fell down the rabbit hole of Nazi-ism racism. Yes. And that's who you were friends with fell down. I'm not naming. Yeah, because, and it was very disturbing them in real life. Correct. Wow. And it was very disturbing to watch as they start throwing our terms like HPD and Rx, human biodiversity, that's their code word for different races.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       Right. Schuman, biodiversity is the code word for different races. Yes. And what's the other one? HBS and NRX anorexia reaction. So this is basically a, America has this decadent, why my republic and we need to return to like hardcore, right. Euro reaction. Neo, neo, neo, neo reaction. That's, that was the Hashtag before was the outright, it's not the same buddy. They similar enough. So, and a lot of these guys are really cerebral. You know, they could tell you about the history of England. They could tell you about, you know, all the science and Swat went wrong. Uh, with, with, with whom? With them. I, I don't know what went wrong. I think one of the things that goes wrong is when no one's talking to you and you're just talking to each other, you're going to start doubling down because there's no one hitting the brakes. You know what else happens, what you say controversial things. People

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       attack you and then some people don't attack you. They support you and then you gravitate towards those people that support you. Right? And then you get that endorphin rush. You Get the light. Yes. You start seeing that with people and they started embracing really weird fringe ideas. They become a part of these fringe groups. They get praised by these fringe groups and then the elevate to, to virtue signal for that fringe group. And so at a, you could be either an average person in the mass or you could be a leader in the fringe. So it's a big fish in a small pond and you can be one of those who knows one of those who knows, right. People know what the fuck is going on. So not going to get me with the scam. So my line is you take one red pill but not the whole bottle.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       You take the Adderall Bro, the fucking Adderall. No one's going to, I know what's happening. Start stashing weapons in your backyard. Prepping. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting, and there's also a long history of this stuff. So how did you know those guys in real life? Did you know them from work? Did you know from like uh, like Antarctica circles? So yeah, this anarchy thing. Like how serious are you about that? 100%. 100% serious. So anarchists think there should be no cops. No, Eric is, don't think they should be government cops. They should be private security. Oh, private security for what? Well, same thing you, no one wants to have a scenario. Like if you go to a bar, you're not paying for the doorman or if go into a hotel, you're not paying for the security. The point is whoever has an environment wants it to be as safe as possible for stop right there.

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       Okay. Cause if you go into a bar, if you're buying a drink, the bar is taking some of the money from that drink to pay for that security. Correct. It's the same thing as you paying taxes. It's not the same thing as you. Pink texts. Let's just look at it this way. It's just money into a pool. It's not just money. Please. If you throw the money into a pool, but do you need me to, let me explain. Okay. If you throw the money into the pool. Okay. And the obviously taxes get taken from you. It's different in that regard. But if you have a certain amount of money, certain amount of money's going to go to protecting the people. And this is the idea of police force and this is the idea of a bouncer or at least a bouncer is more likely acting in the interest of the club share and trying to keep out bad people and try and keep people from getting sued.

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       But the money for the drinks goes to that. Some of it, a percentage of it goes to that much like your tax money. Some of it goes to the cops. Sure. Right, correct. But the big difference is one is voluntary and one is forceful and one is a monopoly and one isn't. So if you had an a three system, you would have more security because the streets would have someone doing security and the bar and the store and there would be complimentary to each other as opposed to you only have to dial nine one one wouldn't have it. Look how many dating sites. They're all right. Wouldn't it be great if instead of one number you had dozens of places that are gonna offer you security. So like private businesses that work like Uber, you give him a call when you're getting raped unless you press a button has short one with the dude was we had on you press a button and then someone shows up.

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       We have that now. We have now. I mean if you go to an apartment building or a business building, there is going to be security there already. You're not gonna, you're not going to call the cops. You're going to call the downstairs. We'll just book readers. Sure. You're sitting there playing with their phone. They used to be book readers to other phone players. Well, I'd rather they be reading books than shooting dogs. So that's where we are. Right. I see what you're saying in terms of that's the grossest shit ever. When you see swat teams show up and shoot people's dogs when people get, and that's the problem with having a monopoly is there's no consequences. So let's say there's all these cases where, you know, dogs get shot, the flash grenade and the baby's crib. Yeah. These people aren't fight like a, um, Eric Gardner, the only person who got in trouble for Eric Garner dying is the guy who filmed it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       I mean, if you are a cook and you are serving food and you under cook chicken, it's a mistake, honest mistake and someone gets sick. That shouldn't be your job. But if you're a police officer often, and I'm going to get a lot of heat for this, and that's fine. Uh, if you see something bad happens as a consequences for actions, there have to be consequences that maybe this isn't the right job for you. We'll oftentimes a ruse if they're sure in inappropriate shooting or supplying those lines. But I think you're right and mean. I've experienced abusive cops. I think we all have. And I also think that it's very, very, very difficult to be that guy. Absolutely. And not become abusive and not become worn out by it, not become extremely stressed out. I'm a big supporter of police. I just don't think that it's a job for everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       I think being a cop is like a lot of other jobs that are, especially that one that's super fucking difficult. The idea that you just hire people off the street and run them through some tests and they're gonna make great cops. I agree. It's crazy. I agree. And then what happens is when you're a monopoly, you don't have to be efficient or effective. I think they should hire former military. That's what I think have that at least they hire people, know, hire people that have disciplined, hire people that, that have gone through some experience in actual combat, who know how to handle pressure better and then make it a very, very valuable job and make it a very like very strict codes of conduct and behavior and action. I think another problem that police have in their defense is when you have public streets, people uh, have certain rights and they can act, have where they were like, here in la you have all these, these tents.

Speaker 3:          00:52:45       And I thought, my understanding is the government said you can't clear out those tents. That is hilarious, isn't it? And now the cops can't do anything. So they are hamstrung for being able to do their jobs. Whereas if this was private, this would not be happening. Well, if you go under underpasses and La folks, I don't know where you live, but there's a fucking campground that literally they have tents everywhere. I went to see, I didn't know skid row was an actual place. I didn't know. I went there last time I was here and they were, they, the whole block is covered intense. Oh, it was unbelievable. People who don't know, uh, I love to take them to skid row. It's just amazing. Downtown La is insane. Like you go there and you're like, what is this? Well, what this is, is failure. This is failure. I mean, cultural failure, failure to address these members of our community.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Fair failure to provide health care, failure to raise children correctly. Failure to keep people from drugs, failure to provide good systems to get them off of drugs. It started in New York to de Blasio. Who's a real charmer that one. Like now all you go into every subway train, there's a homeless person with all their bags and this, there's got to be better alternatives than that. Even for them. Well, there's somewhat, oh, Donald Trump jr posted videos all over the news the other day when he was talking about the de Blasio and he's like, this is, I'm driving here. I'm, LIZ is out my window and filming and look good. Look at all these tents. Like he look at all those homeless shit. He started following me on Twitter and now, uh, I live in fear of like saying the wrong thing again. I don't know. It's just like holy shit because North Korea is my biggest issue by far.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Right by far. But what are you in fear of? Like getting on followed by Donald Trump Jr. Yeah. She ain't got long fall. You well, he better not. No. I have friends that are friends with him. Okay. Like good friends, like my good friends and they're good friends with him. Okay. I'll slide in. Tastes like him. They say he's a good guy. Just a slide into his dms. Do it so weird. He's just in a weird position, man. If he wasn't the, the president's son, he wouldn't be under so much scrutiny. You'd be like, oh, he's a great guy. It's like everybody's just like, oh, you're the president's son. But it's weird for me, given that that was my beat, that I'm like one step away from being able to influence policy in that issue, which is the most important thing to me. But again, it, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       What would you tell them about North Korea? Uh, I mean, I wouldn't even know where to start. I would just, I would think I'd have a lot of information about helping with the psychology, how to kind of influence them, how to basically, uh, manipulate them, uh, also how evil they truly, really and truly are. I'd always to keep that in mind. So it's a dance. It's a very delicate dance with them. Um, do you think he's going to get in trouble with Russia? Who, which one don't Trump jr? Yeah. You think he will? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. Yeah. Thing anybody's, I think it's over. I don't think it's Alpha. It's not, I don't think it's over it because people, if after three years of reporting now you can say with a straight face what, there were three years of reporting over nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       If there's smoke, there's fire, you know, blah, blah, blah. So I haven't been following it that closely. I saw Justin Amash, you know, just tweeted out that he had this whole tweet storm that he thinks Trump should be impeached based on who was that? Justin Amash is a congressman from Michigan. He's uh, uh, uh, one of like three libertarians and he turned, he said, he's like, I actually read the report, which most people have not in Washington. He'd hundred pages, is it? Yeah. And he's like, I think this is, there's stuff in here that's impeachable. Whoa, this was a big deal. And then all the left, we're like republic. Even Republicans like Justin Amash is like, no, no. It's just him. It's not, there's no, like it's him. It's literally just hit save him. Yeah. There's only two like him. It's Thomas it like them. It's Thomas Massie and likely that's the three of them. And Ran Paul for rand. Paul's an interesting cat. I like him. Well, I was, uh, I want to talk to his neighbor that fucked him up. Oh, that's such a bitch move. Don't be such a bitch. That

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       is such a bitch. Tackled him when he wasn't even looking. I know. Yeah. I think he had earphones on to it's, it's uh, uh, I'm gonna, I'm not sitting here like some Badass, but come on. What the fuck are you doing? Yeah. How about that guy that kicked Arnold Schwarzenegger? Yes. That was hilarious. He kicked this kid, dropped, kicked Arnold towards the nigger. I think he was crazy. South Africa. He was saying he was screaming out. Help me. I need a Lamborghini. While they were arresting him, it was the bath salts. Worldstar hip hop made it. He's on. Look, I mean, if that's what he want, look what really happened to Arnold. Nothing. What's really gonna Happen to that kid? Probably go to jail for a couple. Actually, I don't know. You don't know South Africa. Look at, look at, uh, Ottawa beer in North Korea. He steals a sign in and he's dead.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       So you don't know what the laws like in South Africa could be. Think it's not as bad as North Korea. That's not a status North Korea come on y'all. It's not a to guard. Fucked him up pretty well too. Then it looked like it. Two seconds. Let's say if your, if your drop kicking people out of nowhere. That's the problem. When I was talking to Eddie Izzard, Eddie ran a bunch of marathons in South Africa. 20 was, it was to sell to do, it was a designation. It was the same numbers, the amount of years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, social 27. Um, so he ran 27 marathons, but there was areas where they're like, listen man, you ain't running through here like this is this area we want to go to. We're going to take you, I'm going to put you in a car. We're going to drive you way the fuck past here.

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       And then you keep running when you're not running through here. Like you'll get killed, you'll get, you'll get your gift Card Jack. This is, we're all gonna get shot. You're not going through here. And that's, you know, there's parts of the world that are like that and on Swartz and Egor when he visited South Africa, what's the worst you've got? Drop kicked in with poor technique. Okay. Want to say to the kid had no follow through, right? Barely knocked a 71 year. First of all, even though Arnold Sports Center, 71 years old, he's still a 71 year old Arnold's wards, and of course he's still at tank, but I mean even fall over kid drop cam, he didn't even know it was coming. Right. He gets hit in the middle of this guy and he's fine. It's kind of impressive. I got your precedent. You do? What do you got? Ready? Okay. What do you like best about me? Uh, get to fuck this up. I got this, this system as Joe Rogan thing. That's like a thing of girl says to you, right? She's about to trap you. What? That's the intellect. Your personality. I like everything. This is the most Joe Rogan thing I've ever found. What is it? Here you go. Well, we got here. Take it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       What is that? It's a mini museum set. It's got 29 different things from all over the universe in Cayston. Lucite. Wow. That is fucking dope. Yeah. Wow. Got a piece of the White House. A piece of the Hollywood sign is some Amazon water. A giant sloths claw. I think. Wow. Thank you. You are welcome to. That'll go right fucking here. Yeah. Here's the book to tell Centrelink about it. Thank you. Very cool. That's, where'd you find this? I want them one of my rabbit holes in the Internet and I'm like, Holy Shit. This will be perfect. Gel Internet rabbit holes. Oh, that's dope, dude. Thank you very much. Um, so you get the velvet bag. Oh yeah. Oh, this is a bag for it. All the bag. I feel like I needed to have it out though. The bag right here, I got mine on display desk is so cluttered.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       This is a ridiculous to ever keep saying I'm going to clean it up. It's not going to happen. Yeah. So tell me more about your book and why you, why you breaking. Um, these buildings. Is that, that's a dog whistle. That's a dog was to cover. So there's a guy named Ben Garrison and he was a regular conservative artist. Right. And he would have drawings about like Ben Bernanki or Hillary or whatever. The Nazis took his art, replaced all of his drawings with Jews. So instead of the great wizard or debt being the Fed, it was a Jewish caricature and they did it perfectly. And they also invented this whole backstory about him that he was this closet Nazi and this poor guy in Montana, if you Google him, it's like not to end. He's like, why is this happening to me? And the Photoshop work is perfect.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       So eventually they calmed down and you know, he now he's kind of like a regular cartoonist and the story got out. But that's his artwork. So the people that, this poor guy who is talking about a victim of Nazis, it's very rare nowadays to have a new victim of Nazis and he's actually one of them. Well, meme culture is very strange, right? Yes. And those little humorous images that get chucked around. Oh yeah. There's a lot of dirt bags that have really profited off of other people's meme work to my, like my friend Don, he's terrible. He works, he works for a meme site. Yeah, sorry, I'll turn it back. Those sites are bad, man. Some of them just flat out steal and some of them steal and then they'll attribute, yeah. Somewhere. Like they'll just say your name and sometimes they don't even say your name.

Speaker 3:          01:01:22       They say unnamed of like a fake account. That doesn't even just it just attributed to someone. Oh we thought we got it from that person because they know that it's at a hundred different accounts cause a bunch of people have this guy's like you, you'll find something and you're like, oh this is funny and you put it up. But then these people that they make these giant sites with all other people's work and they curate them and they make millions. Yep. Like the fat Jewish. Yeah. Oh yeah. Everyone hates him. Yeah. This, this is one of this is like one of your big issues with like people who like take content and basically it'd be, it'd be appropriate for themselves first for sure would stand up comedy. But the thing that's happening with memes is like you're, you, if someone sends you something, like there's a bunch of things that my f like Eddie Bravo sends me hilarious ones all the time. He'll send me a funny meme and then I'll send it to Brendan shop and like I'm not asking who made that mean. Right. So it's a joke. Brendan doesn't think that I made it myself. So it's not like I'm stealing that joke, but I'm definitely not crediting the original creator cause I don't know who the fuck it

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       is. Right. And those things fly around, they flyer out. So, but that's all with in good faith. The person was in bad faith, right. Curates a website and then starts profiting off of it. They find a loophole and then they make deals with comedy central and they also have people who actually steal standups bits and turn those bits in the memes and they put those bits on there, their meme pages and they do the same shit. They'll do it. They just, their content needers they need content. They're whores. Parasites. Yes. So they just, they'll hire people to do it. They, they in the people that they hire, they'll, they'll steal people's jokes and tournament into memes. I mean it's real. It's a real problem.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       That's, that's, that's, I mean, that's like become a joke because people were like, oh, this is a rare pepe. Right. As cause like please save it. It's just like, you know, even though you can replicate it into the lab, a lawsuit lawsuits going on, right. I talk about that in there. Oh No. The new one that's happening right now, Alex Jones refused to, he refused to settle out of court. So they're going to go to court. They're going to figure out whether or not peppy can, you can use pepe the frog. But I mean, I talk about this in the context of, it's like, can you Andy Warhol use a Campbell soup can. It's the same thing. It's like, it's, yeah, someone creates it. But if someone is using it in it, kind of a broader satirical context, what it doesn't though, because Andy probably couldn't do that today.

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       Yes, he could. I think that assume if you tried to make a lot of money off of Campbell soup cans, corporations had more power back then unless, uh, accountability. Because now with social media, if I want to lose their minds on Campbell's, right. That's true. That's a good point. I think that, do you know what they did with Campbell's did when he did this, he paints all 40 flavors of soup cans, right? Puts them up in a gallery. Campbell's is like, what the fuck is this? Like they didn't know what to do. Right. And they didn't know who to call it. This is unprecedented. So they had a storefront and they had the cans out the window. They go, why pay a hundred grand? You could get a here for a dollar. So they tried to own it in their own way. That's smart. That's smart. Great advertising for them.

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       Yeah. I mean gigantic advertising. But that's the other thing is like with this meme culture, people like, oh, pepe means white supremacy. It's like you can't, Campbell's doesn't say what a Campbell soup can means. Different things mean this is not news. Different things mean different things to different people. And if you're using it in one context doesn't mean other contexts aren't legitimate. That's how art and images work. Yeah. I mean that's almost like what happened with the guy in Montana, right? He takes his work and then turns into Nazi stuff and then all the sudden he becomes a Nazi. Right. And that's what they do with it. With pepe the frog. Cause that guy who met here. Yeah. Oh he's so upset. I know. Cause he know what they did to him log. Do you know if they did to him? He had a cartoon where he killed peppy.

Speaker 3:          01:04:57       So all the trolls are like, oh that's interesting. So they took all his other characters and made them full blow Nazis. So Heinrich, who's the wolf, instead of having reflections in a sunglasses had the SS, they're like, oh you want to, you want to throw it out, we'll throw down asshole. And that's what ended up happening to him. Wolf has a name already now they gave him the last name. It's like Heinrich, something else. But that name, I'll tell you what. Oh my God, I, no, no, no. This is, what do they call it? That's a Nazi wolf. Sounds like a Nazi war navy. They, what was the guy's hilarious that he thought he could just kill it off. That's like d platforming. He thought he was going to d platform. Pepe. Let's also like, let's suppose I decided to kill off Paul Bunyan put the fuck are you, how does that mean?

Speaker 3:          01:05:41       It doesn't mean anything. Like the idea that he's going to kill it off and they're going to say, oh well we killed the dog. His name was originally land wolf, so they said, oh, his first name is Heinrich land wolf and the you pull it up and the glass as well. Maybe we shouldn't have that assessed the damage right here, but land wolf as opposed to sky wars. Fuck does that mean, the funny thing is about pepe? It was, it was always so bland in lame. Well I think for, it was adopted as a meme. Like when you see like feels bad man, right? Like it was like, Whoa, this is so low. Blood sugar bothers me. But it's also the idea of, you're saying that because Nazis are using it, you can't use it as feels bad man. Like if you're giving it okay symbol and they're using it this way, you can't say, oh that's okay as make any sense.

Speaker 3:          01:06:27       Yeah. You can't say something to me. I go, okay my mouse if I do that, that's white supremacy. No, everybody. For years I had a whole series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay sign. Of course, including me back when I had earrings, it was radio days. Bill Cosby doing the okay symbol. It's fucking, come on man. You guys know this is not, that's not what this is. Just because people are using it and saying it is. And they were investigating. People were investigating people. There was a guy who is on television, they blurt it out. Yeah. And the other thing is we're at a point now where it's more easy to give the finger to someone than to say, okay, yeah cause you blur the finger out and nobody cares. But if you do that like, oh, what is he doing? He's touching his fingers.

Speaker 3:          01:07:10       You can't even do like you're holding a joint cause that's like a white power giant. Like if you're like doing that like a roach, that's bad. That's bad. How do you, do you have to use a roach clip? It's a ploy by the roach clip industry. But there's, I have a list in their world, the things that are called racist milk show dinosaurs milk become racist. Oh cause the, the what the trolls do is they make it, let's see if we get them freaking out about milk and they got it. Picnics. My favorite one the trolls did was the free bleeding movement. I'm like God, that's the greatest thing that people who've ever accomplished that they actually got women. No, no, no, no. You're, there's two things. You're confusing. Two things. The free bleeding was a woman who made it, but there was the pee on yourself and there was no free bleeding. Was a four Chan Chantrel no, it was the girl running a race cause she was, she was actually smart about it. She said this is to create awareness toward women in third world countries who don't have access to sanitary pads. I, yeah, I was reading a whole article on the four Chan, the creating the free bleeding movement. Okay. I could be wrong. See if he could pull that out. I

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       know there was a legitimate example of the free bleeding. Yeah, I think that was post that on putting it up. They've done a few things like that. They all said, pee on yourself to fight rape. Oh, I heard. Because that's one of the big arguments that to fight a rapist, that you're actually in that situation, pee on yourself, that'll turn them away and it's like you shouldn't give people advice. It's like, listen, if she's actually getting assaulted, what should she do in that horrible circumstance? And then it's like pee on yourself to show your support for victims sexual assault. Wasn't there a senator or somewhere that actually said that if it's a legitimate reason that's in there, and Todd Aiken, Todd Akin was run, this is amazing. Todd Akin was running for Senate in Missouri and he's prolife and they asked him a very common question for life people. What about if it's rape? And he goes, well, that's very rare. And it goes, but my understanding is a, if a woman is assaulted, the body has a way of shutting it down. Now there's a book called sperm wars and apparently an, again, I'm crazy scientists don't get mad at me.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       Didn't work. That's the book's not legit. Is that true? No, no. It's been disputed. It's been debunked. Okay, thank you. Is there is no evidence that sperm acts as anything other than sperm that attacks the egg and tries to get up

Speaker 2:          01:09:23       pregnant. The claiming that book, Yeah. Is that rape is more likely to result in pregnancy than regular intercourse. The point is, he got red out of town on a rail, uh, and then Reza Aslan, who said on Twitter, you know what? I hope he gets raped. And if you take his comment out of context, it's very disturbing and it's kind of disturbing in context. But Rez response being like, this is a response to you being like, yeah, you've got raped or not going to get pregnant. And he got the new right one after him, Reza and got him fired from CNN years later. Is that what he got fired from? He also called the present and a shithead. So they're like, they use that and they use the other tweet and they gave it to him.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       What's free, really free bleeding stuff has been online. There's an article I found from 2004 Oh crap. So it's been online for a long time, but as we started it, four Chan picked it up as a troll in 2014 okay. Say started as a real thing. It's been a thing online now for a long time on feminist blogs. I'll 2011 there's another thing when you fuck, but when you find in 2004 was it a troll? No, it was all about my vagina. My badge.net. Yeah, I told you we'd do a new, I'm glad I got this right. Okay. You got it right to my badge. Fortunate has too much power long [inaudible] dot net some ladies experienced with her free bleeding, so she just lets her 15 years ago, her twat bleed. Oh sorry. That's okay. You got that one. The article was so fucking convincing. That's a problem man. It's a Pr, you know and that's what people in that are arguing for. D platforming are saying when they're like for d platforming, anti vaxxers or d platforming, flat earthers or anybody who's got information that's just not accurate in terms of, the other thing is climate change.

Speaker 2:          01:11:08       Yeah. Hold on. Pick one. My big answer is you guys reported WMDs for a long time and hundreds of thousand people got killed because of this misinformation. So if that's going to be your standard, you're going to have two d platform, the New York Times as well. So it's a very, a double edged sword. When you start talking about if people give misinformation, they have to be banned from these social media sites. You need someone to be able to check the orthodox point of view no matter what it is. It's true. There's no denying that. What does [inaudible] this is the poster. That's the key. I didn't know this was about a poster. It's a fair use issue with the peppy and Alex Jones. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:11:45       upon certain, like they're arguing as fair use and he's arguments, not blah, blah, blah. So interesting. It's not just because it's a meme or something. Yeah. There's the poster person behind Alex to l a to the left of Alex. All right. He's going to question. Most of these people are, I know who all of them. I don't know if that's like a cigarette in their hand or a test tube or a tampon. What does that, what does that, is that a blunt? What does that, so the Sharpie is that you're writing something on Alex's back. Is that a dude or a guy? Who the fuck is that? Who is that? I know everybody else. Whatever. We could be here for days. Is that the diamond and silk? Okay. Is that lady, I think that was so, I don't know. It must be diamond and silk.

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       The two of them whose diamond and so there are these two black ladies who are Trump's biggest fans. And they go to social media and they start ranting or raving. I've seen one and that one of them always drinks blue line blue wine and it's like when you're so sick of his blue bullshit, they just drinking literal Koolaid. It's blue. She's got a blue liquid. It's crazy green one here and she's a Trump. It's racist. Well, wait a minute. Maybe she's drinking coolers like do you can get, can you get Green Koolaid? No, I think it's wine. Wine glass. I think they have blue line. Now what? Let's look at the looks on her face. She's always seemed sad. I don't know what you want is diving for when Silk One zero always act really upset the other month. Just like, why am I here? That's a good move.

Speaker 2:          01:13:05       If you just want attention. If you don't really support Trump, I can sit in there with the Green Line. Yeah, just get super outrageous. See and they testified in front of Congress. That's why I love this timeline. It's like this is where we are. They testified in front of Congress about Facebook censoring people because Facebook is censoring them. They said, what do you see? What's going on with Alex Jones? If you right Alex JonesJones' name on Facebook, it says only you can see this post. I do license name, I do live streams a lot. Right. And if the live stream was my thoughts on Alex Jones live stream, the second it's uploaded, it's demonetized and they laid her has to get remodeled ties. Once they see it's okay. So the default setting is, and that's the other thing of all of these people. Alex Jones is the worst one. Like you have actual full blown, we need another holocaust types and he's the villain. Yeah, well he's got a big platform. That's the idea. The idea is that he's got a big platform so they have to show the other lie. They're like, oh blah blah blah sandy hook or like you're an upset when the sandy hook should happen. You're getting upset about him now.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Years later. Cause you're being whipped up into a froth by the corporate press about it. You wouldn't flip flip saying he should be beauty platform. Seven years ago when was, whenever it was sandy hook was, was something around them. Right. Five years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:14:28       Well it becomes something that is a talking point, right? Right. Like that he needs to be d platform. Do you use it or agree with it or you don't agree with it? And I think that's the case with a almost what is happening with our, uh, something happened up there. Oh, is that the perch? The perch. Now these guys are here messing with electronics. Okay. Um, no, there's no approach here. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, we have security. I would not do well in purge. Yep. You're fine. Dude. Stay in this room. This room was bulletproof. Yeah. All right. Good to know. Yeah, you'll be all right, man. Okay, good. Are you worried about the purge? No. Are you worried about the apocalypse? No. Natural disasters? Not at all. Nothing. Solar flares taken out the grid? No. No, no. I mean there's a satellite's going wasn't the best books.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       No more Sirius satellite radio. And this is my response to people on the far right. And I'm using that term to term accurately. It is a great book by Arthur Herman called the idea of decline in western history. And he talks about, you know, every 20 years, it's a different group on the left, on the right. And they're like, the world's going to end. And he brings the receipts and it never ends up happening because people are smart some. And we have a huge asymmetry in wanting to stay alive. So the idea that the last of what apocalypse, what probably the black plague I would say would be the last apocalypse we were doing so good so far. Do you know the belt, the people that got the black Pitt, excuse me, the people that got the black plate cause they were eaten a Marmot liver, is that what a, was it a liver or kill?

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       I thought they thought it was the fleece from the rats. No, no, no, no, no. There's some, oh, recently, recently, recently got the black plague, but it's just like the flu now. The rats, the last time that happened in the United States I think was in the 1920s. And that was in Los Angeles actually. The last, uh, evidence of the black plague. Yeah, but you don't die from it anymore. Oh, you could definitely die from it, but they died in the twenties I think they died in the 20s and I thought it's still okay. Maybe it's the people died this year from the black plague. Oh Shit. People that ate the liver. Okay. Kidney, I think. Right? You're killing couple, you know, we're all Marmet kidney. Yeah. Marmet it's like a vole. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we used to be 65 million years ago. Yeah. Just weird little mini museum.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       Weird little rodent thing. Yeah. Yeah. These people hate it. Ate It, and wound up dying from the play. What was the point? I had a point about end of the world. Are we worried about the apocalypse? You know, that idea that people have always worried about the end of the world and it never happens. Sure. That's like saying, I've always worried about dying, but I never have. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to be there. You're going to die, but I'm not going to be there. How do you know? What do you mean? How do you know you're not going to be there? But I mean that's a dying means. Oh, you not going to be there when you die. Right? So you're not going to die. Right. Cause I'm not gonna experience the hive or you're not.

Speaker 3:          01:17:17       So don't even worry about it. Does what? It's over. You won't be here. So who cares? I wouldn't say who. So who cares. But I mean if your entire life is focusing on, you know, avoiding death, that's a very bad mindset. Yeah, that's for sure. That's what I'm saying is that I think people are operating with a very small historical timelines and the more I talk to people like Graham Hancock, what is the, describe the overwhelming evidence that something pretty severe happen to the human race around 12,800 years ago. Most likely common impact or some, something along those lines. Are there other people think that it was actually a solar mass coronal ejection that made lightning storms like rainstorm. Lightening was coming down like rain all over the world and just killed everything. And this thing could happen easily at any time. Not Easily. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       Easily. Okay. Yeah. Common impact or asteroid impact easily, easily or not easily in terms of likelihood because it would happen easily. Turn the likelihood it would've happened by now. No, no. That has happened. There's a lot of evidence that it's happened. It's just we're dealing with a small timeline. The ideas could, could you get lucky and it won't happen in the next 60 years or so while you're alive. Yeah. Yeah. Could happen or could hit tomorrow. That could happen too. Okay. I'll take that bet. It's good bet. I mean, it's good. Look, your prospective is good. That's a good, it's good to not worry to, to not look at license, but you don't have power if you don't have the power to effect the comment as I personally don't know. That's true. Uh, knowing it's coming. Who could theoretically, what can I do about it?

Speaker 3:          01:18:48       Just live and I th one of my heroes, Albert Kamoo, great French philosopher, you know, his point about living to the point of tears, right? And I think what really I find sad in this culture is cynicism and hopelessness and it's like we're blessed. You know, we have this, I mean there's beyond, beyond the Internet, you can find people who are making amazing things, more opportunities than you can count. And if you're just going to sit there and Mope, I mean you're blowing this great gift that God's given you. Yeah. Well, I think a lot of those people that are moping, that are concentrating entirely on the negative aspects of life, they're doing themselves a giant service and they can't. It's almost like they can't help it. I think there's a lot of people that are affecting the way culture shifts today that are probably clinically depressed.

Speaker 3:          01:19:34       And one of the things I resent enormously about culture is this idea of something is joyous or fun. It's less, it's less legitimate artistically. And that is such a disgusting, horrible mindset and we need more joy and more happiness. And I, for me, because I want to see Jojo Siwa last night. Okay. Yeah. Do you know who that is? You don't know who that is? She's a youtube star. My nine year old loves her. So how to, how to go to Jojo Siwa was birthday concert last night. Okay. At the Microsoft Center. Whatever the fuck that is. I know because Burt ran into her at the airport or loves or two of that bet because Berta, his young daughters too. Yeah. She's all about positivity. Believe and achieve fun times. I'll upload a video later. Is it all like Saccharin like Disney stuff or is it sincere? Sacrad as again.

Speaker 3:          01:20:23       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like um, yeah, she was taking old queen songs and reworking the words, cleaning them up. Just like those mean people. She always, she's cleaning, she toning down Queen Song tone down some queen songs. Oh, this woman is the devil. How dare you take someone's art and an appropriate it and make it like a takeout. All the, all the energy. Yeah. She uh, this is corporate culture at its worst, but she's doing it for three year olds, Bro. Sell to sleep. Five year olds. They don't need to be listening to queen over. There it is. Oh, Jesus Christ loves Freddy Mercury, Bro. What's problem? No, she doesn't. If she loved him, she'd respect him. That's just fucking 12 she know. Oh, she's 16 excuse me. Yeah. Should know any better. She does know better. How smart were you when you were 16 smart enough not to try to rewrite queen.

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       I bet she doesn't have a say in it. I bet whoever's pulling the strings gets her to rewrite even more nefarious. Of course the Disney people or the, the, the, the, the, the sensors, wherever it is. The producers. Wait, am I wrong? Where's the lie? Where's the lie? What song was it that they did it to? I'm trying to remember. They did. We are the champions. She sang that the champions. I mean, someone is a loser. Yeah. No time for losers. That changed her. No time. What? Don't got no, I don't think they've changed that now. The time for recess.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       Oh my God. This is horrifying. Video two, this is like those videos they made for like Mormons where they took like Hollywood blockbusters and cut out all the sex and all the cursing. Yeah. And it's like you are evil vampires. Horrible monsters. She did crocodile rock. Elton John. Okay. And she changed Rainbow Chevy to rainbow beamer. So Crocodile Rock, you know, my theory is that that song, I tweeted this out years ago, I just imagined Elton with a bunch of his friends all getting high as fuck, right? And they're like, all right, let's try to think of the most fucked up lyric and Eric Elta and you're gonna make a song about it. They're like, all right, how about like, um, like crocodile rock? And he's like, all right, I'll fucking do it. And he fucking sits and nails it. And then what the fuck does that even mean? What does that mean?

Speaker 3:          01:22:33       But I'll tell you what man, the word crocodile means something different to me after watching that Black Mirror episode titled Crocodile, I haven't seen it. Holy Shit. If you're listening to this, ladies and gentlemen, and you have a sensitive heart and you can't handle really fucked up premises in a really fucked up episode like her fans don't want young, don't watch it cause it's rough. It's really good though. It's, but it's like, Holy Shit. It's one of those ones where they are not giving away anything. But at the end when you're, when you're done with that show, you feel like you need a fucking shower. Like he was like, whoa. Oh Geez. It's dark. Okay. There's nothing to do with the reptiles. I do like dark. It's just dark. It's dark. I just read this book by this woman, Cynthia Carr called fire in the belly. It's the life story of this artist David, when he wrote, which I didn't know anything about and he was in New York in the early to late eighties when AIDS was coming up.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       And as she tells his life story, you hear the story of Aids percolating through this culture. And that book is as dark as fuck because she'll have a scene where he's like, oh, he had dinner and Dah, Dah, Dah. And the next sentence, Keith haring died on this day at age 34 and you realize this is what it's like for them. Like they're hanging out, phone rings, Keith's dead. And these are men who are the symbols of virility early, late twenties early thirties just dropping like flies. And the thing is they're watching each other die knowing I'm next. That's going to be me in a year from now. And they're getting dementia before they die. So they're talking all crazy at age 30 so this book really fucked with my head really, really badly. We're giving them easy t to yell. Yeah. Didn't help. No, but that was later. At first they're like, we don't know what the fuck to do is go.

Speaker 3:          01:24:09       Good, good luck. And it's like we're dying. Like, no, I'm sorry. Should I suck Dick? It's like, what the fuck? What the fuck am I supposed to do? Yeah, they were calling it the gay cancer. We didn't know what it was they did. And then when they were trying to fight for education, people are like, well we're not going to teach kids, you know about sucking Dick. And they're like, dude, we're dying. And they're like, mm, sorry about it. And it's, is this book really got with fucking with my head especially cause you know it's real. Yeah. Did you ever hear a book Kutchers of course, about chasers both chase fuck chasers. Yeah. That's again, we're talking about things that are just fucked up about human beings. When you look at the spectrum of behavior, bug chasers are people who tried, yes. Gay Men. Right. Cause they thought it was the ultimate symbol of being gay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:52       Well, I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons that was the big reason. Well, so there was probably that, but probably they felt bad that other people had it and they wanted it. And there was other people that just wanted it because they're crazy. Sure. And other people hated themselves. So they wanted, there was also that guy in Germany who was like, I want to cut off someone's Dick and eat it. And they got someone signed up for it. No, he said, I want to, I want someone to cut off my dick and eat it and I want them to eat me. Right. So someone said, sure, let's meet up. Yeah, that's right. I got it wrong. And so the guy cut his dick off and they both shared his dick and then killed the dude and started eating them. And then they arrest him and they didn't know whether to charge it because it was voluntary.

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       Yeah, it's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I'm not a fan, but I mean you still like you can't, that's murders. Like it either is murder or it's not murder. Like if, uh, if you're in a gay relationship with the guy and the guy says, okay, this is what I want you to do, I want you to beat me up and raped me. And you're like, oh, okay. Can I get that in writing? And you write down and once you to beat me up and then, you know, the cops come, he's like, you beat me up. And he raped me. Like, oh bro, listen here. He wrote it right here. He made

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       a video tape. You didn't use you all the video and use your safe word. He said he wanted me to beat him up and play by him. And the cops probably let you go, but you can't murder. Right. You know what I'm saying? Because consensual sex is obs obviously legal. So if you have consensual sex with someone, it's legal. But if you pretend to be fighting them off, right, and then real place you, it's fun. It's roleplay. But murders never roleplay. You know, I found, um, uh, when I was doing research for the book, the National Review, who's my favorite paleontology journal in the late nineties, as the gay rights movement was coming up into mainstream consciousness, they wrote an article comparing the struggle for gay rights to a struggle for necrophilia. They're like, love get a difference. Like if I, and they talked about how right now in the European Union perverts are fighting for the right to be violent toward each other in bed in, in various ways.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       It's like, yeah, it's like rough sex. It's adjacent to vanilla sex. They like it. And now the are the articles are the conservative case for gay marriage. It's like you guys have no fucking shame then and you have no fucking shame now at least be consistent. One of the things that disturbs me greatly today is there is a movement, and I don't know how big it is, but it's a movement for people to try to recognize pedophiles, us as a sexual distinction, as sexual designation rather than a sick disease that similar to being trans or being gay or that some people are just born pedophiles. Well, I think what's important there is it's not just a crime because a crime can be fixed and treated. So I think it is important to understand these people will always psychologically be pedophiles and you're not going to get them to be like, Whoa, uh, straight, you know, hold on.

Speaker 2:          01:27:53       No therapy that's ever been shown that I think it's, I try and make someone who's gay. It's straight. Is it really that, that's my understanding. If that's the case, then is there an argument that we should be more compassionate with them as long as they don't act on that. But that's the danger. Because the other thing, what they don't understand is from their point of view, those kids are giving consent, which they are, right? The kids saying yes. So they're like, look man, that's what's scary. I don't even know if they do. Right. They don't think a statutory raping a thing. And I knew, okay, this, I interned at a place long ago and there was a librarian who worked there like a Guido type, you know, and grow or Guy Guy and years later he was arrested. He was a schoolteacher. He was arrested at an undercover sting trying to meet a kid who he knew was 13 or 12 in a park to try to sleep with him.

Speaker 2:          01:28:46       Right. This was an Jeanine Pirro who later became a Fox commentator. He got out of jail and I see him on Facebook, he's married with kids and it's just like, you think it's fine that that shit scary shit. That's insane. And it's thing to be switched gender too. If you're going for young boys, you're going to go to like regular aged women. I don't see how that would work. Right, right. And this is something that is such a taboo topic that I don't think once you, for a lot of people correctly, once you start talking about kids in sexuality, their hackles res, it is a PC subject. Cause it's like why even introducing this into the conversation where you're going with this, it's a very, very, very slippery slope. Well, if you're trying to say or if they're trying to say that this is something that people are born with, I don't think there's evidence that people just are born that way.

Speaker 2:          01:29:36       I think there's evidence that people become that way from sexual abuse. Yes, that's true too. Absolutely. And they think it's appropriate. Never heard of anybody that grew up in a normal household wasn't abused. Is that the case? I might not in a position to talk about this at all. I think we have probably a very few cases of pedophiles on the record, uh, explaining how they came to this point of view. But he, in either situation born or abuse, I can't see how this is something that's going to be, uh, an emotion level. You're going to be able to turn them away. Well, it's also a super, the idea of that being in your neighborhood. Yes. This is in your neighborhood. You've got this guy who likes to fuck kids and he promises not to do it anymore, but they did a few times. They locked him up in a cage.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       Now he lived down the street and he locked up on a couch where he was traumatized. Also further traumatized, so and also if he promised not to do it, but knowing when he's looking at it, he's checking out my son or my daughter. Yeah. I did not accept to be talking about this today. I know. Of course. That's just the beauty of the show. It's a fucking the, that the human mind can be that it'd be imprinted in your abused when you're younger, that you go on to do that same thing that was horrifically done to you, that that is a common thing that happens with children that may get abused, doesn't make sense to you. It does make sense to me. It's like that way I'm not, I wasn't abused. I was enjoying it. Could be. Right. You know, that that way it takes away the trauma cause it's like, oh this is how I've always been.

Speaker 2:          01:31:03       So it was okay, nothing happened to me and you don't have to deal with the trauma that way. Well that's what my low and when he was talking about being sexually abused as a child. Right. I think that's what he was kind of doing. Oh yeah, he was saying I was the Predator and I w I was going on for the panel. Talk about that in the book because if there was anyone other than Milo people would, because he was older, he wasn't like 12 he was like whatever, 1814 I think he was like, I don't remember how well do you know if he's 18 is fine. It wasn't 18 but it wasn't 12 I think he was a teenager. But if you're young, if it was somebody else, people are we talking about heteronormativity. Right. And it's historically not that weird for an older gay dude to get with a younger gay guy, especially when everyone was closeted to kind of initiate them into the lifestyle. This was a thing, but it's my low now it's, Oh my God, you want pedophilia, blah blah. It's like there's different standards for gay people that frustrate people and that's appropriate and acceptable and people understand that in other contexts. Well the problem is society as the way we understand human beings

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       and the way a person's brain works when you're young, you shouldn't be allowed to make those decisions because sexually in particular you could get coerced. You can. Yes you can get, you can wind up doing something that you don't want to do, that can be straight guys that are 14 years old and her talked into having gay sex by a very charismatic 40 year old man who gives them things. The idea is that this is a bad thing for the boy. It's bad thing cause you wouldn't want to happen to a girl. Why would you want to happen to a boy? But I think it's a very different phenomenon for a 30 year old man to sleep with a 30 year old gay man to sleep with a 16 year old gay man. As far as 30 year old boy. Sure. As opposed to 30 year old gay straight man to sleep with a 16 year old straight girl.

Speaker 3:          01:32:42       I think you can make that argument that it is a little bit different. I still don't think it's okay. I'm not saying it's okay. I'm just saying clearly it's different. It's different and yeah, especially if the boy is like very gay, very obviously gay, which you know everyone or high school, remember it's not a virgin. Right. That true to that first, that first guy for that girl will fuck with her head for her life. For many women. For him it could be, it wasn't his first. Yup. That's a very big difference too. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to be that first guy. That's a lot of work.

Speaker 3:          01:33:14       I don't even mean with gay. I mean it was straight to, I don't think I ever had a virgin of my life. I've never had a virgin. Thank God so much work. I say I connected. You'd be like forever basically be too much work. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, yeah, I should probably clarify. I mean being connected to the upper, it's too significant. You want to be like the third guy. You don't want to be the first car girl has sex with. You were always my first Michael. I'll never forget, I always thought that we were supposed to be together forever and never, because I believe in movies and fairy tales that you were, and I listened to the Queen Songs with a nice lyrics to work chooses. He was concert cheeks, plane, everything is like a movie. Yeah. You uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:33:57       That's a thing, right? Like people do get emotionally attached to romantic stories that they see in movies and they want their life to play out like this fictional narrative. And the left uses this a lot because they'll have all these leftist ideas in culture and movies and that's where a lot of people get their programming. Uh, and then it's like, you know, for example, here's an idea you don't see in culture that people very often knowingly and consciously do the wrong thing. And that happens every day. People know they're doing something fucked up. You don't really see that that much in like TV and movies and that's a right wing message that like, you know, people sometimes are basically evil. Um, and you can run into someone at that point in their life, they're evil. That's a fact. And I'm sure that exists all over the world. Or like it, I, I, it's also evil on a small scale. Like if you're in an office and someone's getting chewed out and they're getting bullied for whatever reason, and you're sitting there and you're keeping your mouth shut, you're not Hitler, but you know, you're doing the wrong thing, but you're trying to protect your job, right? Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       The boss to come down on you let a lot of times that you have that space and you still won't do it. And that's knowingly doing the wrong thing. And I'm not saying you should be thrown in the garbage, but I'm saying people do that all the time. These little sacrifices they make with their conscience. That's true. Yeah. And you don't see that really represented. And that's an important idea for people to understand that people are often weak. Yeah. And always, especially if you're going check to check. Always worried. Yeah. Losing your job. Losing your Gig. Yeah. That's a real big thing with people till I was on vacation once and there's this guy who's a boss and he was there with his employees, employees, family and he was mean to his employees daughter are to watch it. The guy had to take it. He's just talking shit.

Speaker 2:          01:35:38       He to her and it was just, it was really gross cause you can see the dynamic play out. He was just this mean old guy, just really shitty. It was disturbing to see this week man, like just having to accept the fact that this guy is my shitty to his daughter and he was giving her a lecture and berating her and doing it publicly like are the poem God? Is this who you want it to grow up to be? Is this job worth it? It was so gross. I W I wanted to step in. I was like, I just want to tell this guy to shut the fuck up. It's driving me nuts. I remember when I was back before I started me out being an author, I was working at Goldman and it was a very stressful job and they, I had my review and they said, oh, you know, if you have downtime sometimes we see like going online, we want you to help the laptop lab.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       And I just go, no. And she goes, what? I said I wasn't hired to do laptops. I'm not interested in, in learning laptops. And there are, the job is very intense and high stress. So if I have downtime I'm going to, you know, use the downtime. And the look on her face was just like as if I just added myself as a pedophile. What did it mean by use the law? I was doing laptop, the laptop lab, I was doing tech support. So like Microsoft word, Excel. People had problems. They would call on the fly. You've got to have an answer for them. It's very, it's like a quiz show. You're living in quiz show and then there's a laptop lab. People are checking out laptops, they're setting up laptops, which is a very different skillset. Something I didn't really know. Setting up in terms of like downloading.

Speaker 2:          01:37:07       Sure. Yeah. I, you know like where and I didn't know then I still don't know. I didn't, I don't fuck with you. Like, no, it's not my job now I'm not and I'm not interested in working as hard as possible. While also like when you have downtime with did they want you to work extra it, the point is the phone rings or it doesn't ring. Right. It's your job. That's my job. My job's to get off the phone as fast as possible because their problem solved. So there what they were saying was while you were doing this other job and waiting for something to come up, we want you to keep you working specifically different jobs. Correct. Yeah. No, it's corporations, man. That's right. Squeeze that rock. Right. And it's like, why am I busting my ass to make Goldman Sachs that extra $5 of value?

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       Fuck you. And I'm so proud of myself that far. You after that they fired me because I refused to work in Thanksgiving because my great grandma had died. So I wanted you to work on thanksgiving. We were 24, seven but we're 24. It's a, it's a help desk. Oh Wow. But you must've shifts. I was second shift, 4:00 PM to midnight, right? Every night. Monday through Thursday or Friday. Monday, Thursday. Okay. And they go, oh, we're having you in on, um, Thursday during the day, Thanksgiving Day. And I'd promised my and I work second shift. So they wanted me four to midnight then in there at nine. And I said, no, I promised my grandma I'd have Thanksgiving dinner with lunch with her. I could've called my grandmother's schedule. I didn't want to be that guy cause I knew this was one of those, you know, things that like, this is the fork road, a crossroads in your life.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       And they go, we'll find someone else to cover your shift. And I asked, everyone else had plans and they go, well we need you midnight, you know, the second next day for lunch. And I said, no. And they fired me. And I'm very, very glad I did that. And I had lunch with grandma. Her mom had just died or they allowed to fire you for that if it's not your shift. Yeah, of course they are. Of course. Well, no, the shift every week they would get the calendar, right. So this week, right? Oh, I see. So you wasn't, you didn't have a specific shift came Michael, every day you come in at eight o'clock, I usually did. Or forklift when you had holidays, things had to change. And I'm like, well, I don't care. And I, and no regrets. Well worked out. It did. But did you ever think that you'd be like this?

Speaker 2:          01:39:21       Uh, what are you, what do you opened it? I'm a, I'm a, what am I an author? Media personality, I think is the word central though. Immediately I went right to it about myself. I saw that you wanted to be a troll. Like first thing you think on it is like if someone says like, what do you do? You like trouble. Ah, I'm an author now what? Actually, you know what I say? Uh, when people ask me what I do, I say, you know, those, uh, obnoxious people who have a job giving, they're uninformed opinion. That's me. That's what I usually say. Interesting. Yeah. Isn't that funny that that's a job. All you have to do is be kind of entertaining and have an interesting way of looking at things. It's great that this is what I'm talking about being blessed and I don't take it for granted and the fact that like people pay my rent because of my sick burns on Twitter.

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       Unpatriotic Burn, burn. I love my sick birds. And you used to be a Microsoft help representative for Goldman Sachs wanted? Yeah. Was it Microsoft? Just Microsoft or at, yeah, all the Microsoft products. Yeah. Yeah. Do you use windows? I do. Do you? Yeah. You don't use apple? I don't, I you seem like a guy. You seem like I use an android phone too. I haven't enjoyed filling. Ah, I do a little bit of a contrarian. I have a little bit, yeah. Do you like windows? Because the people that use macs are just like following the sheep herd. I use windows because that's what I was professional on, so I haven't changed in all this time. The only thing that bugs me about windows, I have to constantly be updating. You turn that shit off. You have to turn that shit off. Why? Because on the uptake, sometimes it's crashed my computer.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Oh, when it updates, so I'm not rolling. That fear of the computer, we start. How often do you update your software? But what if they fixed like vulnerability? They're going to invent new words. It's fine. It's fine if they get the squiggly line. When I write the word meme, why would I worry about is like vulnerabilities to the system. I have everything backed up in three places. Oh, I'm a crazy person like that. Okay, so you're ready to rock and do you run some run a VPN? No. No. Ooh. Then I'm, and I'm piloting that shit too. I would you, I would you say that on there? I'll shit, they're gonna. I think I'm going to get swatted down and get you gotta get Swat. A real pirate. They're gonna fucking [inaudible] me and Madonna with the eyepatch. Madonna has an iPod. Yeah. You didn't see that thing.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       See, I think it's a fashion thing, but it could be a glaucoma thing. One just got an eyepatch. Mm. Yeah. Maybe she's just a fan of slick Rick. Do you know who's you know my favorite comedian? You'll hamburger. Yeah, sure. I love Neil. He's my absolute favorite comedian. And one of his jokes is, what do you call a senior citizen who can't help but expose their genitalia in public? But Donna, and he says it all sad. Oh, he's got such a weird act. He's so funny. Oh, he's the best. It's a strange, strange act. Well, he's just basically like Tony Clifton. Yeah. As as a stand up, but better but better material. Much better material. Better presentation. I talk about Kauffman in the book because he's the first troll. [inaudible] Andy Kaufman was the first chore. Yeah, I agree. And there's this great, he had this character, Tony Clifton.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       People don't know. He's just like angry lounge singer. And Tony did this bid. He would perform, I think it was in Atlantic city. And he said, hey, my wife died. Whenever I look at my daughters, you know Stephanie's eyes, I see her. So that's seven and come out and do a song, sits on his lap, they sing her voice cracks, he smacks her across the face. He goes, are you fucking it up? The audience is booing and goes, don't blow it. You just got to make her cry more. And it wasn't even a kid. It's an actress. You know what I mean? Quarterly. That is just beautiful. Trolling. Yeah. Well he used to cough means to go on stage and sing the mighty mouse theme song, but just the mightiness part. Yeah, you, you're welcome to save the day. He did the special, and I think it was ABC, refuse to air for two years.

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       And one of the parts, it was like peewee's playhouse, where piece piece, play a house. He had a girl from sound of music and she's like, oh, she's starting to, you know, restart a career. He called. It has been quarter and she comes out. He goes, so at what point did you realize you weren't gonna make it and show this, this, it's just, she's in on it, you know, but it's just, you're sitting there, you're like, oh my God. Even if you're in on it, it's kind of staying. And she's like, Oh, real, I'm trying to restart my career. He goes, well, I don't think it's going to happen for you, but good luck. And you're just like, oh my God. Well, how about when he was wrestling women? That was this thick of sexual thing, but yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, but it was also trolling, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Was screaming and yelling

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and I know that part, but yeah. Yeah. But I did that. I'm not a fan of the fucking people at the wrestling arenas. They wanted to kill him. Yeah. They wanted to fucking kill him. They thought it was real. I got Dolph Ziggler coming up on my show tomorrow. Um, and he's like, he come, came out once dressed as the undertaker and the audience, what he pulls off the head where like bullying goes. Oh, you thought it was really good about him. You only see once a year, so he fucking comes dressed this other wrestlers just to troll the audience. I love that shit. Well, when you got to think also when coffin was doing this, there was real discussion as to whether or not wrestling was real. Yeah. This is a different time. Yeah. It's amazing. You can look back at these arguments that people are like, oh yeah, yeah, it's totally fucking real.

Speaker 3:          01:44:34       He was taken. Do you know? It's really though, what's fascinating though, because with the rise of the MMA, yeah, I just saw like the WWE admass square garden. We know what the dynamics of fighting it looks like. Right? Right. But the wrestlers, it's still the same motions. It's like we know that if you hit someone here how they actually react because we've seen it thousands of times for real, but you guys are still like if someone punches you in the neck, you're not going to be passed out on the floor. Will also somewhere else who's got upset because I was explaining that a figure four leg lock doesn't work. Not only does it not work, but you're setting yourself up for, he'll hook. Okay. I'm like, let me explain. Yeah, and they were mad like how dare you disrespect for wrestling. What? It's also like if you close slides, someone that's going to hurt you.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       No, no, no. That's not true. If someone 200 pounds hits me here, it's not going to hurt my shoulder. No, no, looks fine. Okay, then not know what the fuck I'm talking about this issue. I'll fuck you up with a clothes line. How that's like, dude, you just hitting someone in the head with your forearm. You could fuck somebody able to close on really a hundred percent in the neck one, but it's not going to hurt. You know? I mean mine. Okay. You haven't taught you punched. Somebody could break your I'm sure, but no. Are you close on someone? That shit's totally legit. Okay, let me that people get code from that all the time. It's like a, like a leg. Like if you kick someone in the neck, right? Like if someone gets net kicked, they go out. Sure. You could do that with your arm. Same thing.

Speaker 3:          01:45:58       Same motion. Your Shin is stronger for sure than your forearm, but especially this way. See, there's two bones, right? There's the owner and what's the Tibia? Fibia? No, that's your leg. Okay. I don't know. Tibias I broke the fibula. The, the, the smaller one or the Tibia. Which one? I broke the little one. Which one's the Big One? Which one's your Shin? Your tea. Your femurs. The top. And then I left Fibula. I think it's the fibula. I broke. I broke the one. What's that? Tibi is the bigger one. Yeah, I broke the smaller one. Okay. It's fucking gross. It was really painful and they couldn't do anything about it. It just, it was just a hairline fracture. Oh, see that guy just close line by this dude. Boom. Okay. Wow. But the cop doesn't know how to land it. Look, you went down with it too. He probably broke his fucking arm. That's how you fuck that up top. Broke his arm. See,

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       it's barely using his arm. Oh, it definitely works out. Okay. Yeah, like in the UFC. Well, the thing is like my point was I think the big, where's the big bone? Where's the little bone? I think in the front this happens all the time. Guys get kicked in. This bone breaks, well actually sometimes both of the bones break, but it with a spinning back fist when they're landing at a lot of times they're landing it with their, with their forearm, what not landing it with the actual fist. What about Randy Savage? If you're jumping out the top row on your elbow when you break your elbow or kill the person, if you're landing on his neck, you will hurt him for sure and you're slamming down the elbow. It's definitely got more force, but when you're getting on top of someone and you're smashing with elbows, which you can do an MMA, you can generate incredible amounts of forest.

Speaker 1:          01:47:39       If you ever watch a guy work out on the heavy bag where the heavy bags on the ground, they worked the ground and pound, just boom, boom. I mean you think about that being your fucking head. It's incorrect, but, and if you're 200 pounds to 50 jumping off a rope on an elbow, it's a small point. I would think that would, I mean, break something in there. It could, it could just really hitting him though. He's, yeah, he doesn't hit him chest, but if that were for real, but just that, first of all, the reality is just that alone. I mean, even though he only liked bounces off of them a little bit. Yeah, he's, he's just got it down where he lands first with the feet. If you watch the impact, if you slow down the feet, land first, and then he's absorbing all of it and just, he lands the, the, the side of his body on the guy's chest, but it's a secondary impact.

Speaker 1:          01:48:26       Boom. See? Oh he collapses to, it's like a one, two and he doesn't hit him that hard, but he hits him hard enough that it sucks. Like it ain't fun to be around, so it's a tough gig. But that shit would work. Clothes lining, someone would work. It's just not ideal. The ideal thing to do for someone's, it's just palm them in the face. If you get close lie on, you could also just pop them in the face. That's that. The good thing about the palm and the face is that first of all, it's extremely difficult to break your palm like this. Think about what you can do. Okay, this is the Oak table and I'm slamming my hand into it. I have no pain at all. You can't do that with any other part of your body. You can't kick it like that. If with your Shin, you know you can't punch it like that with your knuckles.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       Even your elbow or kind of hurts more than your palm. The Palm, you can really fucking smack the funny bone to. Yes. Yeah, but you could fuck somebody up on an elbow and though sure, like in Moitai it's one of the eight points of contact, but a palm strike. If someone's charging at you, just smack him. You could have a tremendous impact on your hand and still get away with it and knock someone out. John Hackleman who is a chuck Liddell's former trainer, trainer of um, um, I actually current trainer for, he still works out trainer Glover to sharer just one of the best guys in MMA. He, uh, has these little videos on his Instagram, I think it's the pit or pit master pitmaster on Instagram talking about street self defense things and he's always advocating hitting people with your palm so people break their hands, all the tonic.

Speaker 1:          01:49:53       Isn't that the whole thing? He hit him in the nose to kind of, that's not real. That's not real. The idea of drive the bone up, you'll break their nose. Not that you're gonna kill them, but like that's the easiest self defense anywhere. Even the side of the head. But the idea is hitting them with the palm. I thought you were going to say when I said that's not real. There was one where kids, it was like a, in a karate movie, the guy would hit the palm up to the nose. The nose bone would go into the brain. It would kill some ones that happened in like a Seagal movie. Smash him in the nose. I thought you were gonna say that, but the idea is that you could just without worry of consequences, you could palm strike someone in the face like really hard and never break your hand.

Speaker 1:          01:50:29       A regular person throwing a punch, you have a real good chance of breaking your hand. Okay. Real good chance. Like if you crack someone in the forehead, most likely you're gonna break your hand or your wrist or something else. But with your palms you can just fucking waylay somebody. You could smack the shit out of somebody, but you're going to look kind of silly. There was, uh, an organization, the MMA more organization back in the early days called pancreas. I think he might be still around, but they have modified rules. But pancreas back in the day they were wrestling shoes with Shin pads and they wore like little tiny little speedos and they would smack each other with their hands so they'd kick and punch and do submission techniques. It was fairly crude in comparison to today's MMA. Sure. But we got to see a lot of leg locks back then.

Speaker 1:          01:51:13       And there was, there was some fishy fights too. But my point is like boss route and was the first guy figured out how to really fuck people up with palm strikes. And what he did is he has a really flexible wrists and he's a bad ass striker. So he learned how to pull his hands way back and he would just throw them like punches. He would just do the same motions that he would do with a punch, but just smash guides with his, with his palms. And he was lighting people up like a Christmas tree in Pancrase with that horrific to what he fucked. He came out a bunch of people with his palms. Huh? See if you've watched boss Rutan Kao put put boss route and Kaos Funai he catered food [inaudible] who is a like an elite MMA fighter who was a Hixon Gracie's last opponent and Hickson was fighting MMA.

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       But for Nakia I think started out in pancreas and boss route and code them. And the way K Odom was like, like like a punch, but he was doing it with his palms, just smashing people. So it's like your hand, like there's a lot of things that you think wouldn't work. Clothes lines, one of them. That shit would work. Okay. That's my point. Not The hockey talk. Bands move though. What's the a hundred on a shake? Rattle and roll and it just flips him on his back. It's like, why does this even hurt? You don't remember this. You didn't watch wrestling in the eighties no. Well, how about the DDT here? So here's bacilli that knee, but the knee, you have a backup before that. Back Up. Before that. Here, watch. Watch how he's hitting him. He's so, he's using like a boss was a fucking gorilla back. They look the size of them.

Speaker 1:          01:52:44       See smacking shit out of him. He's using his head. She always hitting him with his [inaudible]. He's thrown them like punches. But this knee is what did it. Boom. Yeah. Boss was a beast, man. He was a fucking beast. He was probably the first really elite striker that we saw an MMA where you're like, whoa, like this is what can happen. Like when he was kicking people in Pancrase, everybody was like, whoa. Like this is this guy can fucking kick. Like you're seeing a lot of guys who are kicking that were kind of like karate bay. Maybe they didn't have as much power, but boss was, he was a Dutch kickbox. He was smashing people. Boom. He looks scary. He was a bad motherfucker. Bad motherfucker. He won the UFC heavyweight title. He was the first guy ever, I think in my recollection to win a title off of his back by uh, from strikes.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       He fought Kevin Random and Kevin ran him as a badass wrestler, kept taking them down and boss was beating the shit out of him from the bottom, throwing elbows and, and they gave him a decision, which a lot of people disagreed with. But I was like, man, you look at the volume of strikes landed then way more you, you just, just being on top side. Good enough. You have to actually do something with the position. Huh? Okay. This is not a subject expert road. Yeah, yeah. Hey, yeah, this is, this is the old school, but you got to really look at whole body kick. Fuck, fuck people up, man. Boss. Ruin was no joke, man. Dude, he was fucking people up. They had, nobody had seen anything like that. This, those guys just couldn't strike like that. They didn't have that kind of power. You'd see the impact, but then, you know, like all things, it caught up.

Speaker 1:          01:54:24       Yeah. Oh good Lord. The USC, then they got, um, there was some elite fighters to start showing up in the UFC or Lando Veit smashing machine. Mark. Mark. Yeah. Well he was different man. He was a wrestler. He was a wrestler slash science project. Like, yeah, he was used up real good. God, that's to put it mildly. Yeah. There's a great documentary on the special machine. You saw it. Yeah. It's amazing. It caught him. They, they were that documentary, the purpose of it was initially to catch him as the scariest fighter on the planet. This guy who was just this Goliath who just dominating people in Japan, but in the process of documenting it, he was falling apart. That's him. When he was his biggest, he would say his, his neck would start at his ears and he was very skillful as well. I mean just really gives all American wrestler before that, right? The elite wrestler and um, just, just gigantically that upper left hand picture. Upper left. Look at that one. Same One. Yeah, but click on that. That's the one I started with. No, why is it? No, that's different. It's very different. The same photo. No, it's not. It's just different effects. Photo. Yeah, but look at them. But that one looks like shit. Go to the other one again. That's a different version of it. Look at that fucking Jesus Christ. That is insane. The fact that a person could get to look like that.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       That is insane. There's guys that look like that at my gym. Fuck you all at Harvard fitness are listening to this show in the locker room while my scrawny ass is right there. And you don't even notice me. You wonder like what? It's like walking around looking like that. Well, you can find out if you took all those same steroids, but they're also like six, you know? Yeah. You would do a mini version of that. Yeah. Yeah. We're likely priests. Yeah. Do you lift weights? Yeah. What kind of Shit do you do? I have a split, uh, six days a week. Do you have a trainer? A yeah. Oh, look at you like a wolf. You try shout out to Michael Wolf. Yeah, he's like a deadlift guy. Yeah, he's a dead lift. But it's also important for me psychologically and for people who are depressed or anxious.

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       Uh, I've sometimes have a lot of downtime. So if I go to the gym, I can tell my brain I'm objective Lee, a better person than yesterday and I did something today. So it really helps with keeping you mentally grounded. I'm never going to get jacked, but I could see, I learned this from um, Matt Hughes now. He was the first one to take me to Jim. Really? Yeah. Matthew first want to take you to a author author's book and I realized I don't have to look like Mark Kerr. I could still look like a better version of me. Yes. And when you have that realization, it's, it's very liberating. The mental health benefits and people need to realize that. And the thing is other people who are like, really, like the first day I went, I was all nervous and I know what I'm doing and there was a guy I wish I could thank him.

Speaker 3:          01:57:11       He's like, are you done with this machine? And I'm like, yeah. He goes, thanks brother. I'm like, all right. No one hears judging you. Everyone's doing their own shit and if you're, if you're happy, you're working out and if you're fat, everyone's cheering you on. Yeah, yeah. They were like, fuck yeah. You're getting good for, you know, the opposite of what people would think. Yeah. So no one cares. Uh, it's, I really recommend it. Yeah. There's a lot of gyms have a good culture of support, a good culture of encouragement. You know, like this is the reason why a lot of people that are on Instagram are fitness people that are also motivational. Yeah. This is the culture of these communities. Like when you see people doing reps, like, come on, come on. You got it. You got it. You got it. Like that sort of support.

Speaker 3:          01:57:53       Is it, there's something too, there's endorphins that get released when you're all pushing each other together. I mean this one of the big rushes of martial arts training is that you're, you're pushing each other, you work out together and then afterwards over you just, everything seems to be more normal and I seems more rational and I have people follow me on Twitter, Insta, like Jack paypal and they give me advice and, and they're very supportive that, yes, and that's the thing, that's the real big misconception I guess from those movies. The sales of Rent Rom, Rom coms will tell you that the guy who's like a big guy's a bully and sometimes he is, but most of the people who were like serious about fitness, they want other people to be like, come on this, this'll be great for you. Yeah. I think most people's experience with bullies is really high school stuff, right?

Speaker 3:          01:58:36       It's like jocks in high school and lot of them are just, as we were saying, insecure and a lot of them are also probably, it's probably their experience experiencing at home from their dads. And I think that's changed a lot because thanks to the Internet now. I think the jocks respect the nerds a lot more. When I was working with Hughes and I met all those fighters, they could not be friendlier or more like, Hey, you're, you're doing your thing. I do my thing. I can relate to that. That's awesome. So there was no, uh, I'll look at this pussy or whatever like that, you know. Well, fighters are a lot nicer than people think, but there, cause they're so disciplined is that for sure. And they know what it's like to get their ass kicked. And it's humbling muscle. Jamo who's a famous, a karate guy, he, uh, he said it's not that fighters are any nicer, is kind of Tika. He was calling it, you know, karate practitioners were any nicer. It's just they're tired from training.

Speaker 3:          01:59:31       He might be right, but they, they do behave nicer because of that. It's, it's both. But I think it's also one of the things I love about the Internet is that if you're doing your thing now, people respect someone else's doing their own weird thing as opposed to when we were kids, there'd be that one Weirdo. Like I had this tweet. There's two types of people, right? If you learn someone is a Guinea pig breeder, there's two approaches. You're weird. What the Fuck's wrong with you? Or sit down and tell me everything and I'm very much, and people who follow me are the second one. It's like you're doing your thing. It's gives you joy and passion. I've never heard of it. Let me know. I want to know too that I watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain's old show was called no reservations and he was in, I forget what country it was, but these people bread Guinea pigs for food.

Speaker 3:          02:00:18       Oh yeah. Sounds like Erica cabbies. Yeah. They had Guinea pigs running around the house or they were all over the place. Yeah. And then when they wanted to cook something, they reached down, grabbed Guinea pig, just picked it up and killed it, cooked it all the other kidney pigs and you fucking know. Oh yeah. They said domestic. They're nearly dumb, but they don't, it's, it's, it's a good argument for eating Guinea pigs so they don't seem to miss their friend. I just got, uh, someone just paypaled me a contribution. 300 bucks, Adam. And he says, go out to dinner or buy something stupid. Probably Guinea pig. Hold on. Not Better. If someone says this is for stupid things. I'm like, all right. It's an ardor. It's your money. So I bought some stupid things. You some money I got, I got this. And I'm like, elephant is unethical.

Speaker 3:          02:01:05       Mm. There's, they recognize themselves and mirror, they have a social structure. This is draft. It's stupid. I got draft a leather wallet. Let me see that. There you go. Wow. But it's nice and it's stupid. Wraps are so nice. They're, they're dumb. They're like cows or that's dumb. They're just dumb. They're dumb. They're dumb. Are you sure? I'm positive to run some tests on. My friend owns my friend's parents, each own a zoo and I've gone, I've gone with him to different zoos. Drafts are very dumb, but they're so peaceful that they let little kids feed them at the zoo. That's one of the only animals where they let people feed them. That's true.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       And they just reach out with their tongue. Like I'll never forget that my daughter was like to take it into the zoo and her giggling and laughing. When the naysayers, the big crazy tongue comes out and grabs the lettuce, they can clean their ears with their tongue boob. Yeah. Um, I would, that was a joke that I used to have about how they are the only animal that I could point to. That's a wild animal that doesn't seem to have any problem with domestication. Yeah. When they're at the zoo, that like another day with no lions and just strolling around. Did you ever say that to eat though that blue planet where the lines are trying to kill the giraffe and the desert and she's just kicking him in the face? Dude. Shit, they kick them and break their fucking jaws. It's really dangerous for lions when they fuck with zebras or eat your ass drab zebras as well.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       But whenever they fuck with any animal with hubs, that's probably one of the reasons why they have hooves. Yeah. It's like a weapon. Same like they have antlers. I mean it certainly helps them traverse difficult terrain and helps them run, protects her feet. Where do you, where do you draw the line when it comes to like leather or different animals? It's a good question. Yeah. Um, I, I've gotten very, very interested in elephants, you know, in terms of like their social structure and what they're like and learning about how intelligent they are and how long their memory is. And I don't want to have anything to do with elephant leather or ivory prebate a queue a long time ago that had a elephant ear as a wrap. Okay. And I didn't think anything of it, but now I think, yeah, I, I, that's my line.

Speaker 1:          02:03:10       I like, they have elephant wallets and I was like, no, I'm not comfortable with this. Here's the thing, man. Pigs are super fucking smart. Pigs are real sweet. And when you domesticate them, like people have domesticated pigs that as they're well fed, they behave a lot like dogs. The only difference being of course if you fall in the pig pen, they will fucking eat you. Yeah. And they had to often, that happened. That's a very common way for farmers to die. They fall in the pig pen in the file, like scraps at clothes and like, oh my God, I'm just a puddle of blood. My Buddy, the fuck is left there. Yeah. So I know now, thankfully they're coming out with this kind of synthetic food, synthetic amaze people know that mimics pork or chicken. Oh, mimicking it's actual chicken cells or pork cells or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:03:54       Yes. Yes. And that's going to be a great day. Yeah. That brings me the, the beyond burger that people keep. It googled this cause I want to make sure this is true because someone sent me this, I didn't have the time to check, uh, beyond meat, uh, test positive for glyphosate, glyphosate. Glyphosate is roundup masonic hall. It's very fucking dangerous that trying to pretend it's not. But meanwhile the addition out fucking lawsuits when one couple got, was it $2 billion, they got a $2 billion ruling against Monsanto and another guy got 5 million to 2 billion cause they got cancer being pesticides. I'm like, yeah, give me the, I'll drink this shit. I've got a good lawyers were big, they're probably going to lose. And I mean that seems like a lot of money. Yeah, of course. Um, but I was reading

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       that uh, that, you know, fits a, it's a meat based in a non meat based Burger that's supposed to taste pretty similar to me. I haven't had one yet, but what I'm saying is now they figured out how to take yeah. Sales and replicate that it actually is meat. No. Right. No animals being killed. Right. Which is the ideal. I just wonder if there's any, it's dangerous for you, but this glyphosate thing, I need to find out if this is correct. That's the only reason why I brought it up. I just remembered. And I think it's important for people to have, this is one of the best things about that whole kind of a Paleo whole foods situation of no way. If you're going to act in a certain way towards your food, know what you're doing and be happy to draw that line about, okay, what are you comfortable with and defend your decision.

Speaker 3:          02:05:18       Yeah. Yeah. What, what are you willing to kill? You know, uh, my friend Chris Pratt? Hell yes. Um, he's got a farm, he's got his own thing that he does and he takes lamb and you know, he, he puts the rod on their head and yeah, and puts him to sleep and they have no idea what's going to happen. And then they just die instantly. And he made this like really detailed post on Instagram about it and people got super upset with them. You know, that he talked about this as a peaceful thing and that he has these animals that he loves and cares for and you can see pictures of him like touching them and holding them and then later they're packaged up as meat. And I'm like, but, but you've, you saw just a steak, you wouldn't have a problem with it. Like if someone said, look, I cook the steak, you'd get a lot of people are like, Ooh, that looks good.

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       But if it's like I killed this animal and now I'm going to cook it, people are like, you're a monster. Everyone has to other than getting hit by a car son. And people have to put down their dogs and their cats. Yeah. So maybe this is not, and that lamb is being bred for that purpose and it's being done painlessly. That's the important thing. And I'm sure that Lam had a good life and it wasn't a factory crowded shoulder to shoulder existence is torture situation. Yeah, I'm sure. But it's a very quick life, you know. And Lamb is a baby lambs, a baby. She nature's about us eating babies. Yeah, I have no, I haven't had mutton. I haven't had like a sheep, sheep, you know, that's such a British thing. And it's always like in these old storybooks you read. But like now, I don't think he'd get become adult unless they're for, they're for or their hair.

Speaker 3:          02:06:50       Well, I, I've had wild sheep. My Friend Remy, Remy Warren, he gave me some, um, some, um, wild sheep. Um, backstrap it was very good. Some wild sheep that he killed. I'm going to, while I'm here, I'm big on dry. Um, hagfish have you ever had that? That's that weird fucking slimy thing at the bottom. The ocean. How do they cook that? I, it's Korean barbecue. There's one place here that has it. I like, oh, super legit Korean barbecue. Yeah. They're cooking. Hagfish yeah. While I'm cooking it, I guess technically. What does it taste like? Like I haven't tried it yet. I can't wait. What's the reports? Uh, not that good. I'm not surprised to like sign me up. Well, I like, since I have a zoology background, I like, I'm like Noah, but I want to eat at two of every animal, you know? Have you had yet? I

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       have it. It's tasteless. It's weird plastic. Yeah. It's the sauce that hasn't chest. Yeah. Strange. I ate at a restaurant that's in the win. Yeah. It's in the win and it's the only five star Chinese restaurant in the country or in North America. It's insanely good. Like you realize like wow, it's true. Like you don't see a whole lot of gourmet, right? Like super high end Chinese restaurants. What? Did you have anything weird there? Yeah, I had that. I had jellyfish cucumber had no, I didn't have that. I had abalone. That was really, I was not that. A lot of times it's like credit cards. Abalone. Yeah. It wasn't the taste. Yeah. I've had abalone before and I liked it. I liked it. I don't, I don't love it. It's expensive too. What do you got Jamie? So from a couple of articles I just found the, the issue seems to be, and pea protein, which is what is used to make these burgers and dark.

Speaker 1:          02:08:27       What I've found about what you were saying is the impossible Burger actually tested 11 times higher when tested for glyphosate than the beyond Meat Burger, which is, there's two different versions of what's in very light weight. I eat pea protein, protein chips every day. Is that a problem? So there's an article that you're getting some glyphosates. What does that mean? Bloomberg not good says pea protein could have its own concerns. Detox project, a research organization looking into pesticides of glyphosate has been looking into it for every year. It says that there is an issue, there's hot, we can hardly find a clean protein anywhere. The results like those for other products tested for the popular pesticides aren't pretty. It's a very, we can hardly find the clean pea protein source anywhere. Jesus Christ's all got glyphosate. There's, but I still don't know what glyphosate does to Kate glyphosate.

Speaker 1:          02:09:15       This was the idea. Okay, and please Google this because the argument was glyphosate is great because it just kills the weeds and bacteria and it doesn't kill people. You actually drink it with a problem they're saying is, no, no, no. You have bacteria in your body, so if you're taking in glyphosate, you're killing the bacteria in your body. It might not kill you, but it's not good for you and it fucks up your system. Okay. This is the argument, I guess, that they use to present in court. They must have used this to, to get the jury to award them $2 billion in damage. Cancer. Yeah. Yeah. That's not a Monsanto parent company. Bayer fee faces thousands of roundup cancer cases after $2 billion verdict. 13,000 cases right now. Yeah. Listen man, this thing, I don't know. See there's this, this is what the problem, first of all, I'm a moron.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       I don't know anything about any of the science behind this. When I read this, I see two different camps. Just like so many other things. I see people saying there's no evidence. This is just, they're all hysteria. But is that the people that work for Bayer, is that like their PR firm that's putting this out there to try to like alleviate people's concerns and stopped some lawsuits in their tracks? They try and do influence public opinion on this or is there real that shows that this stuff is very bad for you, but there's definitely a bunch of people online that are telling you that it's horrible for you here, exposure to glyphosate based herbicides in a risk for non Hodgkin Lymphoma, a Meta analysis and supporting evidence. I don't want to switch up my pea protein. [inaudible] good bro. [inaudible] hemp protein. Good. That should get tested too then.

Speaker 1:          02:10:53       What am I saying? Just start eating steak. I can't, it's hard for me to eat much. What's the problem, bro? That's ever happened? Do you know who David Frank is? Is that his name? Hold on, I'll send it to you. Jamie is a fucking hilarious guy. Who is, uh, this, uh, big, uh, steroid it up bodybuilder. Dude. That's also very, very funny. Okay. And uh, see the one does the bro science videos. He's very, he's bro life talking like this. Let me, let me find his, uh, seeking to get me all swole. I sent it to these guys to, uh, the, my, um, I have a fight companion Twitter feed that's going, I'm not Twitter feed. Um, text message group text. Here it is. Robert Frank. Hold on a second.

Speaker 1:          02:11:46       Abortion. Yeah, it's here. I'm going to send this to you. Hang on a second. Do you know what it is, Jamie? Robert Frank. Six one five private. It is, yeah. Oh No. Oh, so he's got a sign up. Got million followers, but like I don't follow him. Oh, it's one of them deals because he says a lot of crazy shit. All right, so, um, how long does it take to be the length? Fabulous yet. Okay. Hold on a second. I'm going to text it to you right now. How long does it usually take for what those people, they have to be either one of those dorks and sit in front of the computer or someone's doing it for, yeah. Yeah. He must've allowed me in. All right. I'm sending it to you right now. Bam. Okay. It went through. Do you go through anyway? It's hilarious in post. It's hilarious. This is no taking anything out.

Speaker 1:          02:12:44       No need to. No need to try and make it smoother. It's hard to put the calories down though, is my point. No, it's not open your mouth chew swallow what? Your baby, your, your grandfather would have died for a steak like this. Jesus Christ. Listen to yourself. You saying all this shit that you would get mad at people if they were saying about any other subject. It's hard. It's hard to eat all that food. It's hard. It's hard to get by in this world. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard to get up every morning. It's hard. I work hard. I work hard. How fucking hard is the deed steak? Look at me, Bro. Just eat it. Cook it. Eat it. Put some salt on it. D licious maybe like some steak sauce. Do whatever you gotta do to get that steak down your stomach, sir. Get some grass fed.

Speaker 1:          02:13:24       Grass Fed, grass fed, grass raised. It's got a darker, richer taste. It seems like a lot of work. Grass Fed. No, just cooking steaks all the time. Slot that hard. You learn how to do it. It's easy. Is it? Get yourself a nice grill. All right. I'm in Brooklyn though. You're in Brooklyn. You got a yard? No, no. Oh, hang on Brooklyn. Come on. Get a cast iron skillet. I can get one. That's all I need. It's not going to think of my house. Yeah, it'll stick up your house. Okay, meg steak. Yeah, go man's house. Smell good. People will be like, tease that Michael's live in. Good. He's got the steak. Life could be knocking on doors that butcher box bros at grass fed and legal. Oh look, just cut it for me. Let me see what you got. You got a medium rare. Oh yeah. Kosher salt. Yeah. Crushed. Well, I got to be kosher so it's a thicker, so that's why I use, I like the pyramid salt. What's that? It's shaped like a pyramid that crystals. Yeah, they do it a certain way. No, it's crunchier. If you want to cook a steak like a man correctly, you need to kosher salt. Okay. How many, how much grams of protein or a steak? A lot. So I need to know, shut your fucking mouth.

Speaker 1:          02:14:31       I followed my macros every day. Oh, do you? Are you really getting serious about that? I've always been cause I have an eating disorders, so this is a way to put that in a good direction. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, you'd have to look, I mean it's, it's certainly more for wild game, which is mostly what I eat than it is for a store bought meat. Okay. But store bought meat, I would, I would guarantee you that there's more nutrients in grass fed meat. I don't know if there's more protein. That doesn't seem to make sense. But if you look at like it could be more protein because they might be less fat or whatever, but more fat. Yes, that's true too. Of course it would be more protein if it was leaner. Yeah. For the same amount of ounces. Yeah. But there's also, um, a bunch of other shit am tour and essential fatty acids that exist and grass fed meat.

Speaker 1:          02:15:17       It's all good. It's all good stuff. Okay, let's get some state stop with the pea protein, bro. Okay. Sorry. Approach. I'm not eating your people. It might be fucking you up, man. I wonder, I wonder how many people are getting fired. What are the dangers of consuming glyphosate other than non Hodgkin's lymphoma? Maybe this is what you're seeing over and over and people kill my gains. There was my date. I don't think pea protein is helping your gains. There's something about knowing that you're getting all your protein from peas, all of it. Some of it just makes you 60 grams a day.

Speaker 1:          02:15:48       What do you got to an endocrine disruptor. Oh, that's no joke. That's what glyphosate, oh, fuck. Liver disease. Birth defects, reproductive problems and animals. Oh Christ. What does this from a just typed in dangerous of glyphosate. I don't want to get you, I don't want to get a birth defect. I don't know what that is. Pull up whatever you RTKL is fine. It might be horseshit. We should otherwise. Dot Org. You ask us right to know, right? To know that doesn't, that doesn't mean anything. Like what does it, what does that based on Virginia, look at that top news on the right trial for Monsanto. Hometown. It's all Monsanto. Everything's Monsanto. This is another genomist just news stories from today. They're all over the news. Right? But you gotta be carry this. This is not real story though. Look at all the top news is all my contact.

Speaker 1:          02:16:38       I bet you it's just some, it should have, uh, some dude, GMOs are low. What is it? Or Litigation. Oh, they're litigating. This is from the lawyers. Mm. Could be. Yes. Pushing for Truth and transparency. This is the lawyers. Yeah, the food system. This is looks, and if there are $2 billion rulings, you can bet your sweet ass shit. People that are swarming on this subject, what would it be? A better source of information? I don't know, man. It's a good question. What do we got here, Alex? Let's call Alex Salmond. Kill. No, he, I dunno if he's up on food stuff. He knew about the plastic wrap that gives you racist. You're kind of estrogen ones that makes the frogs get scientific American. Yeah. Okay. That's good. That's good. That's good. 2009 weed whacking herbicides. It's deadly to human cells. Used in gardens, farms in parks around the world.

Speaker 1:          02:17:29       The weed killer roundup contains an ingredient that can suffocate human cells in a laboratory. Researchers say, yeah, so we'll kill my gains if it's suffocating myself. Fuck that. Whatever that is. Whatever, whatever has that on it. Fuck that stuff. Okay. I'm going to go more weight than carnivore. Die. That's your move. Okay. And I'd like Jordan Peterson. Jordan on cardboard. Yes. Okay. Over a year. Huh? It's helped him tremendously. How so? Well, first of all, and intellectually he says it's really alleviated a lot of his autoimmune issues that he thinks we're slowing him down and wearing him out and making him tired and he has more energy for things. He says he's at his peak intellectually and he credits that. A lot of that through this diet. He's lost 50 pounds. All he eats is meat. When I'm saying all eats is meat, I mean that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:14       What about drinks? I brought stuff. There is none. He doesn't have any of that. He drinks water and he eats meat. And for the below you all what? I've heard this, I heard that. Okay. You know what else I heard? I heard that uh, the food pyramid was all green at the bottom and that's not the case anymore, right? There's a lot of shit. And I'm not saying this is for everybody because it's not for everybody. It's not even good for everybody. There's a lot of people, if they ate meat every day, all day, probably be terrible for them. But for some people in PR, it seems that particularly people with autoimmune disorders, they achieve some, at least anecdotally, some really positive results. Um, Jordan Peterson has gone as far as to take, I think he took three blood tests when he had a one year in for insurance purposes and which things showed because you know, obviously you're going to ensure a guy who's 55 years old just eat steak all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:19:03       Like, Oh my God, this guy's going to die. No, everything's fine. Everything's healthy. Um, no coronary artery disease, no plaque, no cholesterol levels are all fine. Everything's fine. This sounds like it would be exorbitant though too. Financially. Yeah. I'm maybe not the cheapest way to eat the world. I mean, you can get Costco steaks. You get, uh, some supermarkets have cheaper cuts. I'd really depends on what know. You could also eat just ground beef that's not as bad. You don't eat as much. And that's one of the reasons why when you're on a, what they call an elimination diet, one of the, one of the coolest, you eliminate base basically everything that might be fucking with you except the one thing that you can consume easily. And this is one of the things that they're calling the carnivore diet elimination and elimination diet. Um, when you do, do you wind up eating less food, which is one of the reasons why these people just eat steak and wind up losing weight.

Speaker 1:          02:19:55       They don't, they don't take in any car. Let's they're off basically. It also kind of Atkins if they're not taking a car, sort of, but there's a thing called glucogenesis and uh, like not necessarily sort of Atkins but sort of Quito, but it's more Atkins than Kido and that, that Atkins Diet works. You stick to it, it does work. And when you stepped away and when your piece starts to smell, it's great. That's when you know the party started. You're in Quito. Genesis. Great. Yeah, ptosis, ptosis. And when you're in Ketosis, man, you really do have energy throughout the day because your body is not craving carbohydrates. You don't have this up and down blood sugar crash. The thing about the carnivore diet is it's not even ketogenic really. I mean you're in Ketosis sometimes, but you're not eating that much fat. You're just eating a lot of meat and a lot of it with fat.

Speaker 1:          02:20:43       Some of it without fat. That's not ketosis is look, when you have no carbs, it's not a function. No. Here's why, because when your body eats a lot of steak and you don't have any carbohydrates, you, your body does something called glucogenesis where it'll convert stake into glucose so it actually convert protein into glucose and it actually knock you out of Ketosis. If you take in too much protein and not enough fat, it's got a portion. Ketosis is I think somewhere in the 80% range. If you you, you should be consuming like 80% of your calories from fats. He'd be kind of amazed and actually can fuck with some people's gains. They don't think they're getting enough protein because they're getting a lot of fat in a smaller amount of protein, like less grams of protein might not be ideal in terms of like a physical performance for athletes they think.

Speaker 1:          02:21:33       But when you, when you do do that and you just eat steak, your body says, all right, this asshole doesn't want to eat apples. You know, we have to figure out how to get our, our carbs and we have to get it figured out how to get our sugar. So we're just going to get it through the steak, Huh? Yeah. It's a weird thing. It's like people, some people are unaware of that, but your body literally produces it turns protein into like a glucose substitute or glucose actual glue. It's Glucogenesis. Hmm. Yeah, you can do it. I've done it for several days. I've never done it for a long periods of time, but I was, I wanted to try it. Um, when they're there were doing national carnivore monthlies knuckleheads. This people are so into it. Carnivore diet is a lot like the Vegan diet is, they can't shut the fuck up about being a carnival or my buddy Michael Goldstein, who is the first percentage of know who's a bitcoin is that bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin. Same thing with cognitive, all the cargo, cargo, cargo or like, all right. So I tried it for

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       a couple of weeks. I think I went from like close to two weeks and after awhile I was like, Jesus Christ 20 eat regular foods. I'm not being, I'm not joking. I would think it'd be a problem with getting it stuck in your teeth all the time. No, you just brushed your teeth. What do you disgusting. What's wrong with you? You don't have a toothpick at home. Excuse me. I have every flavor of Marvis on my shelf right now. Marvis oh, interesting. Now who doesn't know about tooth care? What's Marvis is the like Italian toothpaste, Brad. And it looks really cool. Although the, uh, this flavors and subpar, the point is brushing your teeth, not going to get, not stuck in between your teeth. That's not gonna help. Flossing. Yeah. Flow. You got to be up to flossing all the time or just bite off bigger chunks like a man.

Speaker 2:          02:23:07       Just swallow it. I, oh, can I tell, can I tell you a story about this? This just happened to me. Yes. And this is when I realized that, uh, most people, there's no mind there. I am at a buffet. I'm eating steak. I was eating steak. Congratulations. I, it's gets stuck in my throat. I'm like, all right, it's just too big a piece. I'll just wash it down. It's not going anywhere. And I realize I'm choking. And it was a very scary situation in the sense that mentally I knew there is a percent chance that I'm going to die. Did you try to throw up, hold on, hold on. Let me tell the story. Joe Rogan. So I'm sitting there, I'm like, Holy Shit, I'm choking. And I'm like, all right. I was calm, but I'm like, it's your life is currently in danger. And there's a co three people at the next table, um, to got to two women in their 50s and got in their sixties.

Speaker 2:          02:23:56       I go up to them and I'm like, I know what to do cause I was at school and I go to them and I go, I'm choking. And I did the hand motion and I make eye contact with each of them. No, no effect on their face. And I'm like, at the very least you have a crazy person coming up to your table doing a neck motion. Are you in New York? Yeah, that's a problem. I Ip, we're desensitized. Did this to myself and it's shot out. And then I go, how'd you do it yourself? Show me how I just did this. And I saw Heimlich, like, I don't know if it was the call for whatever it, it popped out and all the liquid to after it. And I go to them, I go, I was just choking. And they're like, oh well you should show your food better.

Speaker 2:          02:24:35       I'm like, someone was just, Chuck said that to you one the ladies, she get that lady's name, she doesn't happen to you because there's not a human being there. There's no mind. And I'm like, Holy Shit, if I saw this happen and I didn't help, I would be like, oh my God, you just, oh. I'm like, Holy Shit. Are you okay? It was like, oh, she should your food. You're not a soul. How old was this lady in her fifties somebody probably just true. Your bad man. Not Bad enough. Bad relationships. It was scary. The reaction was scarier than the choking. Yeah, I would imagine. Well, I think that's a really common thing with big cities that that sort of, there's a diffusion of responsibility, but there's so many people, there's so many. You don't feel responsible for this guy with his hands on his neck saying, I'm coughing like somebody else. Go Tech, somebody handle this. I've got to go to work. I would be fine

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       if they had shrugged and then like, yeah, whatever. In a sense, but there was no reaction. She's probably so jaded. So whoever you are, lady, I hope that things happen to you. Fuck you. I hope you go back in time and you have a better daddy and a better mommy and better friends. Yeah. And he grew up to be a nice person and I, and yeah, in her fifties maybe she could be a yoga teacher in her mind and be like, I saved someone's life today. I can go on to heaven. Yeah. Maybe she thought you were nuts and you're just trolling her, but if I was nuts, you would think they'd pull back and be like, Holy Shit, there's a crazy person or a table. Maybe it's because of your troll. Likewise. [inaudible] lesson. The universe has sent your way. You're the boy who cried wolf.

Speaker 3:          02:26:04       No, no, no, no, no. The lesson is you're invincible and nothing bad will ever happen now. Oh, because you survived. I survived. Oh, do you know how to do that to someone else though? If someone was choking, do you know to give a high like, I think I do it. We all think we do. Right. That's the thing, but it's like you have to get it right here, like right where the rib cage, the stardom and you push up. I think people get the ribs broken all the time that they're supposed to. You're supposed to do as hard as you can. Oh, you don't want that? Well, the alternative, the ads are Matthew's doing that to you. Sorry. As you can. That would be very painful.

Speaker 3:          02:26:37       It would just be like an old chicken. Yeah, no pea protein. Then you get in trouble for helping and hurting. Of course you can 100% of chorus or something. You can get in trouble for shooting a burglar. Especially if you're a strong person. Like if you're like a that Robert Frank, are they approved you yet? No, no, no. I'll check Twitter account. I couldn't tell what the video was. You might have it on Twitter. Maybe it's a, yeah, I bet he does write well, but isn't he like, um, he's um, I don't know what the topic was because he had a couple of videos up, but it could have been, this is what it looks like. I'll show it. Oh, it's for some reason now Instagram wants to send me Twitter wants to send me to, um, the Instagram from the web and not from what happens.

Speaker 3:          02:27:20       And you're in an apple. One of the do that should've been in a wet mess it up on an android. Why does it do that? But does Andrew would work better for that for today? For the purpose of it, for the purpose of the show but doesn't, doesn't know. The thing about Google though is the goop. I have android to look up an android phone as well, but don't, doesn't Google a collect way more data than apple does? I think they, uh, yeah, it's my understanding there's this gathering data and selling it. Where's apple is kind of trying to avoid that. I want to support, apple did a great, great thing where they had that set up where they can't even break into their phone if they want it to. And define law enforcement. That was really wonderful. Not just that, but your information, right terms, you relocation information and where you're going and what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          02:28:02       Like Google, every time you're getting online, they're just trying to do like, where are you at? What do you want, what do you need? There's a great documentary called the creepy line. Um, and they talk about like, let's suppose face on Facebook and I want to influence elections, right? What if, if I have an ad that says get out and vote, it's going to crush people vote. What if I've ran that ad on Donald Trump fans? People who like Donald Trump, right? Don't run on Hillary fans. That would sway the election and no one would know. Mm. So what they do with this information is very quiet and there's not that much transparency. And it can really lead to, especially with the sheer, with foreign countries, how with China, how they're like, you know, being perfectly happy to kind of sensor stuff. This is, these are things that need to be asked.

Speaker 3:          02:28:46       Yeah. I was talking to a wound was as an executive and her position was that if they didn't do at Google is going to copy it anyway. So might as well just let Google sensor and this way Google won't invent their own Google. Sure. And just copy all the codes and steal the code. And that's a fair response. But these are things that people I think should think more about. Yeah. Well, especially with something like China where the government and the industry are all tied in. Right. This is why I was really weirded out by this Walway thing today when it came to Google and Google because you want to say, well, if Google's doing this, clearly there must be a real reason for it. But then you know about the Google memo and James Demore and you're like, oh yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why Nay?

Speaker 3:          02:29:31       Oh yeah. Cause when you've done that, I've got to go, okay. The guy just provided scientific information, didn't say anything sexist. You're just talking about the facts of studies. Right. And you, you fired them for what you called like was it reinforcing sexist stereotypes? And it wasn't the case at all. It's not what he did. But so many people were complaining about his report on the data that they were asking about. Well also saying that he doesn't know math and statistics when that was, this isn't even MIT to cre. Yeah, well he's a, he's a coder. Yeah. So it's, it's what happens is when you have this fundamental is faith. You start with the conclusion and you reason your way backward and if you're contradicting my conclusion, you're not only wrong, you're a liar and a sinner and have to be driven from the face of the earth.

Speaker 3:          02:30:17       Well that's why I would ordinarily defer to them. I'm like, wow, this must be pretty serious. If Google is looking to take Gmail off of the new Walway phones and not update the operating system, but then I go, well no, that's on this story. What's going on at all? Yeah. I don't know. We don't know what's going on and we might never know. That is a problem when you do one thing like that, like there's giant consequences for what they probably thought it was a PR disaster. Probably have to get rid of this change to more guy. Let's just do it, will justify it and I think the culture of the company probably support it. It's probably very leftist mandates. It didn't support it and demand that it was my understanding the company. Yeah. Even though it does logically and did the rest of that was really interesting to just see outside of the bubble where the rest of the world that people actually read his memo and looked at it and we're like, okay, what is wrong with what he's saying? He's not saying anything bad about women. He's in fact he had a page and a half talking about strategies to get women more interested in tech. He was just relaying the information as a stance

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       in terms of the studies that have been done that show what women tend to gravitate towards, what men tend to gravitate towards. These aren't sexist studies. These are studies where they're just trying to figure out why do more women go into healthcare? Why do, is it opportunity? Is it designed like is it, is it just natural cultural? It's cultural. I mean sure there's a lot of things and so data is not sexist. This guy was just talking about data and then when you looked at his own ideas, those rent sexists either he was just talking about strategies that women might disagree with you.

Speaker 2:          02:31:54       They will say data is sexist because it has conclusions that contradict what they air quotes know to be true. So therefore, if the data contradicts this, the data is sexist. That's so crazy that that's the left. The left used to be science driven and now the logical ones that are left has, this is one of the big myths, and I talk about this in the book they have from Woodrow Wilson on have this evangelical fundamentalist faiths, a segment of the left. There's many people on the left who are very science driven, who are like, look, these are the facts. Let's work on that. But there's a big segment of them which are very prevalent where they're basically like jihadis and you have this on the right as well, where it's just like, these are my conclusions and we're going to force everyone to fit said conclusions.

Speaker 2:          02:32:36       Mm. So you think that even like when you go back to, um, what was that fucking, there was the terrorist organization that Obama's professor was involved in. The weatherman. The weatherman. Yeah. Like that. You go back to that similar, almost like an educated version of Antifa. I'm going back to Woodrow Wilson. Yeah. But I mean if you went belly, yeah. It's real similar to what we were. Absolutely. Yeah. Uh, and they, that's, there's a book called days of rage and it talks about how in the early seventies there were bombs going off I think every week in America. And they weren't trying to kill people. It was political. They, they called him the bomb threat and be like, look, we're going to set up a bomb. But the point is they, there are other Symbionese Liberation Liberation Army that had patty Hearst, a few of them. Yeah, the weather underground. They really, this was their thing.

Speaker 2:          02:33:22       And they blew up a townhouse in New York City, you know, killed a bunch of people and now they're walking around and they're fine. It's a fast and, and it's all been swept under the rug. Like people always think that no matter what's happening now is like regardless to like these like New York Nazi types and the outright, oh, this is the worst time ever. It's like the Klan used to be like a major part of both political parties. Like, what are you talking about? Things used to be re Woodrow Wilson is playing birth of a nation at the White House. Things were really, really dark before. Um, and, but people don't have the historical context. No. It's easy to not know what happened before, but just to think about what's going on now and where you want things to go. Yeah. So therefore it's really, really bad and different. Must be the worst. Yeah. There's a better, there's a better way to live for sure. But I think we went, went into real problems when you start telling people what they can

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       and can't do. Yeah. No matter what it is, no matter what it is. And you tell people that what they can and can't do. You sort of reinforce, I think one of the things that's going on now, um, in terms of, uh, like these abortion rulings. Oh Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Which is very sketchy, very scary. And the Alabama one, which essentially just outlaws abortion, they're making it where your punishment for abortion is far greater punishment. Then the punishment for raping someone and causing them to get an abortion. So, well, they don't punish the woman. I thought the players, the doctor, the law punishes the doctor. Was that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. I think doctor gets 99 years or something like that. It's the doctor who's being charged, not the woman. That's the question is in Georgia and Alabama, maybe baby. Right. But the question is why do you want this?

Speaker 3:          02:35:06       If you regard this mother as a potential murderer, do you really want her raising that kid? Right. Forced her to go ahead 99 years in jail. Oh yeah. That they thought. The other thing is that I am very torn in this issue, abortion on Twitter. It's such a cesspool of people who don't understand each other. One group saying, oh, it's all about, uh, uh, you want to control a woman's body. And the other would be like, oh, you want to murder babies? No, no. They don't want them or to babies and they don't care about the woman. They care about what they perceive to be the infant. So I try to talk to both and it's, it's just noise. Yeah. These are rigid ideologies and they're not persuasive. If you tell someone who is pro choice could wait otherwise be amenable to your point of view.

Speaker 3:          02:35:52       Well, you just want to murder kids. It's like, well I don't, so there's nothing to talk anymore. Did you see that at state representative that was walking around, um, in front of a, um, a abortion clinic and was trying to get the names of these kids that were there that were oh yeah. He's still on Twitter. Yeah. No consequences. That's crazy. He was trying to docs kids. He was asking for, he was going to be offering money bribing though. Yeah. $100. $100 to get the names of whoever these people are. It's insane. Gets to this one boy. And he puts his boy's face on Twitter. Just some meek, shy Christian Rice, a big guy. He's big and aggressive and he's getting in people's face with the camera. Right. And then he's putting them online and he's getting a lot of attention and fame for it. And it's crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:36:39       And meanwhile, my buddy Mike, he has a parody account of AOC. He gets kicked off. That's crazy. Yeah. And it says parody. Yeah. Why can't you do that? I mean, I don't think what he did was even rough. It wasn't, it wasn't anything. I don't really awful like I've read some of the tweets. I was like, they're just kind of funny. They're at, they're a parody. What about site alive? I think come on quickly. Exactly what w Alec Baldwin does to the president every fucking day on Saturday night live every week. He's doing a fucking Trump impression. All this. Well, he should, that's their job. Exactly. So it's, it's a complete double standard. It's, it's, and the other thing, I'll defend jack in this regard we were talking

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       about earlier, I'm sure the pressure he gets internally, oh my God is off the charts and he even said this explicitly goes, they were all at, my whole company was yelling at me to kick off Alex, you know, for a long time. He refused to do it for a while. Yeah. It's, it's weird that they don't see the consequences. They don't understand that this is going to go to a bad place, but this is, they do see the positive consequences where they're preaching to their own tribe and basically the people who aren't like us get to go out in the ghetto, in the ghetto, in the wilderness. Well

Speaker 1:          02:37:45       I think human beings are way better at expressing themselves today than they ever have been in the past. And I think one of the reasons why is the free expression that we so enjoy and that we have enjoyed.

Speaker 2:          02:38:01       You know, like

Speaker 1:          02:38:03       if you, if you look at the, the history of what you could, the message you could get out just 40 or 50 years ago as opposed to what you can get out today. And then you looked at how culture has radically evolved over the last 40 or 50 years versus where if everything was stagnant like it was in 1950 we would, we would think if you watch like 1950s films are read books about the 1950s the behavior that people got away with was, it was way different than it is today. Of course things are getting better. But one of the reasons why these things are getting better is because people can see everything. You can talk through all the details, have you think you could just cut off the ugly stuff, cut off the Nazi stuff and cut off this stuff and you're going to keep people from getting recruited. So you're going to kill this and you're going to DIY platform this. You're also gonna, you're gonna enforce assholes to say like there's a reason why their silencing us. There's a reason why instead of having people going, hey, no, you guys are shit heads and this is a stupid idea, right? And you guys are all ignorant fools and your perception of things is so often

Speaker 2:          02:39:08       we're going to explain to you while it's off and we're going to all like work this out together. And when they say there's a secret elite who's running this country and wants to control your life, they made Jews don't they? Shit Jig is up. They know, shut it down this, but this is their proof. They can point to Twitter and Facebook and they could also say, Hey, they're picking off the same exact people and every platform. It's not a coincidence. Yep. Whereas David Duke is still on Twitter isn't brilliant. Yeah, of course. That's hilarious. Is it? No, but it's telling no, it's not hilarious. Like, oh, I know they got rid of Pharacom. They didn't get rid of David Duke. Right, right. Cause David Duke serves a purpose. What purpose? Because he's a good foil for the left because when David Duke endorses a Republican look, oh, the Republicans are racist. When David Duke Endorses Ilhan Omar or Keith Ellison crickets, though he'd be a good, bad guy on payroll. Like if I was the Democratic Party, I'd say, look, Dave is the Jig is up. Okay, everybody knows you're never going to be president right now. We're going to really run for office or anywhere or legitimate blah. She's not that good with that.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       How about this, David? We'll give you $400,000 a year. All you have to do is every now and then I'm going to call you up. But I'm just saying, Dave, you know, it'll be interesting. It would be interesting if David Duke endorsed this asshole and then David Duke just starts talking about this person being a fine American and a white nationalists and all these different, just make up a bunch of quotes and have David Duke put it up there. A lot of people when that have a shake that off. A lot of people think he's controlling like not him specifically and trawl oppositions controlF is this. Oh, that's my favorite. Right. When someone's not bad, they must be controlled opposition. That is one of my favorites. I love their CE dork theory. That control up position is someone who you don't like who hasn't been banned yet.

Speaker 3:          02:40:53       Yeah. Controlled opposition. Is it useful? Idiot? Yeah. Controlled opposition. It's like when people get into these, uh, I've been accused of being a CIA plant. Oh, you probably are probably one of these ace for anarchy. You know the term cognizanti like those in the know know. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great term. And that's like, that's perfect for this. It's like, oh, useful idiot. All controlled opposition. I'm in the know, I'm one of the cognitive symptoms. You're not sneak this by me. I understand, but me, while sometimes they're right, which is why it's really fucked up. It's like sometimes there is controlled opposition. Sometimes there is sometimes just fake websites could talk to somebody because somebody wants, probably somebody wants a win, a lawsuit. You know, look at this. I'm dear, dear, let this case that you're working on come and look at this website I've found, but that's why killing babies.

Speaker 3:          02:41:44       That's why it's so important for there to be venues for those people. If someone is crazy or brilliant, bright off, it looks the same. Right? But how does a person know whether or not that websites, right or well, once we got to scientific American, we all go, you're like, okay, this is legit. This is legit claim. They're basically talking about cells though. They were talking about human cells. Um, I don't know any better way drawing human cells. But here's, here's a problem with that, with what was going to say is at what scale? Cause by the way, they've shown that certain elements and plants in laboratory environment will destroy cells even like phytonutrients. And there was some something, um, one of the head guys for the carnivore diet, uh, Sean Baker posted on his Twitter a while back showing that, um, that you can make a lot of weird arguments based on cells. Like how things respond to cells doesn't necessarily mean once it gets through the organism. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:42:42       They only way, in my view, and I'm not an expert on this, is discourse and having a platform where people can argue at each other and you could stand by and watch an NC things through. Otherwise if you're silencing, it's, it's, it's a very, as we talked before and I think any right might've person. I agree it's a very, very slippery slope. I agree. Did you see the Ben Shapiro meltdown on the BBC? I did, yeah. Yeah. That's a good example. That's a good example because I don't look, he didn't handle it well. He knows he didn't handle it well and I like them like them a lot. I think he's a really nice guy. I like talking to him. I don't agree with him on many things, but I really like him. He's a really good guy and if he's a very smart guy, I think he's smart enough to admit that he fucked up.

Speaker 3:          02:43:23       He went on Twitter and instantly I, here's the thing, I didn't mean making fun of him, it's on my insta and people are white knighting for him. And I'm like, he owned that, he played it wrong, he's fucked up. And he's like, yeah, I got God. And that's to his credit. Yeah. And it highlights to me more so than anything. The problem with two things, one doing remote show. Sure. Where you're from, you're in Los Angeles, they're in the UK where he was talking to him like he wasn't there, the British guy was because he wasn't really there. Right. And then the other part is that short time format, you don't have enough time. You have at a time to have a conversation and just talk that Ben knows this then is that a pro? He knows what the BBC is too, but he's also a pro at doing those things.

Speaker 3:          02:44:09       You just shout talking points at each other and talk over each. And Ben talks super fast because when he talks to profess, it's really hard to keep up with him and he sounds smarter than you like he, he's very smart and articulate and he talks fast. I was like, whew. It's hard to him. He rose to prominence when he was on piers Morgan. Yeah. Talking about guns. If he thought that BBC interview was rude, peers at one point just goes, you're real stupid man, aren't you? Like that's your line, Benton storm off. He was just like, no, I just think with a governor that comes to your patients that it's very important for the citizens had the, you know, and he handled the good impression. We go to the same shul, he handled it amazingly. So for him as he admitted for him to lose his shit and also to be like, I'm popular and I've never heard of you just because you've never heard of someone.

Speaker 3:          02:44:53       And I'm sure he would admit this is of no relevance to their, uh, the validity of what they're doing. Yeah. That's why I was shocked when I went to Jojo Siwa last night and it was sold out. I don't know the phone. I literally didn't know she was until a week ago. A lot of people know her. I'm the Seg bore so than Ben Shapiro. I'm the second most famous Joe here. What the fuck? Athens and she's 16 I was like, Ben Shapiro did a speech at the Microsoft Center. I don't know how many tickets he sells if he does speeches, but it's a hard sell. 7,000 people to hard. So I don't think Ben Shapiro could still sell thousand tickets. That's a lot. Yeah, but that's basically you're getting a two hour speech in one hour. So that's, you know, I already have the double the value. No, but it's getting people out of their house to pay money to come see or hear people talk.

Speaker 3:          02:45:36       Like most of these, like when these guys are doing these talks, unless it's Jordan. Jordan can kind of do a football stadium right now, but a lot of these guys are doing like 2000 seaters. This is 7,000 this is a big jump. Okay. She was seven people. I bet you he can fill it. Maybe. Maybe it's possible. I don't know. I'm like, I don't know if he's doing live ones like that. There's a lot of people doing live shows now. It's very interesting because they're doing the whole time. You too. Very old timey. Yeah, but it's also, it's cool to see people that are interested in intellectual dis like Sam Harris, some fantastic and I like some, what is some of Sam's live ones too? Because he's funny in them. Yeah. Which she's, he gets a chance to actually work to the crowd. You know, I was talking to them about, I'm like you have good timing.

Speaker 3:          02:46:22       Yeah. Like a comic. Like some of the stuff you say actually makes me laugh when he does live ones as opposed to he's very like rational and somber when he's doing straight, you know, just, just conversation. Once you know, this is a performance stayed with me. Like, if you're in front of that audience and the laugh is out of proportion because there's so many of them and just have that one liner, it makes you want to be more on. And it's like it's this meeting its tail and it's really, really exciting. It's also like a nod to the crowd that you know that they're there and you're trying to entertain them. You appreciate them. Like you say something fun like you're doing it, they know you're doing it because they're there and it's funny, you know, and let us Improv. That's much more intimate. You know when you've got that one liner that you knew was in part of his speech, it's great.

Speaker 3:          02:47:03       So they're doing their their way where it's just conversations and it's interesting cause they're getting these giant crowds and you know, um, they're also like do produced ones too. Like radio lab does a produced live one and it's really interesting. They'll bring someone out and they'll play sound clips and I dunno if they have a video element of it. I don't see, I think they do. I think they have like visuals too, but they're doing it all in these big ass theaters and people love it and come out to see it. So for someone who listens to like radio lab every week and they get a chance to go and see it live, it's like, wow, I can't believe it's here as a part of my life. And this is the danger of the help them write their Twitter, Facebook stuff. People are desperate and excited to hear new ideas.

Speaker 3:          02:47:45       It's thought provoking people, even if you disagree. Right. Two of my favorite people, like a lot of times if you hear them talk, even if you don't care what they're saying or disagree with them, the energy and it's like this is fascinating. It's such provoking for me. It's just nothing's better. I think there's something really cool about people coming out to see these really interesting discussions to look, Jordan had a debate with this lava Jijak yeah. Thank you for saying his name. I think I pronounced it right. Maybe you better you than me. Um, about Marxism and it's sold out. Yeah. And then they had paper view. People were buying. This was like the dub WWII of our time. It's like, how are these two people in a room together? I want to see this and they actually want to agreeing on quite a few things and just, it was really an interesting discussion.

Speaker 3:          02:48:32       But it's also interesting that, that, that Marxism is such a attractive subject that they're willing to host this giant event and pay to see people debate this topic. It's like this is this idea that you could fill up a whole arena for an intellectual discourse or a theater. I mean, I don't know how big the place was. And then you could also sell paper view tickets for like, what the fuck are you talking about? Who the hell is going to pay to hear that? But that school get outta here with that shit. It's not, I wish school was like that or wish. Right? There's no better way to get kids to hate learning than school. Every kid is so excited about the world, you know, uh, go on us to go to the museum. Well not every kid a lot read books. Then you go to school and that all goes away.

Speaker 3:          02:49:20       You're a factory worker. So this, anything that reinvigorate your show, does this do reinvigorates your love of learning and about how there's so much interesting, crazy shit out there. I who doesn't love that? And that's the creative, the jocks back in the day didn't have that space and now thanks to you and people like you, it's like, you know what? I don't like reading books. Readings enough for me. I could sit here and listen for three hours and I'm going to be a smarter person than I was three hours ago and learned stuff. Who Doesn't love history? Even if you're the biggest meathead, it's like this shit's interest. Or like these crazy animals. He, the biggest meat had to be like, oh shit, that's cool to hear about this. You know, just there's a raft weevil which has a hinge on its neck, but only the males.

Speaker 3:          02:49:56       And it's from Madagascar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't thing it is a real thing. And I was going to say this, like it's fuel for your curiosity. Yeah. And for your creativity, it's going to give you ideas. It's gonna like there's so much fuel for creativity right now, like more so than any other time. There's so much information and interesting shit you can learn and do it easily. Like you could just find a po, like, um, I need to learn about economics and you just find an economics podcast and start playing it. And if the person's good, you know, they're, they're interesting to talk to and they can do it in a fun way. Like you are listening to Peter Schiff guy, he knows his shit. Like I've had them on a few times. And the way he describes things, it's like he's entertaining as well as factual as well.

Speaker 3:          02:50:42       It's just a compelling charismatic person while he's talking about these things, he's getting fired up and you're like, oh, okay. So that's how it works. It's so much better than absorbing it. And they're dry, stale manner. And if, and then you go from that like, Oh, let me tell you, he mentioned this thing. Let me learn about this. Oh, there's a youtube video about this and you go down this rabbit hole and it's just like hours of entertainment and you're a, and you could have better conversation with the people, Hey, I learned about this, this and that. I feel so far behind kids these days. I'll go, I mean an 18 year old today feel like a 30 year old when I was a kid. In what way? They're smarter. They have more info. Yeah, more data. They know it's horseshit and what's not. When we were in our twenties we didn't know what the fuck was real and what was fake.

Speaker 3:          02:51:24       There was no youtube, there was no Google. There was books and you didn't read them all. I read them. I you might do, I've read a lot of Joe. Yeah, I'm older than you. Yeah. You had books about like to find out whether or not something's true. Right, like we do today. You know what I'm saying? Like when I was in my twenties like I wasn't like researching subjects and I've read a few books here and there, but I wasn't researching things on every single aspect of the world. The way the, the access to this information just so radically different that you just have a thing in your pocket that answers your question. What else is fascinating is Google and other organizations have digitized entire libraries. So many of these books that are old are public domain and for free. You can read this book from 1910 where these ideas got started and instead of hearing someone's interpretation of it, now you can see where this idea developed in how they looked at the world back then.

Speaker 3:          02:52:19       Now here's the real question. Yeah. Is that acts? Absolutely. We both agree incredibly valuable resource. Is that worth giving up the data? Like maybe we should just accept the fact that they gave us something to change the worlds. Of course they got super rich. Hey, mark Zuckerberg, I know what you did. It's okay. So can you take that data? You're taking ticket pitch. Yeah. You like the shaking urges person. Well, you deserve it. You shouldn't, you shouldn't just give it away for free. Well, I used the world in a better way. Nah, he should've take advantage of the fact that you changed the world in a better way to profit in some insane, spectacular way. We generate billions and billions of dollars. The thing we don't know is how they are generating that profit. That's the issue, you know? So if they're doing it in a certain way that we know about, all right, if they don't, this is where it gets tricky because there's an element of fraud in it.

Speaker 3:          02:53:13       Well, I think they must be terrified, but both Twitter and Facebook, there must be terrified at their influence of culture. The actual, yeah, of course. There's no way they can't. The responsibility must be insane. Do you know how you know this? Because a lot of people who were Republicans during the Gulf War, the Iraq war, and now look back on it who are beating the drum beats, and I'm not gonna name names. You watch interviews and they're like, that shit was fucked up. And when you look back and you realize you had a part to play in this unnecessary war, and if you're someone who cares about human beings as a Christian or whatever, that will fuck you up for life because it's like, I had a little part in this, like when I do my work with North Korea, right? If I help 10 people, that's a huge fucking deal and I don't take that shit lightly.

Speaker 3:          02:53:57       I've had, and here's the power of social media. I've had people three or four tell me I'm going through chemo and I read your Twitter and it makes me laugh throughout the day. That's fucking huge. Conversely, if you're on the side of Hillary Clinton and you realize that your website, Mike would be contributing to her, the mines. Oh yeah. And all he had realized that other countries might be posting fake accounts that are there. You know, they have these groups, these discussion groups, and they're based in Russia and they want to talk about black lives matter. Yeah. Or they want to talk about abortion or they want to talk about southern separatism, her all kinds of, you know that IRA research group in Russia. When you find out this is all happening on your platform and that your platform, yes. Likely being used to manipulate how the world is run, how financial markets are run international politics, and you just wanted to help college kids get laid. Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right, right. And kind of Jack the idea to, right. What about the kids when they were torturing that retarded

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       kid and was a Chicago and there was streaming and our Facebook, that's your site. That's got to fuck with your head. It's God. Well, there's been murdered, I live streaming in New Zealand. He was live streaming.

Speaker 1:          02:55:14       I mean, there's many, many cases of horrible things that had been put on there. Isis beheadings and you know, I mean, there's no way they can catch it all. There's no way. And we, when you talk to Twitter or you talked to Facebook or youtube or you'll, they'll tell you the, just, just, I want everyone to just think about the idea that 7 billion people, yeah, let's be real conservative. Potentially 3 billion. Sure. Just 3 billion. 3 billion people can all send something at once.

Speaker 2:          02:55:45       Wow. At the speed of light is of bits of information headed towards youtube or Twitter or Facebook. I, they trying to catch it all. Some of it's Nazis and some of it's frogs and an Alex Jones, Ben, his name, blah, blah, blah, blah. And they just, everything's flying it out. I'm like, oh. And then congress is like, Mr Zuckerberg, you know what you're doing. It's like, hold on, let me drink her water. Hold on.

Speaker 1:          02:56:11       Uh, Mr Senator, yes. We know what we're doing. I think, I think Mr. Senator, no, that isn't no special or knows what he's doing. Also, he's, he's not, he's not a monk, right? He's not some scholar. He's not a genius. He's not enlightened. He's a guy. He's just like, he's not a stupid guy. He's a smart guy, but he's just a person. Just a human and has an insane connection and insane. He's the CEO of one of the biggest groups on the planet where people exchange conversation,

Speaker 2:          02:56:46       which still hasn't verified me on Instagram. By the way, let it remind not because they're not seeing how many followers you got. Only 7,000 Instagram. That's my weakest one borough. You touched the fuck up, but uh, but it's also like Lucy, Lucille ball when she's working the chocolate factory, right. The chocolates are coming out and then they go faster and faster. Oh yeah. There's a certain point where you, you're not going to be able to process this much information and scan it and any filter, any filter, by its nature, any coder will tell you is going to be imperfect and it's going to weed out people. It doesn't want to eat out and and leave people in the, you don't want to leave it like any filters only as good as its creator. That's what I wanted

Speaker 1:          02:57:26       people to kind of understand from Jack. And he did a pretty good job of explaining that and then saying that it just shows you the problems with trying to monitor these things, right.

Speaker 2:          02:57:40       Scale. But the thing I would say to Jack is one work around if someone is a high enough platform where they're contributing like the, the laws against obscenity, the ruling was if there's some cultural benefit here, it's not regards of scene, right? That's a blue pool. If someone is big enough in terms of their part of the public conversation, you should have a manual person, double check or triple check. They're blocked.

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       You could give them a warning. Explain why. Because it's important for [inaudible]. Here's the question for what it does. If there's gotta be rules, but you are getting blocked. If you're threatening violence against someone like you, if you're sending like Dick Pics to report or you should be blocked. I mean, and if you're, if you have, uh, you're putting up people's information, find doxing, putting people's address out, right? When you go to your home telling people you want to pay someone $100 to take the photo [inaudible] photo and video of someone who's not giving you permission, you're uploading in an offering. This is what that guy did is offering $100. That's crazy. So with sunglasses, that work. Yes. Kim, I'm not jack. How could that work? I don't know Jack get it. Um, but he very easily that people like that. You should tell them you could that way you'd be banding if you're doxing people.

Speaker 3:          02:58:49       Yes, but someone is doing a parody. You, it could be like, take this down for x, Y and z reasons do. The thing is, I think they tried to make a differentiation between doxing someone and threatening to dock someone. This is how the kept Kathy Griffin on, right? Remember when she was saying, I want names of his kids. Yeah. For these kids. You know, imagine if they did and the, the, the kids eventually all their information did get wind up getting online. But when you watch the full video and you saw what actually happened, you're like, God damn. Like you'd be able to have really shifted the narrative gets, I posted a picture of myself holding up a bloody Clinton Hillary Clinton head that I wouldn't be banned. Ooh, I'm not going to find out, but that's a big deal. And I didn't even don't, she was obviously doing as a joke.

Speaker 3:          02:59:36       I didn't find it offensive. I think it'd be funny if she was wearing a hijab while she did the photo, but the point of shit, no consequences on Twitter. None. Um, yeah, I think you would be banned. Yeah. Almost positive. You'd be banned. It's for whatever reason, it's more disturbing. See a guy holding a woman's head. Sure. That's true. Um, in the, see, even if it was Obama, the idea is like Kathy Griffin probably wouldn't be able to cut Trump's head off. Like he kick her ass. He's a big dude. If she, you know, she came at him with the knife. I mean she'd have to shoot him and then cut his head off, which I guess you could do. It's not as long as she's got to use the palms. Oh, the palm to the nose. Tom's at the nose, nose bone in the brain. Would you do that? I'm just trying to like run the numbers in my head. There's 126 million daily users on Twitter. How many people should they hire? Remember when we were asking me. I know that's like, I'm just remember. I'm like, that's going back over my head. Like how that cue, if someone could get through a hundred a day, if they could get through a hundred a day and spending five minutes on each of them, that's 500 minutes. That's more than there. That's [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          03:00:38       No way you're going to do, I'm going to have to use the reporting system is smart. Yes. Like you're relying on the users to report things that are initiative that smart, but it falls victim to trolling because then someone can just decide to attack Jamie Vernon. Don't do it. Got Charles at the worst. Yeah, those. Fuck Oh that's you. Oh my goodness. That's the bad kind of trolling. That's just being an asshole dude. We

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       already did three hours. Oh, how are they? How's that possible? I'm just adorable and charming. I guess that's something something happened. I'll go with that. It's good to answer is any, um, your book is called the New Right. We barely talked about it. Um, more, more stuff for people to read. Yeah. A journey to the, how's the first 12 pages inside joke. A journey to the fringe of American politics, Michael Malice. And, uh, thank you, brother. Thank you, man. That was a pleasure, Jeff. Thank you. Bye everybody.

Speaker 4:          03:01:30       That was [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          03:01:42       Mm.
