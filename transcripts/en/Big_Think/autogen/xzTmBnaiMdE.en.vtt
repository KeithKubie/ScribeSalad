I get asked a lot about the state of

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580
I get asked a lot about the state of
 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.549
I get asked a lot about the state of
capitalism and I think that for those

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559
capitalism and I think that for those
 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.159
capitalism and I think that for those
members of society of a certain age we

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:11.169
members of society of a certain age we
 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.949
members of society of a certain age we
think of capitalism as being locked in

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959
think of capitalism as being locked in
 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.520
think of capitalism as being locked in
an ideological battle with socialism

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530
an ideological battle with socialism
 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.000
an ideological battle with socialism
perhaps or even communism but we never

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010
perhaps or even communism but we never
 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.370
perhaps or even communism but we never
really saw the capitalism might be

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
really saw the capitalism might be
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.100
really saw the capitalism might be
defeated by its own child technology and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110
defeated by its own child technology and
 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.720
defeated by its own child technology and
I think that what we find is that even

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730
I think that what we find is that even
 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.480
I think that what we find is that even
the most die-hard free-market economists

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490
the most die-hard free-market economists
 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.540
the most die-hard free-market economists
usually safe place for what they call

usually safe place for what they call
 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.140
usually safe place for what they call
market failure that is markets really

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150
market failure that is markets really
 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.569
market failure that is markets really
only work when the value of something in

the price of that object or service

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
the price of that object or service
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.000
the price of that object or service
coincide so the key question is what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010
coincide so the key question is what
 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.910
coincide so the key question is what
causes value in price to get out of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920
causes value in price to get out of
 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.030
causes value in price to get out of
alignment and in fact every government

they must be valued so for example

raising a standing army is tough because

large so for example if I record a piece

large so for example if I record a piece
 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.980

a high quality version of that music you

computers like any AK and during that
 

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.100

period of time there was a tremendous

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.110
period of time there was a tremendous
 

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.770

somewhere along the line that got lost

technical talent to build an optimistic
 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.740
technical talent to build an optimistic
future but for whatever reason we're so

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:12.750
future but for whatever reason we're so
 

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.860
future but for whatever reason we're so
terrified now of those technical folks

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:15.870
terrified now of those technical folks
 

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.530
terrified now of those technical folks
that we keep attempting to subordinate

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540
that we keep attempting to subordinate
 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.010

them to keep them on a leash to make

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.020
them to keep them on a leash to make
 

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.530
them to keep them on a leash to make
sure that they are not the ones in the

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540
sure that they are not the ones in the

know with power with decision-making

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700
know with power with decision-making
 

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.730
know with power with decision-making
abilities and I think that if you look

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740
abilities and I think that if you look
 

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.790
abilities and I think that if you look
at a society like China's China

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800
at a society like China's China
 

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.790

certainly not falling for this trap and

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800
certainly not falling for this trap and
 

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.020
certainly not falling for this trap and
they are proceeding along a very

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.030
they are proceeding along a very
 

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.780
they are proceeding along a very
different path so I think whether or not

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:38.790
different path so I think whether or not
 

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.660
different path so I think whether or not
we understand where we are and we make

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:41.670
we understand where we are and we make
 

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.640
we understand where we are and we make
the correct decisions for the optimistic

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:43.650
the correct decisions for the optimistic
 

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.130
the correct decisions for the optimistic
future depends as to whether we have the

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140
future depends as to whether we have the
 

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.140
future depends as to whether we have the
right leadership class do we view our

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:48.150
right leadership class do we view our
 

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.230
right leadership class do we view our
technical people as support staff for

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240
technical people as support staff for
 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.410
technical people as support staff for
the true decision-makers or do we

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420
the true decision-makers or do we
 

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.290
the true decision-makers or do we
realize that in fact these are the

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300
realize that in fact these are the
 

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.850
realize that in fact these are the
people who should have been making the

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860
people who should have been making the
 

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.700
people who should have been making the
decisions all along I think

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:00.710
decisions all along I think
 

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.660
decisions all along I think
you think about for example the

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:01.670
you think about for example the
 

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.000
you think about for example the
Challenger disaster it was the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.010
Challenger disaster it was the
 

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.280
Challenger disaster it was the
management class that didn't understand

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.290
management class that didn't understand
 

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.250
management class that didn't understand
the real risks the engineers knew just

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.260
the real risks the engineers knew just
 

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.440
the real risks the engineers knew just
how much risk was being taken and I

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:11.450
how much risk was being taken and I
 

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.780
how much risk was being taken and I
think that in fact if we could just

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:13.790
think that in fact if we could just
 

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.630
think that in fact if we could just
invert that relationship we'd have a

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640
invert that relationship we'd have a
 

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.160
invert that relationship we'd have a
much better chance at an optimistic

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.170
much better chance at an optimistic
 

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.530
much better chance at an optimistic
