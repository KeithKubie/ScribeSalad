BECAUSE YOUR BOOK JUST CAME OUT 

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.332

&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:15.966
&gt;&gt; AND I GOT A CHANCE TO READ IT
LAST NIGHT.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.912

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:26.179
OF THE THINGS IN THERE. SO WE

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.042
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE
TO BE HERE.  

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.665
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: HAVE YOU BEEN TO 
WASHINGTON, D.C. BEFORE? 

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.149
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I HAVE, I ATTENDED 
THE BLACK CAUCUS TWICE.  

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.605
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU CAN CLAP.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.287
SO, WELL, IN THE BOOK, LET'S 
JUST GET

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.488
TO IT -- HAVING THE LAST NAME 
MANDELA AND WHAT IT MEANS TO 

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:58.524
YOU, IS THERE A LOT OF PRESSURE 
OR RESPONSIBILITY?  

00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:02.175
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: OF COURSE, OF 
COURSE. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A 

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:09.146
LOT OF EXPECTATIONS, YOU KNOW, 
OF BEING A MANDELA.  OF COURSE, 

00:05:09.147 --> 00:05:11.589
YOU KNOW, THEY CONSTANTLY WANT 
TO PUT YOU IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF 

00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.232
NELSON MANDELA. AND WANT TO KNOW
WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR YOUR 

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.233
COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW?

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.111
LUCKILY, I AM DOING SOMETHING 
FOR MY 

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:24.158
COMMUNITY, THROUGH MY FOUNDATION
WHERE 

00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:27.211
ALL OF OUR EDUCATION AND 
TECHNOLOGY AND 

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.667
TECHNOLOGY AND CELEBRATING 
AFRICAN CULTURE.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.202
AND DEVELOPED ENTREPRENEURS IN 
THE VILLAGES. YEAH. 

00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:41.061
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED 
TECHNOLOGY. HOW DO YOU BRING 

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:43.062
THAT IN? 

00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:46.748
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SO BASICALLY WE'RE 
RUNNING A THREE-MONTH COMPUTER 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:48.749
CODING PROGRAM.

00:05:51.707 --> 00:05:54.548
WE HAVE -- WE'RE TRAINING 50 
YOUTH, 40 IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:57.800
OTHER 20 UNEMPLOYUNEMPLOYED 
YOUTH. ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:59.801
CHALLENGES THAT WE 

00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:06.488
FACE IN AFRICA IS WE HAVE 60% TO
70% OF OUR YOUTH UNEMPLOYED.

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.807
AND UP TO MORE THAN 60% OF THEM 
ARE UNEMPLOYABLE. THEY DON'T 

00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:15.471
HAVE THE SKILLS TO ACTUALLY BE 
EMPLOYED. SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO

00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:17.472
THAT THROUGH TEACHING THEM HOW 
TO DO CODING.

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:23.994
AND THEY WRITE AN EXAM WITH 
ORACLE AFTER THREE MONTHS.

00:06:28.094 --> 00:06:28.906
THEY THEN QUALIFY FOR THE 
QUALIICATION AND THEN WE FIND 

00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:33.583
THEM JOBS.  
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AFTER THREE MONTHS. 

00:06:33.584 --> 00:06:38.661
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.  VERY BASIC. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW, THAT'S QUITE 

00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:41.910
SOMETHING. 
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THEY HAVE A SKILL, 

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:43.911
THEY HAVE 

00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:47.406
A CERTIFICATE THAT PROVES 
THEY'RE PROFICIENT IN THAT 

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.675
PARTICULAR MODEL, ENTRY LEVEL. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: NOW, SPEAKING OF 

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.676
JUMPING RIGHT INTO THE BOOK, AS 
A YOUNG MAN, AND 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.667
I CAN SEE WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS 
BEEN A THREAD, YOU WERE VERY 

00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.668
MUCH INTO CERTAIN VIDEO GAMES?

00:07:04.604 --> 00:07:09.506
YOU MAY SAY WHICH ONES?  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: NORMAL ONES. 

00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.995
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: REALLY. 
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SPORTS, MUSIC. 

00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:17.628
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: MUSIC.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:21.518
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU 
DESCRIBE HIP-HOP AND ALL OF THE 

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.519
THINGS LIKE THAT. 

00:07:25.224 --> 00:07:27.224
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I WAS VERY LUCKY. 

00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:30.507
MY OLDER BROTHER, HE GREW UP IN 
LONDON.

00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:37.203
SO WHEN I WAS 17, HE WAS PLAYING
PUBLIC ENEMY.

00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:42.113
THE FAT BOYS. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THE FAT BOYS? 

00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:48.427
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES? AND, OF COURSE,
COOL J RAP. AND SO, YOU KNOW, 

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:51.275
HE'S AN OLDER BROTHER AND I 
REALLY LOOKED UP TO HIM, I 

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:55.743
REALLY FOLLOWED HIM AND THE TEAM
HE SUPPORTED, THE LOCAL TEAM. 

00:07:55.744 --> 00:08:01.238
AND IN TERMS OF THE MUSIC IN 
THIS INSTANCE. THE LABEL THAT HE

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.239
LIKED, HE WAS REALLY 

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.331
A GREAT INFLUENCE FOR ME AT 
THOSE FORMATIVE YEARS, TO BE 

00:08:07.332 --> 00:08:10.174
HONEST. 
AND, I OF COURSE IDENTIFIED FROM

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:13.425
HIP-HOP BECAUSE WE COME FROM A 
HISTORY OF FIGHTING THE POWERS 

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.307
THAT BE, FIGHTING AGAINST THE 
SYSTEM, FIGHTING AGAINST 

00:08:16.308 --> 00:08:20.379
APARTHEID. SO ENWHICH YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT BEING A REBEL, 

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.380
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IN MY BLOOD 

00:08:23.832 --> 00:08:26.677
IT COMES FROM THE GENERATIONS. 
HE HIMSELF WAS A REBEL AND HIS 

00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:28.678
FATHER HIMSELF WAS A REBEL.

00:08:34.202 --> 00:08:40.757
BASICALLY MY GRANDFATHER WAS 
BORN IN A RURAL VILLAGE. AND 

00:08:40.758 --> 00:08:42.758
THEN HIS FATHER GOT IN DISPUTE 
WITH 

00:08:43.843 --> 00:08:45.843
ONE OF THE -- GOT IN TO A 
DISPUTE.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.194
AND BASICALLY PUNISHED THE 
GENTLEMEN AND TOOK IT. AND HE 

00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.195
WENT TO THE WHITE MAGISTRATE TO 
REPORT THIS MATTER.

00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.699
AND SO THEY -- THEY BASICALLY 
DENOUNCED 

00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.401
OR REMOVED THEM FROM OUR GREAT 
GRANDFATHER. SO HE LEFT AND 

00:09:04.402 --> 00:09:08.485
MOVED BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T GIVE 
BACK THE CAPITAL, BECAUSE HE 

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:10.314
SAID, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO 
WITH THIS. YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW I

00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:15.013
RULE MY AREA. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT 
TO COME AND TELL ME HOW I SHOULD

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:18.883
GOVERN MY AREA. SO PLEASE GET 
AWAY. HE TOLD HIM TO -- TO LEAVE

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:21.127
HIM ALONE, BASICALLY. SO THEY 
BASICALLY CAME WITH POLICE, ETC.

00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:23.544
, ETC.

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:26.592
, AND THEY REMOVED HIM FORCIBLY.

00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:30.295
SO HE SETTLED IN KUNU.
AND MY GRANDFATHER GREW UP, YOU 

00:09:30.296 --> 00:09:33.955
KNOW, SEEING HIM. BUT ANOTHER 
THING HE WAS I GUESS 

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:39.657
ATTRIBUTED TO IS WE COME FROM 
THE RURAL KINGDOM AND WE COME 

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:42.322
FROM THE FOUR PARTS. SO WE ARE A
POLYGAMIST NATION.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.883
SO THE FIRST WIFE IS THE GREAT 
HOUSE, THE SECOND WIFE IS THE 

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:53.552
RIGHT-HAND HOUSE. THE THIRD WIFE
IS THE LEFT-HAND HOUSE, AND WE 

00:09:53.553 --> 00:09:55.553
COME FROM THE FOURTH HOUSE, 
WHICH IS A JUNIOR HOUSE.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:00.033
AND EVERY WIFE AFTER THAT COMES 
FROM A JUNIOR HOUSE. 

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.734
&gt;&gt; AND IN THE FOURTH HOUSE 
SEEMED TO BE THE HOUSE THAT 

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:03.940
MEDIATED BETWEEN THE OTHER 
HOUSES? 

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:05.941
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.

00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:11.277
SO OUR JOB FROM THE FOURTH HOUSE
WAS TO BE MEDIATORS AMONGST ALL 

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.278
OF THE 

00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:15.976
HOUSES, ESPECIALLY AMONGST THE 
FIRST TWO HOUSES BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:10:15.977 --> 00:10:17.977
ALWAYS FIGHTING OVER THE CROWN. 

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.450
AND THEN TO BE COUNSELOR TO THE 
KING.

00:10:24.763 --> 00:10:27.407
SO, YOU SEE, NELSON MANDELA DID 
NOT FALL FROM THE HEAVENS AND 

00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:32.511
BECOME A GREAT PEACEMAKER, IT IS
IN HIS BLOOD, YOU UNDERSTAND. 

00:10:32.512 --> 00:10:34.512
THAT IS WHAT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY 
RAISED TO DO, TO BECOME. 

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:41.654
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THAT'S AN INTERESTING
IDEA OF HOW YOUR GRANDFATHER 

00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:43.655
DEVELOPED AND WHAT HE BROUGHT 
WITH HIM.

00:10:48.793 --> 00:10:50.824
YOU MENTIONED, AND THE NAME OF 
THE BOOK REFERS TO SOMETHING.  

00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:54.276
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: GOING TO THE 

00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:58.341
MOUNTAIN.  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA "GOING TO THE 

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:01.996
MOUNTAIN" REFERS TO TWO THINGS. 
FIRSTLY, IN OUR CULTURE, WE HAVE

00:11:01.997 --> 00:11:04.236
A RIGHT OF PASSAGE WHERE YOU 
MOVE FROM BEING A 

00:11:08.098 --> 00:11:10.098
BOY TO BEING A MAN AND THAT IS 
CIRCUMCISION.

00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:14.402
WE ARE CIRCUMCISED BETWEEN THE 
AGES OF 18 AND 21. BECAUSE WE 

00:11:14.403 --> 00:11:18.067
DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BE A MAN 
AT THE AGE WHEN YOU'RE BORN. YOU

00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:20.920
KNOW, USUALLY HERE IN THE WORLD,
YOU GET CIRCUMCISED WHEN YOU'RE 

00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:24.174
BORN. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SPOILER ALERT, 

00:11:24.175 --> 00:11:26.175
THERE'S AN ENTIRE CHAPTER ON 
YOUR EXPERIENCE.

00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:32.036
(LAUGHTER)  

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:37.397
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: FOR US, IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FIRSTLY 

00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:40.039
HOW TO BECOME A MAN, YOU HAVE TO
EARN THE RIGHTS TO BECOME A MAN.

00:11:43.298 --> 00:11:45.129
YOU DON'T JUST BECOME -- TURN 21
AND NOW YOU'RE REGARDED AS AN 

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.130
ADULT, NO, YOU HAVE TO EARN THIS
RIGHT. YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:56.349
AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT 
HAPPENS IS THE CHOP --

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:00.858
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: LET'S JUST SAY, THAT 
WAS THE -- AT NIGHT, YOU'RE 

00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.859
READING THIS AND GOING OKAY.

00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:07.800
I COULDN'T STOP READING.  

00:12:11.672 --> 00:12:13.672
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THAT'S THE FIRST -- 

00:12:14.885 --> 00:12:16.885
(LAUGHTER)  

00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:20.301
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THAT'S REFERS TO THE
CIRCUMCISION PROCESS WE GO 

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:22.542
THROUGH. IT'S RICH. BECAUSE YOU 
GET TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOU 

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:28.867
ARE, YOUR HISTORY, YOUR 
HERITAGE, YOUR SPIRITUAL BEING 

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:30.868
IN TERMS OF HOW YOU 

00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:35.338
RELATE TO OTHER TRIBES AND OTHER
CLANS.

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:39.199
AND SECOND, THE CHALLENGES, THE 
JOURNEY 

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:43.264
THAT ALL YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE IN 
THIS WORLD, PEOPLE OF MINORITY.

00:12:47.563 --> 00:12:50.016
WE FACE AN ENORMOUS TASK. YOU 
HAVE TO GO AND APPLY TO COLLEGE.

00:12:52.445 --> 00:12:53.867
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET 
ENOUGH GOOD GRADES TO APPLY TO 

00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:55.868
COLLEGE.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.759
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE GET -- WHEN
YOU GET INTO COLLEGE, HOW ARE 

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.406
YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THE TUITION
FEES? AND WHEN YOU FINISH 

00:13:01.407 --> 00:13:05.461
COLLEGE, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
PAY BACK THOSE TUITION FEES? AND

00:13:05.462 --> 00:13:07.462
NOW YOU MUST BEGIN YOUR CAREER. 

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.552
SO THESE ARE ALL LITERAL 
MOUNTAINS THAT WE'RE FACING AS 

00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:13.553
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:17.879
WORLD BECAUSE OUR JOB IS MUCH 
HARDER THAN THE AVERAGE WHITE 

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.911
WESTERNER WHO HAS GROWN UP IN 
THIS PRIVILEGED WORLD, YOU SEE.

00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:24.965
SO THIS IS WHAT GOING TO THE 
MOUNTAIN MEANS.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.067
AND AS NELSON MANDELA SAID, 
AFTER CLIMBING A GREAT HILL, AND

00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:31.970
YOU REACH THE TOP OF THAT HILL, 
YOU REALIZE THERE ARE SO MANY 

00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:33.971
MORE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB.

00:13:35.418 --> 00:13:38.311
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AND YOU HAVE THE 
PERSON THAT 

00:13:42.987 --> 00:13:45.009
WE ALL REVERE AND WE KNOW HIS 
PUBLIC PERSONA. WHEN YOU WERE 

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.466
11, YOU WENT TO LIVE WITH HIM.  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.  

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:52.299
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WHAT WAS -- JUST TELL
US ABOUT THAT.  

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.580
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, I WAS LIVING IN
A GHETTO IN JOHANNESBURG.

00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:06.975
AND SO ONE DAY, THIS GENTLEMAN 
CAME, MY GRANDFATHER'S DRIVER, 

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:10.024
AND HE SAID, I'VE BEEN SENT BY 
GRANDFATHER TO COME AND FETCH 

00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:14.104
YOU. COME, LET'S GO. THAT WAS --
I HAD ONLY MET MY GRANDFATHER 

00:14:14.105 --> 00:14:16.974
ONCE BEFORE IN 1990. THIS IS 
THREE YEARS LATER.  

00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:20.805
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WAS HE IN PRISON 
THEN? RIGHT? 

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:23.090
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WE MET HIM JUST 
BEFORE HE CAME OUT OF PRISON. 

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:26.136
AND THIS IS THREE YEARS LATER, 
NEVER SAW HIM, NEVER HEARD FROM 

00:14:26.137 --> 00:14:28.137
HIM.

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:31.429
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A DRIVER TOOK 
HIM AND WAS SENT BY HIM. 

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.660
I'M HOME ALONE BECAUSE I'M AT 
HOME AT 3:00 P.M.

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:38.509
MY PARENTS GET HOME AT 7:00 P.M.
FROM WORK.

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:42.862
SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT 
THE APPROVAL OF MY PARENTS. NO 

00:14:42.863 --> 00:14:45.113
CELL PHONES IN THOSE DAYS. DO 
YOU KNOW WHO YOUR GRANDFATHER 

00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:49.418
IS? ARE YOU CRAZY? 
DO I NEED TO LOSE MY JOB? 

00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:54.333
PLEASE, LET'S GO!
I SAID, NO, SIR, I CANNOT.E GAVE

00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:56.334
UP.

00:14:57.401 --> 00:14:59.639
MY PARENTS CAME HOME THAT 
EVENING AND I TOLD MY FATHER 

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.097
WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED AND HE SAID,
YOU KNOW, IF THAT MAN COMES 

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.362
AGAIN, YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM. 
LO AND BEHOLD, THAT MAN CAME 

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:08.363
BACK THE VERY SAME WEEK.

00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:13.490
AND I WENT TO THEM AND HE TOOK 
ME TO MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE, 

00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:15.491
WHICH WAS THIS BIG 

00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.361
HOUSE, A MANSION IN A WHITE 
SUBURB IN 

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:22.874
THE NORTHERN SUBURBS OF 
JOHANNESBURG, AND, YOU KNOW, 

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:24.875
BASICALLY MY GRANDFATHER 

00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.747
TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD BE SENDING
MY PARENTS TO COLLEGE AND WHILE 

00:15:27.748 --> 00:15:31.802
THEY WERE AT COLLEGE, THEY 
NEEDED TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL AND HE

00:15:31.803 --> 00:15:33.803
WAS GOING TO LOOK AFTER ME 
DURING THAT TIME.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:41.597
I SLEPT OVER THAT DAY. MY FATHER
CAME THE NEXT DAY AND HE SAID, 

00:15:41.598 --> 00:15:44.040
YEAH, WELL, THIS IS WHAT MY 
FATHER HAS DECIDED -- YOUR 

00:15:44.041 --> 00:15:47.898
GRANDFATHER -- AND THIS IS 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AS A 

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:49.119
YOUNG PERSON IN ANY AFRICAN 
FAMILY, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH 

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.187
CHOICE. YOU DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.  
AND SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

00:15:57.453 --> 00:15:59.488
AND NOW FROM A GHETTO, FROM 
SLEEPING, EATING RICE AND TOMATO

00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:02.346
SAUCE, THAT WAS MY STAPLE DIET, 
BECAUSE WE GREW UP IN A 

00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:09.677
POOR HOME, TO MOVING INTO THIS 
MANSION WHERE THERE ARE CHEFS, 

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.702
DRIVERS, SECURITY, GARDINERS, 
STAFF, STAFF, STAFF, STAFF, 

00:16:11.703 --> 00:16:16.388
STAFF.  
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED YOU 

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:20.448
FELT LIKE "THE FRESH PRINCE OF 
BELL AIR."   

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:25.740
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: KIND OF WAS LIKE 
THAT, YOU KNOW? TO BE HONEST? 

00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:28.786
YOU WENT AND THERE YOU WERE. AND
THERE HE WAS.

00:16:34.858 --> 00:16:37.991
BUT A PRIVATE PERSON THAT MOST 
OF US COULD NEVER IMAGINE. WHAT 

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:40.023
WAS THAT LIKE? 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ACTUALLY -- THE FIRST 

00:16:40.024 --> 00:16:42.024
CUP ALL 

00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:47.132
OF YEARS, THERE WASN'T MUCH 
CONVERSATION HAPPENING.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.209
HE WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN. HE TOLD
ME EVERY TIME MY ROOM WAS IN A 

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.210
MESS.

00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:02.814
THINGS THAT REVOLVED AROUND 
SCHOOL, WHAT I NEEDED FOR 

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:05.863
SCHOOL, BOOKS, UNIFORMS, SPORTS,
ALL ABOUT HOW THE REPORT CARD 

00:17:05.864 --> 00:17:11.187
WAS LOOKING. NOT MUCH OUTSIDE OF
SCHOOL STUFF, BASICALLY. AND I 

00:17:11.188 --> 00:17:12.000
REMEMBER ONCE, I LOST MY JERSEY 
-- MY SCHOOL JERSEY FOR THE 

00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:14.001
SECOND TIME.

00:17:18.106 --> 00:17:20.634
AND, OF COURSE, I HAD TO TELL 
HIM, I NEEDED A NEW ONE. I WENT 

00:17:20.635 --> 00:17:22.635
AND I TOLD HIM AND I WAS VERY 
NERVOUS.

00:17:34.933 --> 00:17:36.758
HE CHANGED HIS FACE ALL OF A 
SUDDEN. TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO 

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:40.626
SLEEP OUTSIDE!
OH, OKAY. OUT I WENT, OUTSIDE. I

00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:42.627
WAS PLAYING SOCCER IN THE 
GARAGE.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.930
IRS AT FIRST, IT WAS KIND OF 
OKAY. STARTED TO GET COLD, DARK.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.430
I SAW THE COOK BRING ME 
BLANKETS.

00:17:57.098 --> 00:17:58.964
SHE GAVE ME THE BLANKET AND I 
THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD, I'M REALLY 

00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:01.952
GOING TO SLEEP OUTSIDE. 

00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:08.308
MAYBE 20 MINUTES, I MAKE MY 
LITTLE BED ON THE GRASS.

00:18:12.851 --> 00:18:15.289
AND THEN 20 MINUTES LATER I CAME
UP AND HE CALLED ME AND HE SAID 

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.581
IF YOU EVER LOSE ANOTHER JERSEY,
YOU WILL DEFINITELY SLEEP 

00:18:20.582 --> 00:18:20.991
OUTSIDE, NOW GO INSIDE, HAVE 
YOUR DINNER AND GO STRAIGHT TO 

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:22.992
BED.

00:18:26.681 --> 00:18:28.512
IT WAS KIND OF HARSH BUT IT 
WORKED. I NEVER LOST ANOTHER 

00:18:28.513 --> 00:18:31.153
JERSEY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP 

00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:33.154
WHERE HE MENTIONED HE WAS THE 
DISCIPLINARIAN.

00:18:37.452 --> 00:18:39.081
IN HINDSIGHT, DO YOU THINK THAT 
YOU NEEDED IT? 

00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:41.318
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, OF COURSE. I WAS A
LITTLE KNUCKLE HEAD BACK THEN.

00:18:47.013 --> 00:18:49.266
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN AND 
FUN AND MORE FUN. WHETHER IT WAS

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:52.115
-- WASN'T PLAY STATION BACK 
THEN, IT WAS SAGA.  YOU KNOW? OR

00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:54.558
SOCCER. YOU KNOW? THAT WAS -- OR
WATCHING A MOVIE.

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:04.755
I'D GO TO HIM ON FRIDAY, 
SATURDAY, HEY, CAN I HAVE 50 

00:19:04.756 --> 00:19:06.582
RAND TO GO WATCH A MOVIE WITH MY
FRIENDS. AND HE WOULD ALWAYS 

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:10.070
GIVE ME. NOT ONE TIME HE SAID 
NO.  

00:19:14.346 --> 00:19:17.393
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SO THERE WAS A 
SOFTNESS UNDER THERE. 

00:19:19.023 --> 00:19:21.865
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: I WROTE THIS DOWN, TO

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:26.945
BE THE FATHER OF A NATION WAS A 
GREAT HONOR BUT TO BE FATHER OF 

00:19:26.946 --> 00:19:31.006
A FAMILY WAS A GREAT JOY, A JOY 
I HAD FAR TOO LITTLE OF. AND IN 

00:19:31.007 --> 00:19:34.057
THE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT, HE 
MISSED THAT. SO WITH YOU HE HAD 

00:19:34.058 --> 00:19:36.058
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.559
&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO. I GUESS SO.

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.451
I MEAN, I ALSO STAYED WITH MY 

00:19:49.112 --> 00:19:51.755
GRANDMOTHER A LITTLE BIT, 
GRANDMA WINNIE. HE COULD HAVE 

00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:53.756
SENT ME TO GO STAY WITH HER.

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.296
OR MY REAL GRANDMOTHER FROM THE 
FIRST MARRIAGE, HIS FIRST WIFE 

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.297
WAS STILL ALIVE. MY AUNT WAS 
STILL AROUND.

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:12.167
BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE ME IN AND
STAY WITH HIM. HE HAD OPTIONINGS

00:20:12.168 --> 00:20:14.168
BUT HE DECIDED I'M GOING TO 
DISCIPLINE THIS YOUNG MAN, I'M 

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:18.088
GOING TO SHOW HIM THE WAY OF 
LIFE. SO PERHAPS THAT WAS HIS 

00:20:18.089 --> 00:20:20.089
WAY OF MAKING 

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:24.606
SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW, 
COMPENSATION OR RESTITUTION OR 

00:20:24.607 --> 00:20:26.233
WHAT -- BE THE FATHER FIGURE 
THAT HE NEVER HAD THE 

00:20:26.234 --> 00:20:29.294
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE 
HE HAD TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE 

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:31.295
SACRIFICE. 
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:38.241
INSTEAD OF TAKING HIS KID TO GO 
RIDE 

00:20:39.694 --> 00:20:41.745
BIKES, HE HAD TO GO ORGANIZE 
PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND MARCHES 

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:46.628
AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO KEEP THE 
ANC ALIVE WHILE IT WAS BAD. HE 

00:20:46.629 --> 00:20:48.256
HAD SO MANY THINGS TO DO TO 
FOCUS ON TB COUNTRY. SO HE HAD 

00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:50.257
TO MAKE A VERY HARD DECISION.

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:00.045
SATISFY HIS FAMILY OR FIVE 
PEOPLE OR THE GREATER GOOD OR 4 

00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:02.046
MILLION OR 5 MILLION.

00:21:08.943 --> 00:21:11.228
&gt;&gt; AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IN 
PRIVATE HE WAS SOME OF THE 

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.229
THINGS THAT WE COULD SEE -- 
HUMBLE AND FORGIVING.

00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:20.586
AND HE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR, 
THOUGH.  

00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:25.681
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: GREAT SENSE OF 
HUMOR. HE WAS MISCHIEVOUS WITH 

00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:28.900
HIS HUMOR, TO BE HONEST WITH 
YOU. 

00:21:32.035 --> 00:21:34.678
ONE TIME I HAD ASKED A FEMALE 
FRIEND TO COME OVER FOR LUNCH. 

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:37.315
AND SO HE SAYS, OH, NICE TO MEET
YOU.  SO DID YOU PROPOSE TO MY 

00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:39.316
GRANDSON?

00:21:42.189 --> 00:21:46.869
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: OKAY.  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU CAN IMAGINE THE 

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.924
YOUNG LADY BLUSHING. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

00:21:50.128 --> 00:21:54.596
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO THROW ME -- LIKE, HEY, HAVE 

00:21:54.597 --> 00:21:57.037
YOU SEEN MINUTE GRANDSON. I WAS 
A BIT TOO YOUNG.

00:22:00.103 --> 00:22:02.133
BECAUSE YOU USED TO HAVE -- MISS
SOUTH AFRICA WOULD COME OVER, 

00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:04.134
MISS UNIVERSE 

00:22:05.383 --> 00:22:07.213
WOULD COME OVER, MISS WORLD 
WOULD COME OVER. I WAS IN AWE 

00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:10.362
BUT I WAS WAY TOO I DON'T THINK.
I COULDN'T REALLY HANG. 

00:22:10.771 --> 00:22:13.643
HE DIDN'T CARE. HE WOULD BE JUST
LIKE, HEY, DID YOU SEE MY 

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:15.644
GRANDSON?

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:25.460
THAT WAS PRETTY NICE.  
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SO DURING THIS TIME, 

00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:28.310
HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE 
NATION. WERE YOU AWARE OF THOSE 

00:22:28.311 --> 00:22:31.357
-- HE WAS WORKING WITH YOU AND 
BEING PART OF YOUR LIFE, BUT HE 

00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:33.358
WAS HELPING TO BUILD THE NATION 
AGAIN?  

00:22:34.822 --> 00:22:35.636
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, HE WAS VERY 
BUSY. HE TRAVELLED A LOT, OF 

00:22:35.637 --> 00:22:37.637
COURSE.

00:22:44.192 --> 00:22:46.192
THERE WERE MANY WEEKS I DIDN'T 
SEE HIM.

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.246
IT WAS FUN, I COULD GET AWAY 
WITH MURDER.

00:22:51.574 --> 00:22:53.198
I COULD PLAY GAMES UNTIL 2:00 IN
THE MORNING. AND NO ONE WOULD 

00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:55.439
SAY ANYTHING. BUT WHEN HE WAS 
HOME, HEY, THE CHIEF IS HOME. 

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.596
YOU HAD TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN 
LINE. BUT THE ONE THING I 

00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:01.597
REALIZED ABOUT HIM 

00:23:03.475 --> 00:23:06.126
IS THAT THAT'S A MAN WITH SO 
MUCH COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE, FOR 

00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:08.127
ORDINARY PEOPLE.

00:23:13.464 --> 00:23:14.906
YOU CAN IMAGINE -- MICHAEL 
JACKSON HAD BEEN TO OUR HOME 

00:23:14.907 --> 00:23:16.907
TWICE.

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:20.185
EVEN FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH, 
EVANDER HOLYFIELD, MIKE TYSON, 

00:23:20.186 --> 00:23:22.186
YOU NAME IT.

00:23:25.827 --> 00:23:27.827
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT

00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:32.563
VISITED US HE TREATED THE SAME 
WAY AS 

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:38.283
MAMA KOLI WHO COOKED FOR US, 
ALSO AS THE GARDENER AND THE 

00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:40.284
DRIVER.

00:23:41.352 --> 00:23:43.586
ONE THING NELSON MANDELA 
UNDERSTOOD SIMILAR TO MARTIN 

00:23:43.587 --> 00:23:46.020
LUTHER KING, YOU DON'T JUDGE 
PEOPLE BY THEIR SKIN COLOR, 

00:23:46.021 --> 00:23:48.021
THEIR AGE, RACE, SEXUALITY.

00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:51.924
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EACH PERSON 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE 

00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:54.761
GREATNESS AND WE SHOULD ALLOW 
THAT PERSON TO HAVE THE 

00:23:57.433 --> 00:23:58.444
OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE 
GREATNESS THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE 

00:23:58.445 --> 00:24:01.100
FOR THEMSELVES.  

00:24:04.293 --> 00:24:06.293
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:24:17.647 --> 00:24:22.124
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED HE 
TREATED EVERYONE THE SAME. I WAS

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:24.766
REALLY TAKEN WITH HIS PHONE CALL
WITH QUEEN ELIZABETH. WE THINK 

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.448
OF HER  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I KNOW, I KNOW. 

00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:34.574
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS ALSO
VERY MISCHIEVOUS WITH 

00:24:34.575 --> 00:24:38.409
GRANDFATHER. I REMEMBER ONE 
AFTERNOON -- NOT SURE I SHOULD 

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.677
TELL THIS STORY. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: OH, DO. 

00:24:42.883 --> 00:24:45.775
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: IT'S A BIT LATE NOW.
A BIT LATE  GRAND DAD, PLEASE 

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.776
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS ONE. 

00:24:52.312 --> 00:24:54.312
WE WERE HAVING LUNCH, ME, MY 
GRANDFATHER 

00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:58.389
AND AUNTIE -- MAMA KOLI COMES 
AND THE PHONE NUMBER COMES IN.

00:25:00.673 --> 00:25:01.485
WE USED TO CALL HIM FATHER -- 
TATA -- IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH ON 

00:25:01.486 --> 00:25:03.486
THE LINE.

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:07.667
PUT HER THROUGH, PUT HER 
THROUGH. AND THEN THE PHONE 

00:25:07.668 --> 00:25:11.138
COMES. HE PICKS IT UP. HELLO, 
ELIZABETH, HOW ARE YOU?

00:25:18.227 --> 00:25:20.509
(LAUGHTER)  AND THEY HAVE A 
CONVERSATION. 

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.940
THEY TALK, THEY TALK.

00:25:25.589 --> 00:25:27.827
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY, BYE, BYE. 
AND HOW CAN YOU CALL THE QUEEN 

00:25:27.828 --> 00:25:30.066
BY HER NAME, YOU HAVE TO SAY 
YOUR IMAGESTY!

00:25:35.164 --> 00:25:40.437
AND HE TURNED TO HER AND SAY, 
WHY, SHE CALLS ME NELSON?  

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:42.438
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:25:46.535 --> 00:25:48.535
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW.  

00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.443
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WE ALWAYS CALL EACH 
OTHER BY OUR FIRST NAME. DO YOU 

00:25:53.444 --> 00:25:56.287
FORGET I'M A PRINCE. DO YOU 
FORGET I'M A PRINCE, DARLING? 

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:59.130
HMM? WHERE IS THE LOYALTY HERE. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW.

00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:09.116
SO YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE SIDE AND
YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS LEGACY. 

00:26:09.117 --> 00:26:10.741
THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 
HERE AND WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU 

00:26:10.742 --> 00:26:13.790
ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE LESSONS 
THAT YOU THINK CAN BE APPLIED 

00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:15.791
TODAY.

00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:18.845
THERE WAS A LOT ABOUT 
RECONCILIATION, 

00:26:21.918 --> 00:26:24.354
AND BEING ABLE TO LET GO OF, 
NOW, NEVER TO FORGET THE HATE, 

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:28.231
BUT TO LET THINGS GO.  TO 
RECONCILE.  

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:33.116
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, YOU KNOW, I 
THINK NELSON MANDELA OBVIOUSLY 

00:26:33.117 --> 00:26:36.586
HE TRIED THE PEACEFUL WAY.  
RIGHT?  A PEACEFUL MARCH.

00:26:42.448 --> 00:26:45.186
BUT HE SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW THAT
ALL THE PEACEFUL MARCHES, 

00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:47.187
IMPORTANT AS 

00:26:48.675 --> 00:26:50.675
THEY WERE, THEY WERE ONLY MET 
WITH 

00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:54.195
VIOLENCE AND SAVAGE ATTACKS BY 
THE GOVERNMENT. SO THEY DECIDED 

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.196
TO NOW TAKE UP MILITARY ACTION 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:03.355
AND SO HE BECAME THE FIRST 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 

00:27:03.356 --> 00:27:05.356
MILITARY ARM OF THE ANC.

00:27:06.816 --> 00:27:09.648
HE TRAINED IN ALGERIA FOR SIX 
MONTHS. AND SIX MONTHS WITH AN 

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:11.649
EMPEROR.

00:27:14.742 --> 00:27:15.963
AND HE CAME BACK AND STARTED 
OBVIOUSLY HITTING BACK AT THE 

00:27:15.964 --> 00:27:18.605
ENEMY. BUT THEY DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY
ATTACK PEOPLE.

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:23.656
THEY ATTACKED THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS.

00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:28.167
SO THEY ATTACKED THE POWER 
LINES, THE POWER STATIONS, THEY 

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:32.044
ATTACKED THE TELEPHONE 
INFRASTRUCTURE, BASICALLY. BUT, 

00:27:32.045 --> 00:27:35.452
OF COURSE, THERE WERE CASUALTIES
AS IS IN ANY WAR. 

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.166
CAPTURED AND SPENT TIME IN 
PRISON.

00:27:51.624 --> 00:27:53.624
HE GOT TO SEE THE INDEPENDENCE 
THAT WAS 

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.873
HAPPENING ACROSS AFRICA, FROM 
1960 GHANA 

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.211
TO 1980 IN ZIMBABWE AND MOST OF 
THE COUNTRIES WERE GAINING 

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.212
INDEPENDENCE IN AFRICA WERE 
GOING THROUGH CIVIL WAR.

00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:08.555
AND I THINK HE REALLY WANTED TO 
STOP THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT 

00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:10.556
WAS REALLY 

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:15.789
EATING AWAY AT OUR

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.540
COUNTRY, OUR SOCIETY.

00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:25.056
AND AS HE CAME OUT, HE DECIDED 
TO OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, FORGIVE 

00:28:25.057 --> 00:28:27.494
HIS CAPTORS. FORGIVE THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST HIM,

00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:29.495
YOU KNOW?

00:28:32.424 --> 00:28:35.066
AND THE ONE THING THAT I HAVE TO
ASK MYSELF IS, FIRST OF ALL, 

00:28:35.067 --> 00:28:39.766
THAT IS ONE SUPER UNNATURAL 
THING TO DO, BECAUSE IF I WAS 

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:42.413
THERE FOR FIVE YEARS, EVEN, LET 
ALONE 27 YEARS, FIVE YEARS, I 

00:28:42.414 --> 00:28:44.414
WOULD COME 

00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:47.893
OUT WITH THE VENGEANCE AND THE 
ANGER OF -- OF A GORILLA, RIGHT?

00:28:50.384 --> 00:28:51.400
AND I WOULD WANT TO BLAST ALL OF
MY ENEMIES.

00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:56.278
BUT HE DIDN'T. WHICH IS 
SOMETHING VERY UNNATURAL. 

00:29:03.604 --> 00:29:06.043
SECONDLY, A LOT OF COUNTRIES -- 
LEADERS WHO WERE CAUGHT WERE 

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:09.297
KILLED IN INCARCERATION. THEY 
DIDN'T LAST LONG. SO HOW COME 

00:29:09.298 --> 00:29:14.436
NELSON MANDELA WAS NOT KILLED?  
WHY WAS NELSON MANDELA SPARED? 

00:29:17.707 --> 00:29:19.356
AND THE ONLY ANSWER THAT I CAN 
COME TO IS THAT GOD SAVED HIM. 

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:23.832
THAT GOD WAS THE ONE WHO WAS ON 
THE SIDE AND KEPT HIM ALIVE FOR 

00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:25.833
A SPECIFIC 

00:29:27.303 --> 00:29:29.303
PURPOSE THAT HE HAD TO PLAY 
AFTER HE CAME OUT OF PRISON.

00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:35.201
AND SO HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY 
NEEDED 

00:29:36.874 --> 00:29:37.682
TO CURE THIS  VICIOUS CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE THAT WAS TAKING OUR 

00:29:37.683 --> 00:29:39.683
COUNTRY.

00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:44.971
AND HE AND BISHOP TUTU CAME UP 
WITH 

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.420
THE TRUTH AND 

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.720
RECONCILIATION TALKS THAT CAME 
OUT OF 

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.218
THE 90s, THOSE WHO HAD LOST 
LOVED ONES, TORTURED, WRONGFULLY

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:01.473
INCARS RATED FOR MANY YEARS -- 
INCARCERATED FOR MANY YEARS TO 

00:30:01.474 --> 00:30:03.474
SIT WITH 

00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:10.096
THEIR VICTIMS AND HAVE SOME SORT
OF RESTORITIVE JUSTICE AND FOR 

00:30:10.097 --> 00:30:13.955
THE PERPETRATORS BE ABLE TO 
DEVOLVE EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION

00:30:13.956 --> 00:30:16.228
IN RETURN FOR AMNESTY. A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FEEL THAT IT WASN'T 

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:19.037
REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:22.529
BUT I THINK IT REALLY LAY THE 
FOUNDATION TO TRY AND GET THE 

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:28.022
BALL ROLLING FOR A NEW DISPEN 
SAYINGS, FOR A NEW COUNTRY, CALL

00:30:28.023 --> 00:30:30.023
IT THE RAINBOW NATION.

00:30:31.071 --> 00:30:33.912
THAT WOULD BE -- AND THEN PEOPLE
UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF PEACE 

00:30:33.913 --> 00:30:37.775
AND HARMONY OVER THE CONTINUED 
VIOLENCE THAT THEY'D BEEN 

00:30:37.776 --> 00:30:39.776
EXPERIENCING FOR SO MANY 
DECADES.

00:30:43.668 --> 00:30:45.668
AND I THINK IT WAS JUST HIS WAY 
OF 

00:30:48.756 --> 00:30:50.373
TRYING TO -- TO AMEND AND TO -- 
AND TO ELIMINATE HIS ENEMIES.  

00:30:50.374 --> 00:30:55.052
YOU KNOW? BECAUSE ONE OF THE 
THINGS YOU SAID WAS THAT IN 

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:56.481
ORDER TO DEFEAT YOUR ENEMY, YOU 
MUST WORK WITH YOUR UH ENEMY, 

00:30:56.482 --> 00:30:58.482
BECAUSE THEN HE BECOMES YOUR 
PARTNER.

00:31:04.004 --> 00:31:06.004
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN:

00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:11.567
AND HE HAD YOU LEARN AFTERRY KAN
-- AFRIKKAN.  

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.095
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I DIDN'T LEARN IT. 
I DID LEARN A LITTLE BIT PCHLT 

00:31:18.096 --> 00:31:20.096
THERE ARE 

00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:24.614
MANY AFRIKKAN SPEAKING PEOPLE 
HERE? NO. I WAKE UP IN THE 

00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:26.615
MORNING, HE WOULD BE IN THE 
LOUNGE, HE WOULD READ THE 

00:31:28.479 --> 00:31:30.479
NEWSPAPERS BACK-TO-BACK.

00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:33.525
HE WAS VERY FLUENT IN AFRIKKANS.
READING AND WRITING.

00:31:36.407 --> 00:31:38.820
SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN IN JAIL, 
THE WARDEN THAT WAS LOOKING 

00:31:38.821 --> 00:31:41.457
AFTER THE CELL HAD TO BE CHANGED
EVERY THREE MONTHS 

00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:46.533
BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT
NELSON 

00:31:48.001 --> 00:31:50.435
MANDELA WOULD BE ABLE TO REALLY 
CONNECT WITH ANY HUMAN BEING, 

00:31:50.436 --> 00:31:52.436
INCLUDING THE GUARDS, RIGHT? 
INCLUDING THE GUARDS.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.330
SO HOW HE DID IT IS THAT THE 
GUARDS 

00:31:58.797 --> 00:32:00.797
WOULD RECEIVE LETTERS FROM THE 
LOVED 

00:32:02.657 --> 00:32:04.891
ONES, BUT THEY WERE NOT AS 
EDUCATED AS HE WAS IN THEIR OWN 

00:32:04.892 --> 00:32:06.892
LANGUAGE.

00:32:07.943 --> 00:32:10.185
SO HE WOULD TRANSLATE THE 
LETTERS FOR THE WARDEN THAT WERE

00:32:10.186 --> 00:32:12.186
LOOKING AFTER HIM.

00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:16.081
AND THEN HE WAS VERY HAPPY HE 
UNDERSTANDS AND NOW HE WOULD 

00:32:16.082 --> 00:32:21.186
CONVINCE THEM TO SMUGGLE HIM AN 
EXTRA FEW SLICES OF BREAD, AN 

00:32:21.187 --> 00:32:23.187
EXTRA COUPLE OF ORANGES AND 

00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:28.297
FRUITS, AN EXTRA BLANKET, SOME 
EXTRA JACKETS, YOU UNDERSTAND? 

00:32:28.298 --> 00:32:29.732
ONCE THE AUTHORITIES FOUND THIS 
OUT, OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE 

00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:32.171
COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY, YOU 
KNOW, ANGRY. SO THEY CHANGED THE

00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:35.022
GUARD. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'D 
CHANGE THE GUARD, THE SAME THING

00:32:35.023 --> 00:32:37.868
WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.  

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:42.919
SO EVEN IN PRISON, THERE WAS NO 
ONE 

00:32:44.175 --> 00:32:45.803
GUARD THAT COULD LOOK AFTER 
NELSON MANDELA WITHOUT HIM 

00:32:45.804 --> 00:32:47.804
ENDING UP BECOMING A FRIEND OF 
NELSON MANDELA.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.338
THAT IS THE SPIRIT AND THE POWER
OF MANDIBA.

00:32:56.036 --> 00:32:57.664
I BELIEVE HE HAD A GIFT FROM GOD
THAT HE COULD CONNECT WITH HIS 

00:32:57.665 --> 00:32:58.916
COMPASSION TO ANYBODY, WHETHER 
THAT PERSON SPOKE ENGLISH OR 

00:32:58.917 --> 00:33:00.917
NOT.

00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:05.413
BUT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT 
WITH YOU.  

00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:09.524
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: DO YOU THINK HE 
REALIZED? HE KNEW HE HAD THIS 

00:33:09.525 --> 00:33:11.963
GIFT? OR HE HAD THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY?  

00:33:15.617 --> 00:33:16.425
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I THINK HE KNEW HE 
HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY. I DON'T

00:33:16.426 --> 00:33:18.426
KNOW ABOUT THE GIFT.

00:33:20.502 --> 00:33:22.502
BUT I THINK HE DEFINITELY KNEW 
THAT HE HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:26.165
AND I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE HE 
TAUGHT ME --

00:33:28.427 --> 00:33:30.667
HE TOLD ME, DABA, YOU'RE A 
MANDELA, THEREFORE PEOPLE WILL 

00:33:30.668 --> 00:33:32.668
LOOK AT YOU AS A LEADER.

00:33:34.134 --> 00:33:36.976
AND AS A LEADER, YOU MUST GET 
THE BEST MARKS IN CLASS. I WAS 

00:33:36.977 --> 00:33:39.433
LIKE, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. 
YOU KNOW? I WANTED TO BE A 

00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.434
NORMAL KID.

00:33:43.293 --> 00:33:45.969
AND PLAY AND HAVE FUN AND DO A 
NORMAL KID. I DON'T HAVE THE 

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.476
PLEASURE OF HAVING TO STUDY ALL 
-- EVERY DAY SO THAT I CAN HAVE 

00:33:50.477 --> 00:33:53.932
THE BEST MARKS IN CLASS SO I CAN
BE A LEADER? YOU KNOW? FOR ME, I

00:33:53.933 --> 00:33:56.569
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT AT 
THE TIME. ONLY MUCH LATER THAT I

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:01.886
COME TO GRIPS WITH IT.  
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AND SO YOU'VE BEEN 

00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:05.136
ABLE TO, WITH YOUR FOUNDATION 
AND TO REALLY SEE HOW YOU CAN 

00:34:05.137 --> 00:34:07.782
KEEP IT. 
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, YES. 

00:34:09.816 --> 00:34:10.626
OBVIOUSLY, INSPIRED ME 
INDIRECTLY TO START THIS 

00:34:10.627 --> 00:34:14.918
FOUNDATION. BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF 
THE MAIN REASONS I STARTED THIS 

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.919
FOUNDATION IS I WAS LUCKY 

00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:18.588
TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL, YOU KNOW, 
WITH MY GRANDFATHER AND WITHOUT 

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.589
HIM. 

00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.728
AND I REMEMBER MY FIRST TRIP 
HERE IN -- IN AMERICA, WE WENT 

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.729
TO DISNEY WORLD, OF COURSE.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.861
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD WITH MY 
YOUNGER AND OLDER BROTHERS AND 

00:34:31.862 --> 00:34:33.862
COUSINS. 

00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:38.171
AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET ON THE
ROLLER COASTER. YOU GET IN THE 

00:34:38.172 --> 00:34:41.638
LINE, YOU GET IN FRONT OF THE 
QUEUE, EVENTUALLY. AND THE 

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:45.312
GENTLEMAN HI, HOW ARE YOU? WHERE
ARE YOU FROM? I'M FROM SOUTH 

00:34:45.313 --> 00:34:47.313
AFRICA.

00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:51.623
HE SAYS TO ME, WELL, HOW BIG DO 
THE LIONS GET.

00:34:56.293 --> 00:34:57.513
I LOOKED AT MY COUSIN AND SAID, 
SORRY, SIR, I DON'T WORK AT THE 

00:34:57.514 --> 00:34:59.956
ZOO. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG 
LIONS GET. 

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.039
THEN WE TRAVEL TO LONDON AND 
SOMEBODY SAYS, HEY, WOW, YOU 

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.040
KNOW, HI, HOW ARE YOU?

00:35:08.088 --> 00:35:10.326
AFRICA, I HEARD IT'S DANGEROUS. 
I NEED SECURITY TO COME TO SOUTH

00:35:10.327 --> 00:35:14.623
AFRICA. IT'S QUITE SAFE. MY 
GRANDFATHER WAS PRESIDENT, I 

00:35:14.624 --> 00:35:18.088
DON'T EVEN HAVE SECURITY. I 
THINK YOU'LL BE JUST FINE. 

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.153
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE. THEN WE 
TRAVEL TO NEW YORK. AND ANOTHER 

00:35:22.154 --> 00:35:25.806
PERSON CAME IN THE SAME FASHION.
AND THEN I REALIZED, OH, MAN, 

00:35:25.807 --> 00:35:29.471
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. 
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTINENT 

00:35:29.472 --> 00:35:32.741
HAVE A VERY SKEWED PERCEPTION OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR 

00:35:32.742 --> 00:35:34.742
CONTINENT.

00:35:36.243 --> 00:35:38.687
AND THIS IS MAINLY PERPETUATED 
BY MAIN STREAM MEDIA THAT AFRICA

00:35:38.688 --> 00:35:41.121
IS A PLACE OF WAR, POVERTY, 
DISEASE, AND DICTATORS.

00:35:44.602 --> 00:35:46.641
NOW, WE'RE NOT HERE TO DENY 
THESE THINGS EXIST, HOWEVER, 

00:35:46.642 --> 00:35:48.642
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUALITY 
THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IN AFRICA 

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.127
THAN WHAT YOU SEE ON YOUR TV. 
AND SO WE DECIDED TO START 

00:35:52.128 --> 00:35:54.128
SOMETHING. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
IT WAS.

00:35:56.805 --> 00:35:59.043
WE DECIDED TO START SOMETHING. 
SO WHEN I GOT BACK HOME, ME AND 

00:35:59.044 --> 00:36:03.327
MY COUSIN CALLED OUR COLLEAGUES,
RIGHT? AND I SAID, GUYS, THERE'S

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:05.328
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE IMAGE 
OF AFRICA. 

00:36:05.768 --> 00:36:09.831
WE NEED TO CHANGE IT. AND WHAT I
REALIZED THAT DAY IS I WAS NOT 

00:36:09.832 --> 00:36:11.463
SPECIAL BECAUSE MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE I CALLED TO THE MEETING 

00:36:11.464 --> 00:36:13.464
FELT THE VERY SAME WAY.

00:36:18.428 --> 00:36:19.645
SO IT WASN'T I AM IN THE HEART 
OF AFRICAN YOUTH IN GENERAL, 

00:36:19.646 --> 00:36:22.295
THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO. 
THEY'VE SEEN IT AND EXPERIENCED 

00:36:22.296 --> 00:36:26.777
IT. SO THAT DAY WE DECIDED TO BE
A FOUNDATION, A NON-PROFITABLE 

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:31.871
ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON 
YOUTH EMPOWERMENT BECAUSE WE 

00:36:31.872 --> 00:36:34.543
UNDERSTAND THAT THE TASK AT HAND
IS NOT GOING TO BE ACHIEVED 

00:36:34.544 --> 00:36:38.024
OVERNIGHT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE 
TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS FOR US 

00:36:38.025 --> 00:36:39.852
TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE 
BREAKING DOWN OF THE 

00:36:39.853 --> 00:36:44.353
MISCONCEPTION OF A AFRICA SO 
THEY CAN SEE IT AS A PLACE WHERE

00:36:44.354 --> 00:36:46.184
THEY CAN GO ON HOLIDAY, THEY CAN
SEE IT AS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

00:36:46.185 --> 00:36:48.185
DO BUSINESS. THIS IS A PLACE -- 

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.208
YOU

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.137
LOOK AT THE TOP TEN GROWING 
ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD RIGHT 

00:36:55.138 --> 00:36:57.781
NOW, SEVEN OF THOSE ARE COMING 
FROM THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA. 

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:01.846
RIGHT? MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
THAT. YOU WANT REAL GROWTH AND 

00:37:01.847 --> 00:37:03.878
INVESTMENT AND RETURN ON YOUR 
CAPITAL.  COME TO AFRICA.

00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:12.450
YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN AND 
EXPERIENCE THE MOST TROPICAL AND

00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:14.451
AMAZING ISLANDS, COME TO AFRICA.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.375
YOU WANT THE FRESHEST, CLEANEST 
GARMENT DRAPING DOWN YOUR BODY, 

00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:19.376
COME TO AFRICA.  
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.582
I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF 
THE FASHION HOUSES, WHETHER IT 

00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:31.583
BE LOUIS 

00:37:32.629 --> 00:37:35.074
VUITTON, HUGO BOSS, HI END, LOW 
END, THEY'RE ALL SEEKING 

00:37:35.075 --> 00:37:37.104
INSPIRATION FROM AFRICA.
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE 

00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:39.105
MUSIC AND DANCING. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: I WAS GOING TO ASK.

00:37:41.595 --> 00:37:43.595
AND ART.  

00:37:48.521 --> 00:37:50.552
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SO WE BASICALLY 
FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE 

00:37:50.553 --> 00:37:52.553
HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, 

00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:55.833
FOCUS ON EDUCATION, FOR 
DEVELOPMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:58.571 --> 00:38:00.815
SO WE ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING A 
THREE-MONTH CODING PROGRAM FOR 

00:38:00.816 --> 00:38:02.816
40 KIDS 

00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:07.494
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 20 UNEMPLOYED
YOUTH. 

00:38:08.544 --> 00:38:10.798
AND IN SOUTH AFRICA, ONE OF OUR 
CHALLENGES IS WE HAVE 60% TO 70%

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:15.287
OF OUR YOUTH ARE UNEMPLOYED AND 
OVER 60% OF THEM ARE 

00:38:15.288 --> 00:38:17.288
UNEMPLOYABLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT
HAVE SKILLS.

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.785
TO ACTUALLY GET A JOB. 
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WHAT ABOUT THE SCHOOL

00:38:20.786 --> 00:38:22.786
SYSTEMS?

00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:25.463
I KNOW THERE WAS -- 
THERE WERE DIVISIONS AND THINGS.

00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:30.521
SO, NOW, HOW ARE YOUR EDUCATION 
SYSTEMS?

00:38:35.665 --> 00:38:37.085
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU KNOW, THE STORY 
OF SOUTH AFRICA IS THAT WE HAVE 

00:38:37.086 --> 00:38:40.375
THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC. THE 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN SOUTH AFRICA 

00:38:40.376 --> 00:38:43.445
ARE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD, HAVE THE BEST FACILITIES 

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.687
IN THE WORLD. AND CAN REALLY 
COMPARE TO ANY IN THE WORLD.

00:38:50.157 --> 00:38:54.011
BUT THE PUBLIC NOT AS GOOD -- WE
HAD A FEW GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 

00:38:54.012 --> 00:38:56.012
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE 
LACKING IN MANY WAYS.  YOU KNOW?

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.948
WHETHER IT'S THE ATTITUDE OF THE
TEACHERS, YOU KNOW? THE 

00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:04.949
FACILITIES.

00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:08.043
BUT SHEER DOWN THE MANAGEMENT OF
RESOURCES OR LACK OF RESOURCES 

00:39:08.044 --> 00:39:11.721
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR. I MEAN, I KNOW A SCHOOL 

00:39:11.722 --> 00:39:13.722
WHICH IS NOT 

00:39:15.423 --> 00:39:18.266
TOO FAR FROM OUR VILLAGE, THEY 
ARE STUDYING IN A -- YOU KNOW, 

00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:20.267
THE SHIPMENT CONTAINERS, THAT IS
A SCHOOL.

00:39:21.947 --> 00:39:24.641
THE SHIPMENT CONTAINER -- A 
WHOLE SCHOOL.  

00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:28.269
LOOKING AFTER ABOUT 200 
CHILDREN.

00:39:29.364 --> 00:39:31.805
AND IT'S A RAGGEDY, RAGGEDY, 
TERRIBLE SHAPE.  

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.230
RECENTLY BEFORE I CAME HERE, THE
TEACHER 

00:39:36.284 --> 00:39:38.727
WHO TOLD ME THAT IT HAS HOLES ON
THE FLOOR AND THERE'S BEEN 

00:39:38.728 --> 00:39:43.806
INCIDENTS WHERE SNAKES CREEP UP 
THROUGH -- I MEAN, CAN YOU 

00:39:43.807 --> 00:39:45.644
IMAGINE A 5-YEAR-OLD, 
6-YEAR-OLD? THAT'S THE MOST 

00:39:45.645 --> 00:39:49.536
TRAUMATIC THING. THAT'S THE MOST
TRAUMATIC THING. SO HOW CAN YOU 

00:39:49.537 --> 00:39:52.177
-- THESE KIDS ARE NOT LOOKING 
FORWARD TO GOING TO SCHOOL.  YOU

00:39:52.178 --> 00:39:54.410
KNOW WHAT I MEAN? 
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO 

00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:58.920
GOING TO SCHOOL. THEY DON'T KNOW
THE FACT THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN 

00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:00.921
AFFORD FOOD, HOW CAN YOU LEARN 
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:06.019
SO THE WEIRD THING IS THAT SOUTH

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:09.489
AFRICA, OUR COUNTRY IN 
PARTICULAR, HAS 

00:40:10.967 --> 00:40:12.592
BOTH ASPECTS OF A DEVELOPING AND
A DEVELOPED COUNTRY, WE HAVE THE

00:40:12.593 --> 00:40:14.593
BEST AND THE WORST IN OUR 
COUNTRY.

00:40:16.045 --> 00:40:18.045
THE BEST AND THE WORST.

00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:21.554
YOU'LL SAY, OH, MY GOD, I'M BACK
IN THE STONE AGES. LOOKS LIKE 

00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:23.992
HELL. AND THEN THERE ARE PARTS 
WHERE YOU SAY, 

00:40:27.242 --> 00:40:28.264
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS, I MUST
BE IN MONACO!

00:40:28.265 --> 00:40:30.265
THIS IS AMAZING. THAT IS SOUTH 
AFRICA TODAY.

00:40:32.738 --> 00:40:34.974
SO IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW DO WE 
CLOSE THE GAP, YOU KNOW? THAT IS

00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:39.896
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THIS JULY, YOUR 

00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:41.897
GRANDFATHER WOULD HAVE TURNED 
100 YEARS OLD.

00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:48.300
AND ARE THERE PLANS FOR A 
CENTENNIAL? BECAUSE I REALLY 

00:40:48.301 --> 00:40:50.531
WANTED TO -- BEFORE WE OPEN IT 
UP FOR QUESTIONS, I WANTED TO --

00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:55.206
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: AWESOME PLANS. THE 
NELSON MANDELA FOUNDATION, THEY 

00:40:58.453 --> 00:41:00.688
HAVE THE ANNUAL LECTURE THAT'S 
BEEN GIVEN BY BARACK OBAMA AND 

00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:02.689
MICHELLE OBAMA 

00:41:04.148 --> 00:41:06.148
OF THIS YEAR, THAT WILL BE THE 
17th OF JULY. 

00:41:06.388 --> 00:41:08.388
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE GOING TO 
HAVE A GALA DINNER.

00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:13.077
IT HAD TO BE POSTPONED SO WE'VE 

00:41:15.785 --> 00:41:17.785
POSTPONED IT TO THE 1st OF 
DECEMBER, IT'S WORLD AIDS DAY.

00:41:19.649 --> 00:41:20.664
HIV-AIDS IS SOMETHING THAT'S 
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MY 

00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:22.665
LIFE.

00:41:24.323 --> 00:41:26.323
I LOST BOTH OF MY PARENTS TO 
HIV/AIDS.

00:41:27.374 --> 00:41:29.374
AND SINCE THEN, HAVE BECOME ONE 
OF THE 

00:41:30.834 --> 00:41:32.834
LONGEST SERVING AMBASSADORS OF 
U.N.-AIDS.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.337
HAVING TRAVELLED TO, YOU KNOW, 
BRAZIL, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, 

00:41:37.338 --> 00:41:39.972
TALKING ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC. 
RECENTLY, I WAS IN RUSSIA SPEAK 

00:41:39.973 --> 00:41:43.834
EGG AT THE EAST EUROPEAN AIDS 
CONFERENCE.  SO, YEAH.

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:52.135
I MEAN, WE ARE

00:41:56.477 --> 00:41:58.477
BY MANY WAYS THE AVERAGE

00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:05.458
FAMILIES.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.510
WE'RE AFFECTED BY SOMETHING THAT

00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:12.005
AFFECTS ALL OF SOUTH AFRICANS, 
WE HAVE MANDELA, THIS PATRIARCH,

00:42:12.006 --> 00:42:14.006
OUR LEADER, 

00:42:16.082 --> 00:42:17.713
WE'RE VERY MUCH THE SAME AS 
THOSE AVERAGE FAMILIES TODAY.  

00:42:21.607 --> 00:42:23.837
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOUR GRANDFATHER LEFT
A LEGACY FELT GLOBALLY. I KNOW 

00:42:23.838 --> 00:42:27.544
YOU CARRIED ON. WHAT ARE SOME OF
THE LIFE LESSONS YOU THINK HE 

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.410
TAUGHT YOU AND THAT WE CAN ALL 
LOOK FORWARD TO?  

00:42:33.864 --> 00:42:35.864
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THE ONE LESSON WE 
TAUGHT ME 

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:38.983
WAS, NDABA, YOU MUST ALWAYS BE 
HUMBLE, HUMILITY IS VERY 

00:42:38.984 --> 00:42:40.984
IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY FOR A 
LEADER.

00:42:44.085 --> 00:42:46.085
YOU HAVE TO BE -- YOU HAVE TO BE
ACCESSIBLE.

00:42:47.143 --> 00:42:50.415
AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE SERVING. 

00:42:50.416 --> 00:42:52.416
BECAUSE AS A LEADER, YOU ARE A 
SERVANT. 

00:42:53.264 --> 00:42:55.264
YOU'RE NOT THERE TO BOAST, TO 
SHOW HOW 

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:59.998
MUCH, WHAT A GREAT CAR YOU HAVE 
OR HOW MANY THINGS YOU HAVE. 

00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:02.661
THAT'S NOT A LEADER. 
LEADERS ARE NOT THERE TO SHOW 

00:43:02.662 --> 00:43:06.529
I'M NUMBER ONE, LOOK AT ME. I'M 
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:10.221
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE, 
WHO CAN'T STAND UP FOR 

00:43:10.222 --> 00:43:13.278
THEMSELVES, THAT'S THE PEOPLE 
I'M THERE TO SERVE. SO YOU HAVE 

00:43:13.279 --> 00:43:14.498
TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOUR 
CONSTITUENCY IS. YOU NEED TO 

00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:16.499
HAVE A CONSTITUENCY.

00:43:20.817 --> 00:43:22.849
YOU MUST BE HUMBLE AND HE SAID 
TO ME, NDABA, YOU MUST NEVER 

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.864
DRIVE A JAGUAR, BECAUSE THEN 
PEOPLE KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU 

00:43:23.865 --> 00:43:25.865
HAVE.

00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:29.321
AND THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, 
BUT, 

00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:33.027
GRAD DAD, YOU USED TO DRIVE A 
MERCEDES BENZ. OKAY, OKAY. BUT 

00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:36.689
I'LL TAKE IT ON THE CHIN. I'LL 
TAKE IT ON THE CHIN.  BUT, OF 

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.690
COURSE, I THINK HE WAS VERY 
SERIOUS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:44.261
YOU KNOW? DISCIPLINE IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. AND HE WAS ONE OF THE

00:43:44.262 --> 00:43:46.262
MOST DISCIPLINED PERSONS I'VE 
EVER MET.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.244
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY AS HE WAS 
GETTING OLDER, HE WOULD GET SICK

00:43:51.245 --> 00:43:53.245
FROM TIME TO TIME.

00:43:54.721 --> 00:43:56.721
AND THE DOCTOR WOULD SAY, YOU 
MUST EAT 

00:43:58.993 --> 00:44:00.622
MORE TOMATOES AND YOU'D TELMA MA
KOLI, EVERY MORNING, I WANT YOU 

00:44:00.623 --> 00:44:04.074
TO SLICE UP TWO TOMATOES. THIN A
COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, HE WOULD

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.965
SAY, NO, YOU MUST EAT LESS 
TOMATOES. AND THEN HE WOULD SAY,

00:44:09.966 --> 00:44:11.966
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO MORE 
TOMATOES. NOW I WANT APPLES.

00:44:15.897 --> 00:44:18.129
HE WOULD DO IT RELIGIOUSLY EVERY
DAY. YOU KNOW?

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.800
DISCIPLINE. INTEGRITY, VERY 
IMPORTANT.  IF YOU TELL YOUR 

00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:24.461
FRIEND, HEY, LET'S MEET AT THE 
LIBRARY AT 2:00, BE THERE AT 

00:44:25.068 --> 00:44:29.985
2:00.OFF KNOW? HE'D SAY, LISTEN,
I'M GOING TO SEND YOU THAT 

00:44:29.986 --> 00:44:33.260
E-MAIL LATER TONIGHT, SEND THAT 
E-MAIL LATER TONIGHT. THAT'S 

00:44:33.261 --> 00:44:35.699
INTEGRITY ON B A VERY BASIC 
LEVEL, YOU KNOW?  BUT IT'S VERY 

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.700
IMPORTANT. IT GOES A LONG WAY.

00:44:44.864 --> 00:44:46.898
BUT MANDIBA? WHAT CAN I SAY 
ABOUT MANDIBA?

00:44:53.007 --> 00:44:55.007
HE TAUGHT ME THAW LOVE IS 
STRONGER THAN HATE.

00:44:56.116 --> 00:45:00.607
BECAUSE LOVE COMES MUCH MORE 
NATURAL TO THE HUMAN CONDITION 

00:45:00.608 --> 00:45:04.709
THAN HATE. IF A PERSON CAN BE 
TAUGHT TO HATE, THEY CAN BE 

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.710
TAUGHT TO LOVE.

00:45:07.965 --> 00:45:09.993
THAT'S OUR THEME FOR CELEBRATING
MANDELA FOR 100 YEARS, LOVE AND 

00:45:09.994 --> 00:45:13.050
UNITY. BECAUSE THROUGH LOVE AND 
UNITY, THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE 

00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:15.051
CANNOT ACHIEVE.

TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

00:45:42.036 --> 00:45:44.681

HOPE.

00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:05.542
WHEN YOU 

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:08.790
WERE TRYING TO SNEAK OUT.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.719

EMERGING MEDIA STUDIES MAJOR AND

00:46:30.016 --> 00:46:33.068
A JOURNALISM MINOR. I'M FROM 
COLUMBIA, MARYLAND SO I GUESS 

00:46:33.679 --> 00:46:36.136
I'M COMMUTING. I'M A JUNIOR

YEAH, I'M AN INTERN HERE. SORRY.

00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:49.181
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS YOU SAY 
THAT YOU SEE THE BEST AND THE 

00:46:49.182 --> 00:46:51.182
WORST, SOCIOECONOMICALLY AND ON 
THE EDUCATIONAL 

00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:56.291
LEVEL OF THE PUBLIC IN AFRICA, 
HOW COULD THAT TRANSLATE TO 

00:46:56.292 --> 00:46:58.292
HELPING THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN 
AMERICA?

00:47:04.884 --> 00:47:07.117
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WELL, WHAT THAT SAYS
IS LIKE WHAT I SAID NOW, THROUGH

00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:09.118
LOVE AND UNITY, 

00:47:11.385 --> 00:47:14.250
YOU KNOW, MANDIBA SAID YOU CAN 
JUDGE THE SOCIETY THERE'S NO 

00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:16.078
KEENER REVELATION TO A SOCIETY'S
SOUL THAN IN THE WAY THEY TREAT 

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:18.079
THEIR CHILDREN, RIGHT?

00:47:23.418 --> 00:47:25.418
SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
DO AS 

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.680
MUCH AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOUNG 

00:47:32.584 --> 00:47:34.584
PEOPLE HAVE MENTORSHIP, GOOD 
MENTORS.

00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:38.890
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST 
SCHOOLS, BUT WE CAN TEACH ONE OF

00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:41.934
US SITTING IN THIS ROOM MENTOR A
YOUNG CHILD FOR ONE HOUR OR TWO 

00:47:41.935 --> 00:47:44.183

LONG WAY.

00:47:47.228 --> 00:47:48.452
IF YOU CAN SIT WITH THEM FOR ONE
HOUR A WEEK ON A SATURDAY, 

00:47:48.453 --> 00:47:50.453
RIGHT?

00:47:55.379 --> 00:47:56.604
AND GO THROUGH HIS HOMEWORK AND 
ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE 

00:47:56.605 --> 00:47:58.605
EXPERIENCED IN THAT WEEK AND 
WHAT HIS CHALLENGES ARE, 

00:48:01.683 --> 00:48:04.353
THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT IT 
WILL HAVE IF YOU DO THAT FOR 

00:48:04.354 --> 00:48:06.354
FIVE YEARS, RIGHT?

00:48:07.638 --> 00:48:09.058
WE CANNOT -- THESE DAYS, THE 
MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE ARE NO 

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:12.530
LONGER YOUR LAWYERS OR YOUR 
POLICEMEN, RIGHT? THE MOST 

00:48:12.531 --> 00:48:13.147
INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE TODAY ARE POP
STARS.  

00:48:13.148 --> 00:48:15.148
RIGHT?

00:48:17.841 --> 00:48:20.277
YOUR MUSICIANS, YOUR ACTORS, WHO
ARE NOT NECESSARILY COGNIZANT OF

00:48:20.278 --> 00:48:25.560
THE EFFECT THEY HAVE ON A YOUNG 
KID'S MIND, RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY 

00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:28.598
ENGAGE FROM TIME TO TIME IN 
NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR. AND SOME OF 

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:31.456
THEM WILL SAY, WELL, I DIDN'T 
WANT TO BE A MENTOR. I DIDN'T 

00:48:31.457 --> 00:48:35.524
CHOOSE TO BE A MENTOR. DOESN'T 
MATTER IF YOU CHOSE IT OR NOT. 

00:48:35.525 --> 00:48:37.963
YOU ARE A PERSON IN AN 
INFLUENTIAL PERSON, SO 

00:48:37.964 --> 00:48:39.964
ACKNOWLEDGE AND EMBRACE THAT 
POSITION THAT YOU'RE IN.  RIGHT?

00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:47.554
SO IF WE CAN TAKE TIME TO SPEND 
TIME WITH THE YOUNG PERSON AND 

00:48:47.555 --> 00:48:52.052
TAKE SOME OF THE LESSONS OF 
NELSON MANDELA, DON'T YOU THINK 

00:48:52.053 --> 00:48:52.663

CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
HUMANITY BASED ON SOME OF THE

YOU TALK ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION

ISSUE WHICH I SEE IS VERY BIG 
RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR

00:49:37.717 --> 00:49:39.717
TO OUR COUNTRY. WE WENT THROUGH 
A SIMILAR THING, BUT IN 

00:49:44.638 --> 00:49:47.107
OUR COUNTRY, WE ACTUALLY HAD 
ATTACKS, THE PHOBIA OF FEAR OF

THAT SOUTH AFRICANS 

00:50:00.178 --> 00:50:01.834
WERE PHYSICALLY ATTACKING 
ETHIOPIANS, ZIMBABWEANS,

MY NAME IS MONTY -- MY QUESTION 
RELATES TO ZIMBABWE.

00:53:34.151 --> 00:53:36.598
AND COMPARABLY SPEAKING, NELSON 
MANDELA 

00:53:41.519 --> 00:53:43.519
WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS,

00:53:45.613 --> 00:53:47.613
LIBERATORS, THAT WAS ABLE TO 
EVENTUALLY 

00:53:49.221 --> 00:53:51.539
HELP WITH THE DEMOCRATIZATION 
EFFORTS AS WE ARE 

00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:58.047
APPROACHING ELECTIONS IN 
ZIMBABWE, JULY -- THEY ANNOUNCED

00:53:58.048 --> 00:54:00.048
FOR JULY 30, TO BE 

00:54:02.934 --> 00:54:04.934
DOING ELECTIONS, MY QUESTION IS 
REGARD 

00:54:11.276 --> 00:54:13.276
ING THE 25% OF ZIMBABWEANS WHO 
CURRENTLY 

00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:19.205
DWELL IN THE BEING TOLD YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE 

00:54:19.206 --> 00:54:21.206
ELECTIONS UNLESS YOU COME BACK 
HOME TO VOTE.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.360
SO MY QUESTION IS, CAN YOU SHED 

00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:33.018
SOMESOME -- SOME SUGGESTIONS OR 
SOME 

00:54:35.098 --> 00:54:36.936
SUPPORT AND IF YOU COULD ALSO 
TOUCH ON PAN AFRICANISM ON THIS 

00:54:36.937 --> 00:54:39.177
ONE?  THANK YOU.  
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:54:47.095 --> 00:54:48.723
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY JUDGE 
ON THAT ISSUE. BECAUSE IT ALSO 

00:54:48.724 --> 00:54:50.756
DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES OF THE 
COUNTRY.  YOU KNOW?

00:54:54.029 --> 00:54:56.499
IT'S -- IF THE COUNTRY IS POOR 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE RESOURCES TO

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.500
ALLOW THE CITIZENS TO VOTE BY 
REMOTE CONTROL, HOW CAN I JUDGE?

00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:01.161
YOU KNOW?

00:55:06.082 --> 00:55:08.124
LIKELY, SOUTH AFRICA HAS NO 
RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE AT 

00:55:08.125 --> 00:55:10.565
THEIR EMBASSIES AROUND THE 
WORLD, BUT JUST BECAUSE SOUTH 

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:14.222
AFRICA CAN DO IT DOESN'T MEAN 
EVERY NATION SHOULD DO IT OR 

00:55:14.223 --> 00:55:17.079
EVERY NATION CAN DO IT. SO IT'S 
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO JUDGE 

00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:19.484
IN THAT SITUATION.

00:55:21.141 --> 00:55:23.141
YES, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S 
UNFORTUNATE, YOU KNOW.

00:55:24.203 --> 00:55:26.845
YOU WANT AS MUCH CITIZENS TO 
OBVIOUSLY BE INCLUDED IN THE 

00:55:26.846 --> 00:55:32.570
VOTING. BUT IT'S DIFFICULT.  YOU
KNOW? IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. YOU 

00:55:32.571 --> 00:55:34.809
CAN ONLY B HAVE THE RESOURCES TO
CARRY THE EMBASSIES AND GET 

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.283
THOSE VOTES BACK TO THE 
COUNTRIES. YOU KNOW? WHO CAN 

00:55:38.284 --> 00:55:42.347
JUDGE THEM FOR THAT? WE CAN'T 
REALLY JUDGE THEM. SO, IF THE 

00:55:42.348 --> 00:55:45.188
ONLY WAY TO TELL PEOPLE TO COME 
HOME AND VOTE, HOW CAN WE -- WE 

00:55:46.006 --> 00:55:48.006
CAN'T JUDGE THEM FOR THAT. 
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:54.337
BUT, AS FAR AS PAN AFRICANISM IS
CONCERNED, I BELIEVE THAT 

00:55:54.338 --> 00:55:57.008
LIBERATION OF SOUTH AFRICA COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT 

00:55:57.009 --> 00:56:00.256
THE SUPPORT OF OUR BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS ACROSS THE CONTINENTS AS

00:56:00.257 --> 00:56:02.257
YOU KNOW.

00:56:05.767 --> 00:56:07.767
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ZIMBABWE 
AND 

00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:12.506
SWATSLAND ALL THE WAY UP TO 
NIGERIA, ETHIOPIA, YOU NAME IT, 

00:56:12.507 --> 00:56:14.507
MALI, ETC.

00:56:18.629 --> 00:56:20.629
SO, FOR ME, WE NEED SOMEHOW, 
SOME WAY, 

00:56:21.835 --> 00:56:23.835
THROUGH THE

00:56:25.556 --> 00:56:27.556
INDEPENDENT JOURNEY AND THE POST

00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:32.916
COLONIAL AREA, WE LOST THAT PAN 
AFRICANISM THAT WE ONCE HAD. WE 

00:56:32.917 --> 00:56:35.962
LOST THE UNITY AND SOLIDARITY 
THAT WE ONCE HAD. IT NEEDS TO BE

00:56:35.963 --> 00:56:39.856
REUNITED. AND IN OUR CONTINENT, 
WE'RE TRADING MORE WITH THE WEST

00:56:39.857 --> 00:56:42.293
AND THE EAST THAN WE ARE TRADING
WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH HAS NEVER

00:56:42.294 --> 00:56:44.294
HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.750
WE NEED TO REIGNITE THAT BECAUSE
IF WE 

00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:54.701
DO NOT UNITE, AND REIGNITE THE 
SPIRIT OF SOLIDARITY AMONGST 

00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:56.702
AFRICANS ON THE 

00:56:58.155 --> 00:56:59.780
CONTINENT FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE
SHALL NEVER REALIZE OUR ROAD TO 

00:56:59.781 --> 00:57:04.254
INDEPENDENCE. WE SHALL NEVER 
REALIZE OUR DREAM TO CREATE A 

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.255
PROSPEROUS AND INDEPENDENT 
CONTINENT OF AFRICA.

00:57:13.006 --> 00:57:15.038
THAT IS REALLY THE KEY TO US 
ACHIEVING OUR GOALS AND MAKING 

00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:17.039
SURE OUR DREAMS COME TO 
FRUITION.

00:57:21.386 --> 00:57:23.386
SO, IN THE SPIRIT

00:57:27.162 --> 00:57:29.162
OF MEN WHO WERE TRUE 
VISIONARIES, AND 

00:57:31.038 --> 00:57:33.073

CURRENTLY A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR 
MANY CAUSES, HOW COULD -- DO YOU

00:58:10.172 --> 00:58:13.482
HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
LIKE MYSELF OR OTHERS WHO MIGHT 

00:58:13.483 --> 00:58:16.117
BE IN THE ROOM ON HOW WE CAN 
BETTER, YOU KNOW, BECOME A VOICE

00:58:17.758 --> 00:58:19.792
AND BECOME AN INFLUENCER OF 
CHANGE WITHIN OUR OWN 

00:58:19.793 --> 00:58:21.793
COMMUNITIES AND WHAT ARE SOME OF
THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN SEEK OUT 

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.840
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE BETTER
AT THAT IN?

00:58:27.317 --> 00:58:32.188
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE 
TO CHOOSE A CAUSE THAT YOU CARE 

00:58:32.189 --> 00:58:34.428
ABOUT, THAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE 
ABOUT. IT'S LIKE BUSINESS. WHERE

00:58:34.429 --> 00:58:36.429
YOU BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:58:37.892 --> 00:58:39.309
YOU CANNOT BE A SUCCESSFUL 
ENTREPRENEUR IF YOU'RE NOT 

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.310
PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT BUSINESS. 

00:58:44.845 --> 00:58:46.703
BECAUSE ALONG THE WAY, YOU WILL 
COME ACROSS HURDLES, PEOPLE WHO 

00:58:46.704 --> 00:58:48.738
DON'T BELIEVE YOU, AND PEOPLE 
WHO THINK YOU CAN'T DO IT.  

00:58:48.739 --> 00:58:50.739
RIGHT?

00:58:55.507 --> 00:58:56.116
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A  CAUSE 
THAT YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE 

00:58:56.117 --> 00:58:59.164
ABOUT. THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU DON'T GIVE UP. 

00:59:00.383 --> 00:59:03.841
BECAUSE PEOPLE GIVE UP SOMETIMES
TOO QUICKLY.  YOU KNOW? FOR 

00:59:03.842 --> 00:59:05.842
VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF REASONS.

00:59:08.532 --> 00:59:09.952
NOW, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU SURROUND YOURSELF BY PEOPLE 

00:59:09.953 --> 00:59:12.594
WHO CARE FOR YOU AND BELIEVE IN 
YOU. 

00:59:13.206 --> 00:59:17.276
YOU NEED TO HAVE A MENTOR.  
EVERYBODY NEEDS A MENTOR, NO 

00:59:17.277 --> 00:59:20.582
MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, NO 
MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE, 

00:59:20.583 --> 00:59:22.583
EVERYBODY NEEDS A MENTOR.

00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:28.522
AND, YOU NEED TO THEN UNDERSTAND
THE PEOPLE OF A CAUSE THAT 

00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:32.186
YOU'RE CHAMPIONING, WHAT THEIR 
CHALLENGES ARE. YOU CANNOT 

00:59:32.187 --> 00:59:34.212
CHAMPION A CAUSE IF YOU HAVE NOT
TALKED TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT 

00:59:34.213 --> 00:59:36.213
AFFECTS THE MOST.

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:42.152
OTHERWISE, YOU ARE JUST SHOOTING
IN THE HEAD, RIGHT? YOU NEED TO 

00:59:42.153 --> 00:59:44.153
UNDERSTAND THAT CONSTITUENCY 
THAT YOU'RE SERVING.

00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:52.122
AND MAKE SURE THE CONCERN 
YOURSELF WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE. 

00:59:52.123 --> 00:59:54.558
AND OFTEN THAT SUPPORTS AT HOME.
THAT SUPPORT STARTS WITHIN YOUR 

00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:57.813
OWN IMMEDIATE NETWORK. AND IF 
YOU CAN'T GET SUPPORT FROM YOUR 

00:59:59.643 --> 01:00:01.471
FAMILY MEMBERS AND YOUR FRIENDS 
AND YOUR OWN IMMEDIATE NETWORK, 

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.472
THEN, MY FRIEND, I THINK YOU 
NEED TO CHANGE YOUR COURSE.

01:00:05.539 --> 01:00:07.539
BECAUSE CLEARLY, THEY DON'T 
BELIEVE YOU. 

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.848
AND IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE YOU, 
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE 

01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:13.849
GOING TO GET YOUR SUPPORT.

01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:19.429
SO FIRST -- THE FIRST THING IS, 
DO I REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS 

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:22.271
THING AM I TRYING TO PUSH? AM I 
IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE THAT 

01:00:22.272 --> 01:00:27.190
I'M TRYING TO HELP, TRYING TO 
GIVE A VOICE, TRYING TO GET A 

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:29.219
LAW PASSED, OR AN ACTION -- YOU 
KNOW, DONE, OR WHATEVER THE CASE

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.627
MAY BE. YOU KNOW? YOU NEED TO BE
IMPRESSED WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.333
AND HAVE A MENTOR AND A SUPPORT 
BASE. BASICALLY.

01:00:40.397 --> 01:00:42.397
AND THAT IS REALLY THE FIRST 
STEPS OF 

01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:46.867
MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO
SERVE 

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.784
THE OBJECTIVE THAT YOU SET OUT 
FOR YOURSELF DON'T DO IT BECAUSE

01:00:51.785 --> 01:00:55.434
THE GIRL YOU LIKE SAID YOU 
SHOULD DO IT. OR YOU DO IT 

01:00:55.435 --> 01:00:58.900
BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS FORCE YOU 
TO DO IT. DO IT BECAUSE YOU 

01:00:58.901 --> 01:01:01.961
YOURSELF CARE AND ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THAT CAUSE.  

01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:03.962
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:01:12.124 --> 01:01:17.612
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WE ALL THANK YOU FOR 
SHARING THE LIFE LESSONS YOU 

01:01:17.613 --> 01:01:19.613
LEARNED FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER 
AND SHARING THEM WITH ALL OF US.

01:01:24.946 --> 01:01:26.946
AND I AM NEVER RECOMMEND A BOOK 
BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO.

01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:38.641
BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A 
CHANCE TO READ WHAT YOU HAVE 

01:01:38.642 --> 01:01:40.642
LEARNED AND READ THIS 

01:01:42.496 --> 01:01:43.725
BOOK, I THINK YOU WOULD BE IN 
TOUCH, NOT ONLY WITH YOUR 

01:01:43.726 --> 01:01:46.973
GRANDFATHER, BUT WITH YOU.  
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THANK YOU SO MUCH.  

01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:48.974
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THANK YOU.
