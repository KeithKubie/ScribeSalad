What’s the deal with airline food?

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.070
No seriously, what is the deal with airline
food.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.110
Hi there airborne gourmands, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.790
Airplane food is infamous.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.620
While it’s usually not causing pilots to
get food poisoning and leading to wacky hijinks,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.550
it’s been regarded for years as being just
kind of... meh.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.640
Surely the airlines would have done something
about that by now.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.350
They have, and don’t call me Shirley.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.630
Lufthansa commissioned a study in 2010 at
the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.649
and in it they created a room that was depressurized
to cabin pressure at cruising altitude.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.469
They dehumidified the air to less than 12%
relative humidity, which is less than most

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:39.469
deserts.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.910
And for good measure they made the seats vibrate
and simulated engine noise.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.200
No word on whether they had a flight attendant
who was polite but secretly hates you.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
Their findings showed that in these conditions,
people are less sensitive to sweet and salty

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.909
flavors, but their taste for bland, bitter,
or spicy remained mostly unchanged.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.640
The dry air also deals a whammy to your sense
of smell.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.920
You just don’t pick up odors as well, and
that’s a big part of what makes food taste

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
so good.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.380
Have you ever noticed nothing tastes as good
when you’re congested?

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.650
Then there’s the noise.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.900
Weirdly, a study found that people who eat
with loud background noise rated food as less

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.790
salty and sweet than others in a quiet environment.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.940
So it sounds like the solution is to salt
and spice food within an inch of it’s life.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.010
And that’s the game plan, except the food
has to be prepared on the ground, so the recipes

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.610
have to be tweaked somewhere where they can’t
really be tested.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.060
Then to compound the problem, the food is
blast chilled and reheated in the sky hours

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.020
later by convection ovens, which work by circulating
hot air over the packaging.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.610
That process would do the food no favors on
the ground.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.561
Airlines have gotten creative with tackling
the problem.

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.920
They’ve started cooking meals in a way that
takes the reheating into account to avoid

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920
overheating.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.060
They’re taste testing new recipes in flight
simulation chambers like Lufthansa’s.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.060
They’re making meals with more umami ingredients
to capitalize on the fact your taste for savory

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.060
is in tact.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.780
They’re using heavier cutlery because that
actually has an effect on how much you like

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.780
food.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.630
British airways even tried distributing nasal
sprays to improve people’s sense of smell,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.860
but it didn’t catch on.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.340
Now they offer an in-flight music channel
to complement the meals, like scottish music

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.670
when they serve scottish fish.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.720
I think that’s genius, because I can’t
taste anything over the sound of bagpipes.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.120
Even if the mass produced airline food hits
the spot for you in can still be unappealing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.379
to the guy next to you.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.170
Anthony explains why people taste things differently
over here.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.980
Do you have any travel hacks?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.349
Like after learning this I might bring my
own salt aboard if I can get it through security.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.650
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
