and that's really what the back button
 

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.870
and that's really what the back button
is for is to go back right so if it's if

okay actually bring up a good point
 

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.040
okay actually bring up a good point
let's test that out so not really sure

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.050
let's test that out so not really sure
 

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.310
let's test that out so not really sure
how to get back to the no I don't know

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320
how to get back to the no I don't know

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.770
know this is this is one of those
examples of things where we we kind of

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:26.780
examples of things where we we kind of
 

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.150
examples of things where we we kind of
ratchet up our standards as time goes on

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160
ratchet up our standards as time goes on
 

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.050

and said you know what we should really

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:54.900
and said you know what we should really
 

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.120
and said you know what we should really
go a little bit further I and and as I

00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.130
go a little bit further I and and as I
 

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.220
