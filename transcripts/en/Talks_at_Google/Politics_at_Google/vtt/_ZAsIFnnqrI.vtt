[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.430
SPEAKER: Thank you for coming.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.780
We have a really
important topic here today

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.450
for the Talks at Google.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.290
It's my pleasure to be
able to introduce and emcee

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.030
the next hour with Kyra Kyles.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.860
She's here to talk to us
about a very important topic.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.540
One of my colleagues
actually heard

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.690
her speak at a conference, and
we felt compelled to really

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.450
help broadcast the message--

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.470
"Diversify or Die,
Why News Media Need

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.540
to Reflect Their Audience."

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.930
What we'll do is
we'll hear from Kyra,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.340
go through the presentation.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.510
We'll have a discussion.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.000
I'll ask a few questions.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.270
We have some open
mics for a lively Q&amp;A.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.890
To tell you a little
bit about Kyra,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.480
she is the co-founder of
Myth Lab Entertainment.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.820
She founded this
company with her sister.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.420
It's a multicultural
agency, multi-platform.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.880
She's also the former
editor-in-chief

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.590
of "Ebony" magazine.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.030
So without further ado,
please welcome Kyra Kyles.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.954
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:18.310
KYRA KYLES: Good
morning, everyone.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.720
How are you?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.345
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.160
KYRA KYLES: Good.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.730
Wonderful.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.596
So thank you so much for
the warm introduction.

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.970
And it's really
great to be here.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.760
I really appreciate
people coming out

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.630
to talk about a topic that
is extremely important to me.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.480
As Natalie mentioned, I've
been in the journalism industry

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.170
for about 20 years.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.810
And it's interesting
that the industry

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.820
has changed in so
many ways, especially

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.850
as it pertains to technology
and the advertising models.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.360
But there is one area where I
feel that it's woefully behind,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630
and that's why I'm here
with the daunting title,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.590
to "Diversify or Die,"
because sometimes you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.080
have to scare people in order
to make them make change.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.590
So we're going to go with
the "Minority Report" now.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.350
So just to give you a little
bit more detail about me.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.450
I did work at "Ebony"
magazine, where

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700
I was the editor-in-chief
and also the senior vice

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.710
president of digital editorial.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.800
And honestly, that is the
first black-owned company

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.000
that I worked for.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.500
And "Ebony" is an
interesting story,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
because this is a
70-plus-year-old company.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.050
And the reason it was
started is because, even

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.410
back then, of course, there
was a dearth of positive news,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.690
or affirming news, or
even just factual news

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.340
about African-Americans.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.995
And it's sad to me in a way that
something like that is needed.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.620
I mean, we obviously
love it, and we're

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.470
excited about that and other
black-owned and black-run media

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.190
entities.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.630
But the fact is, this
problem predates most of us.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.340
And it still continues.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.230
I also have had the
benefit of working

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.700
with a lot of
mainstream outlets.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.160
And that's what gives me some
perspective in terms of I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.270
came from "Tribune."

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.800
I worked with "The Sun-Times."

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.540
I've worked with vibe.com.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.010
Worked with a number of dailies.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.240
And even in college, it
was already obvious to me

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.210
that there was a
majority of white males,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.290
to be honest, at these places.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.590
And because of that, there
was a certain perspective.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.650
None of this, I
think, is malicious.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.816
I don't think it's
done to X anyone out.

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:08.190
But there are just certain
factors that are affecting us.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.320
And I think we have to
be cognizant about it,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.690
not only as participants,
like someone like me,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.287
but our audience, someone like
you, and that you're empowered

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:17.370
here at Google to be able
to do something about it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.660
because you're such a huge
factor with the media industry.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.030
So I'll tell you a
little personal story

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.030
about how I figured out,
really, that I could never,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.060
never, never leave the
journalism industry because--

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.500
I don't know.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.690
There are so few of
us, we feel compelled

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.060
to remain within it, even
though it can be very brutal

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.830
and punishing at times.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.300
We're losing ad revenue.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.250
We're losing people many times.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.320
But this is one of
the reasons why.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.000
So Hurricane Katrina, I was
in the newsroom at the time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.270
And I was one of a handful of
African-American journalists

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.230
where I worked.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.540
Most of the black people,
to be quite frank,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.640
that worked there were
in the secretarial pool,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.409
administrative, security.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.200
There were not very
many black journalists.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.052
So one day I was called down
to the big boardroom, you know.

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:05.760
And I was kind of
intimidated because I'm

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980
thinking, typically,
the big editors

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.290
don't call down, like,
an editor or a reporter.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.760
At the time, I was a columnist.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.810
What on earth did I do?

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.570
So I'm thinking, did I write
something wrong in a story?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.175
Is there a bunch of people
with pitchforks waiting for me

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:18.675
outside?

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.570
Like, what happened that they're
calling me into this room?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.710
And what happened is it was
Hurricane Katrina had hit.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.850
Everybody was scrambling
to do coverage.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.260
And so these editors called
me down to this big boardroom

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.680
with all these books
and leather-bound books

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.280
and couches.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.990
And what they
wanted to ask me is

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.840
if I thought it was
OK if they referred

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.820
to those affected by
Hurricane Katrina as refugees.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.400
So I was like, OK, hmm.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.990
First of all, let me tell you
that I cannot exonerate you,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.410
no matter what you do.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.252
I like to think of
myself as very regal,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.710
but I'm not the
queen of blackness.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.930
There's nothing-- you know,
no wand I can wave and say,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.350
this is what you should do,
and you won't get in trouble.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.720
But I will answer your
question with a question.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.770
If something happened in Iowa,
or Idaho, or here in Chicago,

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.280
would you refer to the
people affected as refugees?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.140
And they immediately said no.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.306
So I'm glad they asked.

00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm not grateful
that they asked.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.699
They should ask.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.740
But I'm glad that they
asked and that I was there

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.531
to talk to them about
this because it could

00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:23.130
have been a very big misstep.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.440
But I think that's what
brings us here today is

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.140
that because there were
so few people there,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.505
up in those higher
echelons, they honestly

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:32.630
were going to go with that
had I not said anything.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.959
And it did occur to them
to ask, which is important.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.750
But the fact is, that
they couldn't come up

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.180
with a consensus without
asking me is another issue.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.210
So you might
recognize this frame.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.165
So media is definitely failing
its multicultural audiences.

00:05:45.165 --> 00:05:47.290
And this is "Dear White
People," which, by the way,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.840
is very good on Netflix, if
you haven't seen the show.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.830
And I don't think
that this is a point

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.990
that we can go over too much.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.420
I think people believe
sometimes that there's just

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.910
like this small, dissenting
minority of people

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.280
who want to see all
this positive news

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.430
about multicultural groups.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.170
And I really don't
think that's true.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.610
I think people just want to see
factual, accurate reporting.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.770
They want to see nuance.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.270
They want to see stories
that are not just crime,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.670
or stories that are not
just about race or politics.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.380
They want to see
stories that reflect

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.010
the American population.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.970
So when I say that to
people, sometimes they think,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.770
well, you know, there's
been some progress.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.228
But the fact of
the matter is there

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:27.180
hasn't been enough
progress, considering

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.640
the American population,
which I'll go into.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.950
So what I've done with
the presentation is

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.450
I have put some
factoids in here,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.720
because I think when you're
telling personal stories,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.670
people kind of get it.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.640
But I think if you see numbers,
then people totally get it.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.320
So this one is "don't sleep,"
and for obvious reasons.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.280
I think we take a lot
of things for granted,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.150
especially in America,
regarding our population.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.390
But in just five
years, about 50.2%

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.030
of children born in the United
States will be minorities.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.420
So the whole definition
of minority is changing.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.545
In 2020, white children
will be the minority

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.420
in the United States.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.400
And this is according
to the census.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.740
And then in 2060-- now,
this is really jarring--

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.330
62% of the population
that identifies as white

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.560
will drop all the way
down to about 44%.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.640
So when you see these
newsrooms-- and things

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.030
are changing in certain areas.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.488
But when you go to a lot of
traditional newsrooms, what you

00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:24.450
will see is white older males.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.680
And that does not at all
reflect the population.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.254
So there are issues
and things that

00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:29.920
are lost in translation
because of that.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.260
And I know this
as well as anyone.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.990
You would love to believe
that maybe media coverage will

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.732
change because people
are just awesome.

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:39.690
And people are awesome.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.910
But it's not just
altruism that's

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.870
going to get us
to this next area.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.750
So I think it's
important for people

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.970
to realize what the
potential of this market is.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.240
And so I'll just go over
a couple of the stats

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.990
that I have here.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.000
But for example,
magazines, I came

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.200
from the magazine industry.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.330
We all know that print
magazines are not

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.490
doing very well just
because the advertising

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.840
model has shifted so much.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.940
But of the mainstream
population,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.350
which 55% are reading magazines,
minority populations read 65%.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.080
So there's an over-index there.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.152
In terms of radio, everybody
talks about the death of radio

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:14.610
when you've got
podcasts, we've got

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.151
all of these
technologies coming out.

00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.420
However, minority
communities are

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.060
listening to 20
hours of radio a week

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.500
compared to 10 hours for just
the mainstream population.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.180
In terms of apps,
watching videos,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.010
which is another really
important area also

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.385
for advertising-- people are
always slipping those little

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:32.100
videos in there--

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.570
56 hours a month, that's
what black citizens alone

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.890
are watching on their apps.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.897
They're 81% more
likely to show support

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:43.230
for a brand, which is super
important, because we always

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.391
talk about brand
influencers and people

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:46.890
that can tout your
brand, especially

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.330
in a crowded marketplace.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.940
And this is extremely
important to note.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.850
76% will share their opinions
on some of the social media

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.350
outlets.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.141
So I think that's
important to think about,

00:08:57.141 --> 00:08:59.970
because when things
don't go right,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.540
it can be an ugly situation.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.020
I'm sure we've all heard
the term Black Twitter,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.060
and we've all heard
about dragging.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.380
And it is a real thing.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.560
I've only been kind of dragged
once, like just a light tug.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.390
But I can promise you that I
don't want any more of that.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.070
So I definitely advise
against being dragged.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.440
Another reason that
African-American audience

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.645
is important is
that it's becoming

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:24.690
a more educated community.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.740
Household income is increasing.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.490
I think because we see so many
of these stories and headlines

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.860
that talk about what isn't
going right-- you know,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.730
the crime rates or issues
with Black Lives Matter,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.332
because of that, there is
almost like a blind spot

00:09:39.332 --> 00:09:41.790
with the mainstream media when
it comes to this population.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.206
And that is why I
believe there is

00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:49.300
so much story ideation around
these negative developments.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.860
And I do miss President Obama.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.131
Sorry, I had to say that.

00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:52.630
I know.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.630
Everyone's going aw.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.620
So 75%-- I think
this is horrible.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.980
75% of African-Americans
distrust the media

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.970
that they read.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.030
So if you think about it--
and that's insulting to me,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.550
actually, as somebody who
went to school for this,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.990
worked hard on fact checking.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.731
For me to be writing something
when I was maybe in more

00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:12.730
of a mainstream outlet--

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.188
I don't think I
experienced this as

00:10:14.188 --> 00:10:16.210
much when I was at a
black-owned publication.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.930
For somebody to be giving me
the side eye to the rate of 75%,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.100
that is extremely high.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.470
And I think that
demonstrates that this is not

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.090
a problem that is just among
a small group of people.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.130
This is widespread.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.450
And I'll tell you why.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.830
And I have some examples.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.740
The funny thing is, whenever
I talk about this topic,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.100
it takes me two seconds
to find a new example.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.370
I wish I could bring
you an example from 2016

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.010
and say, oh, this is
back in the bad old days.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.580
No.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.530
I have a very fresh
example for you.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.970
So I won't go
through all of these

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.010
because I really do
want to get to talking

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.810
to everybody about
this issue and what

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.890
your thoughts are on it.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.931
But I'll just highlight
a few, the ones that make

00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:56.550
me the most physically ill.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.070
We'll start with
Miss Kardashian.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.686
No shade to the Kardashian clan.

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:00.810
They are doing their thing.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.220
However, Kim Kardashian by
no means invented cornrows.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.350
The fact that a
magazine would put out

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.350
a story saying that she
created this trend called

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.170
boxer braids, which basically is
the way my mother used to braid

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.660
my hair when I would swim when
I was like seven years old,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.890
I was like, this is a slap.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.360
I mean, did you do any research?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.934
Did you ask anyone?

00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:21.100
Have you ever been anywhere?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.160
Because that, to
me, was so galling.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.680
And I think it really
offends individuals.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.570
I have in the
audience here today

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.279
Wendy Wilson, who's one of
my colleagues from "Ebony."

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.320
And we talked about that.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.400
In the fashion
industry in particular,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.770
it seems like there is just this
blindness towards black women.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.450
And this is an example of it.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.210
Here's another one that made
me irate, when "The New York

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.210
Times" referred to Viola Davis
as not classically beautiful.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:45.990
According to who?

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.698
Did they not see her
at the Golden Globes

00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:49.860
when she was serving
with her yellow dress?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.260
I mean, just the
nerve of someone

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.760
to come up with
something like that.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.830
And when you say
"classically beautiful,"

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.817
you understand what
the implication is.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.650
What does that mean?

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.870
That she's not blonde,
that she's not--

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.834
what are you saying when
you talk about that?

00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:05.250
No, she does not necessarily
look like Scarlett Johansson.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.470
But is there not
room in the spectrum

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.530
for her to be considered
beautiful as well?

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.070
The Mike Brown
situation in Ferguson,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.470
when the news outlets-- and
again, I don't think this

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.230
was purposeful.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.750
I think it was because they
were racing against the clock.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.291
You're trying to
get new information.

00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:23.640
But a lot of the
stories show the image

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.090
on the left, if you can see it,
where he's putting up his hand.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.150
And I don't necessarily think it
is a gang symbol or something,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.820
but there is somewhat
of an implication there.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.554
And then on the right, you
see him just living his life.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.470
Or you could have used
the graduation picture.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.850
You could have used
something else.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.770
The bottom line is that
a lot of media outlets

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.500
hit back and said, hey, we
were under a time crunch.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.924
This is the picture that we had.

00:12:44.924 --> 00:12:45.840
We had to run with it.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.580
However, I think it's obvious
that, in many cases, when there

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.064
is a story about a white teen,
even in a similar situation,

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:54.480
they will get a graduation
picture, a picture with family,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.900
something that doesn't have any
sort of a negative connotation.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.070
And people notice that.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.750
And it actually started
a trending topic

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.690
on the aforementioned Black
Twitter of what photo will

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.890
they use when I die.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.690
Because any one of us
has taken a picture

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.820
that we might not necessarily
want to see again.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.460
And to use that as the
photo, it does definitely

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.930
sway public opinion.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.720
And I can admit to you, the
outlet that I was working with,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.100
we were in the same position.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.900
We did use that photo because
honestly, when I looked at it,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.050
I didn't see it as being
in any way nefarious.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.590
But once the public said hey,
guys, this picture is bad,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.620
please take this down or
find something else, we did.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.900
The issue was when
people say something

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.280
or when the public speaks
out and then no one responds.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.140
And then this is my fave.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:37.650
Oh, boy.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.180
So we recently had the
revelation that how

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.770
to show natural
hairstyles, though I

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.186
don't know if you can see the
picture on the bottom right.

00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:47.850
They had a story
about how to rock

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.530
natural hairstyles in PopSugar.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.030
And every single woman
in this story was white.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.640
Now, I understand that
all hair is natural

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.810
when it comes down to it.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.310
Unless you're growing some kind
of acrylic out of your head,

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.290
everything is natural.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.566
But black women have
clearly taken this term

00:14:04.566 --> 00:14:05.940
and were using it
for the purpose

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.420
that we have not traditionally
been able to wear our hair

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.036
as it grows out of our heads
in a traditional workplace.

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:13.410
I mean, there's
still legislation

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.620
that allows you to fire
someone if they have locks.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.450
So we're not at a place where
we can all lives matter hair.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.820
So when this
publication did this,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.410
the retribution was swift.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.110
But my question was, why
did you ever do this?

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.230
If you had just had
somebody around, somebody

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.550
diverse in your circle, this
never would have happened.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.640
Some of these things
are totally avoidable.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.630
And that's the issue.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.860
And the last one
I'll point out--

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.776
and this is because,
again, I don't think this

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:41.970
is malicious, but
extremely hurtful

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.160
that "Cosmo" did
a lineup of trends

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.090
that were dead, like RIP,
goodbye, you ugly trend.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.590
And then they had
"Hello, gorgeous,"

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.680
and they were ushering in
the new beautiful trends.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.890
And about 90% of the
goodbye, ugly trend

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.710
were black women and
models, Joan Smalls.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.280
Like, it was terrible.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.730
But I don't think-- again,
it was not done deliberately.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.010
But-- and they
apologized for it.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.820
But the fact is, no one looked
at this lineup and thought,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.990
this could be a problem?

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.480
That is the problem.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.925
So again, sad that
the examples continue.

00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:16.050
So what are we looking for?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.850
Naomi's clapping it up for us.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.550
We are looking for
fair representation.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.659
No one is looking
to be treated better

00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:24.450
than anyone, just like
you don't want to be

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.980
treated worse than anyone.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.910
What we're looking for is even
simple issues-- stock art.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.320
And I had this happen.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.550
I will not name the agency.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.560
But one day, just
out of curiosity,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.220
I decided to do a search in
this popular stock art agency's

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.760
collection.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.890
And I put in the word "ghetto."

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.580
If I didn't get back every
black person known to man

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.982
that was in their catalog--

00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:47.940
I could not believe it.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.150
I mean, and this
happened in 2016.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.870
Most of the images are
of people of non-color.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:00.280
It's very hard to find any sort
of minority in the stock art.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.630
And it's being remedied
within the community.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.700
I know several women, for
example, who started agencies

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.350
where they take
pictures, and they

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.270
make it available
to the media's use

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.660
so that there are these
different images out there.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.090
But the sad fact is that
in these major agencies,

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.490
there's only a very tiny,
microscopic selection

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.600
you have to choose from.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.016
And that's why if
you look, you'll

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:21.856
notice that you see
the same feature

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:22.980
images in a lot of stories.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.438
And that is why,
because there just

00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:27.030
are not a lot of images of
people of color, period,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.190
not just African-Americans.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.117
I think asking people to be
part of stories that are not

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.200
about race, that are not
about class, that are not

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.230
about politics, asking people
questions about riding bikes.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.810
You know, I ride bikes,
somewhat, not very well,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.190
but I do.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.530
I would like to be
interviewed for stories

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.050
that don't necessarily
base upon the way

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.550
that I look as a person.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.607
Like, we're all humans.

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:49.440
We're all Americans.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.970
And we're all global citizens.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.910
Why shouldn't we be
included in other stories?

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.070
Being authentic in it, showing
people just because it's cool--

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.840
for example, I think sometimes
people fixate on a certain pop

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.069
culture citizen.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.770
Like this is an unpopular
topic right now,

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.230
but a Blac Chyna, for example,
or something like that.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.896
And the people just
discovered who this.

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:12.900
It's like, come on, now.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.400
You know?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.224
And they go all in.

00:17:14.224 --> 00:17:16.349
And they give them covers,
and they give them this.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.500
And it just rings false because
it's obvious that you're not

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.670
interested in anyone else.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.920
You're just interested
in specific black people

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.569
that are undeniably
popular at the moment.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.480
And otherwise, this
wouldn't be something

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.890
that you would
work very hard at.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.630
So that can be a huge problem.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.750
I think even what I learned
when I was in school,

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:37.480
that the professors always
told us, interviewing a lawyer

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.600
or interviewing a
professor, make an effort,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.050
especially if it's not a
story based around race,

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.880
to talk to people of different
areas of the spectrum

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.259
because you want to
mirror the populace.

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:49.800
And I think that, unfortunately,
because people are in a rush

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.830
and they have these circles
of people that they talk to,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.540
they just want to
continue in that vein.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.220
But I think we just really have
to ask ourselves to expand.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.721
And there are publications that
are doing a much better job.

00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:02.594
Because I don't like to
keep it all negative,

00:18:02.594 --> 00:18:04.640
I want to talk about some
good success stories.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.370
"Washington Post" has been
doing an incredible job.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.290
"Huffington Post, Black
Voices" does a great job

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.330
with a small staff.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.217
They're able to cover
a lot of issues.

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.300
They have a lot of op-eds.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.480
But they also do really good
investigative reporting.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.030
They stress the importance of
covering the black community

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.980
across the diaspora.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.780
"Buzzfeed" is doing
a really good job.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.240
And what I really want
to commend them for

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.800
is transparency.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.770
What I have run into as
a member of the National

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.110
Association of
Black Journalists is

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:38.130
that news outlets don't want to
tell you who they have there.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.760
Like, we're a group of
people that are always

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.710
asking questions, but
this is a question

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.190
that we don't want to answer.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.760
So you don't know what
the proportions are.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.620
Even when they do
surveys, there's

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.120
a low return of organizations
that will provide background.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.370
So "Buzzfeed" did that.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.120
They talk about how
many people they have.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.310
They talk about black.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.610
They talk about Asian.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.510
They talk about women.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.330
They let people know
what they're doing.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.130
And yes, you open
yourself up to criticism.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.020
Someone could look at that and
say, well, that's not enough.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.900
But the bottom line is, I think
that if you open yourself up

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.534
to that criticism, it shows
that you are willing to fix it.

00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:12.950
When you hide it,
it makes it seem

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.290
like you want to keep
things in the status quo.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.890
And I think another important
question for us to ask--

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.260
I know that, as I said,
Google is extremely important.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.140
But even just as individuals,
we can do things.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.035
Something that I
just did recently--

00:19:26.035 --> 00:19:27.410
and I'm just using
my own example

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.120
because I don't want to
put anyone else out there

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.500
on Front Street necessarily.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.540
But a friend of a friend of
mine went into a 7-Eleven

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.710
in Chicago.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.940
She was a mother.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.090
She sent her two boys that
were teenagers, like, very

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.420
young boys, into the store to
pick up food for their lunch.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.240
And within minutes, they were
back outside with nothing.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.634
And she asked them
what happened.

00:19:48.634 --> 00:19:50.550
And the little boys,
they just said, you know,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.200
it's no problem.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.366
He just didn't want us in
there because we're black.

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:53.880
It's OK.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.610
And she was like, wait a minute.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.300
What?

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.350
That is not OK.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.910
She took them back in the store.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.900
She asked the clerk what he did.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.880
And I think he told on himself
because when asked about it,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.950
he said something to her
to the effect of well,

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:07.760
I'm an American.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.620
Like what-- is this
an immigration office?

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.287
It's a 7-Eleven.

00:20:10.287 --> 00:20:11.161
You know what I mean?

00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:12.650
Like, what does
living in America

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.730
have to do with anything.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.190
But that little video of
her encountering this man

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.650
and really confronting him
about what he did to her sons,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.460
I posted it.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.440
I encouraged a lot of
other people to post it.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.100
News outlets got into it.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.970
And from what I understand, he
was removed from that store.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.950
So there are things
that we as individuals

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.230
can do with the
power of smartphones,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.450
with the power of social media.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.290
If we see things
that we don't like,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.284
there's something that
we can do in response.

00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:38.450
Back in the day, there was
the letter to the editor.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.290
That could take
months to surface.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.790
And the reaction would be
equally slow, very glacial.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.191
But now, I think there's
an immediate reaction.

00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:47.690
Now, you don't want
to jump the gun.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.749
Everything is not
a racial situation.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.290
But I think it is
extremely important

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.020
that we take our voices
and that we channel those

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.430
into positive change.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.500
Because the bottom line
is that, as I said,

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.360
the demographic is changing.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.530
The country is changing.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.820
The globe is changing.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.500
And the last thing
we want to do is

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.250
have the media that's supposed
to be a catalyst for revolution

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.680
be the one that's putting
down the revolution.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.094
So that's pretty much everything
that I wanted to say to you.

00:21:13.094 --> 00:21:14.510
And I'd love to
hear what you have

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.718
to say to me about the topic.

00:21:15.718 --> 00:21:18.410
I know it can be hot
button, and sometimes people

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.792
can be a little fearful
about bringing up the issues,

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:23.750
but I think that's the
only way that we'll ever

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.710
come to a solution.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.605
So thank you so much
for your attention.

00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:27.230
I appreciate it

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.420
SPEAKER: Thank
you so much, Kyra.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.840
You have a powerful voice
and such a strong message.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.340
And it is a tough topic.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.430
But with staggering
statistics like this,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.527
we have to bring change.

00:21:46.527 --> 00:21:47.610
And it doesn't come quick.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.750
It doesn't come easy.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.050
It's been a long time coming.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.020
But by having this
conversation here today

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.980
and the impact that you've had
in the industry, it's a start.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.170
And there are ways that
we can also take action.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.994
KYRA KYLES: Yes.

00:22:01.994 --> 00:22:04.410
SPEAKER: I'd like to just start
learning a little bit more

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.220
about you.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.094
KYRA KYLES: Sure.

00:22:06.094 --> 00:22:08.010
SPEAKER: Just how did
you get in the industry?

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:12.150
You had an accelerated master's
program at Northwestern.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.250
You dove right into journalism.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.605
What sparked that interest?

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:16.980
KYRA KYLES: You
know, I've always

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.460
been interested in writing,
ever since I was a little kid.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.140
I often tell the
story that my mom

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.912
used to occupy my time when
I was a child by putting me

00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:26.370
in front of a
dressing room mirror.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.830
And I would sit there and
do these little broadcasts

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.660
so she could shop,
shop, shop, and I

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.900
would be doing the weather
and talking about the news.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.270
I even had a "Barbie"
magazine with my sister

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.950
that we forced my
poor father to read.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.810
He'd come home from
work exhausted and have

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.270
this terrible magazine printed
out and ready for him to read.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.534
So it's funny because,
oftentimes, people

00:22:45.534 --> 00:22:47.700
say they want to be something
when they were little,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.116
and then that
doesn't materialize.

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:51.840
So in my case, that is
exactly what happened.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.010
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.730
And you veered into
the print media.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.930
You're heavily involved
in multi-platform,

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.020
and you've kind of dabbled
in each form, if you will.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.260
On this topic of diversity
and the topic of media,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.050
are there some subverticals
that are doing it better

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.100
than others, whether
it's broadcast,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.540
primetime, newspapers, digital?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.490
KYRA KYLES: I would
say, just by design--

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.110
because digital typically,
it's a younger workforce.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.390
It's more malleable.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.330
There aren't these entrenched
employees and entrenched ways

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.390
of doing things-- digital
seems to be leading the way.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.000
For example, I believe
it's about double

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.780
the number of women working for
some of these online outlets

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.090
compared to your
traditional dailies.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.460
So they are far and
beyond leading the way.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.100
And I think they've
actually worked collectively

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.470
to bring up the statistics
of the number of minorities

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:50.040
in media when added with
these traditional outlets.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.160
TV, I believe, is among the
slowest, if I'm not mistaken.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.850
And that's probably because
it's a visual medium.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.070
We still have situations--

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.910
I don't know if most of you saw
the story about the woman who

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.400
does the weather who she
got all these nasty viewer

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.740
notes because she was wearing
her natural hair on air.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.970
And I mean, the
things that people

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.344
said, you would
have thought we'd

00:24:10.344 --> 00:24:14.100
climbed into a time machine and
gone back, the 1950s or '60s.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.260
Because it's a visual
medium, it may be harder

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.186
to adjust and to
embrace those trends.

00:24:18.186 --> 00:24:19.560
And viewers are
older, so they're

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.220
used to seeing certain things.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.130
So if they wake up
and they see someone

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.260
that doesn't look like
what they're used to,

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.280
they'll turn it off.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.160
And because it's such
a delicate situation--

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.960
they need that
advertising model--

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.050
they still continue to follow
the audience in that way.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.770
So I think unless you had a
lot of young people tuning

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.410
in and voicing
concerns about what

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.360
they're seeing,
that one is one that

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.340
will continue to be stagnant.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.600
And also, behind the scenes
is extremely important.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.850
A lot of people see
people on the front lines.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.600
They don't see the directors,
the producers, the writers

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.710
behind the scenes on TV.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.900
That is also not very diverse.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.450
And in newspapers, you can
kind of tell a little bit more.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.677
But again, you don't necessarily
know the background of people

00:25:00.677 --> 00:25:01.510
that you're reading.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.210
But just statistically
speaking, as I understand it,

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.500
it's about 17% of the
total news workforce,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.440
of those who responded,
are minorities

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.850
at this moment, people of color.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.350
SPEAKER: So with
such low numbers,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.270
how can we bring change?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.340
Does it count just being--

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.590
I'll share a little bit
about the Google practices.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.440
Because it's not just
at the hiring stage,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.000
it's also in the inclusion.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.620
Diversity and
inclusion is something

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.920
that's one of our pillars
and values at this company.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.750
Work to be done.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.710
And that's because
also in working

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.420
on the pipeline of applicants.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.730
So there's another pillar that's
really critical to Google,

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.830
which is in education,
inspiring the next generation

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.050
and thinking about
computer science.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.760
And the last pillar
is our community.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.440
How do we make sure
that we bring access

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.530
to everyone, training SMB,
small- and medium-sized

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.210
businesses, or others so that
they have the tools to grow.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.120
How do we start bringing
more diverse voices

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.070
into the world of journalism?

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.110
Is it in the schools?

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.450
How would you think
about that approach?

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.950
KYRA KYLES: Yeah,
I definitely think

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.160
education is a critical
piece because you

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.190
do need that training in order
to go into journalism, though

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.310
nowadays, some of these sites,
you might question that.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.890
But I think one
really important thing

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.820
is that it's still
kind of a privilege

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.230
to work in journalism.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.240
People expect you
to work for free.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.270
Some people can't afford to
do that, especially somebody,

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.300
a person of color, maybe
somebody who hasn't inherited

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.140
familial wealth.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.480
They can't afford to
do a free internship.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.210
I've had situations when I
was working with "Ebony" where

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.880
someone was working in
retail and also coming in,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.920
but they didn't have
enough hours to really make

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.270
a significant difference.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.320
I think that paying interns
a decent amount would help,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.750
because that would give them
impetus to join the field

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.370
and to be trained the right way.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.190
And also to then get advocates
from within the industry that

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.250
can reach back and say, hey, I
had this really great intern.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.250
Here's a role that
this person could fill.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.960
People always hire from
within their circle.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.940
I think that's
across the industry.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.090
And if you don't know
people, you cannot hire them.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.756
If you've never met
them because they've

00:27:10.756 --> 00:27:12.450
had to work a regular
job because they

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.899
can't afford to work for free--

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:17.190
it's a moot point to talk
about diversity if you're not

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.981
doing those things.

00:27:17.981 --> 00:27:19.650
And that goes across the board.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.780
Even in Hollywood,
people can't afford

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.122
to work for free for agents
and that kind of thing.

00:27:24.122 --> 00:27:26.580
And that's the reason why you
see some of the white-washing

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.320
that people talk
about in the movies.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.160
I think also it's the audience.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.992
I think the audience
has to demand better.

00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:33.950
I think they have to call
people on the carpet.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.870
I recently saw a horrible
industry article.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.540
It was a review of the
movie, "Girls Trip."

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.460
I don't know what happened here.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.910
It was just really
pointed and really biased.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.940
And instead of evaluating it
like you would "Bridesmaids,"

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.890
this author decided to
compare this movie that

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.030
has nothing to do with anything
to Tyler Perry's movies.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.002
And I think it was because that
was his frame of reference.

00:27:57.002 --> 00:27:58.710
And that would be like
comparing the Coen

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.900
Brothers to Seth MacFarlane.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.050
It doesn't make sense.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.350
So I think it is about exposure.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.870
It's about audience
driving change.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.432
And it is about supporting
journalists of color.

00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:12.390
When you see them and
they're doing great work,

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.598
support them on social media.

00:28:13.598 --> 00:28:14.790
Follow them.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.620
Get more familiar
with their work

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.180
so that they can be touted.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.800
We've had several
journalists who have

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.049
gotten that kind of treatment.

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:22.860
And it really helps.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.060
And I think we just have
to continue in that vein.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.420
It's not one bullet solution.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.250
It's like a comprehensive
change that we're

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.750
going to have to see.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.230
SPEAKER: Beautiful.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.970
The need to have stronger
and more inclusive

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.370
journalism voices, I think
there is a stat on your side,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.450
about 75% of African-Americans
actually trust

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.710
the source of news.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.390
KYRA KYLES: That they don't.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.180
SPEAKER: Don't trust.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.830
KYRA KYLES: Not, right.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.160
SPEAKER: So what happens?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.190
Is there just no
more readership?

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.947
Or do they turn to
different sources?

00:28:51.947 --> 00:28:52.530
I mean, what--

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.890
KYRA KYLES: I think
people continue

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.480
to read because this
is the information.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.750
But I think they take
it with a huge grain

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.780
of salt. They think, OK,
the police are always

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.430
right in these
stories that I read.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.900
The person that's killed or hurt
or put in jail is always wrong.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.830
I think that there has also
been a proliferation of blogs

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.007
and different sites.

00:29:15.007 --> 00:29:17.340
And I would say, for example,
like "Very Smart Brothas,"

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.946
"The Root."

00:29:17.946 --> 00:29:19.070
They're in different areas.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.090
Some are entertainment,
"Shadow and Act,"

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.520
that have come to
fill in these gaps.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.050
And I think they're
very successful.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.340
But because they still
aren't the juggernauts

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.010
that some of these
other sites are--

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.110
You know, "BET" has
a huge audience,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.570
and so their news
really infiltrates.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.000
But some of these smaller
sites may be aggregated.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.900
They have influence.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.660
But they're still not going
to have the heft of, say,

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.910
the Tribune company, which has
all these different affiliates.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.590
So I do believe it's
bringing forth new voices.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:49.782
But I still think bringing
forth new voices is effective,

00:29:49.782 --> 00:29:51.240
but it would be
even more effective

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.740
if we could get
some of those voices

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.184
into the traditional outlets
that people read the most.

00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:57.600
And some of those people that
read the traditional outlets

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.910
are the main ones that
need to read the new voices

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.560
because they're
just indoctrinated

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.000
in what they're accustomed to.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.820
And sometimes that's
very biased information.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.560
SPEAKER: It's true.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.890
If we look at another industry,
the movies industry, what

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.080
happened with the
Oscars last year,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.940
it was pretty blatant in terms
of the lack of diversity.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.550
And one approach
they took-- and I

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.130
don't know if it's the right
one for other industries

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.670
to look at.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.370
But they set a number
in terms of how--

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.685
they wanted to elevate the
number by 2020, I think it was,

00:30:26.685 --> 00:30:30.560
of women and African-American
and Latino writers.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.500
What's your perspective on that?

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.520
KYRA KYLES: I think
that's a good step.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.540
Again, I do think it also has
to be within the rank and file.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.920
It has to be the producers.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.730
It has to be the script writers.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.740
There have to be more
people behind the scenes,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.150
the directors, the
cinematographers,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.940
in order to really
make sure that we're

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.120
seeing movies that reflect
the audience that's

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.170
sitting in front of it.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.210
I mean, I'll say, I've
been reading recently--

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.111
and I am a huge "Game
of Thrones" fan.

00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:01.860
I once broke up with
a person because they

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.690
kept talking during the scenes.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:09.540
I'm like, no, you're gonna
be quiet or we're done here.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.570
But I mean, it is weird that in
this fantasy world where there

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.320
are dragons and White
Walkers and zombie horses,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.210
you can envision maybe three,
four people of color, period.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.080
And it's weird to people.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.570
I think you're
coming into a time

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.280
where people are not
willing to accept that.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.520
And then on the reverse,
we have the "Black Panther"

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.478
trailers came out, and
people lost their minds.

00:31:31.478 --> 00:31:33.360
What is happening here?

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.542
Why wasn't there a role
set aside for Matt Damon?

00:31:35.542 --> 00:31:36.750
I'm not going to go see this.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.740
And it's like, listen,
Matt Damon had his turn

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.150
when he was on the Great Wall
of China for reasons unknown.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.470
We're going to let that go.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.900
We're going to let Matt Damon
take a bench on this one.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.680
But I think that it's got
to come from everywhere.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.020
Having the judges have
more diversity, which

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.640
is what they did, is great.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.950
But if there aren't more
movies, it's still not

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.970
going to solve anything.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:00.294
We need more movies out
with people of color behind

00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:01.710
as well as in front
of the scenes.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.380
We do have good visibility
in front of the camera,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.280
and that's getting
better, especially on TV.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.730
I think television is
really doing a great job.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.482
But the industries are old,
and they're showing their age.

00:32:12.482 --> 00:32:14.190
And I think we're now
starting to come up

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.590
against a generation that's not
willing to just accept that.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.360
They're going to say,
hey, if you don't make it,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.484
we'll go make it ourselves.

00:32:19.484 --> 00:32:21.510
That's why you saw the
success of "Get Out."

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.593
That movie, I don't think
it could have been made,

00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:24.820
like, five or six years ago.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.736
And now, because of the
response it's getting,

00:32:26.736 --> 00:32:28.800
you'll see more provocative
films like that.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.240
You know, everything is not--

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.174
I respect Tyler Perry because
he's doing amazing things.

00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:34.590
But everything is
not Tyler Perry,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.880
and nor should it have to be.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.338
And that shouldn't
be the framework

00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:40.890
by which movies with a black
cast or black executives

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:41.707
is judged.

00:32:41.707 --> 00:32:42.540
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.480
It's a shared responsibility,
from corporations

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.180
to also the talent
producing the movies.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.460
And it was a colleague
of mine who pointed out

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.980
that Disney's
"Mulan" movie, they

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.810
were about to cast a white
male to be the love interest.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:03.960
And it was a petition of 90,000
folks signed in to make a stop.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.820
And then they
changed the writers.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.875
So there is a way to
have a voice for people.

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:09.750
KYRA KYLES: There is.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.930
Yeah, and to have
an immediate voice.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.060
And I think that's
important, because there

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.190
used to be a time it would have
been a letter-writing campaign

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.710
or something, which is very
sluggish and ineffective.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.418
The movie would have
been in the theaters

00:33:18.418 --> 00:33:20.530
by the time people
knew about the protest.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.650
I think that-- as you point out,
that is a terrible thing to do.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.900
Why would you do that?

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.660
And there really
is a galling lack

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.720
of Asian representation
in movies and pop culture

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.410
in general.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.750
You're starting to see more
of that, but not enough.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.000
They can't afford to
do that at this point.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.740
And I'm so glad that
people spoke out.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.930
And I hope that teaches them a
lesson because I wanted to see

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.600
"Ghost in the Shell,"
but I couldn't.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.600
Because even though
Scarlett Johansson is, like,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.050
one of my Women Crush
Wednesdays, I could not do it.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.870
Because it's such a huge
opportunity that you miss.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.740
And I think people
need to understand.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.440
They may ignore a
protest, but when

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.551
they see the box
office numbers drop,

00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:55.800
there's no way to ignore that.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.340
And Hollywood is
driven by money.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.240
So is the media.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.990
So if you speak with your
dollars and you don't invest,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.210
they will figure out a
different way to do things.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.630
They always have.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.630
SPEAKER: I'm going to ask
you one last question,

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.800
and then we'll open it up.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.389
And we've got some
mics here if you

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.870
want to start lining
up with the questions

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.030
that you're dying to ask Kyra.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:18.639
But it's a little
bit more about--

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.409
we opened up with who are you.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:25.900
I want to also ask you a topic
that's come up out of our Ann

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.770
Arbor office.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.460
And it is a series, "First
time I discovered I was black."

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.120
And that was a Googler
who thought of the series,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.100
created and produced
a 30-minute video

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.560
segment inspired by what he'd
seen on CNN of the same title.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.802
When was the first time you
realized you were black?

00:34:43.802 --> 00:34:45.260
KYRA KYLES: It was
a wonderful day.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.301
I can remember that much.

00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:47.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:51.100
You know, I think I
was exposed early.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.960
I would say maybe the context
of color and race and that,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.880
maybe when I was
about four or five,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.580
because I grew up in
a predominantly Irish

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.510
neighborhood.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.960
And my mother really
didn't have a choice.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.940
There were children
playing with the hair

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.421
and rubbing on the skin.

00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:09.920
And I was like,
what are they doing?

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.830
They would ask us why
our dolls were this,

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.410
because my mother bought us
black dolls because she wanted

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.210
to reinforce our beauty ideals.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.790
So we had some
beautiful black dolls.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.560
Like, one looked
like Phylicia Rashad.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.580
They were so pretty.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.950
And the fact that
we had them often

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.200
caused questions from the
kids in the neighborhood.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.080
So I believe as early as
that, I figured it out.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.530
And then my mother
talked to us about it,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.270
talked about the differences,
talked about history

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.090
to us in a way that we could
understand and consume.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.700
So I felt luckier than
some other children

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.980
when I went to school
and they really weren't

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.540
aware of our history and that.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.330
And they seemed to be more
subject to being, like, shamed

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.320
for being different.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.778
Whereas with me,
I was like, you're

00:35:48.778 --> 00:35:50.740
just mad because your
hair doesn't do this.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.850
You know?

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:55.900
So you know, I had a different
and much more positive

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.330
feeling about it than
if I had come in there

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.290
and been surprised.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.690
You and I were
talking earlier today

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.500
about the sportscaster
who said that he

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.930
doesn't know what he is, and
race doesn't matter anyway.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.540
And I mean, I feel like this
is a man that he probably

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.631
should know at this point.

00:36:11.631 --> 00:36:12.630
He's about 50 years old.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.441
If he's passed at least three
mirrors, he should know.

00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:15.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.240
But the fact that that's
still happening though,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.950
that just tells you how fraught
with controversy the topic is.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:27.010
Identification and
embracing your culture,

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:31.150
it's still something that
is not easy for anyone.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.900
SPEAKER: For sure.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.112
But shouldn't you be
able to hear the voice

00:36:34.112 --> 00:36:36.070
that you had such a
beautiful narrative growing

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.140
up and hearing that
story, and being

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.420
able to project your
voice and to read

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.205
about like-minded
voices as well?

00:36:42.205 --> 00:36:43.330
KYRA KYLES: Exactly, right.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.955
And I think that's
extremely important.

00:36:44.955 --> 00:36:47.020
In the black community
and people of color,

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.640
I think there is a saying.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.190
It's like, you have
to see it to be it.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.780
Seeing even President Barack
Obama ascend that way,

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.307
kids my age probably
didn't think

00:36:57.307 --> 00:36:59.140
that that could happen
just based on the way

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.730
that society is set up.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.440
But there is
generations of children

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.770
that for them, that's a goal.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.350
They don't even
think twice about it

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.460
because they've seen it.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.770
And it's sad that we just
need to see more examples.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.290
And then people
being free to talk

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.430
about them in various outlets
and in movies and TV and pop

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:16.300
culture.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.236
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:37:17.236 --> 00:37:18.610
You sparked some
ideas as well as

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.654
to how we can do that--
sponsorship and others.

00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:22.570
KYRA KYLES: Wonderful.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:27.090
SPEAKER: We'll turn to some
live questions and pass it over.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.790
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.590
Thank you so much, Kyra, for
coming and speaking with us.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.506
KYRA KYLES: Of course.

00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:34.630
AUDIENCE: So we've heard several
women, female executives,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.300
of color come and see us
and share their experiences.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.700
Some of them actually
expressed that they

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.890
felt more discrimination
as a woman

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.520
than as a person of color.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.040
So I'd love to get
your experiences.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.020
Does that align to
your expectations

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.550
and your experiences
and what you've

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.020
seen in the media industry?

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.879
Or what's the situation there?

00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:54.670
KYRA KYLES: For me,
personally-- and again,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.140
this is just for me personally--

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:01.090
I feel that blackness cannot
be extracted from my womanness.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.700
I feel like they're one thing.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.610
Black women in general
are treated differently

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.470
than white women are treated.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.120
I don't have the statistics
with me at the moment.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.540
But just in terms of
being in a workplace

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.420
and having internal
advocates, black women

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.650
felt much less supported
than white women.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.620
Now, white women felt much
less supported than white men.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.740
So it's like the
old saying, it's

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.000
like there are levels to this.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.642
So I think that when I come
into a room, people see a woman.

00:38:29.642 --> 00:38:31.600
But I think first and
foremost, a lot of times,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.630
they see a black woman.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.240
I don't think I'm able to--

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.840
I'm a woman now and
also a black-- you know?

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.730
So I can only speak to mine.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.550
But I think I like it because
I think I find it empowering.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.729
Like, that's a double challenge
that I'm facing in society.

00:38:47.729 --> 00:38:50.020
And for me to be able to make
it as far as I've made it

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.650
and be able to sit here and
address you all, I mean,

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.200
I hope that inspires
other young black girls.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.550
I hope that inspires people.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.130
I don't want to make light of
the challenges that I've faced

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.600
and say, oh, no it's
no problem, because I

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.808
don't want other people who
are experiencing problems

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:06.270
to think that they
are being singled out.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.100
No, it's a problem usually.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.930
But my hope is
that by doing this

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.570
and by talking to more people,
it will be less of a problem

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.960
until it's not a problem at all.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.150
So that's the goal.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.800
But that's an
excellent question.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.299
And I'm sure there are different
people that would answer it

00:39:19.299 --> 00:39:20.780
differently too.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.030
SPEAKER: There's this
concept of allies at Google,

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.120
because no matter
how you identify,

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.390
you can have sponsors
in the room to make sure

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.920
that your voice is heard.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.530
And I think it's something
that is work in progress here

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.140
and that we're also trying
to influence in the world.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.307
But with beautiful leaders--

00:39:37.307 --> 00:39:39.264
KYRA KYLES: And I think
that's super important.

00:39:39.264 --> 00:39:41.960
I mean, and I love that that's
a priority because I think

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.810
sometimes we take for granted
that if you work somewhere,

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.890
you'll get a mentor.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.780
They'll just appear to
you out of thin air.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.372
No, people have to step up.

00:39:49.372 --> 00:39:51.830
And I think that that's great
that you're encouraging that.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.300
So that's terrific.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.835
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:39:54.835 --> 00:39:56.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name's Jonathan.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.290
And first, I just
want to thank you

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.910
for taking the time
to speak with us.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.907
It's been a really
powerful message.

00:40:00.907 --> 00:40:02.990
Throughout your career,
you've had the opportunity

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.120
to work at a number
of institutions,

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.840
large and small, some
that have gotten it right,

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.670
some that continued
to get it wrong.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.220
And you gave all
those examples earlier

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.660
where it was almost like,
how could this happen?

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.230
How could you get to this
point in your creative process

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.590
or in your execution and
no one asked the question?

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.600
And the checks and
balances oftentimes

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.795
came from the public.

00:40:24.795 --> 00:40:27.740
I would love to know,
in your experience, what

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.380
are some of the hallmarks of
institutions that get it right?

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.570
And what are some of
the checks and balances

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.430
they establish
internally to make

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.500
sure that the product
that they put out

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.294
is more reflective,
is more diverse?

00:40:39.294 --> 00:40:41.210
KYRA KYLES: Well, that's
a fantastic question.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.610
And I'll say, to
be fair, obviously,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.050
it's not just the
media industry.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.640
I mean, we all saw that
tone deaf Kylie Jenner Pepsi

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.370
ad where she solved Black
Lives Matter's issues

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.230
with a carbonated beverage.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.410
And somebody bought
space for that.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.722
And only until people
said, what are you doing,

00:40:59.722 --> 00:41:00.930
did they pull the commercial.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.270
I never would have aired it.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.120
It was like a "Saturday Night
Live" sketch waiting to happen.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.537
Like, you did Lorne
Michael's work for him.

00:41:07.537 --> 00:41:08.620
SPEAKER: Beyonce is black?

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.130
KYRA KYLES: Right.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.532
Yeah, well, that wax
figure, have you seen that?

00:41:12.532 --> 00:41:13.490
They have her looking--

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.810
OK, but anyway, we'll
talk about that later.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:15.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.890
But I would say, in terms
of checks and balances,

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.790
I think it's important to have
people of different backgrounds

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.690
with different
experiences in the room.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.750
Unfortunately, especially
in the United States,

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.510
I think we have a
lot of segregation

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.200
at work and at home.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.817
We have a lot of segregation
in terms of who we talk to.

00:41:33.817 --> 00:41:35.900
So maybe some of these
people didn't have a friend

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.233
that they could say, hey,
we're doing something at work,

00:41:38.233 --> 00:41:40.040
and it's going to be pretty big.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.670
I'd like to get
your thoughts on it.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.630
They may not have had that.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.240
So if you don't have that
in your friends circle,

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.405
you should have it at work.

00:41:45.405 --> 00:41:47.780
And I think what you also
need, which is super important,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.530
is you need to have people of
color in the leadership roles

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.031
too.

00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:54.488
Because there are sometimes
people in the room, and they're

00:41:54.488 --> 00:41:55.490
intimidated to speak.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.948
Like, when I got called in
there for that Hurricane Katrina

00:41:57.948 --> 00:42:00.572
conversation, I did
think, they all seemingly

00:42:00.572 --> 00:42:02.780
have made up their mind that
it's OK to use this term

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.620
"refugee."

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.420
I might end up
getting in trouble.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.590
And I might jeopardize a
promotion in the future

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.050
by being that girl that
came in here and told them

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.860
what was what.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.190
But my great-grandmother
marched with Martin Luther King.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:19.280
I could not-- and I'm not saying
that like I'm some martyr,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.170
because guess what?

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.920
I would have gotten
another job, I'm sure.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.029
But I couldn't do it.

00:42:23.029 --> 00:42:24.320
Because I couldn't be the one--

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.820
I actually had
readers call me when

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.560
they would see things
wrong in the newspaper--

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.460
how did you sit up there
and let that happen?

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.250
So I also had that
responsibility too.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.875
And I had to tell
them, you know, guys,

00:42:32.875 --> 00:42:34.100
I can't control everything.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.350
But I did take my
responsibility seriously.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.750
Some of it is not only just
having people in the room,

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.910
empowering them to speak,
and also having them

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.194
at different levels
of the company,

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:45.110
not just in the creative
and out-front fields,

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.480
but behind the scenes so that
they can stop it before it

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.330
even, as you mentioned, gets so
far up in the creative process

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.175
that you're already casting
for Kylie's police officer

00:42:54.175 --> 00:42:55.550
she's going to
hand the Pepsi to.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.812
They should never have--

00:42:56.812 --> 00:42:58.520
no, that should never
happened, honestly.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.686
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:42:59.686 --> 00:43:01.130
KYRA KYLES: No problem.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.082
AUDIENCE: Hi, so you
mentioned fragmentation

00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:05.540
and how people have
a great ability

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.270
to control what they see
and who they interact with.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.980
Do you think the
media landscape is

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.310
getting a lot more fragmented
these days in terms of people

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.880
being able to self-select more
and more specific outlets?

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.590
And do you think
that's going to present

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.900
a big problem for the types
of issues we're talking about?

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.770
KYRA KYLES: Well,
I think it already

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.812
presented a big problem.

00:43:22.812 --> 00:43:25.020
I think it has a lot to do
with our election results,

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.561
to be honest.

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.920
I mean, and not to
get super political,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.140
but there is proof that people
reading erroneous information,

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.020
people reading kind
of race baiting,

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.190
or just plain not
factual information

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.990
had an effect on the
way people voted,

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.520
had an effect on the way
people came out to vote.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.720
And I think we do live in a time
where you could be in a bubble

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.840
if you want to, if
you decide to wake up

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.060
and use one news
source for everything

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.180
and only go to those
things that agree with you.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.850
Like I'll admit, in my little
circle of Facebook friends,

00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:59.840
most of us agree.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.130
When someone doesn't,
it's really jarring.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.920
But that's actually
not a great thing

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.592
because then you're
being reinforced

00:44:06.592 --> 00:44:08.300
and you think what
you're doing is right.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.260
You don't have any
educated dissenter.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.510
I'm not talking about a troll.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.860
I'm talking about
somebody who really knows

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.250
what they're talking about.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.690
We are seeing more
consolidation of news entities

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.106
teaming up and working together.

00:44:19.106 --> 00:44:20.480
Because of the
lack of resources,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.370
they almost have
to work together.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.370
But I do think-- that's what
I'm kind of afraid of is

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.980
that people will become so
disenchanted with the way

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.290
that the traditional media
is that they will just say,

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.748
I'm not going to
read that anymore.

00:44:31.748 --> 00:44:33.470
I'm just going to rely
on this small blog

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.886
with like three people that
don't have enough people to do

00:44:35.886 --> 00:44:37.160
an investigative bureau.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.650
And I'm going to go
with whatever they say.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.330
So I think it is a problem.

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:44.690
But we can head that off by
bringing some of those voices

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.800
into the mainstream
in larger outlets.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.990
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:54.470
You touch on an issue with
the cost of journalism

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.380
and needing to be able
to sponsor and fund

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.530
quality journalism.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.870
But when we look at the
numbers and shifts, where

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:07.040
in terms of the minority
will become the majority,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.610
those ad dollars will
need to be invested.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.100
There was a question
that came in from one

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.440
of the colleagues, which
was, when you think

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.890
of the traditionally
black publications,

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:23.090
their voices really
focus on their audience.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.800
With the shift in
demographics, how

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.490
do you see that evolution
for those publications,

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.230
the "Ebonys,"
"Jets," of the world?

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.730
KYRA KYLES: That's
a great question.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.490
So I can say from my
personal experience

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:37.097
and what I observed--
and Wendy and Melissa,

00:45:37.097 --> 00:45:38.180
yell out if I'm incorrect.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.370
They worked with me at
"Ebony" when I was there.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.930
Sometimes advertisers
seem to believe

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.980
that they can get advertising
in these black publications

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.990
investing less than they
would for a mainstream outlet,

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.740
even if they see that the
numbers that they're getting

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.811
are very similar.

00:45:55.811 --> 00:45:57.560
And I think that's
another systemic issue,

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.130
the fact that you think you
should pay less for the same.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.570
So that is a problem.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:06.064
And it's hard to really
get hardcore with them

00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:07.730
because then they can
take their dollars

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.730
and invest digitally with some
of these outlets that may not

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.530
be as established,
but it doesn't cost

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.700
as much to invest that way.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.450
But again, journalism does cost
money, good journalism does.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.810
You can't do investigations.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.540
You can't be thorough.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.580
Sure, you can write a
lot of opinion pieces

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.410
that are based in existing fact.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.140
But you can't do
any deep digging

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.140
if you don't have money.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.180
So that is an
important thing and one

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.970
that I think that the technology
industry could assist with.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.610
If they could fund
certain initiatives,

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:37.940
if they could help maybe
invest in investigative arms,

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.460
or invest in certain
investigations, period,

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.600
I think that that
would be helpful.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.350
It's a very difficult question
because one would think that

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.720
the shift in demographics
would mean a shift in budget,

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.669
but it hasn't.

00:46:48.669 --> 00:46:50.210
And a lot of people
point to the fact

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:53.000
that yes, there are
niche black publications.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.840
But I grew up reading all
the different magazines too.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.560
I even had a situation--

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.640
this was very recent-- where
I went to a car dealership--

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.140
spoiler alert, I
did not buy the car

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.931
because I did not like
this guy's attitude.

00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:05.657
He said to me--

00:47:05.657 --> 00:47:06.740
I told him where I worked.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.390
At the time, it was "Ebony."

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.100
He came up with this
wonderful anecdote,

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.830
trying to relate to me.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.540
He was like, you know what?

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.920
You're going to
think this is funny.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.670
I was like, oh, my god.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.440
I know I'm not going
to think it's funny.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.510
He said to me that he loved
Will Smith when he was a kid.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.010
He would buy Will
Smith on anything.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.093
Didn't matter what it was.

00:47:21.093 --> 00:47:23.190
He saw an "Ebony" magazine
with Will Smith on it.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.230
He goes, so here I am, this kid.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.920
I get up there and I
buy an "Ebony" magazine.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.920
And I was like, and
the punch line is what?

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.810
And I was like, every day
that I buy a magazine,

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.300
these are not black
magazines, the cashier

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.040
has never stopped me.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.210
I don't get the story.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.480
You know what?

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.160
Why don't we just go
back to the dealership?

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.110
And then I ended up buying
a totally different car.

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.235
But that's what I'm saying.

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.620
Like, there's still
this stigma and thought

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.540
that it'd be weird
for a person that's

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.150
not black to buy this
magazine, but it's not weird

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.570
for me to buy a magazine that
isn't black-owned and doesn't

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.690
have a black person
on the cover.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.120
And this happened last year.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.990
So it's not some ancient
tale I'm telling.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.052
And that says a lot
about that situation.

00:48:02.052 --> 00:48:03.260
SPEAKER: It's so unfortunate.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.850
KYRA KYLES: It was, for
him and his sale too.

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.609
He learned something.

00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:08.900
He won't tell that story again.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.020
Hi.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.530
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Latoya.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:14.480
I work on a team
called the News Lab.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.255
And we are all about
working with journalists

00:48:17.255 --> 00:48:20.240
and technologists to help
build the future of media.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.310
I lead a piece of
work on the team

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:23.880
called Inclusive Storytelling.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.347
How do we elevate the voices
that we don't traditionally

00:48:26.347 --> 00:48:26.930
hear in media?

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.513
I'm just going to
point out one thing.

00:48:28.513 --> 00:48:30.770
You mentioned that you need
sponsorships and dollars.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:34.610
That's exactly what our team
does, trying to increase--

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.320
we support the Ida
B.Wells Society,

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.320
for instance, which is about
training journalists of colors

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.480
to be investigative journalists.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.670
I wanted to ask you your
thoughts on what more

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.550
technology companies can do.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.430
You made the point about
Pepsi and people of color

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:51.170
not having a seat
at the table and not

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.317
being in positions of
power to say something.

00:48:54.317 --> 00:48:56.900
When we think about newsrooms,
I think we've seen the numbers.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.530
The leadership, I think it's
86% of editorial directors

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.020
and so on are white men.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.250
How do you change that?

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.740
What does it take to
shake up the newsrooms?

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.570
Is it a matter of just
hiring more people?

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:09.830
Going to find them?

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.480
What's the role a
technology company

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.830
can play in really
inspiring that change?

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:15.080
It's something we think about.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.340
We don't have the answers.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.800
But it seems that
change comes down

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.970
to getting more people
with a seat at the table.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:23.650
But how do we make that happen?

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:25.830
KYRA KYLES: Well, I really
liked and was encouraged

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.380
by what Google is doing
with Howard University,

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.240
by creating this
space where people

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.679
of the university and students
are interacting directly

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:35.970
with Google employees, seeing
what their future can be,

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:37.350
seeing what the potential is.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.140
Something to that effect in the
area of journalism, I think,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.880
would be very impactful.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.720
I do think, like
what you mentioned,

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.370
the Ida B. Wells,
that sounds amazing.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.745
I also noted that
Google is going

00:49:46.745 --> 00:49:49.410
to be a partner in evaluating
the number of minorities

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.682
in journalism for next
year, which is great.

00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:53.640
Having that transparency
is extremely important

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.764
because how can we fix the
problem if we don't even

00:49:55.764 --> 00:49:57.460
know the full scope of it.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:03.480
Maybe using technology tools
to create job bank databases,

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.440
or helping create programs or
fellowships that pay a stipend.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.660
As I mentioned the problem
about news entities

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.400
not paying or paying
below standard,

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.910
maybe in some way trying to
help boost that amount of pay

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.450
so that people can afford
to enter the industry.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.500
And then training.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.802
So NABJ offers amazing training
for managers and people

00:50:22.802 --> 00:50:24.510
who want to go into
the management track,

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.850
supporting those efforts,
so that you don't just

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.400
have people who are the
writers and they get on CNN.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.230
And yeah, everybody
knows them by name,

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.630
but they don't necessarily
have as much power

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.389
behind the scenes
as these producers

00:50:35.389 --> 00:50:37.680
and these other people who
are telling them where to go

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.490
and what to do and
what to focus on.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.220
So I think that
what you mentioned

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.890
is a great start, and just
continuing to do that.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:47.190
And also making it easier to
find people or candidates,

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.390
it would be important.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.961
I think technology is
very helpful in that it

00:50:51.961 --> 00:50:54.210
connects people that might
not otherwise be connected.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.980
But what I find that
it does a lot of times

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.980
is it just makes it easier
to connect with those

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.804
you already know.

00:50:58.804 --> 00:51:00.720
And I would love to see
some technologies that

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.370
push you beyond that.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.904
One of my mentors and
former managers, Jane Hurt,

00:51:04.904 --> 00:51:06.570
that worked at the
Tribune red eye, what

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:09.450
I love about her is that she
would go out of her way to go

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.430
find people of
color people, people

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.280
representing different areas
of the gender Spectrum.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.950
She did this with a
conscious thought--

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.080
this is what I'm doing--
and not in a way of,

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.130
this is a token hire.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.942
But this is a
super-talented person.

00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:23.400
I'm going to work
with this person.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.360
I'm going to make sure
that they feel welcome.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.970
And I'm going to make sure
that their voices are heard.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.615
She will ask you, what do you
think about this, in a way that

00:51:29.615 --> 00:51:31.740
doesn't make it feel like
you're being pigeonholed.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.310
And I think it's also that, the
manager mindset of not bringing

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:37.950
someone in so you can
just take a staff picture

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:39.690
and look like you're
doing something,

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.910
but really making them
part of the process.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.190
And she did that really well.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.148
So I bring her up as an
example of what I would

00:51:45.148 --> 00:51:47.740
love to see more managers do.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.415
AUDIENCE: And I'll
be at NABJ in August.

00:51:49.415 --> 00:51:50.040
KYRA KYLES: OK.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.555
I'm sure you will, New Orleans.

00:51:51.555 --> 00:51:52.812
All right, cool.

00:51:52.812 --> 00:51:54.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.220
SPEAKER: So there is
this photo on the screen

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.385
that I have to ask,
what's the story?

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:03.260
KYRA KYLES: I just like
the way I look in it.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.050
No, I'm just kidding.

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.310
So I went on "The Real"--

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.060
I think it was in
the end of last year,

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.270
in December, to
talk about-- which

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:15.030
is another important thing
and something that companies

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.470
can support.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.720
"The Root" does their
own version of this.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.970
A lot of entities do.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.800
The Power 100 for
"Ebony" was a way

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.140
to highlight people that
are doing great things,

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.060
not just entertainment
and celebrity that you

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.130
see every day, but
people in technology,

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.950
people in nonprofit, people
in the business world.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.620
And initiatives like that are
important because, again, it's

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.159
that see it to be it mentality.

00:52:37.159 --> 00:52:38.700
So I was really
happy to go on there.

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.825
And the ladies were lovely.

00:52:39.825 --> 00:52:40.912
They were very kind.

00:52:40.912 --> 00:52:42.870
I didn't get to drink
whatever was in that mug.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:44.550
I'm not sure what
it is to this day.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:48.090
But yeah, it was a great
and empowering experience.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.060
So I think we just need
more initiatives like that.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.120
There are many people of
color across the globe doing

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.962
terrific things.

00:52:54.962 --> 00:52:56.670
It saddens me that
sometimes those people

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.320
don't get the attention
that they deserve.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.520
And I think that if we can work
on our media coverage, work

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.130
on our media newsrooms,
we will see more of that.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:09.340
And the problem will
not vanish overnight.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.790
But we will make a
lot more progress.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.190
SPEAKER: We are
strong believers.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.860
Our CEO has even said, a mix of
diverse perspective and ideas

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.580
and backgrounds will only lead
to better products and better

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.900
experiences.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.050
And I'm hopeful.

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.990
I guess as a final
question, it would

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:32.940
be, what are you most excited
about for the next couple

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.521
of years?

00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:36.645
KYRA KYLES: What I'm most
excited about is twofold.

00:53:36.645 --> 00:53:40.560
So I'm excited by
people of color deciding

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.170
that they will invest and
create media outlets, TV

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.136
shows, that they will
showcase their talents,

00:53:48.136 --> 00:53:50.010
and that they're doing
that, and that they're

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:51.180
getting a reception for that.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.304
They're not waiting around.

00:53:52.304 --> 00:53:54.300
They're not begging
people, please write me in,

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.710
or please cast me.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.660
They're taking matters
into their own hands.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:02.040
I think we're seeing a wave
of content creators of color

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.302
that are making a big splash.

00:54:03.302 --> 00:54:04.260
It's not a niche thing.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.760
It's not something that just a
handful of people are seeing.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.460
You see that Issa Rae.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.531
You see that with Donald Glover.

00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:12.780
These are not people that
are just trying to be stars.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.040
They're trying to make
opportunities for other people.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.290
And I think that that's great.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.100
Jordan Peele as well.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.070
The other thing I'm
very excited about--

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.320
and some people in the
industry might disagree with me

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.550
on this-- is audience power.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:27.760
I love that the audience can get
you right together really fast.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.252
You know, when I
was in the newsroom,

00:54:30.252 --> 00:54:32.460
I know people used to hate
when the phone would ring.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.918
They'd hate emails
from the public.

00:54:33.918 --> 00:54:34.592
I loved them.

00:54:34.592 --> 00:54:36.300
Because that's how I
can do a better job.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.950
How can I do a
better job if I have

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.300
no idea what the reception is?

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.760
There are some people who live
in this little ivory tower,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.555
and they think that the
public doesn't have the savvy

00:54:44.555 --> 00:54:45.930
to comment on what
they're doing?

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.960
But you're doing it for
them, so why can't they

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.220
have a two-way
conversation with you?

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.700
I love the fact that people
get dragged on Twitter.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.770
Sometimes it's
funnier than others.

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:57.450
I think it's appropriate though.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.130
You're putting
something out there.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.170
You can't dictate to me
what I'm going to engage in,

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.070
or what I'm going
to like or hate.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.880
And I love that.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.400
So I think we're seeing power
to the people, so to speak,

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.730
and also power to the creators.

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.560
And that, I think,
is exhilarating.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.140
And I'm excited to
watch where that goes.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.250
SPEAKER: That's fantastic.

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:20.670
You've been an inspiring and
powerful and beautiful voice.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.130
We're so lucky to have had
the opportunity to have

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.360
a conversation with you.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.260
KYRA KYLES: It was
an honor to be here.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.840
SPEAKER: You'll see another
friend later at the conference.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.530
KYRA KYLES: Yes!

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.040
SPEAKER: Thank you again.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.730
KYRA KYLES: All right.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.270
Wonderful.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.080
Thank you so much.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:31.788
Thanks, everyone.

00:55:31.788 --> 00:55:32.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.930
SPEAKER: It was so
great to see you.
