between men and women fundamentally is

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349
between men and women fundamentally is

between men and women fundamentally is
monogamous social norm men are

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
monogamous social norm men are
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.449
monogamous social norm men are
unattractive if these were suggestion to

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459
unattractive if these were suggestion to
 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.399
unattractive if these were suggestion to
them but if these men are unattractive

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409
them but if these men are unattractive

men yes they certainly do this illusion
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.809
men yes they certainly do this illusion
that's the solution absolute and we both

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819
that's the solution absolute and we both
 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.670
that's the solution absolute and we both
agree on this yes what they need to do

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
agree on this yes what they need to do
 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.410
agree on this yes what they need to do
that in this society where monogamy is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420

well that was partly my point although

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299
well that was partly my point although
 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.839
well that was partly my point although
to the degree that we deviate from that

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849
to the degree that we deviate from that
 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.180
to the degree that we deviate from that
we tilt towards a more violent society I

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190

well yeah I see your point no doubt
about it

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.089
about it
 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.579
about it

the degree that she had a point that was
 

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:51.959
the degree that she had a point that was
her point now and but I but it's not who

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:51.969
her point now and but I but it's not who
 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:54.510

doesn't run contrary to my opinions that

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520
doesn't run contrary to my opinions that
 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.639
doesn't run contrary to my opinions that
the issue of outcome has to be addressed

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:56.649
the issue of outcome has to be addressed
 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:57.959
the issue of outcome has to be addressed
I already said there's needs to be a

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:57.969
I already said there's needs to be a
 

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.639
I already said there's needs to be a
reason for the left and the right and

00:07:59.639 --> 00:07:59.649
reason for the left and the right and
 

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:01.170
reason for the left and the right and
then the problem with hierarchies is

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
then the problem with hierarchies is
 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.659
then the problem with hierarchies is
they can get too steep and destabilize

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:03.669
they can get too steep and destabilize
 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.369
they can get too steep and destabilize
everything that does happen that

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:05.379
everything that does happen that
 

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:06.989
everything that does happen that
particularly happens in the sexual

00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:06.999
particularly happens in the sexual
 

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.219
particularly happens in the sexual
domain and there's plenty of

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:08.229
domain and there's plenty of
 

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:10.050
domain and there's plenty of
anthropological evidence for that but

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.060
anthropological evidence for that but
 

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.670
anthropological evidence for that but
you still might say well who cares

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680
you still might say well who cares
 

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.100
you still might say well who cares
because the men who are who are winning

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110
because the men who are who are winning
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.600
because the men who are who are winning
should be allowed to win and the women

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:15.610
should be allowed to win and the women
 

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.769
should be allowed to win and the women
should be allowed to choose it's right

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:16.779
should be allowed to choose it's right
 

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.469
should be allowed to choose it's right
yes except that there's the problem of

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479
yes except that there's the problem of
 

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:21.540
yes except that there's the problem of
children and so society steps in on

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:21.550
children and so society steps in on
 

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.369
children and so society steps in on
behalf of the children and you can say

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:23.379
behalf of the children and you can say
 

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:24.809
behalf of the children and you can say
well lots of people don't want to have

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:24.819
well lots of people don't want to have
 

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:27.119
well lots of people don't want to have
children and yes and that's truer now

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:27.129
children and yes and that's truer now
 

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.589
children and yes and that's truer now
than it used to be although many of

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599
than it used to be although many of
 

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.089
than it used to be although many of
those people end up having children

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:30.099
those people end up having children
 

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:32.189
those people end up having children

anyways you know the guys who sit around
 

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.079
anyways you know the guys who sit around
all the time so that doesn't circumvent

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:34.089
all the time so that doesn't circumvent
 

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:35.850
all the time so that doesn't circumvent
the problem but the issue here for me

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:35.860
the problem but the issue here for me
 

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.290
the problem but the issue here for me
isn't the men or the women it's the
