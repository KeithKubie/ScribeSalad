DAN GALPIN: One
thing I always say

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.850
when you're doing panel
discussions is you're supposed

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.266
to have somebody
keep track of it.

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.860
So basically, my
job is to be sort

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:13.630
of the administrative
assistant for this exercise,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.490
because all the really important
people are coming up behind me.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.370
The title of this
panel is "Why I

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.360
Hate Making Games
Exactly" or "What

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.540
I Hate About Making Games."

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.290
And I first really
didn't like that title.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.170
I didn't come up
with that title.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.760
Because I hope that everyone
is here because they either

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.180
love games or they
love making games.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
I mean I hope no one is here
just because this is something

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.370
they've been forced into doing.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.040
I think the game industry tends
to really not be that way.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.700
Who here actually loves
playing games, first of all?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.620
Yeah.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.540
And who here actually
loves building games?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.080
All right.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.280
So more players than
builders, which is fine.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.834
But since the title
of this presentation

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.000
is "What You Hate About
Making Games"-- but I wanted

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.550
to start out initially saying,
hopefully we all really

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.750
love games, and most of us
really love making games.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.100
Because otherwise
we wouldn't be here.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340
And so let's
introduce our panel.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.417
So we've got Saad Choudri,
who's the VP of Miniclip.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.750
SAAD CHOUDRI: Just get on stage?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.083
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, just come
on stage as I introduce you.

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:32.399
We've got Chris Southall,
who's the CTO Sega Europe.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.940
Where's Andy?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.900
Oh.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590
Well anyways, we've got
Doron Kagan-- oh, there we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.664
are-- Andy Payne
from Mastertronic.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.580
ANDY PAYNE: Apologies.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.170
DAN GALPIN: And also
founder of AppyNation, I

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.490
wanted to make sure
I included that.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.656
ANDY PAYNE: Yeah, thank you.

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:45.690
DAN GALPIN: So, please welcome.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.410
So I'm not going to
start off with asking

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.910
what do you hate
about making games,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.118
but I want to talk about a
couple of different areas.

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:55.900
So one is we've been seeing a
huge switch in gaming from kind

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.560
of traditional style PC
gaming to a lot of web gaming,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.100
and now mobile gaming is
what's really, really hot.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.360
So I wanted to talk
about, first of all,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.449
is the initial question,
what are the things that

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.930
are challenging when it
comes to making that switch?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.220
What are things
that you used to be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.930
able to do that you
can't do any more?

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.763
What are things that
you're struggling with,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:22.430
in terms of making the switch
between traditional gaming

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.400
and into mobile gaming, or from
web gaming to mobile gaming?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.180
So I'm just going to throw
this out here to the panel.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.797
SAAD CHOUDRI: I guess
I'll start then.

00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:30.380
Just make it--

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.600
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.439
Please, please.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.730
SAAD CHOUDRI: That's all right.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.800
So yeah, Miniclip has gone
through this transition quite

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.110
visibly.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.170
We are very well known as
a web portal, web platform.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.220
And over the last
three and a half years,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.020
we've set up our mobile
division, both developing

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.380
and publishing.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.130
Essentially, I think
the biggest challenge

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.040
is the mobile platform
has so many issues

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.580
that you have to solve before
you can even really publish

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.400
a game on there.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.230
So it's not only that
you have to optimize it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.010
if you're making a
multiplayer game, which we do,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.543
for the kind of
mobile kind of amount

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:13.810
of data you could send
across the network,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.000
to user acquisition,
which is the big elephant

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.340
in the room for most people.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.860
And then touch device, so just
the input and the UI and the UX

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.590
that you have to solve.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.000
So those are some
interesting challenges

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.180
that you have to meet before
you could even really think

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.850
about just essentially
taking a web

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.590
game to the mobile platform.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.880
So we've been doing it for about
three and a half years now.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.785
We think we've got it down to a
bit of a science, a little bit

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.330
of an art, especially
with one of our games,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.780
our flagship title,
which is 8 Ball Pool.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.580
And we're still figuring out.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.260
It's not easy.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.010
I think on the web it was
you have mouse and keyboard

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.200
input, which makes-- you know
we've had that for the last 20

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.710
plus years, and
touch devices have

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.989
come since basically the iPhone.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.280
We won't talk about Windows CE.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.655
DAN GALPIN: I program
for that platform,

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:13.780
we shouldn't talk about it.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.160
SAAD CHOUDRI: No, we won't.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.310
CHRIS SOUTHALL: So for
us, we've kind of-- we've

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.643
not come from the web obviously.

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:22.410
I've come from console
and PC as a background.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.410
And actually we kind of
figured that we probably

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.390
didn't know that
much two years ago

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.940
when we started doing mobile.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.230
And it took about six
months to actually start

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.920
to learn what we didn't know.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.360
You've got this
thing where you've

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.440
got unknown unknowns
and known unknowns,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.180
and we didn't even know the
known unknown for some months.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.180
So that was interesting.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.638
We're a bunch of guys who've
been doing console games maybe

00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:43.400
10 or 15 years.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.983
And we kind of thought, right
we need some analytics in there.

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:47.752
So we'll make a game
and hopefully we'll

00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:49.460
have some things that
people want to buy,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.200
and we'll put some analytics in.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.490
And then we'll figure
out how they're doing,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.910
and then we'll
change some things,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.232
and actually that doesn't
go very well at all.

00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:58.690
Obviously, it's
part of Sega, we've

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.550
got quite big IPs so there's
a big advantage there.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.774
You were talking
earlier about UA.

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:05.190
Obviously, if
you've got something

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.270
like Sonic the
Hedgehog, he kind of

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.172
sells games without
too much fuss.

00:05:09.172 --> 00:05:11.380
You don't need to do too
much advertising, but then--

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.470
SAAD CHOUDRI: He is your UA.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.678
CHRIS SOUTHALL: He is our UA.

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:16.720
But actually, after that
that's where the work begins.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.390
And it's very different, because
when you put a game on a disk,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.972
you sell it, your
work is finished.

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:23.180
And actually, that's where
the work is just starting.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.577
And we kind of didn't
understand that.

00:05:25.577 --> 00:05:27.410
We sort of in our heads,
we sort of knew it,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.190
but now we're starting to
understand that instinctively.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.860
So the pattern of game
develops very different.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.739
When you first release that
game, that's your first point.

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:40.280
But then you're really looking
at retaining users, and making

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.849
sure users are
engaged and talking

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.890
about all of these things
that some of these guys

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.223
have been presenting on today,
which is looking at data,

00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:49.396
making sure you've got the
social aspects nailed in there,

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:52.020
making sure that you know you've
got different types of players

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.340
in the games, and catering
for all of those players.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.540
It's is just a
much bigger expanse

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.750
that you're looking at
as a game developer.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.359
What do I hate
about making games?

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:05.150
That's a question I've
been thinking about.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.500
What can I answer?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.300
To Dan's point, we're all here
because we like making games

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.034
and we like the
business, I think.

00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:13.450
The one thing I wasn't so fond
of with console development

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.520
was crunch.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.270
And we would end up--
the best [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.970
in the world, the
best planned projects,

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.594
you would end up
doing some heavy hours

00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:21.610
towards the end
of game releases.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.010
We actually can't do that now,
because with games as a service

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.865
if you crunch you're
knackered and you still

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:29.240
need to maintain the game,
and that doesn't go very well.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.760
So it's actually quite a nice
pace for game development

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.450
now, doing mobile games
and just releasing a game

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.520
and maintaining it.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520
So that's been good.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.210
DAN GALPIN: Well I think
you touch on something there

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.030
that the people who were
developing web games

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.160
were a lot closer to what
we're doing, in a sense of they

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.150
already were developing games
as a service to a large degree.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.110
And they already were thinking
of very, very quick execution

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.320
cycles and a lot
of data analysis.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.850
That's just what's ingrained
in being in the web.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.964
So I think it is interesting,
I mean coming from the console.

00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:00.630
Now the thing that's
interesting is also

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.180
I think that people on
these mobile devices

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.460
are engaging long, for
long periods of time,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.640
but in very, very
short sessions.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.390
And I think that's
also a change.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.060
So in terms of
content-- and I want

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.260
to continue throwing
this out to the panel,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.250
because I was leading at kind
of two things with the question.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.460
One is not only in terms
of the way one makes games,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.110
but in terms of the
content within the games,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.640
how do you see that
changing as well?

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640
So just keeping going.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.000
CHRIS SOUTHALL: Yeah,
I mean for my point--

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.516
I'll let you answer
in a minute--

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:33.120
DORON KAGAN: Yeah, OK.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.260
CHRIS SOUTHALL: That's an
interesting thing as well,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.280
because we were making games
that would be like, is it

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.863
an eight hour game
or a ten hour game?

00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:40.322
A ten hour game, we're done,
that's a good console game.

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:42.780
Now we're making games that
need to last hundreds of hours,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.700
but in very short, short bursts.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.560
So yeah, that's a big
difference as well.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.270
But, sorry.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.020
DORON KAGAN: Sure.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.950
DAN GALPIN: Let's
keep going, thank you.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.720
DORON KAGAN: I'm Doron,
I'm from Deemedya.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.390
We are a boutique publisher.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.390
We don't publish a lot.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.990
We publish only on mobile.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.430
And we have 100
million downloads,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.140
many from Trial Xtreme.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.220
We were born in
the Java days, so I

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.630
don't have a lot of
console experience.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.610
But in today's world,
to think about the game

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.070
that you can design in
the studio with the best

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.105
brains in the country,
and to release it

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.470
in six months, 12
months, to the market

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.610
without any ability to change
it is unthinkable today.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.720
When we finish a
game that we think

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.920
is close to perfect
from our perspective,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.929
we first soft launch it in a
couple of-- Canada, Australia,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.830
New Zealand.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.230
And then we, using Google
Analytics and other tools,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.059
learning that everything that we
thought that the user will do,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.830
he's not doing and he's
doing the other way around.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.210
So learning the behavior of
the user in the soft launch,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.410
by measuring the-- by
learning the behavior

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.530
of a few thousands,
10 thousands of users,

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.300
allows us to change the
pattern to a pattern

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.070
that the users, the
potential clients,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.527
are voting in their legs.

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:05.360
What do they really
want to see in the game?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.280
Where do they go?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.050
They don't go to where
we want them to go,

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.280
they go to other way around.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.420
So yes, I totally agree.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.200
The web developers are much
closer to today's market

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.950
because the model of
ongoing work on the game,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.680
rather than the release is more
or less the end of the game.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.780
For us, it's only the beginning.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.850
And the major change
that it brought

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.010
is that, if this market used
to be ruled by companies

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:39.000
like Sega that had the ability
to be a worldwide distributor

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.310
because they had
the relationship

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.130
and they had the
money, here in the room

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.060
there might be a developer that
is sitting with a Unity license

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.850
or without a Unity license,
and he can publish a game

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.760
and be all over the world
tomorrow morning and by chance

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.270
to be the next big thing.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.426
So for me, this
is the big thing.

00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:02.050
CHRIS SOUTHALL: Yeah, it's been
disruptive for the old fossils,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.442
I think, slightly.

00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:05.650
DAN GALPIN: So one thing
is, you touched on something

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.450
that I thought was
kind of interesting.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.480
So I want to kind of
poll the room here.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.770
So how many people,
first of all,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.070
do soft launches
of their titles?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.620
Just kind of by--
Do soft launches?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.310
And how many people
have actually

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.200
used an alpha or beta
launch within Google Play?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.389
OK, not as many.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.430
I'm just kind of curious.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.888
It's one of the things that I
was really excited about last

00:10:26.888 --> 00:10:30.340
year, was that we added the
ability to actually create

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.390
a community, either a G+
community or a Google group,

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.612
and do a soft launch
to that group.

00:10:35.612 --> 00:10:37.570
And it's kind of useful
for testing internally,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.820
so I was just sort of curious.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.760
But I think that's
actually a huge change.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.980
It's actually funny, I
think it was in 2007 at GDC

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.620
that Microsoft announced they
were actually using analytics

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.350
to generate heat
maps for where people

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.900
died in various
levels of Halo 3.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.570
And that was like, woah.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.630
And now I think if
you released a title

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.700
without having analytics, and
without knowing where people

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.020
were dying and getting
stuck and frustrated,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.470
you'd look like
you wouldn't know

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.761
what you're doing in some ways.

00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:07.271
And so I think we've changed
our relationship to big data

00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:07.770
has changed.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.686
DORON KAGAN: No, I think
you're totally right.

00:11:09.686 --> 00:11:12.950
And I just want to add
this point, the ability

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.200
to change the game
while it's running,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.420
and to meet the next user that
will download it with a better

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.770
product than the previous
user that downloaded,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.840
this is a critical thing.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.420
And what Google
done, and I think

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.280
they failed to
communicate it, the AB

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.720
testing that Google released--
that I found out just

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.850
by mistake, I think
eight months ago

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.430
or something-- is
an amazing tool.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.720
It allows us-- and we
do it for every release

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.760
that we do-- if we do an update
to an existing game or existing

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.790
app, we first release it to
50%, a specific audience.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.350
And then we see how
they react and we

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.700
decide if to release
the additional 50%,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.750
or to wait with the 50% to
send another update because it

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.680
didn't work as good as
we thought, or maybe

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.949
a technical problem with
some devices, et cetera.

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:01.490
DAN GALPIN: One of the things
that I was really excited about

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.070
last week-- which we aren't
going to cover here today--

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.720
but we actually announced it and
launched it at GDC last week,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.190
was we actually did launch
Google Tag Manager for mobile.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.390
So if you want to
go beyond AB testing

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.140
and actually run
experiments in your game,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.300
you can actually
use Google Analytics

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.677
to help segment your
user base and actually

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.260
deliver things like
different strings.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.718
And that can actually be used
to change game play behavior,

00:12:23.718 --> 00:12:25.630
and you can actually
set up like a result.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.852
Like what do I actually
want to see as the result,

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.560
and then have it
optimize for that result

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.010
automatically and
start delivering

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.210
that content automatically.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.690
So it's really cool.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.830
I'm super excited about it.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.140
It's worth checking out.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.870
Had to put a plug-in there
just because AB testing means

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.110
a lot to me, and I
actually-- one of the things

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.609
I've been telling
our team is I want

00:12:42.609 --> 00:12:44.194
to be able to AB
test everything.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:45.610
Everything within
Play, everything

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.590
with-- because you
just need to know.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.140
I want to know what works.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.007
We haven't talked
yet, Andy, so I

00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:54.590
wanted you get you
get a word on this.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.673
ANDY PAYNE: I'd like that.

00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:57.430
I'd like you to be on the panel.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.300
I think you're much
better than we are.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.800
One of things that
concerns me-- so we

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.930
have two parts to our business.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.940
One is the mobile part,
which is really interesting.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.100
And I don't think I've learned
quite so much in the last three

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.550
years, as I've ever learned.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.050
Difficult years,
knowing what you're

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.400
learning to be useful
in a space of time,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.580
what you're learning
to be utter crap.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.390
And it's not always obvious.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.430
We spent 1.5 million
pounds of our own money

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.350
back in about seven or eight
years ago in the Java days,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.100
and we shut that
business down about three

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.440
weeks before the App
store was launched.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.060
That was a salutary
lesson in doing things

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.080
the old-fashioned way,
which is put some money,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.040
make great games, and
it's all going to be easy.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.610
The other part of
our business-- we

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.400
work on PC-- we work
principally with Steam,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.450
and what we're seeing there
is a very interesting dynamic

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.270
within early access.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.110
And that's really
changed the game as well.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.610
And one of the
things I think I'm

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.050
going to hate about making
games-- I actually don't like

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.880
the word hate,
it's quite strong--

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.370
and I don't hate much about
making games right now.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.870
One of things that
concerns me is we've

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.630
moved from console/PC,
two years in the studio,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.664
hitting the crunch,
getting pissed off

00:14:15.664 --> 00:14:18.080
with what you're doing and
seeing that it never turned out

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.420
like you thought it was gonna
do-- you know that thing--

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.900
to the power of 200 people,
which could be quite

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.390
destructive, into we're all
the service, we're on all time,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.750
it's all fantastic.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.230
And you find that you're making
the equivalent of Kylie Minogue

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.100
records-- whatever
the public wants,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.350
you're going to give them.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.870
That for me as a creative
would be disturbing.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.559
And I'm not sure I particularly
like the prospect of that.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:42.100
But if it turns you
on because you're

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.667
gonna make a ton of
money, you could probably

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:46.250
deal with that side
of it and say hey,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.040
you know what, that's
great because it's

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.890
really creative
making all that money.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.960
But I just wonder how much
of the creative process

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.120
we are then putting
out to the crowd.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.210
And that might well
be a good thing.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.137
I don't believe in the old--

00:15:01.137 --> 00:15:03.470
DAN GALPIN: And that leads
me to my next question, which

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.790
was what do you hate
about free-to-play?

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.880
ANDY PAYNE: Yeah, well.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.280
CHRIS SOUTHALL: Do you not think
that's two extremes though?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.320
Because actually there's
such a wide audience,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.330
you can make quite a cool
game and have a big audience.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.404
So I don't think you're throwing
away any sort of moral fiber.

00:15:16.404 --> 00:15:17.195
ANDY PAYNE: No, no.

00:15:17.195 --> 00:15:19.910
I'm trying to paint the sort
of two extremes, the fascists

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.337
and the communists.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.920
They go around the back through
Alaska or somewhere, you know?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.650
SAAD CHOUDRI: Well
I was going to say,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.780
when I was thinking
about the question

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.820
and how to answer
it because firstly,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.390
we all love making games.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.665
That's why we're here,
that's why we're doing this.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.290
One of those points
I was going to make

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.950
is monetization, which is funny
because that's principally

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.670
what I'm responsible for.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.840
So it's the thing that I
should love the most, and I do.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.100
But to Andy's point,
yeah, you could

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.159
talk about the ethics and
the morals of free-to-play.

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:50.200
And it is something that
I think, as an industry,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.116
we're struggling with.

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.850
Because essentially,
there are a few ways

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.510
that we have figured
out in the market

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.060
and as an industry that works.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.330
And a lot of us are
all using those,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.090
without any
creativity or thought

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.290
in the type of
monetization loop.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.310
We're all got the game
loops, I think, down.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.060
I think it's the
monetization loops.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.080
The fact that we talk
about monetization

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.830
in the terms of
friction and pain

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.660
points-- that not good kind
of verbiage to use anyway--

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.620
but it kind of is
indicative of the issues

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.476
we have around monetization
as an industry.

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:22.850
Free-to-play, we're still
figuring it out as an industry,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.350
I think.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.250
And I think until we've
actually found a way where we're

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.260
comfortable both ethnically,
from a business perspective,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.870
in mitigating the risk
in trying to release some

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.630
of these titles, I
think we are going

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.080
to struggle with
this for a while.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.250
And I think ultimately,
it's free to play.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.240
Like Chris' team, and I came
from the console space as well.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.630
We used to work
together in days past.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.830
There was something
kind of honorable

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.250
about spending $10 million and
then trying to release a game

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.474
and recouping that from
what the users liked.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.640
But I mean, there was also
a little bit dishonorable

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.390
because we would spend
a lot on marketing,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.600
and we're hyping the game and
then people would spend $60

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.574
and then not enjoy it.

00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:06.990
ANDY PAYNE: Or big
companies would

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.470
hijack the space in Walmart, and
that would it for the consumers

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.540
so I think where we are now
is a million times better

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.589
from where we've been--

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.520
SAAD CHOUDRI: But
that's what I'm saying--

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.630
ANDY PAYNE: But we're
figuring stuff out.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.920
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah, as we
evolve and as we figure out

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.670
the correct model
for our consumer.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.140
Because the other thing as
well is this analytics focus

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.140
is crucial.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.829
We none of us
disagree with that.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.590
But to try and extract
dollars from those users

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.482
without presenting
fair enough value,

00:17:32.482 --> 00:17:33.940
it can't just be
a compulsion loop,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.355
it's got to be a fun loop.

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:37.980
DORON KAGAN: Yeah, but there is
another aspect to the analytics

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.479
side.

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:40.140
I totally agree on
the monetization,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.350
I should like it also.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.970
This is the dirty part of work.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.480
But there is another aspect,
even deeper than that

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.190
and that's the analytics.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.520
Our job is to analyze
the behavior of the user,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.550
and if we do it
well, we know how

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.940
to tweak it towards
the monetization.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.340
Now, the border of how
much you track the user

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.960
is becoming vaguer and vaguer.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.200
We are getting
companies that starting

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.510
by offering us to put
their SDK and know

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.440
every other app that the
user have on his device.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.800
Other than that, when he's
waking up and starting

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.200
to activate the device,
what are we doing, actually?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.330
We are preparing the
future into a world--

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.930
I'm sorry for being
apocalyptic-- into a world

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.260
that we track everything
a person will do.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.590
And how do it?

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.440
We use games.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.540
It's OK when the
NSA is doing it.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.145
They are spies, they are evil,
they are listening to us.

00:18:38.145 --> 00:18:39.220
Have a nice day, NSA.

00:18:41.652 --> 00:18:42.360
But we're doing--

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.443
DAN GALPIN: Just kidding,
you're not evil, really.

00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:46.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.310
SAAD CHOUDRI: But it is to
Andy's point about creativity,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.810
right?

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.351
If we are analyzing
the user and just

00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:53.750
giving them what they
want, which there

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.900
is some benefit to that.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.660
And I would agree that we
should be looking towards that

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.565
and trying to cater
towards the users.

00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:04.350
You know, innovation in
our space is lacking.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.100
We are struggling to find games
which effectively monetize

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.250
in the free-to-play model.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.340
And if we continue
to use analytics

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.180
to the extensive degree
that we are currently

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.060
using as an industry, we
won't be future looking.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.710
We will always be
looking behind us.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.469
And innovation and iterative
design can work hand in hand.

00:19:27.469 --> 00:19:29.010
I just think some
companies will have

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.460
to start taking a
little bit more risks.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.600
At Miniclip, we've
got 900 plus web games

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.532
that we can still bring over.

00:19:35.532 --> 00:19:37.490
So we've got a lot of
innovation still to make.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.020
But for other companies
from the console space,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.900
I do appreciate that it's going
to be a bit more difficult.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.220
DORON KAGAN: But
this is the beauty.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.302
It doesn't have to be
a big Miniclip company.

00:19:44.302 --> 00:19:45.510
SAAD CHOUDRI: No, it doesn't.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.050
DORON KAGAN: Could
be "Flappy Bird"

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.550
coming out of
nowhere, a developer--

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.710
SAAD CHOUDRI: It proves
that anything I say today

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.420
is meaningless.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.000
DORON KAGAN: Exactly.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.270
SAAD CHOUDRI: Don't
listen to anything I say.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.260
DORON KAGAN: No,
nobody knows anything.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.132
Ubisoft and this guy
are basically the same.

00:19:57.132 --> 00:19:58.590
They have the same
standing chance.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.060
And he won, the company
that's worth billions, so--

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.900
SAAD CHOUDRI: I think
no-- that's just not

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.960
going to be sustainable
model for our companies.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.890
We do have to try
and mitigate risk,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:14.040
and we do have to try and make
it a little bit more stable.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.220
Because otherwise, we
won't have companies

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.750
who will create the next
"Call of Duty" on mobile,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.960
or the next FIFA on mobile.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.710
For all the sins--

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.160
ANDY PAYNE: Well the next
"Call of Duty" on mobile's

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.790
been shut down.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.800
SAAD CHOUDRI: Oh yeah.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.010
ANDY PAYNE: It shut
down the blast furnace

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.320
because they couldn't make any
money out of it, apparently.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.480
SAAD CHOUDRI: Well, not the
next in the actual franchise,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.160
but the next title.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.493
ANDY PAYNE: It says quite a lot.

00:20:33.493 --> 00:20:36.380
It's the brutality of
the world that we're in.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.088
DAN GALPIN: I think
the interesting thing

00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:40.710
is if you look at
mobile gaming today,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.710
one thing still holds true which
is the games that are making

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.960
the most money have
the most engagement.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.250
Which makes me think
that at some level

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.410
they're the most engaging.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.250
And maybe that's
not entirely true,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.730
but it still means
that we're still

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.560
optimizing around
making games engaging

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.730
rather than truly
just optimizing

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.180
around monetization in fact.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.888
ANDY PAYNE: I just
want to be very clear.

00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:06.800
I really, really
like free-to-play.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.250
Let's not get that
any other way, OK?

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.860
I'm pretty clear about that.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.590
And most of the, if not
all, of the mobile games

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.470
that we've made will
be free-to-play.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.460
But, I was with a really
talented games developer,

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.340
designer, last week who's made
the most awesome game I've

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.450
seen on mobile.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.800
And the subject matter
particularly appeals to me.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.530
It's very, very humorous, but
is not a free-to-play game.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.199
He hasn't designed it that way.

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:34.740
He's built it, and he's likely
not interested in free-to-play

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.890
because he doesn't understand
it and he's a games designer.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.760
That's a concern,
because it's like,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.970
well where is that
game gonna go?

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.350
If that doesn't get featured
by the platforms heavily,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.700
it could just disappear nowhere.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.116
And that is one
hell of a designer

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:51.158
who's got a track record.

00:21:51.158 --> 00:21:52.990
DORON KAGAN: Even feature
will not help now.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.870
ANDY PAYNE: No, no.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:54.510
CHRIS SOUTHALL:
That's a good point,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.930
because what you were
talking about earlier.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.620
Actually, there's
a lot of machinery

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.220
that needs to be in place
now to do all of this stuff.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.520
And with the best
[INAUDIBLE] in the world

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.920
even using these great tools,
you need a lot of know-how

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.870
and you need a few pieces
there to actually make

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.000
free-to-play games work.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.950
And that's almost getting
back to that problem

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.800
where your "Flappy
Bird"-- right, OK, I'll

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.508
take that as a kind
of bolt of lightning.

00:22:14.508 --> 00:22:18.070
But the smaller indies, it's
more and more hard and more

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.362
and more brutal in the market.

00:22:19.362 --> 00:22:20.820
ANDY PAYNE: "Tearaway"
for example,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.028
if anyone's played that game.

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:23.660
It's a lovely game.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.470
Does that exist in the world
of mobile as a paid for game?

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.620
I don't know, it's a
question out there really.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.179
But without Sony, that game
wouldn't have been made.

00:22:34.179 --> 00:22:35.220
DAN GALPIN: Sorry, go on.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.678
SAAD CHOUDRI: No, but to the
point about the game developer

00:22:37.678 --> 00:22:39.040
you saw.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.310
I mean, it's not really changed.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.670
It's the same with when we
met a game designer back

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.032
in the publishing days.

00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:46.490
He might have
created a great game,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.580
but if it didn't fit within
the portfolio of the publishers

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.590
it wouldn't have
come out either.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.250
ANDY PAYNE: That is true.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.750
SAAD CHOUDRI: At
least this way he's

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.722
got a chance to put it
on the market somewhere.

00:22:53.722 --> 00:22:54.930
ANDY PAYNE: Well, he will do.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.470
SAAD CHOUDRI: Exactly.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.870
ANDY PAYNE: He'll publish it.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.031
Yeah.

00:22:57.031 --> 00:22:58.085
DORON KAGAN: In paid?

00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:58.640
As paid?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.925
ANDY PAYNE: Yeah, as paid, yeah.

00:23:00.925 --> 00:23:02.800
Even though I say we
don't do any paid games.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.299
DORON KAGAN: It's
very brave of you.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:07.540
ANDY PAYNE: Well, sometimes
you gotta be brave.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.682
DAN GALPIN: That brings
me to another question.

00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:13.440
In mobile right now we really
see a fairly strong divide.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.480
We see games that
are ad supported.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.427
We see games that are paymium,
where you buy the game

00:23:19.427 --> 00:23:21.010
and then you can buy
in-app purchases.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.176
We see games that are
supported by in-app purchases.

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:25.260
And we see games that
are actually premium.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.360
What business
models are missing?

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.735
Is there something else that
we should be thinking about?

00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:32.860
SAAD CHOUDRI: Subscription.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.390
DAN GALPIN: And subscription,
of course, is actually--

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.806
DORON KAGAN: It's
very convenient,

00:23:35.806 --> 00:23:37.030
but nobody will go for it.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.140
SAAD CHOUDRI: Why not? "World
of Warcraft" did it for a while.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.431
DORON KAGAN: Yeah, for a while.

00:23:40.431 --> 00:23:41.790
But the world is changing.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.600
SAAD CHOUDRI: The
world is changing.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.433
CHRIS SOUTHALL: I think
if you skew younger,

00:23:44.433 --> 00:23:46.520
then subscription is much
more meaningful as well.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520
DORON KAGAN: I disagree.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.000
I think that people are
not willing to obligate

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.720
for long term.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.920
SAAD CHOUDRI: I agree, but what
I'm saying is that there is,

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.680
potentially, there is
a space for somebody

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.480
to fill that, possibly.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.980
So when you talk
about subscription,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.080
are you talking about a
subscription game service

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.690
where someone could select
from a hundred different games,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.280
and it was aggregated
down into developers

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.451
and they ended up getting
paid for the engagement

00:24:10.451 --> 00:24:11.450
that people are getting?

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.324
DORON KAGAN: But why?

00:24:12.324 --> 00:24:14.000
There is free
subscription today.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.550
Google Play is a free
subscription service.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.950
You go in, they feature,
they choose the list of games

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.000
that they think are good games.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.240
It's free subscription.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.280
So why would anybody pay
for any game service that

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.920
would limit him to 100
games or 1,000 games?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.055
SAAD CHOUDRI: I was talking
more of the kind of MMO

00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:33.604
or young children's
type platform.

00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:34.520
DORON KAGAN: One game.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.260
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.350
ANDY PAYNE: So one of
the questions I had is,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.440
what are the
challenges when trying

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.310
to make games for young
children with free-to-play,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.040
and with this new model?

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.580
One of the traditional markets
for games have been children.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.760
That's how I started playing
games when I was very young.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.259
And how do we deal with that?

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:57.925
One of the things
that's been brought up

00:24:57.925 --> 00:25:00.862
is subscriptions around
that, but talk about it.

00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:02.320
I think it's one
of the challenges.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.630
SAAD CHOUDRI:
Payment is difficult.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.330
Again, the ethics
of free-to-play,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.820
how to present in-app
purchases to that audience.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.510
You've got to be
very conscious of it.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.480
We've been COPPA
compliant since we started

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.210
and it's crucial for
us to maintain that.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:26.010
And also, it's a hard
audience to the service

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.177
now because there's so many
apps out there for free.

00:25:28.177 --> 00:25:29.593
CHRIS SOUTHALL:
And that's why you

00:25:29.593 --> 00:25:32.050
start talking about subscription
and you go back to paid.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.280
Especially if you go much
younger than sort of 15,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.170
in reality.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.785
Is it's an open
question, I think.

00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:40.160
ANDY PAYNE: It
feels like there's

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.040
a paid app market
for children's games.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.650
[INAUDIBLE] make brilliant
apps and they charge for them,

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.040
at the moment.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.360
I don't have any kids,
but I'm sure there's

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.590
plenty of parents-- who
are parents in the room?

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.120
So at least half.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.870
What would you do?

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.090
Would you give your
child just free reign

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.762
to download what they want
or do you want to pay?

00:26:04.762 --> 00:26:05.720
Well what would you do?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.560
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.684
Out there, just as a show
of hands, how many people

00:26:08.684 --> 00:26:10.920
would actually get a
subscription for their kids

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.566
if they knew that it was comped
and it was free and clear

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:14.940
and they just paid
a monthly fee?

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.091
Just who would actually do it?

00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:18.590
All right.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.870
SAAD CHOUDRI: There you are.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.286
So you answered
your own question.

00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:21.502
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:21.502 --> 00:26:22.585
DORON KAGAN: I'm learning.

00:26:22.585 --> 00:26:24.530
Why do you think I came here?

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.880
DAN GALPIN: So we have only
a short period of time left.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.379
So I wanted to kind
of give everyone

00:26:28.379 --> 00:26:29.930
a chance to kind
of make a closing

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.150
statement around what
we've talked about.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.290
I know we didn't
get to everything.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.440
I think we could have done a
two hour panel, personally.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.773
I didn't want to bore everyone
in the audience to death,

00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:38.330
but I certainly enjoyed this.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:43.550
So closing statement about what
do you think is the best thing

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.980
about mobile?

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.080
Let's close with a positive.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.850
What's the best thing
about mobile gaming

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.340
and what it's done
to the industry?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.560
SAAD CHOUDRI: Democratization,
and portability,

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.456
and one device in my pocket.

00:27:00.456 --> 00:27:02.330
CHRIS SOUTHALL: Yeah,
I think is a good thing

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.140
to have broadened the appeal
and the availability of games

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.090
to a broader audience.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.070
I also find it a lot
easier to work pretty much

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.510
anywhere because I'm
doing mobile games.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.551
Which is a curse as well.

00:27:12.551 --> 00:27:15.310
So I can pretty much be
testing or playing with things

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.660
at any time of the day and
night, which is different.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.550
DAN GALPIN: So true.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.520
DORON KAGAN: I agree.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.840
One is the ability
of every developer

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.810
to compete with the EAs and
the Ubisoft of a few years

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.710
ago that nobody had the
chance to dream about it.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.470
If you would dream
about it, you would

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.450
wake up and replace yourself.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:41.600
The second thing is the
fact that in the Java days,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.030
we were looking at the
target audience of 4%,

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.810
of the people that had mobile
phones that are playing games.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.889
And we were struggling
to get to five.

00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:52.430
And now we're looking
at the audience

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.660
of what 90 whatever percent.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.480
Everybody are
playing games, so we

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.915
are living in a great
time in a grand industry.

00:27:59.915 --> 00:28:00.532
So just good.

00:28:00.532 --> 00:28:01.990
ANDY PAYNE: I 100%
agree with that.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.850
I think the for me it's
the low barriers to entry.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.600
Which means that we'll talk
about-- in a panel here,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.219
we'll talk about
children's games

00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:13.010
and the panel will have
seven or eight year

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.589
olds making those
games for their mates.

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:17.380
And how they sell them,
and how they do it,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.502
that's going to happen
within a matter of years.

00:28:19.502 --> 00:28:20.460
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.709
ANDY PAYNE: And I think that
the low barriers to entry

00:28:22.709 --> 00:28:24.092
do drive the innovation.

00:28:24.092 --> 00:28:25.550
And despite what
I've said, I think

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.040
that there's never been
more original content being

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.461
made across all devices.

00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:30.960
And the whole world
now plays games,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.730
which they've always done.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.355
Because we always
played games as kids,

00:28:33.355 --> 00:28:35.210
not video games,
but other games.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.700
So it's a great time.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.010
And it's interesting
that Google yourself

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.944
refers to the great
thing about mobile.

00:28:42.944 --> 00:28:45.610
I think there's some pretty good
stuff going on with PC as well,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.580
obviously.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.560
And there's a number PC
developers in the room

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.930
and I don't think
those two areas are.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.605
Exclusive

00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:53.980
DAN GALPIN: Not at all, and
I actually-- this is just me,

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.990
coming from my
background is in mobile,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.140
so you're seeing my bias.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.810
ANDY PAYNE: No, a bit
from the perspective

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.800
of the truly great companies--
outside of Google, which

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800
is a great company-- what
Valve are doing is awesome,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.700
what Oculus is doing is awesome.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.290
And this is the
best time ever to be

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.400
a games maker, and
probably a player.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.980
So great, it's all bring it on.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.280
DORON KAGAN: It's a
great time to live.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.718
ANDY PAYNE: I love this man.

00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:21.122
I love this man.

00:29:21.122 --> 00:29:23.580
DAN GALPIN: I'd like to thank
the whole panel for coming up

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:23.960
here.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.459
It's always challenging to go
in front of a room, especially

00:29:26.459 --> 00:29:29.150
a room this intimate
like this and just talk.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.510
So I really appreciate
all of what you brought,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.890
and so everyone give
them a round of applause.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.750
And we're going to move on to
our next session and I don't

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.882
think, do we actually have
time for any questions?
