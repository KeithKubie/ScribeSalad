00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:29.079
In the Western world (and generally speaking)
before imperial Rome, girls were deemed sufficiently

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.800
mature for marriage and sex when they first
started menstruation (and boys, by the way,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.600
when they developed pubic hair).

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.010
Marriage was relatively unregulated by the
state then, and instead was seen as a private

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.479
family matter, so it is presumed these boundaries
were flexible.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.469
The Roman emperors began to take matters in
hand beginning with Caesar Augustus’ marriage

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.460
laws (18 BC and 9 AD):

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.870
He ordered that no betrothal should be valid
if the man did not marry within two years

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.329
of such betrothal . . . [and] that the girl
must in every case be at least ten years old

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
at her betrothal . . . . girls are held to
have reached the marriageable age on the completion

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.970
of twelve full years.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.620
By the end of the empire, the age of consent
for girls had been well settled, as the “official”

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.750
age of reaching puberty was set at 12.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.750
Medieval Marriage

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.600
The Catholic Church had rules for just about
everything during the Middle Ages, and one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.750
of its most authoritative texts was the Decretum
Gratiani.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.180
Written by the jurist Johannes Gratian in
the 12th century, it set a minimum age for

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.140
betrothal (not necessarily marriage) at seven
years for boys and girls, and the lawful age

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.679
for a woman to consent to marriage (and “carnal
intercourse”) at twelve, although certain

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.929
unusual circumstances would render marriages
at younger ages valid, as well.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.030
Gratian was followed by others including Hostiensis
(Henricus de Seguisio) who opined that a young

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.119
woman’s physical development, not her age,
should determine whether she was ready for

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.580
marriage.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.679
Recent scholarship indicates that although
medieval marriages could occur at ages as

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.800
young as 12, that might not have been the
norm:

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.110
While marriages at very young ages could and
sometimes did take place, particularly for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.580
girls of high social status, it would be a
mistake to see marriage below or around the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.870
age of puberty as the norm even for young
noblewomen.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.450
. . . Emerging evidence is eroding the stereotype
. . . [with] work on low- and lower-middle-status

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.480
women [showing that] . . . a large proportion
of the sample married between the ages of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.830
eighteen and twenty-two, [and] . . . showing
that urban girls [in Yorkshire] tended to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.570
marry in their early to mid-twenties and rural
girls . . . in their late teens to early twenties.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.350
Marriage in Early America

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.800
A study performed by the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) on marriage in North

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.670
America and Western Europe mirrors the findings
of the Yorkshire researchers; the NBER found

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.300
that young women from the 17th through 19th
centuries were not all that young when they

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.300
got married.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.750
For example, in Massachusetts records dating
from 1652 to 1800 demonstrate that the mean

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.010
age of first marriage for ladies was between
19.5 and 22.5 years, and records for other

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.850
colonies reflect similar ages.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.459
In fact, the average age of first marriage
for all of the colonies studied was 19.8 before

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.990
1700, 21.2 during the early 18th century,
and 22.7 during the late 18th century.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.550
This is consistent with data gathered in England,
France and Germany that puts the average mean

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.349
age of first marriage for women at 25.1 from
1750-1799 and 25.7 from 1800-1849.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.410
Marriage Post Civil War

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.700
Maintaining the trend, by the end of the 19th
century, the median age when women were first

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.030
getting married was between 22 and 24 years
old, and this tendency continued into the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.030
1940s.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.140
In fact, the lowest median age of first marriage
since the early 1700s was had by the baby

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.160
boom generation, where the age dropped to
20.5 years in 1950.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.960
Marriage Age Today

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:18.910
As of 2010, the median age of first marriage
for women was 26.1 (28.2 for men), although

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.310
research demonstrates that “marriage is
most often delayed rather than foregone,”

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.970
and although they may wait awhile, “more
than 90 percent of women will eventually marry.”

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:51.870
Researchers note that the median age in 2010
was 3.4 years higher than in 1900, and opine

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:14.130
that this “likely reflects the change in
women’s status 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:30.130
in society – as women are pursing education
and careers before marriage . . . they are

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:46.460
increasingly delaying the age at which they
marry.”
