00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.438
- And that's why
you should never

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:08.541
stick your hand inside a whale.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.543
(bell rings)

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.445
Before you leave,
I just wanna say

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.515
that one of you is flunking
the class this semester.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.883
(student laughs)

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:19.419
Steve, in the interest
of privacy, it's you.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.787
Wait, I meant to say, in
the interest of privacy,

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.923
I can't tell you who it is.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.692
- I can't flunk this class,
my parents will ground me.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.361
- Listen I do have a solution.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.063
It sounds a little crazy.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.197
- Crazy's good.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.533 align:start size:88% position:13%
I sometimes pour
yogurt on my dog's ass.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.737
- Why don't you try studying?

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.739
- Hm, studying.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.073
Schoolwork.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.742
Work hard, grades go up,

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.944
feel better about myself.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.245
No.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.913
- Well I do have
another solution,

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:50.983
but it involves doing
a couple of favors.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:52.419
- I love doing favors.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.753
I'm a favor guy.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.889
You know, party favors,

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.258
I can come to your house
and do a personal favor.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.292
(teacher laughs)

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.095
- Hoo, favors. (laughs)

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.764
Off with you, favors.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.500
Favors!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.334
Favors!

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.337
- What're you doing?

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.505
- Uh, nothing.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.007
Dismissed.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.009
- I'm stuck.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.245
- I'm Professor Rich,
expert in science.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.515
These are my devoted students.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
Together, with the
aid of harmless drugs,

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:29.455 align:start size:97% position:3%
we explore science's greatest
hypothetical questions.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.459
(cheesy '80s music)

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.670
There are many things

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.873 align:start size:88% position:13%
that change the
chemicals in your brain.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.840
Yes?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.809
- Once I ate a snowflake.

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:51.678
- And?

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.681
- There has to be an and?

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.953
- The bottom line is,

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.491
that there are many foods that
affect our brain, like this.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.225
Thank you Steve.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:09.162 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Let's apply this thought
to our hypothetical.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.331
What if milk got you high?

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.566
- Oh.
- Yes.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:16.902
No.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.337
- Milk contains tryptophan,

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.507 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
an amino acid that
actually makes us sleepy.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.508
- Awesome.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.711 align:start size:88% position:13%
Give Mike a plus please.
- Yes!

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.978
- Wait a second.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
Why is Steve doing all
this stuff for you?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.183 align:start size:94% position:6%
Did you catch him
masturbating or something?

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:34.020
- Steve is a little bit
slow and lazy, okay?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.855 align:start size:84% position:16%
So he's my new
teacher's assistant.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.189
Introduce yourself.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.192
- Hey assholes, it's me.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.028
Don't mess around with
me or I'll sit on you.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:45.164 align:start size:84% position:16%
(students snickering)
It's not funny!

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.599
- I don't feel high yet.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.433
- No!

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
After popping a
ladle full of Xanax,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.908 align:start position:0%
I decided to speak to an
expert who took milk seriously,

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.577
and, wore a hairnet.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.013
So this is where
the milk is made.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:02.548 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
- Correct.
- Okay.

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:05.685
And so, I'm reading this,
it says raw milk supply.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.754
I'm assuming this is where
the raw milk supply comes in?

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.022
- Yes.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.625
- How does milk make us
feel when we drink it?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.062 align:start size:94% position:6%
Could it make you actually
high or intoxicated?

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.296
- I don't think it can

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.564
necessarily make you
high or intoxicated,

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.232
unless maybe it's um,

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.934 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
been out in a
field, or something,

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.436 line:0%
underneath the sun, or
something like that.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.804 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
There might be a
post-chemical reaction

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.071 line:0%
to the body that way.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.807
- What about him,
does he work here?

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.641
- Um.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:34.112 align:start size:97% position:3%
Shoot, what is he still,
what're you still doing here?

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:35.647
- Class, it's experiment time,

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.917
and I've got glasses of
milk for each of you.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.253
Please pick one up.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.087
And drink.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.890
There you go.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.294
Got a little on you, chin.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.063
What do you think?
- Tastes like rum.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:55.068
- Well that's because it
is dark Cuban rum, yes.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.503
The simulation worked.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.272
Not only was I wasted,
but addicted as well.

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.475
I needed to get help.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:06.011
What is it that makes something
more addictive than another?

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.780 line:0%
- It's a combination of things.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.449 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
So one is just the
rewarding properties of it,

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.151
just how it makes people feel.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
If someone does
something with friends,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.689 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it's related to hanging
out with those friends,

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.490
they're more likely
to keep doing it.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.626
- What about milk for example?

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:23.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
Does that give you
some kind of euphoria?

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:26.665
- Uh, sugar can activate the
reward centers of the brain,

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:29.602
but I don't know if milk can.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.938 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You've been kind of
skirting around the issue.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.507
I'm gonna ask you definitively.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.176 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay.
- Does milk get you high?

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:41.147 align:start position:0%
- No, people have been drinking
milk for a very long time.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:44.651
We have a lot of data, both
anecdotal and scientific,

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.821 align:start size:97% position:3%
that shows that milk
definitely does not have any

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.724 align:start size:81% position:19%
mind-altering or,
(lullaby)

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.326
rewarding, effects.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.366 line:0%
- So then I wound up
eating stale Chik-fil-A

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.903
out of a dumpster
with no pants on.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.738
- Wow, milk's cool.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:07.073
- No, it is not.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.342
Milk should be regulated.

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:11.911
Like cars or businesses,

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:16.549
or those weird pedicure places
where the fish eat your feet.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.518
- Regulations, exactly.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.424
Steve!

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.260
Dance.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.029
(students laugh)

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.601
- Stop, stop!

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.736
Shut up!

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:37.904
Stop, shut up!

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.872
Steve?

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:43.576
Why are you demeaning
yourself like this?

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Because I'm
failing this class,

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.379
I have no other choice.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.514
- This is a self-grading class.

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:52.185
We're all getting A pluses, man.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.722
- Is that true?

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.792 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well I may have
forgotten to mention it.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.060
- No, I remember.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.128
You specifically told
us not to tell Steve--

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:04.564
- Hey look, a rat.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.244
Is he even being honest?

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:19.579
- [Milk Expert] It's
time to go, come on.
