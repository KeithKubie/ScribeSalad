we call college success and the way we
develop those standards is we took the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
develop those standards is we took the
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.600
develop those standards is we took the
AAU which are as as you know our our

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610
AAU which are as as you know our our
 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.580
AAU which are as as you know our our
research at colleges and universities we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
research at colleges and universities we
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.260
research at colleges and universities we
took those standards that they spent

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
took those standards that they spent
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.110
took those standards that they spent
four years developing and use those as

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
four years developing and use those as
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.509
four years developing and use those as
our and those were standards set for

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519
our and those were standards set for
 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.280
our and those were standards set for
what does a kid need to know our student

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
what does a kid need to know our student
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990
what does a kid need to know our student
need to know to go to college and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
need to know to go to college and
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.869
need to know to go to college and
succeed and we took those from the 12th

succeed and we took those from the 12th
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.549
succeed and we took those from the 12th
grade and took them down to the 6th

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
grade and took them down to the 6th
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.280
grade and took them down to the 6th
grade in math and English in which we

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290
grade in math and English in which we
 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.140
grade in math and English in which we
said if this is what you need to know at

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150
said if this is what you need to know at
 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.579

the way up and we've we've built not

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
the way up and we've we've built not
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.780
the way up and we've we've built not
only have we built the standards but we

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
only have we built the standards but we
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.570
only have we built the standards but we
also have the programs the curriculum

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580
also have the programs the curriculum
 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.840
also have the programs the curriculum
that allows kids to take what what would

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
that allows kids to take what what would
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060
that allows kids to take what what would
prepare them for those year-to-year

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
prepare them for those year-to-year
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.090
prepare them for those year-to-year
standards and we call that program

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
standards and we call that program
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.550
standards and we call that program
springboard and and that program we've

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
springboard and and that program we've
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960
springboard and and that program we've
spent the last three or four years

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
spent the last three or four years
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.139
spent the last three or four years
developing and it it also feeds very

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149
developing and it it also feeds very
 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.660
developing and it it also feeds very
much into the AP program which as you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
much into the AP program which as you
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.050
much into the AP program which as you
know is a college-level course taught in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
know is a college-level course taught in
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359
know is a college-level course taught in
high school is we have 37 of those

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
high school is we have 37 of those
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.569
high school is we have 37 of those
courses they are recognized by colleges

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
courses they are recognized by colleges
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.190
courses they are recognized by colleges
and university across the country and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
and university across the country and
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.779
and university across the country and
you're given credit for taking those

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789
you're given credit for taking those
 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.240
you're given credit for taking those
high school courses based upon their

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
high school courses based upon their
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.999
high school courses based upon their
graded and 125 and if you have a 345 you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
graded and 125 and if you have a 345 you
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980
graded and 125 and if you have a 345 you
get credit in college so we've really

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
get credit in college so we've really
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.889
get credit in college so we've really
developed those those standards looking

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
developed those those standards looking
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499
developed those those standards looking
at what the AAU standards were and what

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
at what the AAU standards were and what
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270
at what the AAU standards were and what
we believe a student needs to know to be

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
we believe a student needs to know to be
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160
we believe a student needs to know to be
successful to go to college I think

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
successful to go to college I think
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289
successful to go to college I think
standards is really a belief in in

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
standards is really a belief in in
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.469
standards is really a belief in in
people believe it believe that all of us

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
people believe it believe that all of us
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870
people believe it believe that all of us
have a lot much more capacity and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
have a lot much more capacity and
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.599
have a lot much more capacity and
capability than we know and it takes a

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609
capability than we know and it takes a
 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.039
capability than we know and it takes a
good teacher to bring that out I think

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
good teacher to bring that out I think
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.609
