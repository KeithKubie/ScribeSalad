[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.720
SUSAN LLEWELYN: I'm delighted
to be here today, and thank you

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.380
so much for coming.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.880
It's a great
audience, and I hope

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.940
I'll introduce you to a subject
that I've been interested

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.780
in for most of my adult life
and have tried to distill

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.419
into this little book.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.960
I've got a co-author
who was actually

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680
a student of mine, Katie van
Doorn, who works in the US.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.920
And so we tried to make sure
that the book wasn't just

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.150
a UK-based book.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.710
She's brought in some ideas.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.740
And she's also Dutch, so we've
got the European and the US

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.690
perspective.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.220
So she works in the
US at the moment.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.640
So I'm going to try and
just briefly introduce you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
to this area.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.310
It covers a range
of specialities,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.220
but I'm going to tend to speak
from my own experience, which

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.290
is inevitable.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.140
I worked as a
clinical psychologist,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.800
originally training just
to work in clinical work.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.420
But in later years,
I found myself

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.280
being more interested
in research

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.870
and then eventually in
teaching and training.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.690
So the last 20 years has been
running the doctoral training

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.350
course in Oxford to train
new clinical psychologists.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.550
And as such, I had to have an
overview of the whole subject

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.130
and hopefully was therefore
in a good position

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.350
to write this very
short introduction.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.480
As you know, 35,000
words-- and I

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.940
worked in the area
for about 40 years.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.260
So about 1,000 words per year
of my life went into this book,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.480
and therefore it's
quite crammed.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.120
So what I'm going to try
to do is really talk to you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.070
about what it's
about and what we're

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.180
trying to do as
clinical psychologists.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.440
And I suppose the best
place to start is--

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.530
if you like, what I often say
to my own family and to myself--

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.650
which is it's actually
tough being human.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.420
Being a human
being is difficult.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.630
We have so many differences
and difficulties

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.970
to deal with in our lives--
complex feelings, emotions,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.130
desires, challenges throughout
life, managing other people,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.549
managing ourselves, managing
the world around us.

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.090
So I've always been
interested in how

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.770
do people do this,
how do people tick,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.170
and what happens
when it goes wrong.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.610
And there have always
been difficulties in life.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.350
We are not unique in finding
life sometimes problematic.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.840
If you've never experienced
emotional difficulties

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.860
or relationship
difficulties in your life,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.890
then you're incredibly
lucky, and I think

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.270
you're probably quite rare.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.400
Sooner or later in
your life, there

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.960
are things which go wrong.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.580
I'm not going to
talk in great depth

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.780
about any individual case.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.020
But later on in my talk,
I will talk about a couple

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.310
of examples of people
I've worked with.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.950
But it's tough
managing all the things

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.324
you have to do-- your ambitions,
your needs, your family,

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.630
your parents, pressures,
and the world around you.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.540
And that's, I say,
always been the case,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
not just now in this century
but in many other centuries.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.230
We know that there
has always been--

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.220
not everybody finds it easy just
to get on happily in the world

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.540
that they're born into.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.610
And there have always
been ways that society

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.300
has had to offer people
some way of feeling better

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.110
about themselves
and other people

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.476
when people find
things difficult.

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:18.850
And I've just
listed historically

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.760
a range of ways in which
society has offered people

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.120
who are struggling a bit.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.640
And there are many ways of
dealing with this stress.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.570
If you like, let's
start off with the law.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.060
People who behave
differently or oddly,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.220
we deal with them legally.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.180
We put them in a class.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.630
Maybe somebody who's behaving
badly, we put them in prison

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.230
or we put them away somewhere.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.850
So the law deals with people.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.870
And to this day, when people
start behaving strange

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.480
in the street, or something
happens which is challenging,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.109
we may call the police or
a lawyer to deal with that.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.650
That's one way of
dealing with people

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.000
who are behaving differently.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.880
Another way, of
course, is medicine,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.770
and medicine has
always been a place.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.730
Nowadays we tend to turn to--

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.670
if you are unhappy,
go to your GP

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.000
and maybe they can find some
way of helping you with that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.196
Other ways include religion and
in some way that, if you like,

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.320
you can go see your priest.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.460
And typically and historically,
these three methods--

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.074
the law, medicine,
and religion--

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.490
have been the way
that people have

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.690
dealt with feeling low, having
difficulties, children behaving

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.290
who are challenging, behaving
in ways which we want to change.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.750
If you like, those
are the big ways

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.570
in the past that people have
dealt with difficulties.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.010
I've also put magic
there, because, again,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.850
another approach is, for
example, using astrology

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.530
or some other sort
of technique to deal

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.113
with people who are
behaving strangely

00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:38.350
or feel bad about themselves.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.430
And to this day, you can look
up your astrological signs

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.320
and read the future.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.335
People still use that.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:47.380
It's a way of making
themselves feel

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.240
better when they're not happy.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.060
I mentioned politics there
again because changing society

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.250
is another way of trying
to change people's emotions

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.954
and ability to get on with life.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.370
In fact, those have been the
big ways in which in the past

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.900
we've dealt with distress.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.452
But increasingly, and certainly
since the 19th century,

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:06.160
people have tried to
understand the mind.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.840
People have tried
to understand what's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.720
going on inside our heads,
and the science of psychology

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.870
has developed.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.510
And that's the background
to clinical psychology.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.350
I will just briefly
mention what that is.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.700
Psychology is now the most
in-demand undergraduate course

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.960
in the UK to do your
degree in, and it's

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.000
one of the most
competitive degrees to do.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.200
And it's the study of human
experience and behavior.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.790
And very quickly, I run
through some of the things that

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.770
happens within psychology.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.900
In order to become a
clinical psychologist,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.610
you study this first.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.080
And the kind of
things we study is

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.840
how is it we learn things,
how our memory works,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.430
and importantly, how
we forget things.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.800
That's a very important
part of the system.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.380
What stress does
to us and how we

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.390
are different from
other species,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.240
how hormones operate
on us, and how,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.780
for example, drugs alcohol
work on the body and the mind.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.590
Why do we sleep?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.020
Why don't we sleep?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.160
And how the perceptual system
works, how the brain sees,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.320
feels, and how emotions
work, how perception works.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.290
How we recognize people and
how we attend to other people

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.960
or to anything else and
how we make judgments.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.670
So the whole way in
which the brain works

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.224
is the subject of psychology.

00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:23.015
And as a science, it's
really quite recent.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:26.810
It's maybe 200 years or
so, but the most progress

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.600
has been made within
the last 50 years.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.460
Other things
psychology does is why

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.130
we have emotions, why we
feel, and particularly

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.020
child development--
how children learn,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.050
how they learn social
behavior and language,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.730
and how people
attach to one another

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.870
and how important
relationships are.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.620
How children separate
when they eventually

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.700
do what that process is
and how important it is

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.750
and what the effects
of aging are,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.090
how we get along, how we
behave differently socially

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.480
with other people, and how
groups differ from one another

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.140
and why and how we get
along with authority--

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.490
those are just a sample of
what you study in psychology.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.080
So if any of you might have
done a psychology degree,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.800
this will be familiar to you.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.110
And this is the
equivalent, as in medicine,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.740
of studying genetics,
physiology, anatomy.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.020
So if you want to be a
clinical psychologist,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.850
you do all this
first so you have

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.400
a notion of how the human mind
works and how people behave.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.840
So that's our bread and butter.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.100
So that's, if you like, the
degree that I originally

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.670
studied.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.610
But I was most interested
in, when it all goes wrong,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.620
when people are
unhappy, and what

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.020
happens during the periods
of life when most of us

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.260
have some challenges, what
can we learn in the same way

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.410
as when you do in anatomy
and physiology and genetics?

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.390
If you're a doctor, if
you understand that,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.730
then what is it when
it doesn't work?

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.490
So clinical psychology,
which is, I say, my interest,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.330
is the application of
psychology in clinical settings

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.320
where people have emotional
or psychological difficulties.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.660
And these include hospitals,
in particular mental health

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.820
but also child
health or clinics--

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.830
wherever people present
the psychological distress.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.160
So clinical psychologists
work in a variety

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.180
of different places.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.330
My early years in
the 1970s, '80s

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.430
was working in
psychiatric hospitals,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.040
but people also work
in general hospitals.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.140
So it works across the
lifespan from infants--

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.370
so how people may have
difficulties in early

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.820
relationship attachments,
things like adoption and some

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.760
of the difficulties that
children can experience

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.450
and the relationships
between parents and babies--

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.120
through to the very old
and the process of letting

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.669
go of life at the end of life.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.640
Now, we as clinical
psychology work very closely

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.720
with medicine.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.840
I mentioned the training
to become a doctor.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.700
One of the things you can do--

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.590
if you know all this,
forgive me if I'm

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.320
telling you stuff you
know, but just in case.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.659
One of the specialties
within medicine--

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.200
when you've done
your basic training,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.055
you can choose to do psychiatry.

00:08:57.055 --> 00:08:59.360
Now, psychiatry is different
in clinical psychology,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.530
in that to be a psychiatrist,
which in fact our daughter is,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.880
you have to do medicine first.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.990
So she's done the whole
business of anatomy,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.410
physiology, and all that
stuff, which I didn't do.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.390
So she's very familiar
with, and psychiatrists

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.370
know about how the body works.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.070
And their treatment of
mental health problems

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.590
tends to be oriented
towards the physical.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.190
So for example, the treatment
psychiatrists tend to give--

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.770
so if you're suffering
from depression or stress

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.900
and you go see a
psychiatrist, they

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.850
will tend to-- first
of all, they'll

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.890
do a very thorough
physical examination.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.270
And they may well give you some
medical treatments, for example

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.030
antidepressants or some other
sort of physical treatment

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.224
for your condition.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.640
Now, I'm not
qualified to do that.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.450
I'm not a doctor.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.440
I wouldn't do that.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.770
But I work very
closely with doctors

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.930
so that we will see people where
perhaps medical treatment isn't

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.100
appropriate or it's not thought
to be helpful in this case.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.690
We have a close relationship.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.005
We cross-refer to
one another, but we

00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:57.130
have a different treatment.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.400
Our treatment is
psychological, not physical,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.140
though I'm very aware,
of course, we have bodies

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.030
and therefore hormones
and things are important.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.840
And drugs do have an impact.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.980
Indeed, there's nothing wrong
with psychiatric treatments,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.860
like antidepressant.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.420
They can be used very much
with psychological treatments

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.310
so we work together,
particularly with psychiatry.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.050
And we offer different
perspectives.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.910
So by and large, the
model underling psychiatry

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.740
is a physical one,
which is there's

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.020
something wrong with
your hormone balance

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.170
or with the endocrines
or the brain chemicals.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.700
So you can fix it
with medication.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.490
Whereas we'll understand
when people have distress,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.460
depression, or
personality/relationship

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.330
difficulties or children behave
challenging ways or families

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.130
breakdown that isn't an
illness that's happened to you,

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.670
though that's a
convenient label.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.690
It's not an illness.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.320
It's a complex human response
to trauma or challenge

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.610
or difficulties.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.580
So what's wrong with you
is, while we can treat it

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.400
medically-- and often those
treatments help, interestingly;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.920
they do help--

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.760
their cause may
be something else.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.730
So by and large, what
we do is help people

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.550
to develop solutions
to their problems

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.270
rather than come and find
a medical way of fixing it.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.890
But again, we do
work with doctors.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.747
And if you do have depression,
often the very first

00:11:17.747 --> 00:11:20.080
useful thing to do is to try
antidepressants, because we

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.039
know they're effective.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.371
And if they're effective,
fine, because you can get back

00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:24.680
to work and that's great.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.530
But if it doesn't
fix it or you don't

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.330
want to use
antidepressants, often

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.390
the psychological
approach is the next step.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.000
To complicate matters,
many psychiatrists also

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.470
use psychological treatments.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.160
So they will use the
methods I might use,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.080
but I won't be
prescribing because that

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.310
isn't my background.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.970
So we do work with them, but our
specialty as the psychological,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.150
based on all that research,
all that knowledge,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.790
do with how people think,
how people perceive,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.500
how people develop,
all that stuff

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.390
I mentioned earlier,
which is our basic stuff.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.910
So we work with people to
try and develop a solution

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.920
to the problem and
base it very much in

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.900
a collaborative relationship.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.380
So patients are referred
to clinical psychologists

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.640
usually because they go to see
their GP or somebody suggests

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.690
they maybe need a bit of help.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.090
Perhaps that they've got
difficulties in the family.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.450
The child is repeatedly
challenging or difficult,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.370
or the child is very anxious--

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.130
or perhaps the adult, you or me.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.930
It's very much like all of us
could be in this situation,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.780
feel depressed,
feel anxious, have

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.060
difficulties or relationships.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.440
Or maybe granny is getting
more and more challenging

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.770
to us, living at home with us.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.100
We don't quite know how
best to help the family

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.890
to adapt to the fact that we've
now got granny living with us,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.389
and that's difficult.
We've also got

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:42.030
a teenager who wants
to go out drinking

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.710
and all sorts of problems.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.080
These are human problems
which aren't illnesses.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.250
Can we find a way of solving it?

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.040
And we very much
work with people

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.260
who bring their problems
to us and tell us

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.970
about them in confidence.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.610
Because it's confidential
and collaborative,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.970
ethics is very important to us.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.820
So we have a very
strong ethical code.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.280
We are regulated by
the Health Professions

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.670
Council, which is like the
General Medical Council.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.390
And we also have a professional
organization, the British

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.580
Psychological Society,
which has codes of ethics

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.150
that we have to abide by.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.300
And these specify very
clearly that we are there

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.830
to help the patient,
not ourselves.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.500
And that's important
because typically

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.410
what happens is that a
patient will come see me--

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.500
and I should mention I've
mostly worked with adults--

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.000
with a problem,
a difficulty, and

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.200
would trust me, hopefully, with
telling me some very intimate,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.280
personal things.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.470
And my responsibility
is to help them

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.010
the best I can to solve
their problems, not to--

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.210
not because I think
I've got the answer.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.850
I can't say to them, oh,
well, if you voted Labor,

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.100
your problems would be solved.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.320
That wouldn't be
my responsibility.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.500
I've got to help them
work out the solution.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.082
And in fact, this little
cartoon summarizes it.

00:13:54.082 --> 00:13:55.540
"We're encouraging
people to become

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.920
involved in their own rescue."

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.920
I don't think that's very
ethical there, though.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.592
That man is busy
reading his comic book

00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:01.800
while the person is drowning.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.410
We wouldn't quite do that,
but we certainly don't come up

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.520
with answers for people.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.980
Because there isn't
any point in that.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.000
We don't have an answer.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.190
We help people to
think differently

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.360
and to help them to see how
they got into the situation

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.640
they're in when
they're feeling muddled

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.320
or they're feeling upset.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.420
So we are a helper.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.774
We work with them to
change the situation.

00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:27.690
So the kinds of people
who go and see clinical

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.940
psychologists-- these
are typical clients--

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.000
peoples with phobias or
fears, which are very common,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.832
or anxiety.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.290
These are, in a way, some of
the easiest problems to solve.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.210
If you've got a fear of lifts
or wasps or spiders or cliffs

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.520
or something, airplanes,
those are quite relatively

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.080
straightforward difficulties.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.660
And often that's
to do with people,

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.660
over a long term avoiding,
discovering those things are

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.890
actually quite harmless.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.860
So that's a very
common difficulty,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.310
very common amongst children.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.310
People often grow out of
them, but again, people

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.660
can get stuck.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.077
People with depression, that's
a more complicated problem,

00:15:03.077 --> 00:15:04.618
and there are lots
of reasons why you

00:15:04.618 --> 00:15:05.790
might experience depression.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.290
Life is challenging for you.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.640
We can't solve that.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.160
Life is difficult. Life
is tough, remember I said.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.650
But we can maybe help
you to understand

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.530
the ways you've tried to
solve your depression are,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.150
paradoxically, not helping you.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.180
So things like
relationship problems,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.960
people who've got, again, stuck
in things which are difficult,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.980
needs another perspective.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.170
People with eating
disorders and psychosis.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.770
Psychosis is, if
you like, how we

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.730
tend to use the term now,
rather than schizophrenia

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.000
or manic depression.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.055
Those are words we tend
not to use so much now,

00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:39.930
because we're much more
thinking about what's

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.850
going on in the mind.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.160
Psychosis is
disordered thinking.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.130
We're starting to
understand it better now,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.054
based on lots of very good
psychological research.

00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:51.720
But very serious
mental health problems,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.640
which are very
challenging and very

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.530
disruptive to people's lives.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.910
People who have long term
difficulties in the past

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.732
used to be
hospitalized, but now we

00:15:59.732 --> 00:16:01.440
have better ways of
managing it, together

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.579
with psychiatrists who
have better drugs to help.

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:06.120
Also, people with
physical illnesses,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.390
like cancer, stroke,
or spinal injury--

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.590
if you have a
life-threatening illness,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.762
it affects the way you
think and feel, inevitably.

00:16:13.762 --> 00:16:15.220
And children with
a range of family

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.500
and individual disorders
or different types,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.910
difficulty in relationships,
school refusals,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.410
disruptive behavior
in the family,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.190
or child anxiety,
which is very common.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.660
And people with brain injuries
and developmental disorders,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.120
all of which have a
psychological component.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.630
You can't just have, say,
diabetes or a stroke or heart

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.190
disease without
it also affecting

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.290
how you think and feel.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.220
So we use a number of models.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.720
Some of you have heard of CBT.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.160
That's very common now.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.400
The cognitive model says the
thing let's pay attention to

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.520
and is a disorder on
happiness is how you think.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.940
So we look at how it is you're
understanding, your perceptions

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.370
of what's going on.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.770
The underlying idea here
is that sometimes people

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.830
can understand something
in a particular way which

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.990
leads them to have
particular emotions,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.450
and what's difficult is
the way they're thinking.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.290
When you are depressed,
for example--

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.560
we know when people
suffer from depression,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.750
they tend to think in
more concrete ways.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.460
They jump to conclusions.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.660
They'll see things in
more black and white,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.410
which can lead you to make
assumptions about the world.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.470
And I'll come back
to that in a minute,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.750
but that can aggravate
your low mood.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.930
So when we're working
with depression

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.660
using a cognitive
model, we try to help

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.510
people to see how their thinking
is actually unhelpful to them.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.150
Behavioral people would use
treatments, for example,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.180
say, with children,
whereby we help people

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.680
to train how they behave.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.170
And again, that leads to
different consequences.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.530
CBT is a combination of
behaviorism and cognitive

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.750
therapy, which is
increasingly popular.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.550
A lot of evidence suggests
it's very effective.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.490
Psychodynamic, this is
more Freudian thinking,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.906
trying to understand
relationships

00:17:57.906 --> 00:18:00.090
and particular attachments
and difficulties

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.820
people have with attachments--
or what I call systemic.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.490
This is trying to understand
how the system around you,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.560
perhaps at work
or in your family,

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.740
is aggravating or difficulties.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.550
So we'll use all these models.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.649
The way we work is, I feel
like, a series of stages.

00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:18.190
First of all, the
person is assessed.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.182
So the person seeing
me, I will ask them

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.470
about what's happened
in their lives, what's

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.020
happened to them, what's the
history of the problem, what's

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.950
going on in your life,
who's in your family.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.930
Are you working?

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.770
What else is happening to you?

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.479
So we might use questionnaires
or just talking to somebody.

00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.020
Or we might pay
attention to how they

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.580
are in a relationship with us.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.550
So are they very challenging,
or are they very passive?

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.310
So we'll pay attention to
those things in the room,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.930
in the assessment room.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.700
We'll then come up
with a formulation,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.820
which is a bit like the
diagnosis in medicine.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.400
And in particular, we're
interested in the predisposing

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.510
factors.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.589
Why does this person
have this problem here?

00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:56.380
And is there something
in their background?

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.463
Perhaps they come from a
background where people--

00:18:58.463 --> 00:18:59.850
branches in the family.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:00.960
What precipitated it?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.480
What happened last week or
a month ago that led to it

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.016
happening now?

00:19:05.016 --> 00:19:06.390
And what is a
presenting problem?

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.710
What's going on?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.880
Why is it staying there?

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.597
Why is it perpetuated?

00:19:10.597 --> 00:19:12.180
Why haven't people--
people don't want

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.760
to be sick or ill or unhappy.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.740
Why is it going on?

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.600
What's going on?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.534
Why is it perpetuating?

00:19:17.534 --> 00:19:19.950
And if you like, what is going
on which is protecting them

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.575
in their lives?

00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:22.080
Everybody has some good things.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.949
So have they got
good relationships?

00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:24.990
Have they got a good job?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.000
Have they got something
somewhere which

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.510
is also helping them to manage?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.970
So we need to know all of that.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.650
We then come up
with a formulation,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.960
which is like a diagnosis.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.400
And I'll show you some
formulations in a minute.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.980
We then do an agreement.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.800
We'll draw up a plan to
intervene to change things.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.090
For example, if we're
using a cognitive model,

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.946
we might set about a series
of cognitive experiments,

00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:49.320
helping them to
think differently

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.240
about whatever the problem is.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.930
Or behaviorally, again, we may
set up some little experiments

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.490
to do with the person.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.500
Just an example,
someone who's frightened

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.090
of going up and down the
lifts, they're frightened

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.256
that something catastrophic
will happen, very scared

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:03.934
of going near a lift--

00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:06.100
you'd have to walk up and
down the stairs every day.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.120
It'd be a pain.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.050
So what we'll do
is help the person

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.800
who's very frightened
of this first of all

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.850
watch me going up, trusting me.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.100
I'll go up and down a lift.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.330
They'll watch me doing it.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.910
Then eventually we'll
stand inside the lift

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.490
without closing the doors,
and I'll get used to that.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.110
Next time we'll go inside.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.470
Perhaps we'll go up together
one floor, which is very scary.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.960
But I'll be with them helping
him to relax, helping them

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.000
to experience less tension.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.759
And then the next time we might
get them to go up three floors

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:34.800
and then finally to go on
their own, up and down.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.210
So that would be a very
simple behavioral treatment.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.980
If it's a relationship problem,
it's not quite simple as that,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.324
as you can imagine.

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.490
But we would come up with
some other ways of perhaps

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.061
suggesting an alternative.

00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:48.060
We'd then evaluate, did
it work, didn't it work.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.768
If it didn't work, go
back to square one.

00:20:49.768 --> 00:20:50.660
Try something else.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.110
At the same time,
we're doing research

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.485
because we want to make sure
we have the right treatments

00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.060
for the future.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.310
How we tend to work-- well,
it takes about eight years

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.660
to train, see somebody.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.399
So as I said, degree
in psychology first.

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:03.440
Then we don't like to take
somebody straight off,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.260
because they're very young
and a little inexperienced

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.580
when you're 21.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.385
So we often ask them to go and
get some work in the workplace,

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:12.260
maybe in hospitals or
somewhere where they're

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.051
working with people,
to make sure that they

00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:15.409
get a bit more experience.

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:16.825
We then do a
three-year doctorate.

00:21:16.825 --> 00:21:18.366
So that's why it's
around eight years

00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:20.900
altogether, which is
what my last job was,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.940
doing that to train people.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.670
Our model underlying is
science practitioner.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.450
In other words,
we're practicing.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.944
We're not in labs, but we are
using the notion of science.

00:21:30.944 --> 00:21:33.360
Because we test something--
does it work, doesn't it work.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.110
If it doesn't work,
we try something else.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.486
We're always measuring how's
it work, what's the outcome.

00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:39.276
So we get people to
fill in questionnaires.

00:21:39.276 --> 00:21:40.970
It drives them mad,
but we need to do

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.370
that to make sure we
are on the right lines.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.590
And we use research-based
evidence, trials,

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.590
which indicate what
works and what doesn't--

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.300
a role for that.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.130
We spend a long time reflecting.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.190
We need to make sure
we're behaving ethically

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.120
and we're aware of the context
of what people want to do.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.050
And one context with
one ethnic grouping

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.480
might be different
for another one.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.160
In the UK, this is pretty
much based in the NHS.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.260
Our training is
funded in the NHS.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.330
In the rest of the world,
it's very different.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.620
People very much self-fund their
training and work privately.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.296
There's a little bit of private
work in the UK increasingly,

00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:18.920
but I've never worked
privately myself.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.520
I've spent all my life in
the NHS or in academia.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.330
If you want to see a
clinical psychologist,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.079
they do advertise.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:28.580
They're increasingly
working privately.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.380
Normally it's people
referred by a GP

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.760
or another medical specialty.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.010
So for example, a renal
specialist might say,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.570
this person is having
difficulty adapting the need

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.910
to be on dialysis,
can you help them.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.470
Or, this person's had a brain
injury, let's work with them,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.570
with their families to help
them back to normal life.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.170
And it's typically based
on a series of sessions

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.140
over several months.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.470
So the course of
treatment might be

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.050
six months or whatever,
or less, depending

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.750
on what the problem is.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.160
So I'll come back to the
candidates in a minute.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.868
I'm just going to show
you a formulation.

00:23:00.868 --> 00:23:03.260
This is a bit tricky,
but we often do diagrams.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.622
So I want you to have a
look at this person here,

00:23:05.622 --> 00:23:07.080
at the very bottom
of this diagram,

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.750
if you can see this person.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.930
And this is a case taken out
from a book by Ryle and Kerr.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.550
It's mentioned in the book.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.480
At the very bottom,
this person--

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.420
she's a woman, her
name was Beatrice--

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.540
comes to see the
psychiatrist or psychologist

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.830
feeling really depressed.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.410
She describes herself as
being like a frozen chicken

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.730
in the supermarket.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.550
She says she's like
wrapped up in cling film

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.480
as a frozen chicken.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.850
That's a self-image
of herself-- frozen,

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.460
no longer in relationships,
unable to do anything, really

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.306
miserable, in her early 30s.

00:23:36.306 --> 00:23:37.430
That's how she comes along.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.356
What do I do?

00:23:38.356 --> 00:23:39.980
Well, antidepressants
might help a bit,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.030
but actually there's
something else going on.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.607
So we try to
understand the story.

00:23:43.607 --> 00:23:45.440
Go right back to the
beginning of her story,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.630
inside the red box.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.816
It turns out she has
parents who really

00:23:50.816 --> 00:23:51.940
were quite critical of her.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.420
They rejected her and were
quite demanding of her.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.666
And in response to her parents,
she felt very guilty about it,

00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:00.290
but she also tried
to work really hard.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.670
So she's in the red box there.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.447
She's striving and needy.

00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:05.030
Her needs aren't
being met by parents.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.840
She's quite independent.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.780
She's also quite
rebellious at school.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.940
So there she is at
school as a young girl.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.110
She actually gets expelled.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.820
So if you look on the side
there, "rebel" gets rejected.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.530
Can you see that?

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.450
She gets expelled
from school, which

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.440
just makes her feel worse.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.030
So she longs for
closeness, because she's

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.200
an attractive young woman.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.550
Makes a series of relationships.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.960
She often has relationships.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.670
She fears abandonment.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.140
She's in the center now.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.160
She fears abandonment.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.440
She avoids getting
close to her boyfriends.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.970
She feels very lonely.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.170
She withdraws from people.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.610
Her needs are often unmet.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.100
She feels depressed, and she
feels like a frozen chicken.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.620
She doesn't dare reveal herself.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.504
So she went sometimes
on the other side,

00:24:44.504 --> 00:24:45.920
on the left-- is
it left or right?

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.120
This side here.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.940
She risks becoming
close to people.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.800
She tends to idealize the
person she falls in love with.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.680
She makes them
out to be perfect,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.970
has a moment of
complete being in love.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.470
They're a perfect relationship.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.400
She then feels totally--

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.129
she feels has been worthwhile,
but she fears being abandoned.

00:25:03.129 --> 00:25:04.670
She then runs away
again, because she

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.503
can't cope with the
idea of being abandoned.

00:25:06.503 --> 00:25:09.230
And she's back to
the frozen chicken.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.760
Sometimes, on the
other side, she

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.040
strives very hard
to please people.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.990
She pretends to be
something she isn't.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.340
She hates herself.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.180
Her needs are unmet.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.420
She doesn't reveal itself,
and then she feels depressed.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.390
So if you like, this is a
joint collaborative formulation

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.970
we've made of the kind
of problems that she has.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.710
That's a formulation.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.330
Another example of
a formulation here,

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.150
this was a man called Terry
who used to drink too much.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.900
He had very-- again, inside
the red box, red circle.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.110
He had very rejecting,
abandoning parents who

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.660
were very contemptuous of him.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.750
As a child, he's in the
place of B. He's very alone,

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.920
felt his needs for closeness,
wanting was very contemptible.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.990
And what we find in
life is you often

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.060
tend to reproduce
psychologically

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.330
some of the things your parents
did to you in your attachments.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.490
So he to himself
was very rejecting.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.637
He was very angry with himself.

00:25:57.637 --> 00:25:58.845
What he tended to do, again--

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.880
he worked in industry.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.459
What he would find is that--

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:07.250
because he was quite
contemptuous and angry

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.010
with people.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.340
He'd look around at his
peers, and he'd often

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.320
find that other people
weren't as good as him.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.750
So he would say to other
people, other people

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.784
were-- he's the best.

00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:17.450
Other people, would
be better than them,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.040
and he would reject
other people.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.360
Not surprisingly, when he did
that, other people reject him.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.059
And he would then end
up being very lonely.

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:28.100
And in fact, what he ended
up doing was drinking.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.160
So he would end up
being very depressed.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.890
He was down here.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.260
"I'm the worst person in
the world," and he'd drink.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.860
So he'd have a pattern
of being contemptuous

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.780
of others and
contemptuous of himself.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.360
And he would
reproduce that pattern

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.840
when we analyzed his
relationships with others.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.430
He would constantly feel he was
either the best or the worst.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.180
He had one way of
thinking about people.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.790
He had to be the
best at something

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.140
or the worst at something.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.940
He was always winning
awards at work.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.230
And then he would win awards.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:58.460
He'd boast, and other people
would then reject him.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.530
And he'd end up drinking.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.410
And it was a pattern.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.826
He went round and
round and round,

00:27:02.826 --> 00:27:05.900
and he found it very difficult
to accept himself as he was.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.280
So that's the kind
of formulation

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.130
we might draw up in
collaboration with the patient.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.950
And then following a
formulation like that,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.270
we would then introduce
ways of change.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.200
So for example, if you
look at this lady here,

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.480
we then talked about her sense
of being rejected by others--

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.110
what it was about her
which wasn't worthy,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.320
why she was avoiding closeness--
and try to help her to accept

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.600
herself more and
gradually, therefore,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.120
to stop idealizing
the men she met,

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.550
when she would go into her
completely over-the-top

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.257
relationship where she'd want
to move in the day she met them

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:40.840
and they would then
run away from her.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.506
Help her to be a little bit more
careful about the relationships

00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:46.210
she got into and gradually
develop relationships

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.020
where she could be with
people without them

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.230
being perfect, but more
egalitarian relationship.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.170
And again, with Terry,
to help him to not

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.040
be so contemptuous of others,
because the pattern he got into

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.470
was always to put other
people down, which meant

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.060
they put him down.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.600
So that's what you might
do in your treatment.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.944
So as I say, that's quite
a different approach

00:28:09.944 --> 00:28:11.860
than giving someone
antidepressants, though we

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.110
might well work with
antidepressants,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.970
say, somebody with depression.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.481
What the challenges are is
how scientific is all of this.

00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:21.730
You may say, well, what's
that got to do with science?

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.930
We try to be science
practitioners.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.840
Really, it's based
on studies which

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.190
have used models like this.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.920
Do they work?

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.910
Don't they work?

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.730
And so a lot of evidence
that CBT is effective,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.790
as I've mentioned.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.280
And there's a lot of work done.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.369
What are the studies?

00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:39.410
Does this treatment work?

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.076
Doesn't it work?

00:28:40.076 --> 00:28:42.110
With which patients
does it work?

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.120
And one of the problems we have
in psychiatry and in psychology

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.820
is that, actually, humans
are terribly varied.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.820
Everybody in this room
has a different story.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.150
Doing psychological research
is complicated because you all

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.670
have different experiences,
whereas probably

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.970
most of your kidneys or
livers work the same,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.170
one would imagine.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.615
But your history,
your psychology

00:29:03.615 --> 00:29:05.530
is going to be so different.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.320
And we've tended to give
one treatment to everybody.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.080
And what the research
demands is that we

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.300
have more and more
nuanced treatments

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.260
for different people.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.400
You wouldn't want
the same treatment

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.233
as the person next to
you, because your life

00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:18.650
story is different.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.090
And that's why often
we don't get it right,

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.220
because it's very
difficult to get it right.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.110
Laws and medicine--
if you like, I

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.120
like to say that they're
difficult subjects--

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.177
are probably simpler because
people are not so different.

00:29:31.177 --> 00:29:33.760
I mean, there are many ways in
which you can be physically ill

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.930
and break the law and
have legal complications.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.750
But the number of ways in which
people relate to each other

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.660
is so infinitely
complicated, it's difficult.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.340
And we do our best
to be scientific,

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.530
but we don't always
get it right.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.940
Therefore we do spend a lot
of time thinking about it,

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.597
and sometimes we
get over-reflective

00:29:51.597 --> 00:29:52.930
when we spend our time thinking.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.829
And maybe that's
not always helpful.

00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:58.120
There are not so many of us
because it's very expensive

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.300
to train somebody to become
a clinical psychologist--

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.250
several hundreds of thousands.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.130
And so the NHS can't afford
that many, and we tend to be--

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.700
there are relative few of us.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.970
So I don't know how many
of you've ever-- actually,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.420
just out of interest,
how many of you

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.712
have heard of clinical
psychologists as a profession?

00:30:17.712 --> 00:30:18.670
Ah, you've heard of us.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.880
Great.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.930
But probably not
many-- how many of you

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.430
actually know a clinical
psychologist personally?

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.480
About four or five of you.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.759
And that's great that you do.

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:29.550
There are not many.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.216
There are many, many
more psychiatrists.

00:30:31.216 --> 00:30:33.560
Psychiatrists are much
more numerous than us.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.320
And, of course, many,
many more doctors.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.460
There are many more--

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.830
most mental health care,
certainly in the UK,

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.020
is provided through the NHS.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.630
It's provided by
nurses and doctors,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.680
and we're very small in number.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.330
And so how can we have--

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.850
these models are
very interesting,

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.370
but it's hard to
actually see somebody.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.800
The chances of seeing
a clinical psychologist

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.910
are really quite small because
there are so few of us.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.250
And one of the other
things is that we

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.850
know very well that the
things often precipitate,

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.120
the background to mental
health problems in particular,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.670
are things like
poverty and exclusion.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.290
So we know that
mental health problems

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.440
are much more
dominant within groups

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.290
that have poor resources.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.830
And if you want to improve the
mental health of the nation

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.620
as a whole, you might want to
pay more attention to things

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.580
like education and
employment, unemployment,

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.630
and so on, and inequalities.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.630
And we're looking at
the individual victims,

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.130
if you like.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.850
We get the people
who've been damaged

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.845
by some of those things.

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:44.450
And maybe a better
thing would be

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.410
to change society as
a whole, because those

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.550
are the things that lead to some
of the mental health problems

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.440
that there are.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.030
We're fixing the individuals.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.610
I appreciate you
have to do both,

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.300
but often there's
a tension between

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.030
should we treat the people
or should we try and change

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.540
the system which leads to
people having these problems.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.450
We can talk more about that.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.880
And one of the other things is
could you make much more better

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.980
use of information technology?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.540
The treatments,
particularly CBT treatments

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.050
that are increasingly
used, they are

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.450
open to being used
with technology.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.700
For example, some of the
individual treatments, rather

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.480
than coming to see me
to do a desensitization,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.730
which is a treatment for your
fear of lifts or something,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.560
could you do that online?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.290
And there are treatments
which can be provided online.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.630
I had a go at this myself,
actually, a few years ago,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.790
because there's a very
good program for people

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:43.610
who have sleep problems
called Sleepio, which

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.100
is a CBT online treatment.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.710
It was, in fact, set up by a
colleague of mine from Glasgow

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.182
University, now in Oxford.

00:32:50.182 --> 00:32:51.640
I don't have a
major sleep problem,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.260
but I thought, well, I quite
fancy sleeping a bit better.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.930
So I did this sleep
program, which

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.770
meant every week I had to go
online about an hour and answer

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.570
questions and do
things differently.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.070
And it was very well-designed.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.140
And actually, I have to
say it really did work.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.180
It increased my ability to
sleep well through the night,

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.220
and it was very nice.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.720
[INAUDIBLE] I stepped
back into my bad habits

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.178
after a while, which was reading
in the middle of the night

00:33:14.178 --> 00:33:16.850
and stuff and staying in bed
late, which you shouldn't do

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.140
if you've got sleep problems.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.440
But we should use
information technology better

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.290
to try and spread, if you
like, psychological treatments

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.310
to more people.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.650
And there are ways
of doing that.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.140
It's very much what I think
the next generation is

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.360
going to include.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.640
So I think that's the
next-- and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.050
because here I am at
Google, thinking with you,

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.480
thinking about what can we do
to spread good mental health

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.560
practice.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.680
We know that depression is
a major cause of dysfunction

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.570
in the world out there.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.330
Most of us in our
lifetime will have--

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.300
either ourselves or one
of our friends and family

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.370
will have some mental
health problem,

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.620
and it will cause
distress to families.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.440
And we can treat it medically,
although not everybody responds

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.700
to medication.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.847
And in many ways,
what we know is

00:34:03.847 --> 00:34:05.930
that psychological treatment
and medical treatment

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.340
together is one of the best.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.409
But it's hugely time
consuming and it's demanding,

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:11.760
and it's expensive.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.639
So is there some way in which we
could deliver better treatment

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:16.402
better?

00:34:16.402 --> 00:34:18.110
One of the things that
makes it difficult

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.485
is that one of
the things we know

00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:22.159
is important in making the
psychological treatment work

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.060
is the relationship that you
develop with the person you

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.060
are helping.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.830
So that's very important, that
we have a close relationship.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:32.960
How can you reproduce a
relationship with a computer?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.819
Because we know that that bond--

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:36.860
the person who goes up
and down the lift with me,

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.651
the reason she's prepared
to do it is we've

00:34:38.651 --> 00:34:42.380
spent several hours beforehand
where I've listened to her,

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.610
I've given her my attention.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.690
She trusts me.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.639
She knows that I respect her.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:50.000
I'm not belittling her, and
therefore so she trusts me

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.770
in order to try doing it.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.600
How could you do that
if you're on a computer?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.100
So that's one of
our challenges, how

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.090
to deliver more widely the
mental health treatments

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.950
that we have to people.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.450
I think I've probably
talked enough.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.700
I was asked to talk about
30 minutes, which I've done.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.450
So I'd be more happy to take
the conversation further

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.942
in any direction that
people would be interested.

00:35:11.942 --> 00:35:13.900
Somebody at the back and
somebody in the front.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.066
AUDIENCE: Is an educational
psychologist the same as

00:35:16.066 --> 00:35:18.010
a clinical psychologist?

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:18.692
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Thank
you for asking that,

00:35:18.692 --> 00:35:20.080
and I perhaps
should've clarified.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.538
When you've done
your first degree,

00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:23.390
as I mentioned all
those subjects,

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.046
either you can just--
that's a degree.

00:35:25.046 --> 00:35:27.170
It could have been history
or physics or something.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.930
You go and work for
Google or something

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.070
that uses psychology again.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.840
Or you can come at
applied psychologists.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.840
And there are about seven
branches of psychology

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.090
which are applied.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.850
One is clinical.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.540
That was the bit I wanted to do.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.282
One is-- you
mentioned educational.

00:35:40.282 --> 00:35:41.740
There are things
like occupational,

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.240
which help in designing
work places and things.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.710
Educational is
particularly working

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.820
with children in schools--

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.180
how children learn and looking
in particular at family

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.230
difficulties.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:58.300
So that if you're interested in
how to be effect-- how dyslexia

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.140
and how children
behave in schools,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.690
that's an area to go into.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:06.130
Whereas where I trained was in
the NHS, in clinical settings,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.120
hospital settings.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.800
Education psychologists
often do teaching first.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.920
So they're very familiar
with the education system

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.920
before they start working with
teachers about how to work.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.430
Because I worked in the NHS
as an assistant occupational

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.760
therapist for a bit, so I got
used to how the hospitals work,

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.720
how doctors, how teams work.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.220
So you know the workplace.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.360
Educational psychologists would
use many of the same models,

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.640
like CBT.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.030
So our theories are the same.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.169
It's the workplace
that is different.

00:36:36.169 --> 00:36:37.210
Thanks for that question.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.470
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about
widespread models, I guess,

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.519
widespread processes.

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:49.310
Because, of course,
depression and anxiety,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.490
they come from things such as--

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.640
or they stem from skills
like resilience and things

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.500
like that.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.100
Do you know if they're
doing such resilience

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.044
course at schools nowadays?

00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:02.710
SUSAN LLEWELYN: That's
interesting, yes.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.650
Because indeed, I think it's
very important, the context.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.830
Although when you experience
depression, anxiety, you think

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.190
it's you, because obviously
that's how you experience it.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.866
It is indeed your life which
is in disorder or discomfort,

00:37:16.866 --> 00:37:17.740
but you're not alone.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.531
And many other people
have the same issues.

00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:22.870
And things like stress and
the demands of commuting

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.450
and the demands of managing
workplace and the family

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.600
and all that stuff--

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.450
all this adds.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.600
And yes, so the
context is important.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.630
So could we do something
about that context

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.527
to reduce some of that stuff?

00:37:33.527 --> 00:37:35.110
And of course, the
real world in which

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.300
we are all competing
and all these demands--

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.025
it's difficult to
change all of that,

00:37:39.025 --> 00:37:41.400
unless we all go and give up
and live in the countryside.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.983
But assuming we don't do that,
can the workplace do something?

00:37:43.983 --> 00:37:45.750
Can schools do something?

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:50.270
One of the fashionable
ideas is mindfulness.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.170
Mindfulness is a way--
people who've heard of that--

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.050
of trying to help you get away
from particularly critical

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.280
thoughts.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.190
And the underlying model of why
mindfulness works-- and they

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.670
are teaching this in schools
now and maybe in workplaces--

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.690
is like relaxation.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.750
It's helping you to
get off the treadmill.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:12.070
So if you look at, if you
like, this poor person here,

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.270
she is in a treadmill.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.640
Because people don't
want to be unhappy.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.090
We sometimes say, oh,
she's her own worst enemy.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.530
She doesn't want to get better.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.390
It's not that you don't
want to get better.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:26.320
You don't know how to change,
and change is very scary.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.030
Because if you always walk
in the same way and someone

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.270
asks you to walk differently,
how do you do that?

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.270
It's really hard, and we
shouldn't underestimate that.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.720
So what mindfulness and
these trainings try to do

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.080
is to help you to get off
the treadmill that you're on

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.370
or think about it differently.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.320
So yes, there is an
attempt to do that,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.100
and then that is going to be a
better way of solving problems.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.300
But it's such a huge thing.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.880
And what we know is that
mindfulness does work

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.450
to a degree.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.200
But then, again, it's
not good enough yet.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.468
We still don't have a panacea.

00:38:56.468 --> 00:38:59.432
AUDIENCE: Do you think, on a
broad spectrum, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:59.432 --> 00:39:02.890
impact things like
mindfulness in psychology?

00:39:05.792 --> 00:39:07.250
SUSAN LLEWELYN:
Again, the evidence

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.460
shows that it has
some small effect.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.000
The evidence on teaching
mindfulness in schools

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.980
is for some children
it is helpful,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.060
but not for all of them.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.360
Partly it's just difficult
to engage all the kids in it.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.875
So yes, the evidence is that--

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:24.510
well, again, trying to
be scientists about it--

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.520
it works for some
people some of the time.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.120
And we're on the case.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.820
But there isn't a
solution to everything

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.670
yet, because it's complex.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.100
So I know that's not
a good story to tell.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.060
I'd love to say yes,
but we don't know yet.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.787
Somebody here had something.

00:39:41.787 --> 00:39:42.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.880
I was wondering how do clinical
psychology practitioners deal

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.470
with all the heavy information
and all the difficult stories

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.332
after work, how they decompress?

00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:55.040
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Yes,
how we deal with it.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.331
I think that's very interesting,
and increasingly we're

00:39:57.331 --> 00:40:00.492
getting a bit better
at that than we were.

00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:02.700
I'd mentioned one of our
skills was being reflective.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.100
How reflective should we be?

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.120
Everybody in
practice is supposed

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.120
to have a supervisor,
which doesn't mean someone

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.078
to tell you what to do.

00:40:09.078 --> 00:40:11.940
It's somebody you can go
and talk to about things.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.400
And in a sense, it's
like being a doctor.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.870
You get used to it.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:21.260
And I have to say
that over my life,

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.230
I think I've become a bit inured
to stories that people tell me.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.820
And sometimes I think
I'm getting hard-hearted.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.361
Because there isn't
too much horrible

00:40:27.361 --> 00:40:28.850
stuff that I've not heard.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:30.170
You do get used to it.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.790
The thing that I
find quite difficult

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.270
is that when I was first
working on one of the big issues

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.186
I talked about, trauma--

00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:38.810
one of the things we
know, for example,

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:42.350
is that childhood abuse
and neglect and abandonment

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:44.220
as a child is bad for you.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.010
We know that having an unhappy
childhood is not good for you.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.490
That's one statement I can make.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.630
And when you hear stories about
how children have been harmed

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.450
by society or by families,
that's very difficult.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.400
I used to find that
really hard to hear that.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.870
And particularly when
I had my own children

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.120
and I was hearing stories
about children being abused,

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.550
that was difficult.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.310
The idea is you have somebody
who's been through it before.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:11.030
And I think you focus
on what to do about it

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.800
rather than going on about it.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.220
Again, we tend not to talk
too much about the past.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.650
We're talking about how
things are playing out now,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.420
because you can't
change the past.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.780
What is happening now, today,
in your relationships which

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.400
maybe we could change?

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.280
For example, one of things we've
found about people who've been

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.790
abused as children is not
that they abuse others,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.020
because often they don't.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.700
There's a myth
sometimes that they do.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.310
What they do is they
abuse themselves.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.230
They often attack
themselves rather than

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.559
attack anybody else.

00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:42.100
So that's what you
want to work with,

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.860
is people self-harming
and psychological

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.020
harming, rather than
going to the past.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.800
So I think you hear
it, but then you say,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.650
what do we do about it now?

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.215
So you hope for a way out of it.

00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:57.670
There's various hands.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.120
AUDIENCE: So what do you think
the biggest difference is

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.460
between approaches to
clinical psychology in the US

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.234
and the UK are?

00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:08.650
SUSAN LLEWELYN:
That's interesting

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.020
because my colleagues
who work in the UK--

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.400
and I did spend a
couple of months

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.720
in the University of Florida
and looking at the health system

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.250
there.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.320
I'm not that experienced,
but what I understand.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.780
One of the big differences
here-- because we're NHS-based,

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.950
clinical psychology,
by and large,

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.130
we tend to have shorter
treatments because

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.820
of the cost of treatment.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.740
And so we're very
much evidence-based.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.340
What is it that works
in the shortest time?

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.090
So there's more pressure
to do things more quickly.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.360
Tends to be therefore CBT
is the model of choice,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.480
whereas in the US it's more
psychodynamic therapies, which

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.670
is more Freudian-based
or relationship-based,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:49.990
which take a bit longer.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.240
The evidence is they're equally
helpful, but they take longer.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.860
So that's a
difference we notice.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.340
That's the most
obvious difference.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.740
There was somebody--
lots of hands.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.240
Good.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:03.739
I like this.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.970
AUDIENCE: Would you
expect, in years to come,

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.990
that there will
be lots of things

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:14.830
in your red box associated with
social media and social media

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.360
pressures, particularly
on adolescents?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.276
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Yeah,
that's very interesting,

00:43:19.276 --> 00:43:23.100
because I think you
are-- one is humans

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.130
are enormously influenced
by the people around them.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.310
And your close relationships,
your parents, your friends

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.510
are very important to you.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:35.490
Especially for adolescents,
there's a huge--

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.520
that process of
separation from parents.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.020
As humans, we need
attachments to others.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.934
The separation process
from your parents

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:46.350
means you start to attach,
particularly in the teen years,

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.810
to your peer group.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.010
And if your peer group
is a perfect peer

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.660
group on social media, who
all look fantastic and go

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.470
to parties all the time and have
a great time, but you're not,

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.220
that teaches you you're not
a very worthwhile person.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.175
So I think, yes, I do
see that's a problem.

00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:02.550
And particularly
for adolescents,

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.299
we know that mental
health of young people

00:44:04.299 --> 00:44:06.750
today is getting worse.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.910
And I suspect, but I
don't know well enough

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.304
what the evidence is--

00:44:10.304 --> 00:44:11.970
I have a social
psychologist [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.966
do you know what the evidence
is on the social media side?

00:44:14.966 --> 00:44:17.804
AUDIENCE: By and large--

00:44:17.804 --> 00:44:22.221
well, it's your
"for some people."

00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:25.938
For some people, social
media is clearly bad.

00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:28.460
And it's a mixture
of two things.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.464
One is, we always make
social comparisons.

00:44:31.464 --> 00:44:33.600
But normally, if
you like, that's

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.350
within a group of 25, 30 people.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:41.583
Suddenly, you've got 700,000
to make more comparisons with.

00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:42.828
And guess what?

00:44:42.828 --> 00:44:44.322
You come out badly.

00:44:44.322 --> 00:44:46.812
And the other thing
is that people

00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:50.796
behave worse to each other
when they're not face to face.

00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:53.784
It's anonymity.

00:44:53.784 --> 00:44:58.764
People do much nastier things
to each other over social media

00:44:58.764 --> 00:45:00.756
than they would face to face.

00:45:00.756 --> 00:45:05.736
So those two factors make it
a very dangerous place to be,

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:08.226
even though it's got
lots of positives.

00:45:08.226 --> 00:45:09.840
But it can go badly wrong.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.160
SUSAN LLEWELYN: And I think,
going back to programs,

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.250
it's teaching people
how to use social media.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.720
Because I don't use Facebook.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.090
Whenever I see anything, I
think, oh, god, these people

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.095
have much more fun
than I'm having.

00:45:20.095 --> 00:45:21.720
But of course, it's
all myth and story.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.410
I know that.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.235
But it's hard.

00:45:23.235 --> 00:45:25.630
When you're young, how do
you know that for sure?

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.330
So yes, I think that's
one of the boxes

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.746
you would put in there, which
is that the world around you

00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:33.084
is much more likely to be
a less comfortable place

00:45:33.084 --> 00:45:34.500
to be when you're
just that little

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.730
you with all your problems.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.240
So I think that's
certainly true.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.760
And I think that helping people,
ways of dealing with that

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.260
and understanding--
well, of course,

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.510
you spend hours making
the perfect selfie.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.990
Most of us don't look like
that most of the time.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.279
So yes, I'm sure that's true.

00:45:52.279 --> 00:45:54.070
AUDIENCE: You've
mentioned the relationship

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:58.610
between the therapists
and therapy.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.260
How do you deal with
people that get addicted

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.920
to you or to the relationship,
relying more on the therapy

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.650
than solving their
problems on their own?

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:09.670
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Yes, it's
a very interesting issue.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.170
Because one of
things you're doing--

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.660
when a patient or client,
whichever word you're using--

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.290
we use both-- comes
to see and tells you,

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.080
they feel like,
their difficulties,

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.480
my professional job is
to listen to the person,

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.060
give them my full attention,
and understand them.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:29.875
So I'm giving them a lot of
cues that I'm there for them.

00:46:29.875 --> 00:46:32.000
We have to be very careful
that's not misunderstood

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.833
in the relationship.

00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:34.670
Because normally when
you sit on your own

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:36.670
with somebody in the room
and they're paying you

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.875
really good attention
for an hour or something,

00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:41.750
that's a very nice
experience, to be listened

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.499
to, being valued,
especially if the person

00:46:43.499 --> 00:46:47.700
has very few other places where
they are experienced as valued,

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.310
which is why it's
very important we

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.890
have a lot of signals
and signs around,

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.560
which is this is a
professional relationship.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.330
This is not a personal issue.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.170
And there's always that
difficulty at some point

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.621
where the person
may start to wish

00:47:03.621 --> 00:47:05.370
they had a personal
relationship with you.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.090
I've certainly had people
want to ask me out to dinner,

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:12.860
and people have wanted a
more personal relationship.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.740
And that's understandable,
because you're

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.780
being terribly nice to them
and you're listening to them

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.890
and being there for them.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.510
But again, it's very important
that you're also very clear.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.500
That's why we often use
our professional titles

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.820
and we only see people
in consulting rooms.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.010
This is not a social space.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.780
This is a work space.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.760
And all the time,
you're helping them

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.250
to understand that this is a way
of talking about your problems.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.910
This isn't solving our problems.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.250
Problems are out there.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.970
We're going to help you
get back out there again.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.060
This is limited.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.790
And we also often talk
about time limits.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.430
So we'll say, I'm going to
see you for six sessions.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.650
And in some models, we
actually say-- well,

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.420
we count down the
sessions, so they know

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.740
it's going to come to an end.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.300
But it's a very
good-- and going back

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.970
to the question
of the USA, where

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.030
you work in a more psychodynamic
model, Freudian model,

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:02.150
that model, where you have a
longer term relationship, that

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.710
can be more problematic.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.110
And it's part of our
training to handle that.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.720
And it's understandable why
people can get dependent,

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.790
because that happens.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.810
And the other thing
is many trainings also

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.130
require you to have
experience with therapy.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.910
So you, as a therapist, can go--

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:22.370
part of your training
is to be a patient.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:26.900
And you then discover how easy
it is to idealize the person

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.930
or to start rehearsing what you
tell them, tell them a partly

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:31.850
true story and not
a whole true story

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.440
because you're worried about--

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.694
so that's a good
way of handling it.

00:48:39.914 --> 00:48:41.330
AUDIENCE: The
clinical body, NICE,

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.450
have to make really
difficult decisions about how

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.520
they allocate resources.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.690
We can't afford this
particular medicine

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.021
for this group of people.

00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:52.520
Given there are so few of you,
I was just interested to know

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.231
how is it triaged in terms of
who's going to get treatment.

00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:58.230
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Yes, this
is the national body--

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.646
it stands for
clinical excellence,

00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:01.760
National Institute of
Clinical Excellence--

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.140
which will provide--

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.920
that's the right
acronym, isn't it?

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.420
Yeah.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:09.740
And they provide guidance
on what treatments.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.650
They do recommend
psychological treatments

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:18.419
for a number of different
conditions, based on evidence--

00:49:18.419 --> 00:49:20.210
and again, quite rightly
based on evidence.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.010
If I have treatment,
I want to know

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.160
that it is the right treatment
for my particular condition.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.370
They do recommend-- for example,
one of the things we know

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:29.240
in psychosis--

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.000
I mentioned psychosis, when
people have major mental health

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.730
problems, hallucinations,
and delusions--

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:39.320
that the evidence shows that
if you provide treatment

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.100
for the individual as early
as possible, the first episode

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.170
of psychosis, which
normally happens

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.970
in the late teens, early 20s--

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.720
slightly different
between men and women--

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.710
is there can be a
devastating life

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.930
course if it fully develops.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.050
If you can get it really early
and get early treatment in,

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.640
you can prevent the
condition from developing.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.240
You can help the person
psychologically and medically

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.700
if a teen gets in early.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.960
So that's the really
good news story,

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.760
is that we don't have
long term patients.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.370
If you can get them quick,
you can divert the psychosis.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.940
You can prevent it.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.330
And it's really late teens-ish,
often connected with-- well,

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.870
some of it is connected with
cannabis use, not always.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.910
And there are now sources
of evidence that show--

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.845
clear evidence-- that
one of the components

00:50:23.845 --> 00:50:25.970
is family treatment, where
you work with the family

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.170
to understand how to deal
with the young person.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.770
Because they're often
still living at home.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:33.830
And that is what the
evidence shows we should do,

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.490
but there aren't enough people.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.940
So a lot of people don't
get the right treatment.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.520
So sadly, there are people
out there not getting

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.860
what NICE says they should
get because there just

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.158
aren't enough people.

00:50:45.158 --> 00:50:46.574
AUDIENCE: But is
it self-defeating

00:50:46.574 --> 00:50:48.680
in terms of they
invested upfront,

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.664
you wouldn't have the costs
associated with that family

00:50:51.664 --> 00:50:55.000
breakdown or relationship
breakdown, supplying the drugs?

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.330
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Absolutely.

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.424
All those things are
true, but it's expensive.

00:50:58.424 --> 00:51:00.590
It's the question of how
we want to spend our money.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.810
I mean, one of the problems--

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.610
I mean, I have to say, the
last few successive governments

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:05.960
have tried.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.475
And you'll hear on the
news this notion of--

00:51:08.475 --> 00:51:10.820
this concept that's
called parity of esteem,

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.180
that we esteem our mental health
as much as our physical health.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.510
But it is not the case.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.960
If you are suddenly diagnosed
with some kidney disease

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.710
or cancer or something, you
will get seen pretty quickly

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:27.471
and be seen by the best experts
in your area, hopefully.

00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:28.970
If you have a mental
health problem,

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.884
like psychosis, you
don't know whether you're

00:51:30.884 --> 00:51:32.300
going to get
treatment, because we

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.780
don't invest as much in
mental as physical health.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.300
That's always been
the way, because we

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.410
stigmatize mental health.

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.950
We think there's something
wrong with you, you're to blame.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.630
Somehow you've
brought it on yourself

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:46.380
if you have a mental
health problem.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.182
And it goes quite
deep-rooted, that.

00:51:48.182 --> 00:51:48.890
We use the word--

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.790
I use it in casual speech.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.820
Oh, it's psychological,
I'll say.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.040
If I've got a stomachache,
oh, it's psychological.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.750
In other words, it's not real.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.490
Of course, it doesn't
mean that at all,

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:01.400
because what is psychological
is absolutely real.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.830
And we are a physical
and mental being.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:04.850
We're all together.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:06.920
You can't have a
mental health problem

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.090
without a physical health
problem or vice versa.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:11.569
But over history, we've tended
to put one in a box and one

00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:12.110
in the other.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.130
And one's good and one's bad.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.760
So mental health hasn't
had the investments

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.280
and the serious treatments.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280
I think that's changing.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.390
I'd say that is changing.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.959
There is more importance
now placed on that.

00:52:22.959 --> 00:52:25.250
And certainly going back to
the question about the US--

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.820
I don't know if he's still here,
the gentleman that asked-- oh,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.770
yes--

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:32.850
is that we've been much
more nervous to talk

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:36.900
about mental health in the UK.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.450
I think that's changing
now, especially with CBT,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.440
having people more access to it.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.450
To say you're having
therapy is now reasonable,

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:48.065
and people talk about that.

00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:50.022
It used to be anathema.

00:52:50.022 --> 00:52:52.230
For example, in our training,
when we trained people,

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.822
I remember my
father saying to me

00:52:53.822 --> 00:52:55.530
when I was thinking
about training, well,

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.670
that's very interesting.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:01.050
But if you want to
go into this, not

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:03.705
working with very nice people,
and it's very important

00:53:03.705 --> 00:53:06.160
that you yourself don't have
any mental health problems.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.930
Now we see it very
differently from that.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:12.742
We see we as trainers, and as
students and as practitioners,

00:53:12.742 --> 00:53:14.700
may well have mental
health problems ourselves.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.410
Everybody has mental
health problems.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.180
We're not different.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.000
In the same way as I might
break my leg or have diabetes,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.664
it doesn't make me a bad doctor.

00:53:22.664 --> 00:53:25.080
Likewise, I might be suffering
from mental health problems

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.590
as well.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.910
It's OK to do that.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.500
It's not I'm a bad person.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.620
So we're trying very much to
change the attitudes, which

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.410
are difficult. But you're
absolutely right about that.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.890
We should spend more, but
that's a political discussion,

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.485
which we can have elsewhere.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:46.032
You mentioned that CBT and
online therapy is quite new.

00:53:46.032 --> 00:53:47.490
Is there any evidence
at the moment

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.872
whether it's more effective
than that face-to-face therapy?

00:53:51.872 --> 00:53:54.330
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Well, what's
interesting is it seems to be,

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.324
with certain groups,
as effective, which

00:53:56.324 --> 00:53:57.990
is quite challenging
to all of us who've

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:59.782
been doing it for years.

00:53:59.782 --> 00:54:01.620
But what was interesting is--

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.110
yes, so it is as effective,
and that's a good thing to do.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.850
But it has to be set
out right, and you

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:08.487
have to get that relationship
factors in there right.

00:54:08.487 --> 00:54:10.320
I mentioned I did the
Sleepio program, which

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.370
was interesting to do.

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:14.070
But what I found
myself doing was

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.292
I would assume that I
was talking to this guy.

00:54:17.292 --> 00:54:19.500
I would think, well, what's
he thinking about me now?

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.730
Of course, it wasn't
he who was thinking.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.820
It was a program.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.450
But what people do is they like
there to be a person there.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.370
So I think when we
design these things well,

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.160
they can be helpful.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.320
One of the very, very
important things to do

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.820
is change how people
think about it.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.160
And one of the good things
about rolling out programs

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.790
is it helps people, I
think, to normalize it more.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.180
Just quickly, one point I should
make about the cognitive model

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.980
I talked about,
where you can think,

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.070
one of the most
damaging things people

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.890
can think about is how
abnormal their thinking is.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.300
And if you can normalize
it, help people to know--

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.240
one of the things we know about
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.410
when you've had a traumatic
episode, when something

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:05.080
happens-- if a bomb drops on
us, it's ghastly and traumatic.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.070
We will all have--

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.870
hopefully we survive it--

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:10.560
flashbacks.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.450
We will have bad experiences.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.990
If you can understand
that that's normal,

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:18.510
that normal people always have
bad experiences after trauma

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.570
and gradually they
fade over the days,

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.600
the months, your traumatic
experiences will fade.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.520
Then you will get better.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.849
If you think you are
odd and unusual--

00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:30.390
and this is what
the evidence shows--

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.300
that you are uniquely
weak and mentally ill

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.120
because you've had this trauma,
this traumatic reaction,

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.560
then you won't get
better so quickly.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.950
One of the great things
about rolling out large scale

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.830
is perhaps people will
understand that their reactions

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.210
are actually normal.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.750
It's OK to feel trauma.

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:48.420
It's OK to feel bad.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.450
And rolling out
larger scale programs

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.700
will help people to see
their mental health problems

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.360
are not unique.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.844
You're not the only one to feel
depressed, sad, angry, have

00:55:56.844 --> 00:55:57.760
relationship problems.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.260
It's normal.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.670
It's human.

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.950
And that's, I think,
large scale programs,

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.470
which hopefully organizations
such as ourselves

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.630
will be helpful to
us in developing.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.780
That was great.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.730
SUSAN LLEWELYN: Thank you.
