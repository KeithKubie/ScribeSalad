PHIL: Finally.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: MIT grad
student, food lover, fitness

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.190
enthusiast, literature buff,
organic chemist by day, super

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.750
hero by night.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.830
PHIL: Soon as my mother had
me, I was ready to go.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.890
Came out of there, running
and jumping.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.720
I haven't chewed gum since
I'm a role model.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.680
What's that stupid train
in Harry Potter?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hogwarts
Express.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.930
PHIL: It's a Hogwarts Express.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.760
I just took my sweatshirt off
and it cut my forehead.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490
I found the photo of
Natalie Portman.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
Phil is weird.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.270
PHIL: You know that Paula Deen
was married to James Dean.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: What?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.440
PHIL: A lot of people
don't know that.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.685
You know what my favorite
dance move is?

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.260
Slapping people with my tie.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.190
This is my hood.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.320
Don't take my advice.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.970
IKE: I want to take it.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.145
PHIL: I'm going to sign up
for ChristianMingle.com.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.665
The commercial says, find
God's match for you on

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.454
ChristianMingle.com or at
Starbucks like every other

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:57.428
self-respecting American.

00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:58.645
MALE SPEAKER: Did you seriously
just end your

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:01.710
sentence with a preposition?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.541
PHIL: I can't talk about
my personal life in

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.699
front of the students.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.625
MALE SPEAKER: I love
you, Phil.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:06.551
MALE SPEAKER: We
love you, Phil.

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.480
PHIL: OK.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.370
PHIL: Tom Cruise says I'm
silently judging you.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.500
There's a girl that was picking
on me at school, and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.310
on the way to school I remember
trying to make up my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.460
mind as to whether I was going
to stick my tongue out at her

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.870
or hit her with my bag.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.790
I never felt so close to dying
in my entire life.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.042
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a sticky bun.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.014
PHIL: I can't.

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:27.930
I really can't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:46.773
