00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.429
The goal of AI is to make a computer that’s
as smart as a human.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:11.010
If you read Youtube comments, that shouldn’t
be too hard.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.110
Hello artificial intelligencia, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.500
Computers are constantly getting better, faster,
and stronger, and they’re really great at

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.039
things we’re terrible at.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.320
For example, tell me what’s 1,957 times
683?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320
Right now.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
Go!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
I didn’t think so.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.820
And yet we still consider them dumb.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.550
If being amazing at raw calculations doesn’t
make them smart, at what point is a machine

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.020
considered intelligent?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.590
The most famous test of artificial intelligence
is the Turing Test.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.729
Basically a computer passes the Turing Test
if it can chat with a human judge for 5 minutes

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.719
and fool the judge into thinking it’s human
30% of the time.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
Aside from one controversial effort in 2014
where a chatbot snuck past the judges by lowering

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.379
expectations, the Turing Test remains unbeaten.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.249
That might be in part because not many people
are trying to beat it.

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.679
The Turing Test isn’t broad enough in scope
to be the be-all end-all benchmark for AI.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.059
For example it doesn’t test if a machine
can make a judgment about an image, or use

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.649
common-sense reasoning.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.219
So more challenges have been set forth, and
little by little machines are starting to

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.219
pass them.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.140
Researchers think an intelligent machine should
be able to interpret visual information, like

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.229
when something is a face.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.300
Lo and behold, on my phone I have an app that
knows what shapes to search for when I’m

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.219
taking selfies so it can slap dog ears on
me.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.310
Computers are also beating us at our own games
lately.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.950
Google’s Alpha Go, an algorithm that played
the ancient Chinese game of Go like a boss,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.189
was good enough to beat a Go master.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.609
And playing Go like a pro and recognizing
my face is impressive, but a machine that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.170
does one specific thing at a human level can’t
really be called intelligent.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.729
We call that Artificial Narrow Intelligence,
when really what we’re looking for is Artificial

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.290
General Intelligence.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.869
To meet that standard, a machine would have
to do many things at our level.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.039
So the human standard for intelligence is
to be like a human, which sounds egotistical

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.530
but it’s really not.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.840
The human mind is formidable because we can
learn about so many completely unrelated things,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.530
and we can do it even if we’re not explicitly
taught.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.979
One person is capable of playing Go and recognizing
faces and having an open-ended conversation.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.499
One computer is not.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.350
That’s where machine learning comes in.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.540
Today computers can teach themselves.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.720
Given enough data, modern algorithms can start
to write their own code, refining it over

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.750
and over.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.640
The most basic facial recognition code an
algorithm writes might look for simple things

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.640
like edges.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.800
The next level adds the ability to combine
those edges into shapes like circles and rectangles.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.890
Go a layer deeper and it can start to distinguish
eyes and noses.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.110
These algorithms need to look at thousands
to millions of examples of faces, but eventually

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.260
their codes will be so good at looking for
facial features that they’ll be able to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.380
tell when two pictures are of the same person,
even if the lighting has changed, the angles

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.560
is different, and they’ve grown a sexy beard.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.010
It’s why Facebook knows your friends are
in a picture before you even tag them.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.990
It’s because they have a virtual book…
of faces.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.410
A smart machine will not just recognize specific
people, but also be able to generalize.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.500
Even if a face looks like nothing they’ve
ever seen before, they’ll still recognize

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.190
this ugly mug as human.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.870
Not a sloth.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.790
Eventually if a machine can teach itself many
different human traits and has the raw horsepower

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.410
to do it quickly, it’ll be considered artificially
intelligent.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.810
But I doubt it’ll stop there.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.960
It won’t be long before they surpass human
intelligence and obtain “Artificial Superintelligence.”

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.820
When that day comes, maybe it’ll be the
machines that test humans to see if we can

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.820
fool them.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.790
You know the routine: anytime someone brings
up AI we all have to freak out about how they’ll

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
be our overlords.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.690
Of course there’s another way of looking
at it- What if humanity and AI merge together?

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.180
Laura Ling from Seeker Stories explores that
question in this video, wherein a robot tells

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:47.540
a joke.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.480
But convinced that AI is going to be safe,
Trace shills for our robot overlords, I mean

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:13.000
protectors, in this video here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.130
After AI hits but before it enslaves humanity
it’s going to have all sorts of uses.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.860
Safer self driving cars, better internet searches,
you name it.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.180
No I mean it, tell us where you think AI will
have the most impact on the world.
