Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today we're talking about color. Okay. And that actually brings us back to Jane Nights. I'm a professor of Ophthalmology, university of Washington, Seattle. Jay has actually spent his entire career trying to get creatures to see colors that they normally can't see. Well, yeah. And he started, this is kind of an interesting story, a by taking some colorblind monkeys who couldn't see red. They have blue cones, green cones, but no red cones, which is not unlike a lot of human males. In any case, he had these monkeys and was able to take the human gene for the red cone rabbit and a virus injected into the monkey's eyes and Bam, the monkeys suddenly had red cones. Yeah. So it had blue, green, and red. Was this like Lasik? So it was just like a, a 10 minute outpatient situation for the monkeys.

Speaker 1:          00:49          I would say close, close to Lasik. Could they then now see red? Well, every single morning before they get their breakfast, they have to do their color vision test. So, so we'd say each monkey at a computer, we add a touch screen and the screen looks totally gray, man. We bought that field of gray. He adds a little red blob right now. Here's the key. We use grape juice as the reinforcement for the monkeys. But the game is, yeah, the touch the blob before you get your juice. So before the surgery, they weren't seeing any blobs and they weren't getting any juice because all they could see was gray. So a little red block could be right there in front of them and they never see it. And the morning after, they're a lasix color booster shot. Okay, that's true. Did you see it? They

Speaker 2:          01:40          still couldn't see it.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Day after day they would do their tests and everyday they would fail. Every day they would fail

Speaker 2:          01:47          and

Speaker 1:          01:49          no blob, no juice. But it's fun for them. They get out of their cage and they talk to their friends. And then did you fail? Fail. Okay. You got up the other day, another fail until one morning after about 20 weeks, Jay woke up the monkeys gave them the test and they began to not fail. Really, if you watched the video of this, it actually looks like the monkey is like, wow, you know, I'm not having any failures and check out this dot. Look at this thing. Check it out. But I did get some sense that they felt like that their life had improved. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:35          well, if this works so well with the monkeys, couldn't you take a colorblind human and give them back the thing they're missing? Absolutely. We could cure colorblindness in a human with exactly this technique. We really, the only thing that we have to do is convince the FDA that the risks are low enough and the benefit is high enough that it'd be something we could do and have never tried it or no, we've never tried it. Although I get a lot of emails that say I don't care what the risks are. I've even had offers. How bout if I come to your laboratory and you don't tell anybody late at night and you give me the shot in the eye and we won't tell anyone, which brings us back to our original question. If you can take a colorblind human and give them normal color vision, could you take a normal color seer and boost them to make them a little more shrimpy? Well, yes. Yeah. We said, sure, why not. But then there's the whole FDA thing. But here's the real surprise. J says there were some people who are already a little bit mantis shrimp, like there are colored mutants, if I may call them that in the nicest possible way among us or they're out there in theory.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Okay, so here's the deal. The genes for the cones in our eyes see color. You have the red queen blue cones. Yep. They're on the x chromosome. Now men, as we know, only have one of those women have two x chromosomes, which means that women have two sets of these cone making genes. Normally one said it's just a spare. It's not used, but still they've got two sets. And so someone said, Aha, it is theoretically possible. Then some women, this spare set of jeans might mix up, turn on, morph into a whole new cone, a forth comb.

Speaker 1:          04:25          We're going to call it the yellow cone. So people with normal color vision are trichromatic cause we've got three cones. A woman like that would be a tetra Chromat. So altogether she'd have a blue cone, a green cone, a yellow cone, and a red count, but she wouldn't just see more yellow. This new yellow would mix with the red and the blue and the green to create thousands, maybe millions of more shades of color. This amazing technicolor is not the right word. It's whatever would be the DEX kind of color. That would be even more super duper. This was just the thought experiment. Yeah, but Jay actually figured out a way to test for this. We can look in people's blood and I can say this woman has the genes for blue cones, green cons, yellow cones, red cones. You can do a DNA test. Really?

Speaker 1:          05:15          Yeah. So he started doing blood tests and he found this one woman, she worked at the same place we did crazily enough at the university. He looked at her DNA and he saw the gene for the fourth coat. Yeah. Wow. So did she see in super technicolor or how would you even know that was, that was a problem. And so we thought of an experiment in order to be able to see whether or not she had this extra dimension of Color Vision. He was able to produce these two yellow lights that to us, you know, trichromatic normal track Crummins look totally identical. We're color blind to that difference. But to a Tetra Chromat, a woman with this fourth cone, they would look totally different. Yeah. So they brought her in. I said, okay, here it is. Do you see these as different? And she said, no, no, I don't see them as any to know, but the story doesn't end there.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Good. Jay told us about a colleague of his in England because she's at New Castle named Gabrielle Jordan, and she apparently found eight of these women with the extra cone. And out of those eight, seven of those women behave exactly like the person that I had tested couldn't see the difference, but one of them took one look at those two yellows and said no, they look totally different to me. Oh, one of these women was saw. The south side is different. So one of them had the Koan but you could use it and the others had the cone but couldn't use it or yup. So why is that? Yeah, why? Well this is the part if you'd like, I could tell you what my theory is of what's going on. Yeah, so I think that right,

Speaker 4:          06:57          Jace has, let's just imagine you grew up in a world without color completely and totally a black and white world houses would be painted black and white printers with all the print in black and white. Even the TV, they would just have black and white TV. Women's makeup would be just, you know, either dark or light. So it wouldn't make any difference if you had color vision because you would never use that color vision. There'd be no words for color.

Speaker 5:          07:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          07:23          now, just to make an interesting, let's imagine one day a bright red apple plops into your world. How would you react to it?

Speaker 1:          07:33          What'd you see it you think, well, so that's a very good question. Maybe says j. Even though you have the ability to see that Red Apple, if you've never had a chance to use that ability to practice, it may just lay dormant and that he thinks might be what happens to women living with the extra cone in our world. They're very rarely subjected to colors that would stimulate their extra kind of cone differently. So you're saying those other colors just aren't around enough for them? Yeah. Everything that we make is based on the fact that humans are trichromatic. The television only has three colors. Our color printers have three different colors. There's nothing out there that we make artificially that a tetra chromatic could see. But Jay says maybe some women because they're just more aware or because of the job that they do. Maybe someone who works with color all the time, like a florist or a painter, little by little

Speaker 4:          08:29          because they're paying such close attention, their brain would learn to see that difference.

Speaker 6:          08:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          08:46          so naturally we wanted to find one of these mythic labels in that mythic. Maybe I say

Speaker 1:          08:52          that as it, cause we tried to find that one woman that he mentioned you the one out of eight.

Speaker 7:          08:56          Yeah. And we had a really hard time and we began to doubt that she even existed. And then we began to look online and you see all these websites thing, are you a tetra Chromat contact us, contact us. Everybody is searching for these women. And we began to feel like you were chasing Unicorns a little bit. But then our producer Tim Howard claimed, he claimed that he had found one calculating. Yeah, you are right on the parish street. He'd been in touch with j j told him that he tested a woman, determined that she had the fourth cone and this woman was an interior designer. Oh. But Jay had not yet determined whether she could use her fourth cone. So we sent Tim to Pittsburgh where she lives right there to see what he could find out. Hi, I'm Susan Hogan.

Speaker 3:          09:42          There are three and an interior designer. Lucia, like she's great or you have a jukebox. Really? You want me to play something? How about number three? Oh seven. It just seems appropriate cause it's about color. Wider shade of Pam. Um, she told me a lot about how she uses color in her work. You see the different colors of paint because she thinks a lot about it in terms of painting walls. I know the way the sun is oriented in a room, each wall will look a different color even though in any case, here's my plan. I ordered this test before I went to Pittsburgh that Jay had suggested I get at. Okay. Alright. Open it, open it up. It involved these little pieces of brown fabric. Okay. They all look identical. They look strikingly the same to me. Yeah. Lynn, Brenna, me, Soren. Those are completely indistinguishable. Couldn't see a difference. They all look the same to you guys. Yes, but I'm assuming they're actually not all the same. That's the trick. Jay said, if you show them to a real tetra Chromat, they're going to be able to see these subtle differences that you know, you and I can't see.

Speaker 3:          10:50          And I'm back to Pittsburgh. So how about we head over toward that tree? Is that, that looked good. Take my shoes off. Oh yeah. It'll be much more fun for me. We ended up doing the test in a nearby park. We're going to do a bunch of these, if you don't mind. The first trial I took out three of the swatches, two that were exactly the same and one that was supposedly different. And when you took it out, could you see the difference? No. No. Huh. So I go behind the tree and I whisper into the mic. Number three is different. Number three, I hope you couldn't hear me. Yeah, I'll let you take a look. She steps back in the swatches, gives a look for a moment and then she says number three said third one is different. It's more neutral, less red than one and two on the left. One for one luck. So I went behind the tree eye on second, changed up the swatches so that now the middle swatch was the odd one out and same, same deal. Ready, set, go easy. Which number? It looks different. The middle middling number two. You are right? Yeah. Wow. Okay. Then I figured I got to make it harder. I switched it up and I made it. So all three are different and I didn't tell her, oh three are different.

Speaker 8:          12:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:12          all three different I o green, red less red as I'm knocking it out of the park. I didn't, I do as well on my sats. Tim. Wow. You found her. I was sure that she was not going to be, there's no way this test can work. Well, it actually might not have totally worked. Right. What did she start to fail there? There's one little thing I didn't mention, but I brought along a friend, um, Jason Lacroix, painter landscape, still life thought. I try him out as a control cause you were thinking, uh, let's get someone who likes color but as a boy and can't be a Tetra Karma. Right. Okay. So, and, uh, when we tried the exact same tests with him, I mean these three, they look the same, don't they? To, you know, I see different, he was amazing. Uh, every time the first one on the last few jumped out immediately, number one, they all three look different to me.

Speaker 3:          13:09          Wow. Was he just as good as Susan? Yeah, I always a little bit disappointed. I gotta say it was no where, where he couldn't do it and she could no better than me. I only had pieces of brown cloth, you know, so it doesn't prove anything. I guess she still might be a tetra Chromat. Right. For All I know. And there was this one moment I had no, it doesn't prove anything, but I asked her, um, I asked her about the sky and the sky was just that quintessential sky blue and she was, I was like, what do you see? And she's like,

Speaker 7:          13:41          see, um, do you see some of the pink and the blue? See, I see a lot of pink. Like among the blue, there's red in that blue section, she was looking up at a blue sky. And seeing red. Yeah. Yeah. Do you see that? No. Oh, I see so much red like up here and it's,

Speaker 3:          14:00          uh, it's kind of a cop out, but it's just kind of that perfect sky blue.

Speaker 7:          14:04          Okay. That's, that's a good, it's just mixed in there. That's cool. I think I don't see is any green in that blue? I just see reds, right? Especially around the white clouded section.

Speaker 3:          14:17          And at that moment I felt like my sky is boring. I'm so sorry for you. For us. I'm sorry for us.

Speaker 7:          14:24          No, I mean, how do we know that any of this makes sense?

Speaker 3:          14:28          Yeah, that's the fine of it. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          14:34          So [inaudible] as a minutes. Hold is that phase at first just goes to the Tony Shayda. Hey,

Speaker 6:          15:04          Brown's browns, man about me. Joe's mad. She's just mad about me calling him. [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         15:28          you know, we haven't talked about yet. What's that? Um, where do the colors come from? Okay. I mean like, like I'm sky colors. No, no, like, like painterly colors. Like, uh, like marine blue and, oh, like artificial colors. Well, no, they're not out. That's the thing. You think they come from a factory or something, but originally they came from the earth. Yeah. And there's one story about Chloe that has haunted me for about a year and a half. It's so strange. I don't know if it's true or not, but I mean, I don't know if you've read my book of good. That's Victoria Finley again. Her book is called color. And this story starts with, well, a particular kind of goop. It's a color called Gumbos. It's um, it's named after Cambodia, a French word for Cambodia and it comes from the SAP of a tree that grows in the Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand border area. And this is a yellow color. It's a color

Speaker 6:          16:26          [inaudible].

Speaker 10:         16:27          How you get it is really the sticky part. I mean, the way they get it is that they cut a slash in the bark and then hitch up a tube made of bamboo about the circumference of a quarter. Yes. And then little droplets of goop come on. A little tiny drop does a good,

Speaker 11:         16:46          and they fill up the tube

Speaker 10:         16:48          the same way you do. You know, you get maple syrup or, or rubber, but they leave it for a couple of years. Years. Yes.

Speaker 6:          16:57          Aw.

Speaker 10:         16:58          All right. So it's a release

Speaker 11:         17:02          precious.

Speaker 10:         17:05          So slow drop. That's some pretty strange thing. Draw up

Speaker 10:         17:13          [inaudible] can happen in that time. What do you mean snap has secrets? Secrets. What? Secrets. Wait a minute. So after two long years, the harvesters come back and each of those tubes is now full of this. Um, quite quite like plastic. It sort of, it's got that sort of plastic resonate kind of feel, but that's just the beginning. The resin makes this incredible transformation, which we actually saw Sean and I. Hello. Thanks to this guy. My name is Charles claimer. I'm a color man. He owns creamers pigments in Manhattan and he sells this Cambos. It is an important yellow,

Speaker 7:          17:52          amazing when you use it [inaudible] powdered and the resin form because when you have a look at it or to this year, it's just like this and the doll it creed Brown. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         18:02          You imagine like a, a ball of earwax. I mean you think, well that's not very interesting coming out of Dusky sort of people are in color, but then you put a drop of water on it

Speaker 10:         18:12          or you grind it up in a bowl with a little water in your on that it looks like this blue. Let's see, and there it is. What does a little bit of lips bright, very bright yellows, bright fluorescent yellow. Suddenly it's like power. It means it is quite an excitedly color. Very, very loud.

Speaker 7:          18:34          I carried one around for ages so I to have a look at this color, look how boring it is now put a drop of water in it showing kids and I was really happy. I give them, gave it to one kid who was, you just said you light it and it was only afterwards that I found out that it's so dangerous. I mean I use dangerous. Why? Through get to bed.

Speaker 10:         18:52          Yeah. When the guys used to chip it in in small pieces was actually a time built in from the visit the toilet at least once an hour. Ian Garrett knows that because he was technical director at this art supply company called Windsor and Newton in England and here's what really got us interested in all this. Back in the 1980s Winsor and Newton would get these shipments of Cambos from Cambodia and they would take it to them to this production room. Quite a dusty area. Just had a table in there, big old table where the workers would set and then they would have this hammer, put the Cambos pieces on this lump of iron and then hit it, shatter it into small pieces because that's how they make it into a kind of usable, solvable paint. And one day one of the workers was chipping and scraping at the resin.

Speaker 10:         19:41          There they were, they found something in the resin that they didn't expect. They found bullets, bullets in the hunks of resin lodged in them. Yet sometime in the two year drip drip process toward the end, probably as the resume was getting thick, a bullet went through the air, went into the goop and stayed there. Actually, it wasn't just one bullet total of about a dozen and those are just the ones he found lying around the factory. There were probably many more. They fall into two salts. That's a very sharp pointed one about just over an inch long and then the other type A, a small sort of barrel shapes, which are about three quarters of an inch long and half a dozen of each. How they got there and what they pass through on the way into The Gambia, I'm not sure

Speaker 6:          20:34          [inaudible].

Speaker 12:         20:35          Well, we do know of course was that those years in Cambodia where years of war and murder, a million and a half people died there. Most of them in the killing fields and that's the same place where you'd find the gangbusters. I mean it's shocking really any cause it, those were just the random little bamboo tubes hanging on the trees. What happened in that grove? The proposition here would be that at some point, maybe because of the famous killing fields that some 14 year olds with collision of cough rifles after finishing a series of murders or just shot lots of bullets, just sprayed that growth. In order to get into the little tiny bamboo canisters collecting this gunboat, they would've had to have sprayed that entire grove with machine machine gun bullets. And in that year or two years, um, somebody, um, the ditch people I should think.

Speaker 10:         21:33          Yeah. Well, I mean, they, they, it's not necessarily a battle scenario. It could have been target practice. You see these things hanging on the side of a tree. You, you, you want to practice your a marksmanship.

Speaker 1:          21:45          But th I mean, there is a way in which the, there's violence in this color. I guess. There's fine. It makes me wonder about, does it ever give you pause?

Speaker 6:          21:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         21:55          did they ever give me what, sorry. Pause. Pause. No. Uh, not really. We would to remote bought it from a guy in Holland who bought it from an exporter who got it from Lord knows where in Cambodia.

Speaker 1:          22:11          But the idea that it could've been attached to to that.

Speaker 6:          22:15          Wow.

Speaker 10:         22:16          Bloodshed. Does that bother you at all? You're saying them? Do I think it's, it's morally acceptable. Is that what you're asking me? Yeah. Um, no. It wasn't Winsor Newton who discovered these things? These things were demanded by customers. You're a hard-hearted man. I feel I had never thought about it until you, you pitched it like that.

Speaker 1:          22:44          As we kept on talking, Ian made it clear. It wasn't that he hadn't thought about the violence per se. It's just, it wasn't like breaking news to him. They sell some pigments that come straight out of hills that are right in the middle of war zones. Okay. Colors are sometimes soaked in blood. That's just how it is.

Speaker 10:         23:01          On the other side of the coin, I've made it my career in 40 years to make artists' paints on the basis that people who paint tend not to make war. It's a peaceful occupation

Speaker 12:         23:14          that is more or less what the Euston George Kramer who runs the paint shop, he was pretty much of the same mind. You could think of it this way. Imagine the first person to ever find this brilliant yellow, maybe 10,000 years ago. He's walking through the forest after it's rained and he sees it there on a tree and he's amazed. So he puts his finger into the yellow and then Dab some on his face and he feels instantly beautiful, like larger than himself. It is about being to something

Speaker 13:         23:47          transcendent and that just George is the other side of the coin to an upper high or whatever. Therefore, [inaudible] from all sorts of ceremonies, marriages, feasts, maybe warpaint to feel invincible any moment he suspects that needed to be pulled out of the ordinary and lifted up. And you need something that is prior to something which is beautiful and special and this yellow gives her something special.

Speaker 14:         24:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         24:22          it is perfect in all

Speaker 14:         24:40          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          25:07          Thank you to Victoria Findlay. Her book is called color, short and simple. When to Ian Garrett, um, of Windsor and Newton who did not wither under our withering moral attack on contrary.
