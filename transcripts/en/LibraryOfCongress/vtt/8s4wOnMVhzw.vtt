&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Hello
everyone, thanks for coming

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.780
out on a beautiful summery
June day here in Washington DC.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.590
My name is Rob Casper,
I'm the head of the Poetry

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.080
and Literature Center here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.100
And I'm thrilled to welcome you all

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.430 position:56%
to our inaugural LGBT poetry
celebration this afternoon featuring

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.590
poets Joan Larkin, Kamilah Aisha
Moon, D. A. Powell, and Dan Vera.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.640
This event could not be
possible without the contribution

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.360
of many organizations
and individuals both

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.530
within and outside the library.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.670
First, I would like to thank
Brock Thompson, former staffer

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.700
of the Poetry and Literature
Center and chair of LC Globe,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.300
the Professional Organization for
LGBT staffers here at the library

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.630
for coming up with the
idea of this event.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.830
I would also like to thank
our cosponsor at the Library

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.530
of Congress, the Rare Book and
Special Collections Division

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.290
and Chief, Mark Dimunation
who is back

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.360
in the other room safeguarding
the materials

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.730
which you will get a
chance to see later on.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.740
Rare Book Division curator, Mark
Manivong has also been responsible

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.590
for developing this program and
for curating the materials and I'd

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.160
like to thank him as well.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.270
But I'll tell you a little
bit more about him later.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.710
Finally, we are delighted
to be working

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.010
with an outside organization
Capital Pride and to be a part

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.210
of pride week here in
the nation's capital.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.970 position:56%
I would like to welcome Capital
Pride Board President, Bernie Delia,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.160
and thank its Executive
Director, Ryan Bos.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.850
We hope this is the first
-- oh there they are,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.650
please give them a
round of applause.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.300
[ Applause ]

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.150
We hope this is the first of many

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.400
such celebrations highlighting
the work of LGBT poets and writers

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.630
and their essential
contributions to our culture.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.940
So before we begin let me ask
you to take out your cell phones

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.530
and any electronic devices
that you have that might be on

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.450
and turn them off, so we can
make sure they don't interfere

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090
with today's event.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.360
I'll also tell you about the
Poetry and Literature Center.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.020
We are home to the poet laureate
consultant in poetry and we put

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.290
on literary reading
events and festivals

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410
like this all throughout the year.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.860
If you want to find out more
about the literary events here

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.360
at the Library of Congress
you can sign our sign-up sheet

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.520 position:56%
which is right outside, there's also
some information about the center.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.150
I also encourage you to find
out more about the Rare Books

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.580
and Special Collections Division.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.220
They have a reading room
upstairs on the second floor

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.580
of the Jefferson building
in which you can see some

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.600
of these materials firsthand.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.060
The Poetry and Literature
Center's website is www.loc/poetry

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.080
and the Rare Book and Special
Collections Division website

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.710
is www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.800
Now on to today's event.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.680
You can read about our
amazing quartet of poets

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.050
in your print program, which
all of you should have received.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.000
Each will read -- they'll
read in alphabetical order

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.290
and each will read their
own poems, as well as poetry

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.680
from the Rare Books and Special
Collection Division's LGBT

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.530
and poetry collection.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.920
Afterwards Mark Manivong

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.620
who I mentioned earlier will say
a few words about the collection

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.170 position:56%
and then he will walk back to LG113,
which is right back there and open

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.220
up the doors for you to come
in and check out the display.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.080
It's an amazing display,
I've never seen those tables

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.440
so full of materials.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.480
So I'm very excited to
check out what's there

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.520
and I hope you'll join us.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.500
We also have books for sale by
our poets right there in the back.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.000
I told him that it would be good
for them to sit at the tables

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.490
and do a book signing because
I'm sure many of you will want

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.510
to get your book signed by them,
but that they too will have time

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.970
to see the display
we'll make sure of that.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.420
But I encourage you to buy
their books even if they're

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.990
in the other room checking out the
materials let them know that you'd

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.140
like to get a book signed.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.410
So and now to say a few words about
capital pride and this celebration,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.510
please join me in welcoming
Ryan Bos.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.690
[ Applause ]

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.990
&gt;&gt; Ryan Bos: Thank you Rob.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.300
I want to definitely give thanks
to the Library of Congress

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.940
for hosting this event and reaching
out to us to actually include this

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.870
in what we call the pride

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.110
in the nation's capital
celebration this week.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.550
This is one of our first.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.360
This year has been -- works
out to have several firsts.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.130
Our first one was having our
first official event in Virginia.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.260
This is another first,
having another official event

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.430 position:56%
in a federal building agency working
with the Library of Congress,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700
part of our pride celebration.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.160 position:56%
Another first was having a letter
from President Barack Obama actually

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.870
in this year's pride guide.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.650
And another big first for us is
we'll have the first ever military

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.910
-- official military color guard
actually present the colors

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.850
and retire the colors at this
year's pride parade this Saturday.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.880
So we are very excited
that this community here

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.280
in the nation's capital is so
excited and willing to participate

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.580
on what Pride represents.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.100
And you by being here
today are doing the same,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.010
so thank you so much.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.800
With that I want to welcome
Joan Larkin to the state

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.000
who will begin tonight
or today's presentation.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:28.610
[ Applause ]

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.610
&gt;&gt; Joan Larkin: Thank you,
it's really an honor to be here

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.970
and to be reading with poets
whose work I admire so much.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.470
I'm going to read from two poets
whose work is in the collection

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.630
and so I'll start with
an Adrienne Rich poem

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.410
and after I read some
poems of my own I'll close

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.910
with May Swenson love poem.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.520
This book is in the collection,
but this is my own copy,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.390 position:56%
which I've had since the early 70's.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.170
It was published in 1973,
Diving Into The Wreck,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.400
which was a revelation at the time.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.330
I'm a hopelessly inveterately
a teacher,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.790
so I'm going to say
a couple of things

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.470
about this poem before
I read it to you.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.300
We're using to thinking of
rich as a poet of long lines,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.910
but this is a poem in short
lines with a lyric shape to it

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.950
and it's called song to remind us
of the tradition of lyric poetry.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:37.580
And in that mode she is speaking as
a woman poet who knows who she is

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.440
and is a poet of prophecy and
I'll say a couple of things

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.650
about it after I read it.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.460
Song you're wondering if
I'm lonely okay then yes,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.800
I'm lonely as a plane rides lonely
and level on its radio beam aiming

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.800
across the Rockies for
the blue strung aisles

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.890
of an airfield on the ocean.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:09.310
You want to ask am I lonely, well
of course lonely as a woman driving

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.680
across country day after
day leaving behind mile

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.130
after mile little towns
she might have stopped

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.170
and lived and died in lonely.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:27.010
If I'm lonely it must be the
loneliness of waking first,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.960
of breathing dawn's first
cold breath on the city,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.160
of being the one awake in
a house wrapped in sleep.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.820
If I'm lonely it's with the
rowboat ice fast on the shore

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.490
in the last red light of the
year that knows what it is.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:54.570
That knows it's neither ice
nor mud nor winter light,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.300
but would with a gift for burning.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.430
And if poetry is memorable
language I find

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.790
that last metaphor
really unforgettable.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.320
The passion of the poet
who knows who she is

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.770
and knows what burning
her language can do.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.680
And I love too that her
metaphoric landscape,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.010 position:56%
the house where she is the first
awake and Lincoln too used the house

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.360
as a metaphor for America.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.000 position:56%
So here was a poet who in 1971, when
she wrote that poem was fully aware

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.170
of her destiny and of
the power of her gift.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.690
She takes, you know, the O
vowel, the loneliness, you know,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.470
that can almost be like a
country-western song and turns it

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:55.040 position:56%
around and changes the value of that
word, the loneliness of the poet.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.000
So I'm going to read
from Blue Hanuman,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.850
which is my new book just out.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.480
A lot of the poems in this
book are about artists and art

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.660
and the first poem in
the book is Eye of Newt.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.690
My older brother gave me
art poetry when I was eight

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.670
or nine handed me Kafka
and Shakespeare

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.960
and I didn't know what it was,
but the language got to me.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.220
So the word life in this poem is
not life itself, but Life Magazine

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.890 position:56%
where he tore out a Picasso
reproduction and hung it on the wall

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.090
and that's where I
first encountered art.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.870
Eye of Newt.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:49.920
I was larval, I dreamed myself
downstairs in PJs still in my coma.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.190
Ba he said and I lay
next to the radio.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.740
Dark amber spread through
my girl brain,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:04.400
eye of newt already nestled
there and egg glued to a twig.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.630
My pale bespectacled brothers set
me on a leaf and watched me fatten.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:16.830
Franz Kafka he said and my new
long feelers brushed the wall.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.500
Girl before a mirror was
tacked there torn from life,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.540
her twin pair belly warm
pink as my own, half curled,

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.520
half crawling I burst
through skin after skin.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.000
Art I said and my wings
fanned slowly open.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.420
One of my friends who died at
the height of the AIDS deaths

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.820
in the 90's Dennis O'Sullivan,
a painter, inspired this poem.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:05.650
He was still painting in his
last week -- weeks of life.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.840
The title in your side
railed bed faces moves

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.500
into the first line of the poem.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.460
In your side railed bed faces,
brushed late nights on paper,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:25.950
mouth nots, dark ink wash
eyes staring into the abyss,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:31.620
world taped to the wall
of your next-to-last room.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.480
After they moved you no more
making, your face swollen

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.320
and no sign you saw me
wearing the fright mask grief

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.000
or my face under it.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:55.830
This is a short term poem about
Artemisia Gentileschi's one

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.770
of her three I think
paintings that she did.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.070
She was an Italian Baroque painter.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.820
Paintings of the slaying of
all Holofernes by Judith.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:16.300
And when I looked at it the sight
of two mattresses with blood

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.550
between them suggested
a female body.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:30.030
Artemisia in her third painting of
Judith a velvet knot of arms, head,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:36.880
fists, he's draped in c Carmine
and folds, her down his gold.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.810
She's forced his sword
into his dense neck.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:50.670
Under him the deep crease between
mattresses, a blood-soaked vagina.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:58.470
Well maybe I was seeing things,
but Artemisia her greatness

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.860
as a painter has often been
obscured by the kind of lurid story

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:11.210 position:56%
of the rape trial of a young painter
who worked in her father's studio.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:18.180
And she won the suit, but they put
thumb screws and other, you know,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.020
tortured her in other
ways to make sure

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.930
that the evidence she
was giving was the truth.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.370
So it goes.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:30.440
And I'm just going
to read a few more.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:37.920
As time goes on some of the
Yiddish that I heard spoken

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.830 position:56%
between my mother and my grandmother

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.770
in my childhood has been
creeping into my poems.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:48.840
And Yiddish is a language
that's rich in insults

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.230
and if you're a child hearing
them and knowing they are aimed

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.160
at you, you pay attention.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.690
So where is it, okay?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.510
So the first line of
the poem is in Yiddish,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.280
but the second line translates
it so you hear the meaning.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.180
The covenant, [foreign language].

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:16.950 position:56%
I was a piece of meat with two eyes,
an animal watching another animal.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.280
She fed, dressed, named
me, flushed my waist,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.760 position:56%
scrubbed my pink skin until it sang.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.000
The kitchen was hers where the
iceman's tongs pincered solid

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.590
blocks, cream rosin bottles
inching up past the lip.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:40.150
Coal roared through a
chute into the cellar.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.840
Unsaid invisible the weight
she carried, cold and dense

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.460
as the block the iceman shouldered
stung through his burlap rag.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.790
I lapped her scorn,
answered her bitter call.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.410
She needed to eat, I was her
meal, I was the nearest protein.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:14.260
And this is also a poem not
just about, but to my mother

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.970
in a very different tone

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:23.680
and the word you mother is not
Y-O-U, but E-W-E the animal.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.260
Summons are you asleep,
are you mute,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.340
are you empty now, are you alone?

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:38.420
You mother, shrike mother, where
did you go frost on a stone.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.870
Soft arms and harsh mouth
you could say I've kept them,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.610
but fold a sheet my own way.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.820
I'd like to show you.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:55.810 position:56%
I'm six, feverish, you're reading to
me white alps your shimmering alto.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.450
Were you awake when your
last string snapped?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:05.080
I'm yeast and air in a
crust quickly swallowed.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.940
Waking in twisted sheets I know how
the green smocked aid hoists you.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.060
When time is done with
me may there be mercy.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:22.920
You mother, shrike mother where
do you go frost on a stone.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:30.000
Are you asleep, are you mute,
are you empty now, are you alone?

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:46.390
This is an untitled
poem, eight lines.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.100
She broke the first
glass and kept launching.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.750
Some flew 10 feet, each
explosion wanted the next

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.400
and when she had nothing left to
throw kitchen covered in shards,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.630 position:56%
floor shining, hands stinging, shard
sticking out of one cheek she stood

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.740
in what she'd made
and was satisfied.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:24.620
So I'm going to read an erotic
poem by May Swenson and then close

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.050
with a short lyric of mine.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:34.680
And, you know, Swenson sort of hid
her sexual identity in plain sight,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.600
she was of a generation that
didn't want to claim the label.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.340
And when Elly Bulkin and I edited

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.130
in 1975 an anthology called Amazon
Poetry Swenson very excitingly gave

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.560
us permission to include a
poem called To Confirm a Ting

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.690
and said maybe people will finally
understand what this poem is

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.040
about in this context.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.350
But in 1980 when we wanted
to include poems of hers

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.920
in an anthology called lesbian
poetry she wrote a very irritated

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.800
letter to us and said why can't
you call it Amazon too, you now,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.560
and she refused permission.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.400 position:56%
But the year before she died in 1988
she gave permission to Carl Morris

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.750
and me to include this love
poem in gay and lesbian poetry

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.640
in our time and then she died so.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.940
Four word lines.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.510
Your eyes are just like bees
and I feel like a flower.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:45.210
Their brown power makes
a breeze go over my skin.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:49.870
When your lashes ride down and rise

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:58.070
like brown bee's legs your
pronged gaze makes my eyes gauze.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:03.070
I wish we were in some shade and
no swarm of other eyes to know

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:10.630
that I'm a flower breathing bare
laid open to your bee's warm stare.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:17.390
I've let you wade in me and seize
with your eager brown bee's power,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.200
a sweet glistening at my core.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:35.630
And I'll close with Cut Leaf
Beach, which ends this book.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:43.000 position:56%
Half-closed eye after eye climbs
her rough smooth swells like the God

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.200
of breast I worship
with my touch mouth.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.510
Silver tree skin, robin
running on two legs,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:21:00.110
twisted rope of wisteria tell me my
nipple is an eye and where I walked

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.580
in milk light trees
are feeding the dark.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.800
Cars, cars rushing where I sleep.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:16.560
Eyes closed, mouth open, blown
bird press your shaking branch.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.510
Thank you.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:32.010
[ Applause ]

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.310
&gt;&gt;

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.890
&gt;&gt; Kamilah Aisha Moon:
Good afternoon.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:40.470
It is indeed a pleasure to be
in this company of poets and all

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:46.090
of your company in this
place for this fine occasion.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.300
I'm also going to read two poems

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.090
from writers included
in the archive.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.760
And I think I'll start with a
brief home by Countee Cullen

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:04.200
who was a seminal figure
in the Harlem Renaissance.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.090
I have a rendezvous with life.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:13.050
I have a rendezvous with life,
in days I hope will come.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.940
Ere youth has sped and strength of
mind, ere voices sweet grow dumb.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.680
I have a rendezvous with life,
when spring's first heralds hum.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.570
Sure some would cry it's better
far to crown their days with sleep

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:36.810
than face the road, the wind and
rain, the heed the calling deep.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:42.490
Though wet nor blow nor space
I fear, yet fear I deeply too,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.720
lest death should meet and claim
me ere I keep life's rendezvous.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:55.430
And the second poet is
Rigoberto Gonzalez who just won

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.860
in gay poetry the Lambda
Literary Award last night,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.430
so very happy for him.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.010
An amazing poet you
should check his work out.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:11.540
This is called Full Moon on
the Night My Father Died.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:17.160
And then silence, no mouth
with the urge for teeth,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.800
a hand without its
switch, stones not feet.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.230
If a woman cries and is not
heard there was no grief,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.820
no lead collapsing at the knee,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.600
no widow spilling open
like a sack of feed.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.130
The moon having paused
to see moves on.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.520
Just another night's comma,
just another eyelid fluttering

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.420
to the flash of lighting, the
living call father or husband

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.800
or son what the dead
call anti-sleep.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.960
And now I will read from my
collection, this is She has a Name.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.130
And about two thirds
of this collection is

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:06.270
about a family's journey with
a daughter who has autism

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:12.170
and all the dynamics that
come with that condition.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:18.260
This first poem when I
first turned this collection

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.820 position:56%
in to be published the statistic was
1 in 150 American families dealing

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.180
with autism and I'm going to
use the most recent statistic.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.710
Borderless country, 1
in 68 now this glitch

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.920
in babies poised to
unlock the world.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.700
These daughters and sons of poets,
store clerks, salesmen, CEOs,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.770
janitors and actors cast
into this permanent script.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.870
Souls we love turned like the faces

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.660
of flowers thrust toward
a rogue sun.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.950 position:56%
We are the earth we walk, what
seeps here is the air fighting back,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:03.710
is the water slowing baskets
down sending them back upstream.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.290
Are we changing?

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.030
Dear God, are they here to tell
us in a way we can't ignore

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.080 position:56%
that we aren't changing fast enough.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.170
Autism, the one drop rule for
minds we strain to understand,

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.970
the catchall phrase that
drops kids off at nowhere

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:26.840
that you don't exist once you
turn 18 at native tongue of one.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.400
At white knuckle cobbled
through touch across time.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.510
At marquee symptoms while
causes lurk at beauty

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.370
that demands seas of patience.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.380
What about that drug
I took once, vaccines

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.550
or some karmic boomerang I
don't remember throwing its

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.590
stealth return.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:53.750
One in 68 apples of
somebody's eye, 1 in 68 my baby,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.590
1 in 68 now a new child breaths.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:04.460
Private riddles of our loving
strapped on many backs.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:12.800 position:56%
Breach. It seems the most special of
beings endure harrowing beginnings.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.270
The covering physician didn't know
her body's history, he treated mama

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.540 position:56%
with less grace than a laboring mare
almost dragging her off the table

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.770
and she had no choice as he
ripped my sister into this world.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.010
Father's voice.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.080
The last thing I ever
wanted was to let her down.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.370
I held her high in the bowels of
my biceps until her legs began

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.000
to grapevine around mine.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.630
She didn't wriggle like my older
girls did restless for ground, no.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:55.960
Lord, no please not my baby girl,
not the one named after mama gone.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.470
Mouth carved just like
hers like mine.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.400
What could I have done?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.520
Held her as long as any
father's strength could stand her

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.030
growing weight.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.520
What next?

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.190
My chromosome limps
in her bloodstream.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.300
The proof years later my
brother's son scales this cliff.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.070
I'm not allowed to say I don't
want to pay what she will cost us.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:27.400 position:56%
I'll work myself into pulp, withhold
my tongue and practice nothingness.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.030
Cockroach logic, if I
don't move I'm not really

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.200
against this wall back
leaning in harsh light.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.940
I won't hold my wife's hand
and skip words like stones.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.880
I'll become a dike of a
man, fall asleep in front

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.340
of the TV nightly until I burst.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.720
Mother. I watch the backs of
college girlfriends trailing off

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.430
to mobile lives, I watch
them until they were blips.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.610
Ours was a sacred [inaudible],
waterfalls of words between us,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:08.760 position:56%
silhouettes in love tending our own,
the hours, clouds floating past,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.610
bed in the sky where rain slept.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:18.530
I often wake up dizzy, the sun
mocking us as it dosses her face.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:26.500
My husband says nothing, his kisses
shallow, what we don't say we eat.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:36.250
Stigma. She hated that
short yellow bus.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.940
The sentence felt each
day it pulled upside

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.440
to McMurray Junior
High's curb delivering her

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.000
to locker lined halls full of
metallic seventh grade [inaudible].

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.370
No room for gray.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.140
Between is a hard place to live.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.950
She shuns wheelchairs and mongoloid
faces mad that her mind will fight

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:11.210
to keep her quarantined from
her own car, yard, babies.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.540
You are or you are not, you're
sick or you're well, one thing

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.760
or another, but it's never that
simple like breathing should be.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.320
Between is a hard place to live.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.740
Each morning she stretches
her fingers toward a life just

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.340
out of reach and gradually
squeezes into a seat

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.000
at a table that bonks her knees.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.730
College is not cadences, not
a promise land to independence

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.550
to normal, not etched in stone.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.590
Come down from your mountain
[inaudible] of longing,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.000
discover your own root to
paradise we'll meet you there.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.590 position:56%
And I think I'll read this one here.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.280
Waving they stand behind the screen

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.790
as they always have
sacred sentinels.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.350
When did it happen?

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.750
The soul dry rot, the
end of heavy breathing,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.260
the loss of their first names,

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.610
their bones in the arthritic
dog [inaudible] limbs brace

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.200
against each other
in the yard wavering

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.180
in January wind without bloom.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:44.490
Each visit home frays me, the price
I pay for being able to drive away.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:54.800
This is a New York poem, watching
a woman on the M101 express.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.600
I live in Brooklyn now I
guess I should say that yes.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.630
You sit in a hard blue seat, one of
the ones reserved for the elderly

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.840
or infirm, a statue of me.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.170 position:56%
Your mouth open as if waiting for
water or medicine, as if [inaudible]

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:18.260
or some ice age hit right
after terrible news.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.290
Oblivious to the metro's bump
and buck, to the toddler begging

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.760
in Spanish to be freed
from her stroller

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.870
to my ogling you sit
embalmed, raccooned or moosed.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.880 position:56%
You have the kind of eyes that never
quite close even in deepest sleep.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.340
Lives an undersized T-shirt
that leaves belly exposed.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.740
Tears navigate molds,
veteran swimmers

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.740
of your creek bed face
I can't stop looking.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.520
You can't get over whatever
has happened, so shell-shocked

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.320
that birds could land and roost.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.120
I want to ask just so you know
someone is paying attention,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.560
but not enough to know what
ravages, it's rude to stare.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.550
I'm from the south, a suburb

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:08.130
where grief pulls the shades
first, stays home if indecent.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.470
But your sorrow struts
four rows down from me,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:16.510
strands you an astronaut on
some distant undiscovered moon.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.630
Bodies to your left and right read
papers, nap, send text messages,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.400
you sit in a hard blue
seat mouth open.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.560
I study the pink of
your jaw and wonder

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.450
if you'll come back
before your stop comes.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:38.390
Now I think I will end
with something sweet.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:44.760
Yes, to a camellia blossom.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:52.940 position:56%
I saw your pretty head lying beneath
the bush without thinking I kneeled

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.700
and cradled you peddle
sighing into grateful palms.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.150
Beauty face down is an abomination.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:05.020
Why must you suffer the
weight of early perfection,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.420
your vividness lifts me, lifts all,

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.580
I wanted to hold you
just like that until.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:18.290
I know this kind of blooming well
to be so lush, inside so swollen

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.040
with life that what was
meant to hold you up can't.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.970 position:56%
I wasn't meant to hold you, yet here
we are on this stray [inaudible]

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:32.130
in April trembling and
fulfilled, unlikely and true.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.720
Before I knew what to call you
I reached and imagined season

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.140
after season [inaudible].

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.510
Thank you.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.680
&gt;&gt; D. A. Powell: It is an honor
and a privilege to be here today

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:06.720
with my peers, my sisters and
my brothers and to read for you

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:13.970 position:56%
from a couple of poets who
inspired me in my journey as a poet.

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:20.040
I'm going to begin with a
poem by Muriel Rukeyser,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.400 position:56%
it's entitled Looking at Each Other.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.750
Yes, we knew each other very well.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.670
Yes, we had made love with
each other many times.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.870
Yes, we had heard music together.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.490
Yes, we had gone to
the seat together.

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.910
Yes, we had cooked
and eaten together.

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:49.450
Yes, we had laughed
often day and night.

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:53.070
Yes, we fought violence
and knew violence.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.980
Yes, we hated the inner
and outer oppression.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.700
Yes, that day we were
looking at each other.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.520
Yes, we saw the sunlight
pouring down.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.090
Yes, the corner of the
table was between us.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.460
Yes, bread and flowers
were on the table.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.730 position:56%
Yes, our eyes saw each other's eyes.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.380
Yes, our mouths saw
each other's mouths.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.860
Yes, our breasts saw
each other's breasts.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.500
Yes, our bodies entire
saw each other.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.530
Yes, it was beginning in each.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.690
Yes, it threw waves
across our lives.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.350
Yes, the pulses were
becoming very strong.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.960
Yes, the beating became
very delicate.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.210
Yes, the calling the arousal.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.250
Yes, the arriving the coming.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.590
Yes, there it was for both entire.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.000
Yes, we were looking at each other.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.740
Walt Whitman.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:15.160
Passing stranger, you do not know
how longingly I look upon you.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.990
You must be he I was
seeking or she I was seeking.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.200
It comes to me as of a dream.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:32.560 position:56%
I have somewhere surely lived a life
of joy with you, all is recalled

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:40.030
as we flip by each other, fluid,
affectionate, chaste, matured.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:45.490
You grew up with me, were a
boy with me or a girl with me.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:48.840
I ate with you and slept with you.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:56.390
Your body has become not yours
only nor left my body mine only.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:02.270
You give me the pleasure of your
eyes, face, flesh as we pass.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:08.390
You take of my beard,
breast, hands in return.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.640
I am not to speak to
you, I am to think of you

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.550
when I sit alone or
wake at night alone.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:22.030
I am to wait, I do not doubt
I am to meet you again.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:26.310
I am to see to it that
I do not lose you.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.690
So I'm going to read
a couple of poems

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:40.850
from my collection Useless
Landscape or a Guide for Boys,

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:48.380
which came out I guess two years
ago now, it's hard to keep up.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:53.490
One of the -- well the original
intent of this collection was

00:37:53.490 --> 00:38:02.200
to elegize and to celebrate the
interior landscape of California,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.260
which is a place in
transition, a place moving

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.800
from farm to suburban to urban.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:18.450
And watching that change
was the first intent

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.710
of that book and chronicling it.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.210
But, you know, what happens is

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.190
as you're writing other subjects
take precedence and what I realized

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:35.480
after I wrote the book is that
this book became a way of affirming

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.780
and celebrating a queer
life in a rural setting.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:52.420
And so I'm going to begin
with one of the early poems

00:38:52.420 --> 00:39:05.900
and you will hear the lives sort of
coming to the forefront of the poem

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:12.330
and it's called Landscape
with Sections of Aqueduct.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:22.030
If the crown of the day is not
gold, then it's a marvelous fake.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.960
Merciful present tense.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.680
If the brown grass
is always flowing,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.030
if the sun is always just
brushing the dry hills

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:39.290
and if last summer's suicide is
still a loner whose white T-shirt

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:45.180
knotted so tight it had to be
cut off his neck with a knife.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:50.840
In evening is the same bare
patch and the same fat crows,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:56.490
the crushed aluminum cans and the
hamburger wrappers or the ribbon

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:01.710
of tire tread where a
road crew hasn't come by.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:07.140
They have taken him away and I
do not know where he is laid.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.210
Among the soft cheat and metal
barley a live oak bags relief

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.090
from the hardened light.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:19.270
The beating of its own gnarled
limbs and the unrelenting rustle

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:25.140
of its own beige blooms that tumble
together shyly like a locker room

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.600
of boys once boisterous
now called to roll

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.750
and suddenly bashful
clasping at dingy towels.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.270
Let the dead be modest.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:43.360
If the tree solitary being
who feeds on wind and the moat

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.120
of another's distant
beauty cause to brag.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:53.500
Except that the kernel would fall
upon the soil it abides alone.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.000
One guy peeled labels
off beer bottles here,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.290
another climbed the
remaining concrete piles

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.260
and wrote Justin loves,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:11.610
wrote Stephen loves wrote
hang them high class of 93.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:18.770 position:56%
Cabbage mobs flickered in Tansey
and clustered broom rape or the pain

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:24.020
of creation for a little
yellow dust, a smear of light

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:30.540
on their fidgeting legs and
the sudden buoyancy in updraft.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:40.000
Ruin by the wayside you took
as sacrament you abiding rock.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.930
This poem takes its
title from a film

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.160
by Bruce Beresford
entitled Tender Mercies.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:03.630 position:56%
The film bears sort of a
tangential relationship to the poem.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:08.080
In the film are Robert Duval plays
a country singer who has sort

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.550
of hit rock bottom
and has to go back

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.850
to where he started and start over.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:19.590
We all got to do that sometimes.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.130
Tender mercies.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:32.300
The dandelions ditch blown
brewed the evening snow

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.810
and dew soaked flocks.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.520
The brewers pea, the
[inaudible] pea,

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.340
these the bright eyes
of the viridian fields.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:48.360
In chaparral the hillside pea and
angled pea intensities of light

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.890
and pump that distress
the easy upswept grass.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.390
That smack the rain
plants as it smudges past

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.860
and penetrates the canvas.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.970
The smattering on field and
railroad tracks both hearty blooms

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.840
and dainty flowers.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:13.510 position:56%
The judge's house, the chicken farm,
a migratory camp of flesh motel,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.840
a stucco digs where all

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:21.650
that mitigates the August swelter
is the swamp coolers immutable bur.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.830
A straggling house that draws
its water from a hard water well

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:31.250
and flushes out with the
help of a crude sump pump.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.960
Before the flatland is occluded
by the staunch of light at the end

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.330
of day I wanted to be
content with all its surfaces,

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.620
weed, barb, crack, rill rise.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.070
But every candid shoot

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:53.000
and [inaudible] branch depends
upon the arteries beneath.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.750
The houses have their siphons and
their circuit vents, the heart,

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:06.230
I mean the literal heart must
rely upon its own plaque valves.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:10.370
The duodenal canal it's
unremitting grumble.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:16.680
The brain upon its stem and
underneath a network vast

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.490
of nerves that rationalize.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.220
The earth's a little
harder than it was,

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:30.230
but I expect that it will soften
soon voluptuous in some age hence

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:36.120
because we captured it as art the
moment it was most itself fragile,

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.100
flecked with nimble weed

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.460
and so alone it almost
welcomed its own ravishment.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:48.650
I was a maiden in this versicolor
plain, I watched it change,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.500
withstood that change the
infidelities of light,

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:59.500
the solar interval, the shift of
time, the shift from farm to town.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.380
I had a man that pressed
me down into the soil.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:10.410
I was that man, I was that town.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:15.950
They called the chicory
ragged sailors here sojourners

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:19.740
who have finally returned
and are content

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.190
to see the summer to its end.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.350
Be unafraid of what
the future brings,

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.000
I will not use this
particular blue again.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.360
And I'm going to finish with
a poem which was written

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:52.610
for a young man I knew when I
was a young man, very young.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:56.300
How many of you dated a Mormon
missionary at some point?

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.290
It happens right yes.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:08.760
And there's that, you know,
unfortunate conflict that arises.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:17.310
So to celebrate his life
I wrote missionary man.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.520
We must bear away the body to
another place, that's Oscar Wilde.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:28.450
And the second epigraph
that begins the poem Isaiah.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.000
Then said I here am I send me.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:41.900
The product of poor radiography
this one rectangular window

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.280
through which the faintest
of flowers might be seen.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:53.140
As each plastered vegetative
I awoke in traction and sought

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.720
to be dismissed from the unreliable
dispensary to which it was tied.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.550
So too did I petition to be moved

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.770
into any upper room
that might have me.

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:08.010
Let the next who comes invite me

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:13.530
so if night can take it shall
we thread it like a spider,

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:19.250
glance around its unlit cistern
complexing our moonstruck strands

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:24.940
toward the vortices we've
kept from thus exploring.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:31.360
Let him knock with a promise of
books, good looks, cutaway collar,

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:37.470
skinny black tie, the pocket
protector with his name engraved.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.660
For the bandages were still

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.830
to be unwound had I ever
thought about being saved.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:52.050
No, I had only ever
thought about being spent.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.600
And unmined in my bones I
fostered such attraction

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.580
to this ardent host himself,

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:04.990
the aseptic argent lancet
brought to pierce me in my side.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:12.210
It was his first penetrating glance
that filled me with a sudden surge

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:18.390
of blood, rack, rent
and bungle of my corpus.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:23.820
Let me say I stank like the
rim of hell in all my lust

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.090
and would've blushed
at my own heat if not

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:31.930
for the shameless eagerness
in his eyes.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:37.520
The world is full of
lovely but tragic boys.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:45.430 position:56%
Get me on the joy bus I said, nobody
ever really rides the joy bus.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:49.130
He prepared a place for
me in the empty houses,

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.140
received me in the
shaded summer lawns,

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.660
wrapped in our own light
jackets at the river bottoms,

00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.860
hid in Manzanita clumps
the break the brittle fern.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.420
In the foyer of a Pentecostal
church where we took our gladness

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:10.000
to spite the pious, took the
praise of God as an offering

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.580
of our bodies each of us
crouched in the doorway in turn.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.680
Mouth to the vine,
lips to the Eucharist,

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.690
flesh of my astonished flesh.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:35.330 position:56%
John my elder, John my boy, the body
is dead to us naughty then gone.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:42.100
Suffer me to kiss thy mouth of
John, I will kiss thy mouth.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:49.560
Let him be born of every ash
that glows in the oil drums

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.860
of winter parks, let
lesions disappear,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.300
let brittle bones be
knit, let the integrity

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.440
of every artery be restored.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:07.860
There is no God, but that
which visits us in skin and few

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:13.250
and pleasing face he
offers up this body.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.000
By this body we are saved.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:28.840
[ Applause ]

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.460
&gt;&gt; Dan Vera: It's a great
delight to read today

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:38.990 position:56%
and to follow such astounding verse.

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:47.570
I'd actually -- when I was asked
which poet I was going to read

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:51.480
from I'd originally
mentioned James Broughton,

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.160
a poet that I corresponded
with before he died.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.620
But discovering that
today's actually --

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.040
would've been the 88th birthday

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.920
of Alan Ginsberg I
decided sort of to switch.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:07.030
And so I'm reading two
poems by Ginsberg to begin.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:11.040
The first is in the collection
and the second that I know

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.150 position:56%
of isn't published anywhere, but due
to the Rainbow History Archives here

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:20.400 position:56%
in Washington, DC they have an audio
recording from the very first march

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.880
on Washington 35 years ago this
October, October 14th, 1979.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.790
A poem at the very first march

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.700
on Washington -- gay
march on Washington.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.670
There were two poets
present, Alan Ginsberg was one

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.510
and Audre Lorde was the other.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.810
And those audio recordings
are evidence of their words.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:45.770
So the first poem, he read two
cones so I'm reading what he read

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.070
on the other side of the capital.

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:54.420
The weight of the world is love
under the burden of solitude,

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.410 position:56%
under the burden of dissatisfaction.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:01.570
The weight, the weight
we carry is love.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.830
Who can deny in dreams
it touches the body,

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.420
in thought constructs a miracle,

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.830
in imagination anguishes
till born inhuman.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:16.560
Looks out of the heart burning
with purity for the burden

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:23.350
of life is love, but we carry the
weight wearily and so must rest

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.080
in the arms of love at last.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.200
Must rest in the arms of
love no rest without love,

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.800
no sleep without dreams
of love, be mad or chill,

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.380
obsessed with angels or machines.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.250
The final wish is love cannot
be bitter, cannot deny,

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:46.180
cannot withhold if denied.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:52.250
The weight is too heavy, must give
for no return as thought is given

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:57.280
in solitude in all the
excellence of its excess.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.470
The warm bodies shine together
in the darkness, the hand moves

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:07.190
to the center of the flesh,
the skin trembles in happiness

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.310
and the soul comes
joyful to the eye.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:19.180
Yes, yes that's what I wanted,
I always wanted, I always wanted

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:24.320
to return to the body
where I was born.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:29.880
Congress and American people
how can you help yourself?

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.160
We have come out here to help you
to ease your grief-stricken hearts.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:41.820
Fear of gays is claustrophobia,
closed minds, violence, accusation,

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.860
hypocrisy, tough hearts
hiding panic.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:51.540
This day's gay liberation can mean
liberation of heterosexual dignity,

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.230
social delight, city
playfulness, country tolerance,

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:59.880
national nonaggression,
international charm

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.340
and spiritedness, enlightened
masculine gentleness,

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.020
feminine mutual affection,

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:11.190
granny wisdoms old-fashioned
open-mindedness.

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:16.640
Diversity of the physical body
politic, yay a self-acceptance

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.880
of body, humor of speech,
spaciousness, friendliness,

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.330
sensitivity, the dignity and
wisdom of the whole blue sky

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.000
of the mind we stand under.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:46.180
So a poem that opens my last
book inspired by Joan's reading,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:54.700
the title is in Yiddish
so it's titled Fetch.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.690
As my gentile tongue screws

00:54:56.690 --> 00:55:01.550
up that perfect Yiddish sound
him complains we have no right

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:04.180
to a word if it's pronounced.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.560
I tell her cry me the river
Grande River and recite the litany

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.080
of the beautiful mid bland.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.400
They made [foreign language]
[inaudible] merely jolly

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.000
and drove the angels
right out of Los Angeles.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.820
They even made [foreign
language] into what a loop.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:28.590
And then I learned it's from the
Arabic Guadalupe from Waddy Lupus

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.730
for the valley where wolves reside.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:36.990
Folded up and carried over oceans
and epochs, syllable reminders

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.820
of our grandmother's voices
that reside inside the hollow

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.700
of the ear till they
come cascading miraculous

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:51.020
out of a stranger's mouth mangled
accents and twisted tenses all.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:58.100
This next poem was inspired
by something in the Library

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.420
of Congress collection which is
a wax cylinder recording that's

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:06.930
believed to be the only existing
recording of Walt Whitman.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:12.050
And many believe, you
know, Whitman to be one

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:13.560
of the pillars of American poetry.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.970
If there's another pillar the other
pillar would be Emily Dickinson.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:21.100
And thinking of that wax
cylinder of Whitman made me wonder

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.330
about Emily Dickinson's voice.

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:28.140
And this poem titled Emily
Dickinson at the Poetry Slam.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.050
I will tell you why
she rarely ventured

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:35.380
from her house it happened
like this.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.080
One day she took the
train to Boston,

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.100
made her way to the darkened room,

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.460
put her name down in cursive
script and waited her turn.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:49.670 position:56%
Poets before her stood and rhymed,
followed a meter tight and expected,

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.950
outdoing one another
in a monotonous clip.

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:56.530
When they read her name aloud
she made her way to the stage,

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:01.220
straightened the papers in her
hands, pages and envelopes,

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.740
the backs of grocery bills.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:08.590
She closed her eyes for a
minute, took a breath and began.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:14.470
From her mouth perfect words
exploded, intact formulas of light

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:19.580
and darkness she dared to rhyme
with words like cochenille

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.570
and describe the skies like diadem.

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:27.190
Obscurely worded incantations
filled the room with an alchemy

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.220
that made the very molecules quake.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:33.440
The solitary words she
handled in her upstairs room

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.780
with keen precision came rumbling

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.730
out to make the electric
lights flicker.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:43.220
Forty members of the audience
were treated for hypertension.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.920 position:56%
Twenty-year-old dark haired beauty's
found their heads had turned a

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.470
Moses white.

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:52.660 position:56%
Her second poem erased the memory
of every cell phone in the nightclub

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.770
and by the fourth line of the
sixth verse the grandmother

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:59.830
in the upstairs apartment had
been cured of her rheumatism.

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:02.750
The papers reported
the power outages,

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:07.640 position:56%
area hospitals taxed their emergency
generators and sirens were heard

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.690
to wail through the night.

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.390
Quietly she made her
way to the exit,

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.390
walked to the terminal
and back to Amherst.

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:20.000
She never left her room again and
never read such syllables aloud.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:33.190
A praise poem for a radical
fairy brother named Coca.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.620
This poem is titled Balanesia
[assumed spelling] in Suburbia.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:46.170
Praise Cocoa born Bruce who every
week bought an orchid for his cell

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.500
between the elevator
and the board room.

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:55.410 position:56%
Who misted the meticulous and thus
transformed suburbia into Balanesia.

00:58:55.410 --> 00:59:00.270
Everyone knew Bruce for the ways
he broke forth from blandness

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.460
with the spotted cowls
of [inaudible],

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:08.170
cymbidium striped fingers and
the purple mouths of dendrobium.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:12.490
All of them pouring over
the cubbyholes of work life.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:18.910 position:56%
Praise what resided in Cocoa to know
what could love a light florescent

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.000
and make the stale
air bloom with hue.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:35.480
So my father who I had a loving
and troubled relationship

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:44.320
with passed away a little over
a month ago and given the topic

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.670
of the reading I thought
I would read this poem

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:51.130
for my first book titled
Father's Day for Gay Boys.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.970
One beside another
brothers seven dividers

00:59:56.970 --> 01:00:00.850
of what lies beyond the
truths we have uncovered.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.890
One makes three, then four,

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:08.230
then more until we move
beyond our numbers.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.730
There is thunder over
the city tonight

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.870
and of the million hearts
we may never see here

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:16.460
in the circle we make commitments.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:22.240
We push the limits of earthly
loving, electricity visits again

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.940
and the black skies pulse
with light, currents of power

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:31.980
by some capillary action,
sons kiss their fathers,

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.640
sons kiss their fathers to sleep

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.020
and the rose eyed boy
remembers himself again.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.900
We are not the sons they ordered
with their patriotic dreaming,

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.270
we are not the sons they
expected to come down the line,

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:54.210
but we unfold beyond such
kind paternal ignorance,

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:59.260
we unfold within the measure
of our time and we make peace

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.670
with the fathers inside of us.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:06.000
We give birth to a hidden
long carried joy within.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.260
I wanted to read a poem
by William Meredith

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.300
who was the first gay
poetry consultant.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.780
I'm not sure exactly how out
he was during his consultancy,

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.360
but certainly by the end of his
life he and Richard Hartley,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.640
another writer, wrote and talked
about their lives together.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.850
This poem is titled
A Couple of Trees.

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:44.750
The two oaks lean apart for light,
they aren't as strong as lone oaks,

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.150
but in a wind they
give each other lea.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:53.930 position:56%
Daily since I cleared them I can see
them tempting to chainsaw an axe,

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.650
two hardwoods leaning
like that for light.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.840
A hurricane tore through the
state one night picking up roof

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.810
and henhouse, boat and dock.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:10.040
Those two stood leafless,
twigless, giving lea.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.870
Last summer ugly slugs
unleafed the trees,

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:18.390
environmental kids
wrote Gypsy mods suck.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:23.160
The V of naked oaks leaned
to the light for a few weeks,

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.030
then put out slight second
leaves, scar tissue, pale as racks,

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:33.320
bandaged comrades lending
each other lea.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.290
How perilous in one another's
V our lives are yoked

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:43.010
in this yoke two men
leaning apart for light,

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.650
but in a wind who give
each other lea.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.070
And two more poems.

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:59.400
This was written -- I'm
forgetting now I think it was

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.740
when Delaware enacted marriage
equality, it was written

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.250
for that day, but it seems
to have been repeated.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:11.430
This is titled On a Day
When Another State Sees Us.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:15.780
Recognizes us for who
we are, how we love,

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.670
how we commit ourselves
to one another.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:24.920
I tell you look lover laugh a
little to say the word husband,

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.790 position:56%
so strange to me, two syllables I
never believed it could be mine much

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:35.510
less take the appearance
of one so sweet and kind.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:40.280 position:56%
Years from now perhaps at the
insistence of gentleness has its way

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.130
who we are together will not be
remarkable, merely the first names

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.660
on the role of some
kind of permanence.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.950
The words do not mean more than our
promises, but they are something,

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:59.530
they a reality longed
for lived and died for,

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:01.460
I will not make light of it.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:08.160
Although I will giggle a little
thinking this is our life together.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:18.500
And I'll close with a poem about
[inaudible] the 60's it opens

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:25.750 position:56%
with am epi thingy from the New
York Times, actually from an article

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:29.900
in the New York Times
dated December 17, 1963.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.000
The poem is titled
Lingering Fraction.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.250
Some homosexuals claim
infallibility in identifying others

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.520
of their kind by the eyes.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.530
There's a look that lingers a
fraction of a second too long.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.490
Growth of overt homosexuality
in city provokes wide concern.

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.160
New York Times.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.830
Hail the lingering
fraction that secured us.

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.730
That inborn longing that led
us to one another one by one

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:09.720
on the corners under the
streetlamps of the inviting city.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.500
Hail the steal of spirit
that attempted to believe

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.490
that ventured forth from body to
body when the law and word was

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:20.940
to condemn, to revile,

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.350
to electrocute a mind
so wedded to love.

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:30.460
Hail the glimmer of recognition
in the eyes of those we sought,

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.550
who reflected back that
fraction of belonging,

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:40.390
who spoke without words what
the heart would dare to admit.

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:42.190
Thank you.

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:49.150
[ Applause ]

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.210
&gt;&gt; Mark Manivong: Thank you again
to our poets for being here today.

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:54.340
My name is Mark Manivong and
I'm a curator in the Rare Books

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.990
and Special Collections
Division here at the library

01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:01.750
with specific responsibilities
in LGBT studies and poetry.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:05.790
I've always been lucky that way.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.780
The Rare Books and Specials
Collections Division holds more

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:14.610
than a million items spread
across more than 90 collections.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.720
We've arranged today a small
display, a small fraction

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.890
of those materials in the back room
which I hope you'll stop by to see.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.450
I hope it illustrates some of
the treasures that we hold,

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:26.480
as well as some of the
presses that we collect,

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:33.230
such as the Shameless Hussy Press,
the Jargon Society and many others,

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:36.290
as well as some of the
individual authors that we collect,

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:45.080
such as James Merrill, Adrienne
Rich, Moon, Larkin, Powell and Vera

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.760
who are now going to mingle
among our collections.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.510
So without further ado please step
back and follow me and have a look.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:55.500
[ Applause ]

01:06:58.050 --> 01:06:59.960

presentation of the Library

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.390
of Congress, visit us at LOC.gov.
