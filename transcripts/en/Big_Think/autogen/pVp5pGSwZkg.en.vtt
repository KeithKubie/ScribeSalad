one of the most amazing discoveries it

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
one of the most amazing discoveries it
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.390
one of the most amazing discoveries it
completely surprised me and that's what

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
completely surprised me and that's what
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.640
completely surprised me and that's what
I like most in research is when you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
I like most in research is when you
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.660
I like most in research is when you
learn something you didn't know you're

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
learn something you didn't know you're
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.879
learn something you didn't know you're
going to learn that's very different

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
going to learn that's very different
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.829
going to learn that's very different
from research where you prove something

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
from research where you prove something
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.660
from research where you prove something
you think you already know you have to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
you think you already know you have to
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.029
you think you already know you have to
do that too because maybe you were wrong

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
do that too because maybe you were wrong
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189
do that too because maybe you were wrong
but when you discover something you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
but when you discover something you
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.310
but when you discover something you
didn't expect that's really exciting and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
didn't expect that's really exciting and
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.029
didn't expect that's really exciting and
what we discovered published this in I

concentrating on the sensations they
 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.170
concentrating on the sensations they
then experience to make them more aware

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180
then experience to make them more aware
 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.610
then experience to make them more aware
of an emotion when it arises so that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
of an emotion when it arises so that
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.979
of an emotion when it arises so that
they will feel it at the moment and then

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989
they will feel it at the moment and then
 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.060
they will feel it at the moment and then
can say did you really mean to ignore me

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070
can say did you really mean to ignore me
 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.060

nature did not want you to do that so
 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.170
nature did not want you to do that so
you have to do it yourself

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
you have to do it yourself
