&gt;&gt;Sal Khan: People have been integrating
technology in the classroom forever.

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:08.736
What I think is really exciting
about what we're seeing now is

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:09.796
that technology is being used

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:11.776
to fundamentally transform
what the classroom is.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:14.906
Fundamentally transform what
you can do with a classroom.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:25.026
&gt;&gt;Adam Bellow: I think to define
technology integration,

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:27.136
it's really using whatever
resources you have

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.676
to the best of your abilities.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.596
Technology, it's a tool.

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:34.496
It's what you do with that
tool, what you can make,

00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:35.756
what you allow the students to make.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.356
That's really what
technology is about.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.886
If you can do this lesson
without technology, that's great.

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:41.766
But if you can do it
better with technology,

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.776
then that's why you use it.

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:43.996
That's why you use tools.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:54.736
&gt;&gt;Divya: This is a list of different
applications that you can use

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:57.686
to like make music or do art.

00:00:57.686 --> 00:00:59.746
I've used it to record some

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.956
of my personal narratives
that I've wroten [sic].

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.686
&gt;&gt;Divya: My eyes were drooping.

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:05.646
I was drifting off to sleep.

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:09.136
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth Hertz: Students today are
creating using digital tools.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:11.486
They're not creating
using analog tools.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.716
For us to feel like we really
are connecting with our kids,

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:17.286
and to make learning fun
for our kids and meaningful,

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.296
we need to meet them where they are.

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:23.706
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: Kids can
create podcasts, movies,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.676
songs to express their ideas,
express their thoughts.

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:28.356
but also to express their learning.

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.556
&gt;&gt;Adam: When you create, you
take ownership of your learning.

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.166
You understand it in
a very different way

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.966
than if you just memorize
something from a textbook,

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:38.596
or if you just read it
over and over again,

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.186
or watched it in someone else's film.

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:43.086
If you were able to translate that
information into your own film,

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:45.026
your own content, your
own something to share.

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:46.146
That's just amazing.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:50.356
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: And sometimes they
learn things we didn't expect them

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:50.916
to learn.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.586
Like I had my second graders
reflect on the project they did,

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:58.106
and some of them said, "I learned
how to get along with somebody," or,

00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:59.406
"I learned how to work
with somebody."

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:05.056
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: This internet thing that
has become a big part of our lives.

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:08.106
It's really enabled people
around the world to connect

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:09.526
in ways we never imagined.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.076
&gt;&gt;Adam: People always say
that the kids respond better

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:14.096
when they're able to
share their work.

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:14.876
Well, of course!

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:16.146
Because they have a valid audience.

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:17.706
It doesn't go into a pile
on the teacher's desk,

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:19.006
and then get handed
back to their folder.

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:21.806
Kids today can create stuff and
share it with the entire world.

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.636
And they have that
authentic audience.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:24.726
They have people that actually,

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.286
not only will read it,
but also care about it.

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:30.196
&gt;&gt;Mia: We have to make
like a movie project.

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:34.046
So you kind of have--
you have a topic.

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.496
And with your topic, you
speak into a microphone,

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:40.476
and then you draw pictures to
go with what you're saying.

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:44.606
&gt;&gt;Asim: If they have the link to
our website, which they might end

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.296
up getting-- like searching something
on Google, and this might pop up.

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:51.096
And so yeah, there
is a chance of kids

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:54.916
around the world getting
to see these videos.

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:58.226
&gt;&gt;Sal: The traditional academic
model, you know, that we've inherited

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:01.806
from the Prussians 200 years ago
is: We have a set amount of time

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.216
to learn something, and
then there's an exam.

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:08.196
You get a B; I get a C. Even
though the exam identified

00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:11.266
that you have some basic weaknesses,
I have even more weaknesses,

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:12.846
we'll then move on
to the next concept.

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.446
So instead of doing that
traditional, everyone move together

00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:17.886
in lock-step model, with
technology, you have the potential

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:19.416
to everyone learn at their own pace,

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:21.706
and master concepts
before they move on.

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:23.746
Have the teacher get
real-time dashboards

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:25.046
to see who's stuck on what.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.726
Now something like that is
a fundamental transformation

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:28.766
of what a classroom is.

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.606
&gt;&gt;Adam: The role of the
teacher has shifted.

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:47.646
I'm truly seeing a world where
the person who's in the role

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:49.146
of teacher is really a facilitator.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:52.486
And if you can facilitate your
students to create great work,

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:55.836
and work alongside with them to
do that, that's amazing to me.

00:03:56.096 --> 00:04:00.156
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: It's not about the mode
of creation, it's not about the tool,

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:04.306
it's about the learning, it's about
the process, it's about the look

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:08.976
on my students' faces, the fact that
they can stay focused, motivated,

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.866
engaged, and they're sharing ideas.

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:13.066
It really makes learning joyful.
