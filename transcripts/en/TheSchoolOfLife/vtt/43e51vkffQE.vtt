00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.080
Many of us probably have a nagging feeling
that we don’t listen enough to other people.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.719
Here we’re not going to make the guilt worse
by telling you that listening is a good thing,

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.799
worthy but in fact rather dull. We’re going
to show you that listening to others is first

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.590
and foremost an interesting thing to do, something
that could be as pleasurable for you as it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.680
is for your speaking companion.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.360
We commonly locate pleasure in conversation as follows:

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.480
Talking about myself is fun and hearing you, talking about you, is boring.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.160
And as a result we try to minimize how much we are listening

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.800
– and maximise how much we are talking – because
that’s how it feels like we’ll have the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.399
most interesting lives. But is this analysis
of pleasure really accurate? Of course there

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.309
is a basic pleasure to be had in, as we put
it, ‘hearing the sound of our own voice’.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.920
But we can also venture that this isn’t
the real pleasure of talking about ourselves.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.429
The real pleasure of talking about ourselves
lies in understanding ourselves, becoming

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:09.530
clearer about who we are, what we feel, what
we want and what we might do next. The pleasure

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:19.119
of talking about ourselves lies in self-clarification,
not merely in hearing our voices. Generally

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.570
we tend to believe that Self-Clarification
will only be possible if we ourselves actually do the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.420
talking. But something far more interesting and
redemptive is in truth the case: we can sometimes end

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.960
up best understanding bits of ourselves by
listening to the stories of other people.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.049
This might sound like a merely convenient
– and sentimental – thing to say. But

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.950
it is soberly true and the proof lies in an
area we know very well: literature. Novels

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
are stories of other people that we don’t
mind hearing; because they are also, at their

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.320
best, stories that teach us about ourselves.
We’re prepared to spend hours hearing other

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.630
people – like Tolstoy or Proust or Virginia
Woolf – talking about their ideas and adventures.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.580
And remarkably, we don’t mind not getting
a single word of our own into the arena because

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.850
we’re actively understanding bits of ourselves
by listening to their stories. This is what

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.540
Marcel Proust had to say on this, he wrote: ‘Every
reader of a novel is in effect the reader

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.360
of his own life, whose shape he is better
able to appreciate thanks to the spectacles

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.600
which the novelist has offered him.’ We
might well reply that this is all very well,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.390
but that the average person we have to listen
to is a lot less interesting than Marcel Proust.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
So no wonder we want to listen to the novelist
and not the average person. But the people

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.160
we have around us are a lot more interesting
than we think – if only we knew how to listen

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.590
to them and edit them properly. The reason
why so-called great writers are interesting

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.420
to listen to (even when they talk about themselves)
is that they have mastered the trick of teasing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.850
out from their experiences what is Universally
Relevant from what is Locally Specific. So-called

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.130
‘great writers’ might be telling us a
story about their aunt’s childhood or a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.460
trip to the woods, but in the way they tell
us these things, they will be adept at teasing

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.950
out the Universal Dimension – so that their
stories end up being not just local anecdotes

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.480
with no echoes in the minds of others, but
Universal Stories that simultaneously narrate

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.390
pages in the Universal book of Humankind:
they end up being their stories and our own.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.340
In truth, we are all living out stories in
the Universal Book of Humankind. But we’re

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.910
apt to describe this life so badly, to get
so bogged down in local details and unnecessary

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.530
digressions, that we bore our audiences, giving
Listening to someone very negative associations.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.000
We haven’t got the wrong sort of life; we
have the wrong techniques for narrating that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.200
life. And by narrating badly, we help to create
an enduring suspicion of the act of having

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.140
to listen to someone else speak. Here is some
of what goes wrong when we try to narrate

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.230
our lives: Firstly we keep latching onto factual
details: we go on about times, places, external

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.140
movements – not realising that things become
interesting only when people say what they

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.560
feel about what happened, not merely what
happened. Secondly we often get overwhelmed by an

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.930
emotion we experienced and insist upon it
rather than attempting to explain it. So we

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.440
say, again and again, ‘it was so beautiful’
or ‘it was the scariest thing in the whole world’

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.460
but without accurately unpacking the feeling
and thereby being able to make it live in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.840
someone else’s mind. Thirdly just when we promise
to get a bit interesting with our narration,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.200
we take fright. We get scared of our own emotions,
which can threaten to trigger feelings of

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.090
unbearable sadness, confusion and excitement.
We take flight into superficiality. Fourthly, another problem,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.080
we don’t stick with one story. There is
so much in our minds, we keep opening up new

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.830
subplots.  We're not focusing. When the Good Listener encounters
these unfortunate ways of talking, they don’t

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.430
panic; they try to act like good editors. Being
a good listener is like being a good editor

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.480
in a publishing house. Consider the relationship
between the American writer Raymond Carver,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:24.530
and his NY editor Gordon Lish. Lish heavily
edited Carver – or, as we might put it,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.060
listened to him in a hugely creative and transformative
way; a way that can teach us about the art

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.580
of listening in ordinary life as well. – Lish
hugely boosted Carver’s confidence; he made

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.840
him feel the world was listening and that
it was worth properly unpacking his experiences.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.850
He did the editorial equivalent of what in
conversation we can call looking closely into

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.730
someone’s eyes with tenderness and sympathy.
– He stopped Carver from descending into

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.060
local tedium. He took Carver’s experiences
in rural America and gave them a universal

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.630
dimension, ensuring that Carver is now famous
in Korea to Germany as well. – Lastly he stopped

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.181
Carver digressing; he kept him focused on
a central theme in each story he wrote. What

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.900
we need to do as listeners is a version of
what Lish did for Carver. In listening, we

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.280
can also shape, tease out, cut out, emphasise
– in the name of getting the latent really

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.480
good story to emerge from our companion’s
mind. So when listening, stop your companion

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.500
digressing; say things like, ‘So a minute
ago you were saying that….’ Bring them

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.490
back to the last coherent and emotionally
‘alive’ part of the story. Draw them away

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.900
from numb surface details to deeper emotional
realities. Ask: ‘what did that feel like

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.330
for you…?’ Allow for the unusual and the
weird. Use signs that suggest an open mind.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.490
Maybe someone is about to say that they felt
attracted to their sister or stole money from

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.030
a company. Don’t do anything that might
close off a vulnerable confession. ‘Say

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.302
go on…’ You’re not a judge, you’re
a friend. The Good Listener knows that one

00:06:57.302 --> 00:07:02.070
of the best ways to understand an issue in
one’s own life is to hear it discussed through

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.010
the life of someone else – and furthermore,
they have the editing skills to make sure

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:13.610
they can find themselves in the words of others.
That way, listening will no longer a chore.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.600
It’s about the most interesting thing we can ever do with somebody else.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.520
We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.680
And to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.280
As well as other merchandise that re-enforces some of the themes illustrated in our videos.
