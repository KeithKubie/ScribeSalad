00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.360
The child is 4 feet tall.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.170
When we compare a tree it's shadow and
a child standing nearby and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.450
the child shadow.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.310
Because these are similar triangles,
that means that the ratio of

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.980
the height of the tree to the length
of the shadow will be proportional

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.150
to the height of the child to
the length of the child shadow.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.990
We can set the proportion up like this.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.940
The height of the tree over
the length of the shadow

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.970
of the tree is equivalent
to the height of the child,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.690
which we'll set to x,
over the length of the child shadow.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.762
When we cross multiply, we see that
20 x 10 = 50 x x, or 200 = 50x.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:43.776
Divide both sides by 50 to isolate x,

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:48.650
and we get x is =
200/50 which is just 4.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.870
So the child is 4 feet tall.
