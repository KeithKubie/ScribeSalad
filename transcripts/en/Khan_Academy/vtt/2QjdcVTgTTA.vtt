00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:02.200
What I want to do in
this video is show you

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.380
a way to represent a
vector by its components.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.900
And this is sometimes
called engineering notation

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.790
for vectors.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.670
But it's super
useful, because it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.339
allows us to keep track of
the components of the vector

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.880
and it makes it a
little bit tangible

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.380
when we talk about the
individual components.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.460
So let's break down this
vector right over here.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.168
I'm just assuming it's
a velocity vector.

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:24.780
Vector v. Its magnitude
is 10 meters per second.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.150
And it's pointed in a
direction 30 degrees

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.270
above the horizontal.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.900
So we've broken down these
vectors in the past before.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.430
The vertical component
right over here.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.820
Its magnitude would
be-- so the magnitude

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.380
of the vertical component,
right over here,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.870
is going to be 10
sine of 30 degrees.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.730
It's going to be 10 meters per
second times the sine of 30

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.230
degrees.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.780
This comes from the basic
trigonometry from sohcahtoa.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.720
And I covered that in more
detail in previous videos.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.960
Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.569
So this is going to be 5,
or 5 meters per second.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.480
10 times 1/2 is 5
meters per second.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.340
So that's the magnitude
of its vertical component.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760
And in the last few
videos, I kind of,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.130
in a less tangible way of
specifying the vertical vector,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.122
I often use this notation, which
isn't as tangible as I like.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.580
And that's why I'm
going to make it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.996
a little bit better
in this video.

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:29.500
I said that that vector
itself is 5 meters per second.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.270
But what I told you is that
the direction is implicitly

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.720
given because this
is a vertical vector.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.680
And I told you in previous
videos that if it's positive,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.892
it means up and if it's
negative, it means down.

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:44.350
So I kind of have to give you
this context here so that you

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.280
can appreciate that this is a
vector that just the sine of it

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710
is giving you its direction.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.180
But I have to keep telling
you this is a vertical vector.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.486
So it wasn't that tangible.

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:54.860
And so we had the
same issue when

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.200
we talked about the
horizontal vectors.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.270
So this horizontal
vector right over here,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.530
the magnitude of this
horizontal vector

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.609
is going to be 10
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.150
And once again, it
comes straight out

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.620
of basic trigonometry.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.990
10 cosine of 30 degrees.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.370
And so cosine of 30 degrees is
the square root of 3 over 2.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.270
Multiply it by 10,
you get 5 square roots

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.860
of 3 meters per second.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.964
And once again, in
previous videos,

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:34.130
I used this notation
sometimes, where I was actually

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.580
saying that the vector
is 5 square roots of 3

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.930
meters per second.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.961
But in order to ensure that
this wasn't just a magnitude,

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.210
I kept having to tell you
in the horizontal direction.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.410
If it's positive it's
going to the right,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.980
and if it's negative,
it's going to the left.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.050
What I want to do
in this video, is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.700
give us a convention
so that I don't

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.610
have to keep doing
this for the direction.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.600
And it makes it all a
little bit more tangible.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.180
And so what we do
is we introduced

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.890
the idea of unit vectors.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
So by definition, we'll
introduce the vector i i.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.400
Sometimes it's called i hat.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.160
And I'll draw it like here.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.350
I'll make it a
little bit smaller.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.530
So the vector i hat.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.490
So that right there is a
picture of the vector i hat.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.570
And we've put a little
hat on top of the i

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.630
to show that it
is a unit vector.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.960
And what a unit
vector is-- so i hat

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.330
goes in the positive
x direction.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.310
That's just how it's defined.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.130
And the unit vector tells
us that its magnitude is 1.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.510
So the magnitude of the
vector i hat is equal to 1.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.790
And its direction is in
the positive x direction.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.760
So if we really
wanted to specify

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.980
this kind of x component
vector in a better way,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.640
we really should call it
5 square roots of 3 times

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.410
this unit vector.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.260
Because this green
vector over here

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.242
is going to be 5
square roots of 3 times

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.450
this vector right over here,
because this vector just

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.850
has length 1.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.587
So it's 5 square roots of
3 times the unit vector.

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:13.170
And what I like about
this is that now

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.628
I don't have to
tell you, remember,

00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:16.540
this is a horizontal vector.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.790
Positive is to the right,
negative is to the left.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.690
It's implicit here.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.021
Because clearly if this
is a positive value,

00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.770
it's going to be a
positive multiple of i.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.060
It's going to go to the right.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.470
If it's a negative value,
it flips around the vector

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.940
and then it goes to the left.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.170
So this is actually a better way
of specifying the x component

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.750
vector.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.950
Or if I broke it down, this
vector v into its x component,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.070
this is a better way of
specifying that vector.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.200
Same thing for the y direction.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.085
We can define a unit vector.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.460
And let me pick a color
that I have not used yet.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.190
Let me find this
pink I haven't used.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.480
We can find a unit vector
that goes straight up in the y

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.300
direction called unit vector j.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.910
And once again, the magnitude
of unit vector j is equal to 1.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.870
This little hat on
top of it tells us--

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.430
or sometimes it's called a
caret character-- that tells us

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.760
that it is a vector,
but it is a unit vector.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.670
It has a magnitude of 1.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.130
And by definition, the vector
j goes and has a magnitude of 1

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.430
in the positive y direction.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.610
So the y component
of this vector,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.360
instead of saying it's
5 meters per second

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.651
in the upwards direction or
instead of saying that it's

00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:30.420
implicitly upwards because
it's a vertical vector

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.760
or it's a vertical
component and it's positive,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.920
we can now be a little bit
more specific about it.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.815
We can say that it is
equal to 5 times j.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.180
Because you see, this
magenta vector, it's

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.109
going the exact same direction
as j, it's just 5 times longer.

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:53.650
I don't know if it's
exactly 5 times.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.358
I'm just trying to
estimate it right now.

00:05:55.358 --> 00:05:56.640
It's just 5 times longer.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.370
Now what's really
cool about this

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.270
is besides just being able to
express the components as now

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.190
multiples of explicit
vectors, instead of just being

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.360
able to do that--
which we did do,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.870
we're representing
the components

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.040
as explicit vectors--
we also know

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.470
that the vector v is the
sum of its components.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.990
If you start with this
green vector right here

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.010
and you add this vertical
component right over here,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.260
you have head to tails.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.200
You get the blue vector.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.280
And so we can actually
use the components

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.900
to represent the vector itself.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.140
We don't always have
to draw it like this.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.200
So we can write that
vector v is equal to-- let

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.510
me write it this way-- it's
equal to its x component

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.640
vector plus the y
component vector.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.170
And we can write
that, the x component

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.530
vector is 5 square
roots of 3 times i.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.400
And then it's going to
be plus the y component,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:07.850
the vertical component, which
is 5j, which is 5 times j.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.980
And so what's really neat here
is now you could specify any

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.020
vector in two dimensions
by some combination

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.490
of i's and j's or some scaled
up combinations of i's and j's.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.946
And if you want to go
into three dimensions,

00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:24.070
and you often will, especially
as the physics class

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.010
moves on through
the year, you can

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.002
introduce a vector in
the positive z direction,

00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:31.460
depending on how
you want to do it.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.420
Although z is
normally up and down.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.110
But whatever the
next dimension is,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.471
you can define a vector k that
goes into that third dimension.

00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:41.470
Here I'll do it in a kind
of unconventional way.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.087
I'll make k go in
that direction.

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.045
Although the standard
convention when you do it

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:48.390
in three dimensions is that k
is the up and down dimension.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.490
But this by itself is
already pretty neat

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.710
because we can now represent any
vector through its components

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.380
and it's also going to
make the math much easier.
