00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:08.266
[ Music ]

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:13.346
&gt;&gt; The Sonoran Desert to a number of venomous
creatures that can cause problems for people;

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.596
particularly those living in rural areas.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:21.046
In Arizona, there are 30 species of scorpion,
and about 8,000 scorpion stings each year.

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:25.256
While these stings are painful, most
can be managed with basic first aid.

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.656
But the sting of one species,
the Arizona Bark Scorpion,

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:31.296
can be deadly; especially small children.

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:33.276
&gt;&gt; In Arizona, children who are stung

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:41.236
by scorpions will sometimes develop a nerve
poisoning syndrome that is really frightening.

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:48.556
They have a set of symptoms that comes from all
of the different nerves of the body being kind

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:51.066
of stuck in the on position simultaneously.

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:54.846
And all of their muscles lose control.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:58.686
So, that there may be one twitching,
and one jerking, and a little inhalation

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.406
and a little exhalation all at the same time.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:04.576
When you put it all together,
they don't breathe very well.

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:07.856
Dr. Leslie Bowyer is an expert
on desert creatures.

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:11.456
Ten years ago, when she learned
that an antivenom being used

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:15.766
in Arizona would no longer be available,
she began seeking an alternative.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.216
&gt;&gt; Children who don't get
antivenom need intensive care

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:22.376
for sometimes as long as two days.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:28.856
During that time, they get extremely high doses
of sedative drugs to make them hold still.

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:33.036
Because the thrashing and jerking that
they're doing can be dangerous just by itself.

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:37.776
Because this condition is one that
comes from interacting with the desert,

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:43.586
it's much more likely that people who live
far from the center of town will be stung.

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:45.756
Which means this is a small-town disease.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.566
It's a rare, potentially
life-threatening condition in towns

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.586
that don't have intensive care units.

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:56.426
&gt;&gt; Dr. Boyer began a study of a
promising anti-venom produced in Mexico

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.676
that had never been tested to US standards.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:03.076
One of the study subjects was a little boy
from Globe, Arizona, Morgan Bray [phonetic].

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:06.066
&gt;&gt; Morgan, he was playing after lunch at school,

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:11.236
and they have these big cement tunnel
things that they were playing in.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.866
They were digging in the san,
and he was bit on the finger.

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.636
And I got a call probably
half an hour after he got bit.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.066
Went and got him, he was crying that it hurt.

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:25.096
Next thing I know he comes to me, and he says,
"Mom, my legs aren't working; I can't walk."

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:27.896
So, I took him to the hospital,
and while we're driving,

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:31.256
Morgan says, "Mommy, I don't want to die."

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:35.496
&gt;&gt; When Morgan was a baby, his two-year-old
brother, Dally, suffered a scorpion sting.

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:39.466
He was rushed to the hospital and given
the antivenom that was then available.

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:44.146
But he had an allergic reaction to one
of the components, and did not survive.

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:50.086
At the time, Morgan was stung, Dr. Boyer's
study of the antivenom from Mexico had advanced

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.566
to clinical trials that were
being conducted in Tucson.

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.096
&gt;&gt; So I get to the ER; I carry him
in there and I get him signed in.

00:02:56.096 --> 00:02:59.456
And the guy says, "Okay, sit down
we'll be with you just shortly."

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:02.096
And I said, "No sir, I don't think so.

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:05.516
I've already lost one son to this,
I'm not going to do -- do it again."

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:12.296
Dr. Gonzales got on the phone immediately to
Dr. Boyer and we were on air vac within an hour.

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:15.686
Morgan had a full -- what
they call "bag a worms".

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:17.746
His tongue was going crazy; his eyes.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.226
He was just going nuts.

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:20.176
He freaked me out.

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:22.446
And they gave him the antivenom.

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:25.096
They filmed him for research.

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:28.266
And I think I remember asking,
"Is that all he's getting?"

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:31.776
And he was already coming out of
it, and we were home by 10:30,

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:33.426
and he played baseball the next day.

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.886
Honestly, I thought I was going
to have to bury another baby.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:42.016
&gt;&gt; This study has had remarkable
results for the children

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.876
and families who have participated in it.

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:46.506
And it has had a wide reach
for the people of Arizona.

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:48.586
Especially those in rural communities.

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:52.036
Because of it, the lifesaving
antivenom is available

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.616
in hospital emergency departments
throughout the state.

00:03:55.086 --> 00:04:01.696
&gt;&gt; We've learned that in Arizona, it is possible
to do amazing things if you ask for help.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:06.046
We pulled together a team
involving 24 hospitals.

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:07.426
Several hundred doctors.

00:04:07.486 --> 00:04:08.866
Several hundred nurses.

00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:11.206
Several hundred pharmacists.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.976
And administrators working
together as volunteers

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:21.406
to make an absolutely unprecedented
study network that allows us to make sure

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:28.416
that no matter where you live in the Sonoran
Desert, antivenom is near your home [music].

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:34.086
&gt;&gt; This study has also paved the way for future
efforts to find safe, effective treatment

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:35.856
for the hazards of living in the desert.

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:41.286
Because of the antivenom study, a team
of trained professionals is in place,

00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:46.586
and prepared to do a type of research
that is unique to this region.
