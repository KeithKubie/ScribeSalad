1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,960
Yeah. Like I think Robbie Lawler stopped
doing it. I think cowboy, I think,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,640
oh these guys,

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,910
Robbie stopped sparring completely for
years while he's fighting for strike

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,810
force. But then when he
moved to a American top team,

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,350
he started sparring again and it was
training really hard and that's when

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:20,250
actually he became the welter weight
world champion. He's so fucking tough.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,680
Like I want to see that ask
and fight again cause he,

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,220
I put my money on Robbie Lawler
that he does not care about.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,430
He looked better than I've
ever seen him as crazy shape.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,510
I've gone back and forth about five
times on whether or not that was a good

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:33,991
stoppage,

12
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,220
but Huseman convinced me after we watched
the footage that was a bad stoppage.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,690
I think Robbie was okay. I think, uh,
he just relaxed. He was there. He had,

14
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,810
what have I done? I mean how many more
seconds, but that bulldog just time or,

15
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:49,860
but yeah, but for Robbie Lawler, I think
he was all right. But it's hard to tell.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,810
It's just unfortunate.
And again,

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,620
herb dean is as good a referee
as there is on planet earth.

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,810
There is no one better than him.
There's no one better.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,810
Herb Dean is as good as it
gets. Yeah, he made a mistake,

20
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,660
but it's hard to say if it was a mistake
because I wasn't even sure it was a

21
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,140
mistake.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,070
We were not sure better to err on the
side of caution because he couldn't hear

23
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,410
him. He couldn't talk.
But here's the thing,

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,610
he's only getting choked out like
if it's been aspirin, it's only,

25
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,900
he's only get choked out if it's

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,630
Frances and Ghana and he's
fucking punching you in
the head and you think your

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:25,050
unconscious then stopped the fight.
Right. But if it's just a choke,

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,980
like Ben asked her and is not
known for being in any way,

29
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,410
shape or form of power striker.
No,

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,310
and he's not hitting them now he's only
holding onto his neck and I think that

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,170
shows have been how tough bad astronauts.

32
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:39,810
Cause he got his head bounced
off that fucking, I was like,

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,660
you're getting crushed here.
And he was just like, whatever,

34
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,190
I'm going to stick to my wrestling.
Yeah, he was getting fucking pounded,

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,150
but he figured it out and he,
even though they disengaged,

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,960
he managed to get ahold of Robbie again
and get them on the ground and get that

37
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,900
choke on. Yeah, look, it was,
it was fun while it lasted,

38
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,250
but he doesn't want to fight Robbie again.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,280
I think if I was the UFC I
would be absolutely trying
to make that fight again.

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,340
Do you think they will know? I think they
want to, that's what Dana White said.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,750
But Ben said, why would I want to do
that? I already went already. One quote.

42
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,080
I want to do that. But the thing about,
you know, like Kamara was saying like,

43
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,290
you don't get a choice. Like the UFC is
going to tell you who to fight again.

44
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,070
Maybe they just offer Ben good amount
of money off from Robbie is Robbie is,

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,450
uh,
you know,

46
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:32,250
he deserves that privilege and I think
he's easily up there and he can always be

47
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,710
the champion again, that got more
on his clothes. He looks good.

48
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,650
He looks as good as he's ever
looked. Yes. It looked amazing.

49
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,720
It looked amazing physically. He looked
amazing when he was fighting. Um,

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,930
even more importantly,

51
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:46,230
I think that's the fight that makes the
most money because people want to see

52
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,160
that. I want to see it. You
want to see it. All the real
fans want to see it. Yeah.

53
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,160
I think I'm doing enough of that in USA.
They do sometimes.
