Rob, you're gonna love it.
Take it away, Kazuki!

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.652 size:88% position:56% line:78%
Hi, Gorburger!

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.652 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hi, Kazuki!
You're my best friend.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.788
I know! You are
my best friend, too!

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.289
[ laughs ]
I like him.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.824
And pleasure
to meet you, Rob.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.092
Nice to meet you, too.

See?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.969
Oh, look at that, Rob.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.671
It's very sharp

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:42.208
and great for stabbing
into meat and onion.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.544
It also works for haircuts,

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.146
but Rob has no need
for that,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.148
because he doesn't have...

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.317
hair!

if it's a cultural thing, Rob,

that bald joke.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.958

Kazuki, what happened?

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.530 align:start size:59% position:41%
Rob, do you think
this is part of it?

Part of what?

Yes, another murder!

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.909
Ah! This is terrible.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.644 align:start size:72% position:28%
It is terrible, Robert,
and you know what?

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:21.881
I will avenge
my best friend's death.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.416
After these messages.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:25.485
Let's go to commercial!

If that's not ketchup,
then we can't eat those.
