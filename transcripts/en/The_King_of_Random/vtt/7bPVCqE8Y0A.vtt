00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
Today, we're taking
a look at three types

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.600
of heat resistant gloves,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.400
and seeing how they hold up
against the stove, hot steel,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.300
and a furnace.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.560
[Music]

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.400
YouTube user ShishiR
wanted to see

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.920
how long it takes for
heat-resistant gloves to burn.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.000
As someone who often

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.100
uses and relies
upon heat-resistant gloves,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.913
this question is near
and dear to my heart,

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:24.900
and I thought it was
a great thing to test out.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.063
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:26.920
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.100
Each of our three types of
gloves will be put to the test

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.400
in different scenarios to see
just how heat-resistant

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
they really are.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.700
First up, we have
a pair of oven mitts.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.600
These things say

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.309
that they are
silicone coated cloth,

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.800
and I think they're supposed
to be rated up to about

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.580
500 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.300
which is going to be good

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.207
for pulling most everything
out of the oven,

00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:46.557
but not necessarily some
of the stuff we do here

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:47.287
on this channel.

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:48.239
Standard oven mitts,

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.361
about what you've seen before,
pull things out of the oven.

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.300
Pretty low dexterity

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.930
because all your fingers are
together with just the thumb

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.700
off to the side.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.820
Hello.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.160
How are you?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.100
That would make
a decent whale puppet.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Next up, we've got
leather furnace gloves.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020
These are usually used
for furnace work or for welding.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.500
And so I'm pretty
familiar with these.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.449
We've definitely used

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:11.100
gloves just like this here
on the channel quite a bit.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.237
They worked pretty well, pulling
stuff out of the foundry,

00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:14.400
putting stuff into the foundry,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.900
but I have had
some issues with that.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.355
Weirdly, we've had
several pairs of these gloves

00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:19.842
where the right index finger

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:22.979
getting the most heat exposure
ended up shrinking over time,

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.905
until I could barely fit my hand
into the glove anymore.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:27.200
Lastly, we have these,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
which are supposed to be
barbecue gloves they say.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200
However, these are rated up
to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.775
these say they're rated up
to about 950 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:37.800
These ones claim

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.600
that they are heat resistant
up to 1,450 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.840
So these are the highest rated.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.680
and I've never tried
these out before.

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:46.746
They are stretchy,

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.300
and they have sort of
silicone pads on the front

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.900
to give you some more grip when
you're holding on to things.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.380
They're clearly knit.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.760
Like you can see the texture.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.269
It just looks kind of
like winter gloves texture.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.520
Although, they're
much much thicker.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800
We're going to test
each of these,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
putting our hand on a hot stove,
grabbing a red-hot bar of steel,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.340
and putting our hands
near or inside our foundry.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.640
I am actually putting
myself at risk for this.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.460
I'm going to be
the test subject.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.000
Today, we're going
to start with a stove.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500
We're going to turn
up the heat, and see

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800
how long I can keep
my hand on the stove,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.100
in the glove before it starts
feeling really uncomfortable.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.260
We're going to let
it get red hot,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.520
and then I am not going
to touch it with my bare hand.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm going to touch it
with a mitten hand,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.560
and then two gloves.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.179
Start to get hot.

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:30.800
Let's see where this is
at right now.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.300
Registering at 226.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.750
Now, that is the surface
temperature of the glass.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.200
This thing is using infrared.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.900
It can't see through
the glass surface.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.198
About to hit 500 Fahrenheit.

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:45.352
There it is, 500 Fahrenheit.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.100
At this point, a drop
of water just explodes boiling,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.800
and then we get
some drips moving around

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.460
with the Ladenfrost effect.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.520
We just hit 935 Fahrenheit,
which is 500 degrees Celsius.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.900
Seems like the time
to put our hand on it.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.200
Alright, here we go.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.400
About to put my hand
on a hot stove in the oven mitt.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.160
[Music]

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.140
Well, that was quick.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.321
When someone says it's
heat resistant up to 450,

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.706
maybe 500 Degrees,

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:22.680
you probably shouldn't put it
down on a 950 degrees surface.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.860
That was maybe like
one second, I think?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.400
Did not last very long.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.991
All right.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.300
Well, despite how long
that didn't last,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.028
we're going to progress on
to the next gloves.

00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:34.180
Okay, here it goes.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.980
[Music]

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.180
That was mostly me reacting
to the smoke I saw coming off,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.900
but it did start burning
one finger over on that side.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.260
Yeah.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.160
Okay.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.300
Just about one second,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300
and it started getting
too hot down inside.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.500
Everywhere that was actually
pressing hard against the glass,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.020
and my pinky finger was
what was pressing the most,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.170
and that got uncomfortably
hot very quickly.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.646
I am going to try
one more thing,

00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:01.000
and that's I'm not going
to press down on the glass.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.320
I'm just going to hold
my hand over the stove.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.400
Smoking quite a bit.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.600
Too hot.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.520
Leather gloves on the stove.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.300
More protection than
the oven mitts,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.600
but not by a lot.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.830
Now, we have
these barbecue gloves,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.975
which in theory, give us
the most heat resistance.

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:19.747
The one thing I want
to test is if it sticks,

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.700
because if it melts and sticks,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.800
and I can't pull
my hand away as quickly,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.024
that would be huge problem.

00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:27.200
So I'm just gonna test
with one finger over here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.840
So we've got some burning.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.480
Full-scale test, here it goes.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.400
[Music]

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.780
Wow, I'm actually
very impressive at that.

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.522
I left my hand on there
for several seconds.

00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:44.514
The other gloves

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.455
got maybe one second
before they started smoking,

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:49.452
and in one case,
burst into flames.

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:53.200
A lot of smoke on the leather,
a lot of fire on the oven mitts.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.900
This was actually much better.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.199
I pulled my hand off
when it got uncomfortably hot,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.260
but it was only just
barely uncomfortably hot.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.380
The leather went
from nothing, nothing,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.600
nothing, uncomfortably hot,
you've burned yourself.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.129
With this glove,
it didn't actually do that.

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.980
It got warmer and warmer,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.960
and I thought,
this is now uncomfortable.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.820
Pulled my hand off,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.597
pulled the glove off,
never got to the point

00:05:15.597 --> 00:05:17.500
where I felt like my hand
was actually burning.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.400
I'm quite impressed.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.100
Let's try the next thing.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:41.700
[Music]

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.600
Alright, at this point,
we have a steel bar

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.000
that is glowing nicely orange.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.850
We're not just gonna go

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.000
and grab right onto
the red part of the bar.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.200
That's going to burn the gloves,
it's going to be a lot

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.186
like putting it
on the stove but faster.

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.908
I don't want to injure my hands.

00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:57.900
So we're going to do
is compare and see

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.461
how close we can get,

00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:00.800
how far up the bar

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.960
toward that red part we can get
without hurting yourself.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.800
So, I'm actually
gonna do a control

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.900
with just my bare hands.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.690
I know that the back
of this isn't burning me,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.639
but I'm going to see
how close to the orange part

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.080
I can get with my bare hand
before it's uncomfortable.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.900
And then I'm going to go
through the other types

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.000
of gloves, and see
how well they protect me.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.500
[Music]

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.000
Little more, not
uncomfortable yet.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.797
[Music]

00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:25.182
Now, getting-- Oh!

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.200
Yep, just about there.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.400
The top half of my hand
is uncomfortably hot.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.000
So we've got these two
weld marks on here.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.640
Just below those,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.800
that's as close
as I could get.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.957
That was burning my hand

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.900
uncomfortable to leave it there
for more than a second or two.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.500
Yep, and then anything
higher than that,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.300
it just burns too quick.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.900
[Music]

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.870
All right, starting pretty close
to what was the maximum

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.000
with my bare hands.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.600
Now this right here was
too hot with my bare hand.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.700
I couldn't handle it.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.400
So far, not really
problem with this glove.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.500
Moving up a little bit more.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.800
Oh, definitely feeling heat now.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.500
Oh, I got smoke coming
off the glove.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.260
Still my hands
actually all right.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.900
My hand was actually doing okay,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.800
even though the mitten
caught on fire,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.400
and now there's a big hole in it

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.149
because I think some
of the stitches burned.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.000
So, that's actually
pretty impressive.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.460
The stitches failed,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.700
and it caught on fire,
and my hand was only,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.700
you know warm.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.340
[Music]

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.000
Whoo.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.040
Yeah, there we go.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.760
That's just all coming apart,
nice and singed.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.300
No longer good for cookies.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.800
All right, we're
starting right here.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.860
[Music]

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.760
I'm feeling nothing,
not even warmth.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.680
Moving up.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.400
My hand is now like an inch
and a half away from the orange.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.900
I see smoke on the glove.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.100
Oh, that got through
because it's done that.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm now kind of-- Oh, wow.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.100
I don't know how well
you can see that,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.500
but the whole glove just shrink.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.100
Look at this.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800
I'm not moving my hand.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.100
It's just contracting
the leather.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.300
[Music]

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.660
Well, that was flat a bit ago.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.050
My hand is actually okay.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.100
It's very warm.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.780
It's not burning me.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.100
Starting really close
to the orange part.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.200
[Music]

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.620
I felt it,
little spot on my thumb.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.950
Oh, I've got a hole right there.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.400
I'm just gonna go orange part
right on the palm.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.480
That is crazy.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.660
It's just warm.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.800
All right, now it's getting hot.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.640
Oh, it's on fire.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.800
Well, I think we found
the stress point

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.133
where that dies out.

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:41.800
Despite that, my hand just
barely got uncomfortably hot,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.100
and that was pressing
the red hot bar of steel

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.600
down onto this glove
for several seconds.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.380
I gotta say,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.770
I'm really impressed
with these things.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.300
When they say they
are heat resistant,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.860
they're not kidding around.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.360
Thousand-degree, nice,
got nothing on that.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.100
That was well over
a thousand degrees.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.760
That was probably more
like 1,500 to 1,800 degrees.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.720
But now, I want to see

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:03.400
how these handle
actually protecting my hand

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.800
as it goes into the furnace.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.200
So I'm just going to sort
of carve out a little spot.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.732
I'm going to reach in,
and see how they do.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.360
First, we got this Mitten.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.300
This is the one
that got burned on the stove.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.637
At least the seams
are all intact.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.300
So I'm just going
to kind of lower my hand

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.821
in protected side down,

00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.400
see how long this keeps
me feeling safe.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.200
One, two...

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200
It's on fire.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.700
So an oven mitt
that catches on fire.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.509
I gotta say,

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:29.600
although I know
I'm misusing it,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.300
I feel like that's
not a good design choice.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.980
Leather glove.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.900
Let's see how this
protects my hand,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.600
just sort of chilling out
right in the hot spot.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.500
This is already doing way better
than the oven mitt.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.100
Oh, the fingers are contracting.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.080
Oh, hot!

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.700
As we saw with the other glove,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.390
when the leather
heats up too much,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.290
it just contracts.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.833
In this case,

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:51.213
the first indication I had
that something was wrong was

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.800
that my fingers
are getting squished.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.400
And our fancy barbecue gloves.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
Now, this is the one

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.180
that I have not melted
any seams open on.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.740
Yeah.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.600
There's the back.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.500
Pretty hot.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Not burning me hot, but...

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.760
All right.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.333
That's a-- Oh!

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:06.575
Yep.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.480
There we go.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.500
That was just a little bit
harder to take off of my hand.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.400
However, pretty
impressed with that.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.750
Oven mitts, good for pulling
cookies out of the oven.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.100
Not good for anything else.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.300
Don't touch a hot stove.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.889
Don't put an oven mitt
in a furnace.

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:21.000
Leather gloves.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.890
Definitely better
than the oven mitts.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.700
However, they do still have
a tendency to light on fire,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.200
or at least smoke a lot.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.200
They shrink when
they get too hot,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.000
and they really have a point

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.980
where they go from it
doesn't hurt

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.170
to "Oh, that's pretty warm-- Ow!"

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.200
And just skips over
"it's getting hot,"

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.600
and goes right into burning.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.500
These gloves that
are for barbecuing,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.600
or whatever else you're using
them for, I'm actually

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.820
quite impressed with.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.300
I would say
the biggest downside is

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.630
that it does actually slow

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.900
my hands down a little bit
trying to pull out.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.185
This restricted cuff,

00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:52.288
while it might be
good for aesthetics

00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:54.920
or even functionality
of using the gloves,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.200
I don't like that it's harder
to pull my hands out.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.857
However, these did
an impressive job

00:10:58.857 --> 00:10:59.900
of resisting the heat.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.876
There's one more thing I
want to try, the question

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:04.109
that was actually posed to us is
how long does it take

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:04.940
for them to burn.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.500
So we're just gonna
do a quick test,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.436
and drop them down
into the furnace,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.200
and see how long
it actually takes

00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:11.600
for them to light on fire.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.415
We're gonna just toss this on,
and see how long it takes.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.760
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.200
4 seconds before we started
seeing flames fly off of it.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.900
All right, leather glove.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.400
Can you beat four seconds?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.700
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.360
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.720
21, 22..

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.200
I'm not sure this
is going to light on fire,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.400
because we're already
at like 25 seconds,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.468
and while it's definitely
shrinking and shriveled,

00:11:47.468 --> 00:11:50.600
and very hot and smoking,
it hasn't caught on fire.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.100
So how long did it take to burn?

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.300
I would say after about six
or seven seconds.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.050
I would have declared
it as burning.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.200
But in terms of getting
it to light on fire,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.900
it's lasted quite well so far.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.700
Okay, leather glove,
will light on fire?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.300
Yes.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.349
How long did it take?

00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:06.999
That was a couple of minutes.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.820
It's so deformed,

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.740
and it's got like these stubby
little fingers now.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.400
That really shrinks
quite a bit in the heat.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.400
All right, fancy barbecue glove.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.840
How do you do?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.200
Four seconds with the oven mitt,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.700
a couple minutes to actually
get the leather gloves

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.400
catch on fire.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.000
Oh, that looks
like it's already on fire.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.700
That was quick.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.400
That's very surprising given how
well it resisted heat before.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.300
That's on fire.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.300
I think it's the silicone
actually caught on fire.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.760
That's interesting.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.800
So the leather glove resists
catching on fire better.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.520
This resists just
general heat better.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.600
ShishiR, thank you
for your comment suggestion.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.900
We've learned some good things
about gloves today.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.300
Guys, that's all for today.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.571
But you know,
we've always got more

00:12:53.571 --> 00:12:54.119
for you to see.

00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:56.236
That box at the top is going
to take you to her last video.

00:12:56.236 --> 00:12:57.264
You should go check that out.

00:12:57.264 --> 00:12:58.494
The other box
is going to show you

00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:00.205
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:01.520
If you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.700
you'll be subscribed
to the channel,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.160
so you never miss a cool video.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.060
Don't forget to ring that bell

00:13:05.064 --> 00:13:06.500
so you get the
notifications about it,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.688
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:08.580
Talk to you then.
