Speaker 1:          00:04          You're listening to radio lab from public radio, w.N y. S t engine, n. P. R. What we have over the criminal. The criminal actually thinks he's destroyed. It will be evidence

Speaker 2:          00:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:20          ever, ever, ever. Never. This is Lou Garcia originally retired from the New York city fire department as the chief fire Marshall, so I've spent 25 years of my life looking at fires and investigating the causes of fire. How many fires do you think you've seen? Oh, tens of thousands of fires. You've seen 10 years of [inaudible] yourself. Yeah. When he tells me his story there was this a true story? I'm not going to get too many details about it, but there was a fire in an area of New York City who was in an apartment building in the south Bronx. As I pulled up to this building, the fire was already over with Lou Gatto. There were people in the street and we're questioning people. People are saying, well, in the apartment where the fire was, it was this brave guy. Somehow he'd gotten in there and he was pouring water on fire, trying to get the fire out. This guy was really something and he's, and he's, he's a hero right now. Everybody's telling me what a hero he is. Everything.

Speaker 2:          01:13          The thing that we're saying in the street about this man was wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:21          so he walks into the apartment, he looks around and he knows right away where the fire started. Now how, why, how, well, you just look at the fire pattern and could tell that the fire started first of all in the bedroom with a mattress mattress. The mattress now matches go up. If you put a match to it. Really? I mean, don't you have to put like gasoline on the mattress? No, no, no. Let me just put a match onto a match mattress and it will catch fire. Yes. If you hold that one off. Yeah. And he also knew that the mattress had been placed upright against the wall. You could tell by the fire pattern that was standing on it. Wow. He can even know what position the mattress was in. Yes, absolutely. Believe me. So he meets the woman whose apartment this is, she shows up and he says this, so do you know this fellow who was putting out the fire? She was, yes. As a matter of fact, I do. Just so happens that you used to live with me, but I kicked him out. He still had a key by the way, and she knows, says I have a new boyfriend, so Garcia naturally goes and finds the hero,

Speaker 2:          02:21          so now I'm questioning this fall. I said, by the way, did you buy that mattress? And he said, yes I did. And you weren't sleeping anymore with someone else who'd been on the mattress in your place? And he says, yeah, we should have the boyfriend. I said, boy, I'd be pissed. How much did the question? Like four or $500 you said no more than that. It was like 800 off. I said, so now she is screwing somebody else on the mattress you bought. I would be pissed. I said, you know, if it was me, if I were in your place, I would want this mattress in the barn. I was probably standard on end. I would take matches, matches, and I would put it to the, to the mattress. That's what I would do. And in fact, I'm an expert on fires and I know that's what you did. You really did do that. Yeah, you can talk about it. I don't blame you. I mean at least you tried to put it out, but they'll work in your favor and court and he looks at me. He says, well, you're not so smart. I said, wine. He goes, I used the lighter

Speaker 1:          03:20          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          03:25          Oh, you're right about that.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Okay, so that was an easy one. We're going to have some harder ones coming up. Yup. Point is the whole hour. We're going to be addressing the same problem. We'll walk into one situation after another and discover that something is not right here. That's right. It's something's not right with my son. What do I do? Something's not right with my pancreas. What do I do? Something's not right with the very phrase something is not right because it presumes that I know what's right and maybe I don't have we confused you enough? Well, there's a whole lot of abnormal things coming your way. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Quilt. Stay with us.

Speaker 4:          04:04          Okay.

Speaker 5:          04:09          Okay. So this first story is about, uh, delivering a diagnosis comes to us from producer Louisville, Kelsey. It's about two doctors who start with that phrase, something's not right here, and ended up going on a crazy adventure after a cure for a deadly disease, which is that pancreatic cancer. Oh, that's not good. It is like the most deadly cancer. This is the one that people have nightmares about. Why you mean it's deadly? How like, well, it's, it's rare, but it's deadly. It's the one where you know, you, something's wrong. You go to the doctor and they say, you have six months to live. Wow. Is it that fast? It usually is that fast. How'd you find this out? I found this out because my friend Amy, um, said, I've got a friend named Dr. Terry Brenton [inaudible]. She made a big scientific discovery and yeah,

Speaker 4:          04:55          you should go to her press conference. This will be amazing. Like, go and I go to the press, male friends.

Speaker 5:          05:01          It's just a tremendous pleasure to be here today. Press conferences are kind of never amazing and I hope to one unfold a story for you. I hope it will capture your attention. It's a fascinating story and I heard this incredible story about 10 years ago. One morning, a 40 year old guy came into my clinic, Mr x just finishing mine, very healthy looking, and he comes into my clinic and he says, I'm worried I'm going to get pancreatic cancer, that I'm going to get the curse in my family. It was like, good gooby, what are you talking about? And he said, well, in my family, my father got pancreatic cancer, my grandfather and my foreign uncles and my three cousins. Wow. Four uncles, three cousins, father, grandfather, all die of pancreatic cancer. And this guy was sure he was next in line, his uncles and his father looked like the healthiest people in the world.

Speaker 5:          05:56          Six months later they're dead. He was terrified. He came to me is a act of desperation. I mean, it's not a feeling, I guess they're not. Maybe I know or you know. But what happened when you walked in as like Terry, she knew exactly how he felt. You can't even process anything. You're just like almost in a trance. She'd gone through that before completely and utterly alone. She was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 34 it's a sense of falling. It's truly a sense of falling. The world slides away from you. You literally, it's almost like it disappears from underneath you. When she got the news, the first thing her doctor did, he was a friend of hers, pulled out the whiskey and put it on the table.

Speaker 6:          06:42          She had a shot, which was like, thank God he did that. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          06:47          he said, I'm not gonna [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          06:50          We're going to fight this thing. You are not alone. That's all I needed to hear.

Speaker 5:          06:57          And so when she was sitting there with with patient x,

Speaker 6:          07:00          she knew exactly what to say. You have to step forward. You can't step back and just [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          07:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          07:09          I was young then and so I felt, look, I fixed this thing. I'll take that on. I can help you. I don't care how horrible it's what happens next. So Terry runs back to her office and office. She shares with another doctor, Mary Bronner, Mary Brunner, I'm a pathologist. So I was like, Mary, Mary says you won't believe this, this guy, Mr x, walk into my office and he has this outrageous, his crazy family histories. Horrible problem was floored. Terry had never heard that pancreatic cancer could be inherited and families, they'd never heard of anything like that. Terry comes in and she's like, I've got to help this guy. I have to figure out what's making these people sick. And Mary, I need your help. And, and Mary, what did she say? Well, she's a pathologist. So, and what does it mean to be a pathologist? Well, she's, she's the person who physically does the diagnosis. When your surgeon does an operation on you or your internist takes a biopsy of you, they send that tissue to me and I make it into glass slides to look at under the microscopes. So she spends her time looking at tiny pieces of Terry's patients, smeared on little slots. I love the emotional distance that you have in pathology. You're, you know,

Speaker 6:          08:25          a step removed from the misery and it makes it so much easier for me to handle it. Does she interact with patients? Almost never. Terry was right up against in misery and she was just relaying the story to me. But I can sit very comfortably at my microscope and be very objective and just look at the tissue and decide where the cancer is because I don't know these patients. So you're like, I gotta go do this. Come with me as she usually does. How did you decide that

Speaker 8:          08:56          Mary should join you? She's my science partner. That's it.

Speaker 9:          09:02          And I have to in the cat, I usually,

Speaker 5:          09:05          so they decided in order to help this guy, they need to go to where his family is.

Speaker 6:          09:09          He drove across the mountains of Washington state. [inaudible] track. They went, wanted to get the family together. Three exactly. Nicknames, draw their blood, look at their blood to see if there's something in there that's making all these people sick. And

Speaker 8:          09:27          we arrive at the little tiny town in eastern Washington, a little town called Elma. And then they didn't even have, they're so small, they don't have a single medical facility. So in order to do the blood draw, we basically had to use the subway sandwich shop in town. Why? Why subway would have great sandwiches. One of the family members worked there and asked the boss if, if the family could all come and these doctors could come and draw their blood and could we use the shop as the meeting place

Speaker 5:          09:57          walking in and thinking this is small. So we've set up a little corner booth with our box of blood drawing supplies and they sort of came in waves, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews and they brought their kids filled that subway sandwich shop. How many in all? About 30 it was funny cause they hadn't seen each other or like,

Speaker 9:          10:20          oh my God, see you in 10 years.

Speaker 5:          10:23          It's like wow, you guys only live like five miles up there. We'd bring them over to our little tiny booth and we'd introduce ourselves. I'm Carrie Brenton or Mary Brian or GI doctor. I am a surgical oncologist. The purpose of our work today is that we are trying to find the cancer gene that causes the disease in your family.

Speaker 6:          10:44          With your permission today, we'd like to take a small blood sample. It's about the size of two tablespoons. You will not get any results back from this blood test. I want to be really clear about that. It's all for us to try and find the gene. I can't even promise that. We'll definitely find that gene.

Speaker 5:          11:02          Here is your sandwich and now me have some blood.

Speaker 8:          11:06          As we were waiting for most of the family to show up, Terry and I were sitting in this one booth with one of the family members who we had already identified as having the disease. He was young, he was in his thirties and all I could think was you have a time bomb inside your body.

Speaker 4:          11:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:33          and then this little boy comes running into the subway sandwich shop, just like friends up to this guy that we're talking to, this patient to family ex. Well, his, his arms around his daddy's neck and kisses him and, and, and all I could think was, oh my God, this beautiful little child, he has 50% chance of having this hideous disease. And I was so upset about that. I was just so torn apart inside, but I couldn't really, you know, start over

Speaker 5:          12:06          bawling right there. Rest your head. That wouldn't have been professional.

Speaker 8:          12:11          I held it together until we were driving home and, and I was telling Terry how sad I was about that little boy and how it just really hit me. And she said, oh,

Speaker 5:          12:22          hello. Don't worry about him. He's adopted.

Speaker 8:          12:30          You have to remember, Mary doesn't come face to face with patients very often. It's not something a pathologist does very frequently. Pathologists have the, I don't even know if I want to tell you this is sort of like [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          12:43          the black side of pathology, black humor to get you through or whatever. Yeah. Really black humor, you know, we'll see things like, um, somebody better tell this patient not to buy the big tube of toothpaste. Terry's laughing, but that's why we do it because it's so horrible. I spent an afternoon with Mary going through slides, looking at pancreatic tissue, three trying to figure out like, you know, if this person has cancer or not. Dozens of patients. Now this is another case with it. Terrible, terrible case. And that's when I really kind of got it. Like why she'd want to keep herself distant. Oh, this cancer is even worse than the last one. This person, if they can go to a beautiful place on planet earth and just stay there till it's over, we would have enough to subway though. I mean, were they able to, you know, figure out what's causing this thing?

Speaker 5:          13:51          Well, once they got the blood, they worked on it for about five years, five years. You know, they went chromosome by chromosome, collaborated with all these other researchers and at the end of the day they discovered that the thing that causes familial pancreatic cancer comes down to a mistake. One little mistake on one, one molecule molecule. I know it comes down to one tiny molecule. Yes. So our discovery is, uh, we're titling it Paladin mutation causes familial pancreatic cancer and suggests a new cancer mechanism. So they write a paper, I have a press conference of all I want to acknowledge and they celebrate. So in the end, do they, do they find a cure? Well, no, not yet. They're working on, can they at least, um, test for it now? Well, they can test, but you know, most pancreatic cancer isn't hereditary like this. This is actually a small subset.

Speaker 10:         14:52          Do Girl. So where does that leave Mary and Terry? I mean, where are they now? Mary's really, yeah,

Speaker 6:          15:00          glad the research phase is over and that she doesn't have to be with patients anymore. Terri nodes, they have more work to do and they can't really give up, but she's really tired and thinks about it a lot. You know, the stakes are so high in this eye. Sometimes it's almost unbearable. Sometimes I think I should quit. Really? Yeah, totally. I've talked to Mary about it, but you know what? I know she'll, I never stopped doing it. Right. Terry

Speaker 9:          15:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          15:36          sometimes it's just too much

Speaker 9:          15:40          too.

Speaker 6:          15:40          Mary and I love to garden. So sometimes you know, we think about being landscape architects. Yeah. And then the worst thing that does is, oh, I killed the bush. They were like, you lose, you killed the bush.

Speaker 9:          16:12          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         16:12          thanks to the little Kelsey for reporting that story.

Speaker 6:          16:15          The next story concerns a dad and his little boy. There's something about this little boy that is not quite right, but there's something about the dad that doesn't want to say. So

Speaker 1:          16:24          that's coming up in about a minute. I'm Jabu Rod and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. We'll continue.

Speaker 11:         16:31          Radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Hey, I'm Jana. Boom Ryan. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. This hour our topic is diagnosis. This next story begins with a dad, two sons and a question. What do you do when you notice somebody different? I heard it from reporter Gregory, right?

Speaker 10:         17:00          Hello. Hi Gregory. Found it very rewarding. It's nice to meet. Nice to meet you in case. Just so you know, it took me over a year. You can sit down and you've to finally get an interview with Byron France. I'm wondering if the air, I can turn the dead in their storage yard and I'm up in his apartment in the South Bronx. You'll have to skills all of this loose paperwork. Are you just, are you moving out or are you moving? It looks like look like that. Was that messy. I don't want boxes everywhere. Crazy piles of stuff. Okay, let go. Don't worry about a sure. Yeah. Sorry. Already seen it up. It's in disarray. So who is this guy? I A, I am a retired electrical engineer. He worked for subway most of his life now. Uh, I consider myself a science researcher and it's 71 years old. He's basically teaching himself onto physics. That's what all the books and stuff you see around. I love that stuff. And he's written this book called Einstein's era criticizing special relativity. Einstein. I sent it to the New York Academy of Science at Caltech, MIT, Harvard, even Hawkins. Still waiting for him to get back. Most people just ignore him. These are the rabies off maniac. But then he points to his letter on the wall. Yeah. From Neil degrasse Tyson. They know that name, this major scientist? Yes. Ahead of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. Exactly. Yeah. And it says how

Speaker 12:         18:20          there you, you're just an engineer. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         18:24          Ah,

Speaker 12:         18:24          and he's BV. Why, why do you smile when, when, when you talk about that letter from Neil degrasse Tyson because they know how foolish it is. Einstein, they didn't even want to read his paper. He said, who is this guy up? Scott. He just a patent examination clerk. And Bern. Byron founders is a man who's proud to go against the grain. The what other people do. I don't really do.

Speaker 10:         18:51          And that's especially true with how he raised his son. So now, uh, Gregory, you're going to do, uh, some kind of a story on he manuals. Youngest son, right? Emmanuel. Okay. And that's why I'm here focusing on two to question him about how he raised his son. Alright, that'd be glad to. Okay, great. So here's the manual.

Speaker 14:         19:08          Hi, I'm Emmanuel [inaudible]. A man, could you take a drink of water for me? Just okay, thank you. No, don't take me. Yeah, take as many drinks of water if you want. He's 28 so what things are you good at? Manual, um, writing essays and making sure they aren't grammatically correct. [inaudible] bowling and so you can hear analyzing stuff. There is something going on with them. Um, and, and, and not talking that much. Yes. No. If you ask dad,

Speaker 10:         19:44          he'll say, Emmanuel's an excellent student. Our Future, no balance is going to win a Nobel prize. You never know. But

Speaker 14:         19:51          if you ask Blair, I'm Blair frown or who's that Emmanuel's half-brother. I'm about 20 years old. And then Emmanuel, he'll tell you that even as a little kid, very little, five years old, there was something odd and I just didn't know what it was. It's a bunch of little things.

Speaker 15:         20:05          Yeah. Like he'd look at you really weird, kind of like a Dow face expression. He could stare at me without blinking for 15 minutes at a time and I would notice, cause you didn't blink once then there was a speech. I did not talk as much as other people. There was something going on with the manual, but I did not have a word for it. And so I'm

Speaker 14:         20:29          pushed several times to get speech therapy,

Speaker 10:         20:32          but every time he did, dad would just say, are you kidding? He may have troubled stumbling and stammering, but he'll grow out of it. I started to layer, you also started Einstein. He didn't speak a word until he was six. He was considered retarded school. He would say that this was some, a temporary problem that would pass. I didn't see anything that was, that was screaming out for attention. He was doing his work. He was interested in the next, we would go out endlessly in cold weather to the park and it seemed like things were okay. What about Emmanuel?

Speaker 14:         21:07          Well, I knew then I was a nicer person and nicer person. Yay. And then I was sent [inaudible]. I don't automatically look at people in the eyes, the face and stuff, you know?

Speaker 16:         21:28          So as long as Emmanuel was a little kid, it wasn't such a big deal. But then he got older,

Speaker 15:         21:34          he was around 10 years old and it was, I think at the point where I'm on, the people would point it out. What did they say? Well, I have been called, um, returning an idiot savant, the n word and stuff.

Speaker 16:         21:51          They lost the innocence of the elementary school. Emmanuel would come home with bruises on his arms. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was something that I constantly thought about and worried about.

Speaker 15:         22:01          I said, yeah, well it'd be really good for him to get professional help with that.

Speaker 16:         22:05          Did you ask dad? He said the problem wasn't a manual. No, it was all the other people. The bully. See, uh, the group

Speaker 10:         22:13          in this neighborhood, it was hot. There was fighting constant fighting right down the street over here. People involved with crack. These are big guys. You know, I felt that it could have been a dangerous situation. So his solution, I decided that I wanted to teach you manual homeschool was just to pull his son out of school.

Speaker 14:         22:36          Yeah. And how do you feel about this at the time? Well, I, I really didn't know.

Speaker 10:         22:42          Oh, up here. So we're looking in the closet here. I thought that whatever way he is kind of turned in. This is a binder from one of his classes that if he got bullied and tormented and going to school, that it would turn him further in. Oh, let's see what this did. If he were here, he could develop along his own line until he became old enough that they wouldn't want to pick on him. Oh, look what we turned to nature. Nurture. It was a big deal for dad. You hadn't homeschooled anybody else before, right? No. I had to get books. I had to go meet the principal. He left his job, submitted a curriculum to the school and I had to register with the state of New York, created this syllabus for his son, great. 10 integrated math courses and they would wake up each morning rational numbers, geometry, do their lessons. He's trying to leak lateral, trying have some lunch. This is the work that he did at home and in the afternoon they'd go bowling. Bowling.

Speaker 17:         23:42          The manual was an awesome book. [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         23:46          his dad would videotape them.

Speaker 17:         23:47          Today is Tuesday, December 28 1993. It's weird footage. It's weird to watch because the manual is such an incredibly good boulder. Yeah, he took it out but beautiful shot. He's always by himself.

Speaker 12:         24:09          Tape after tape of nothing but a manual. Nobody else in the picture

Speaker 15:         24:14          I would fan to size about throwing an into and winning some times and stuff.

Speaker 12:         24:24          Did you think about joining any youth league?

Speaker 15:         24:27          Well, well I vaguely dawn about it but um, but for some reason my dad um, did not want me to

Speaker 4:          24:47          [inaudible].

Speaker 14:         24:48          Meanwhile his brother is just players in Canada at a distance. Yeah. He followed a girl there and one day he picks a book off the shelf, the DSM and the DSM is the a diagdiagnosis statistical manual of mental disorders and I started just to do, I guess what a lot of people would do who could get a hold of this thing is to start diagnosing all of their friends. I diagnosed my girlfriend and I diagnosed my dad and then I saw her right there on the page.

Speaker 16:         25:20          Marc's impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye gaze, repetitive behavior patterns, problem seeking, new friends, problem, being able to understand what someone must be thinking. Problems. Okay. Went down this whole list and everything seemed to fit Martin Pyramids and I, I gave this promise every time he tried to call his dad. What do you think his dad would say? Just stop whining. Let go. He'll just go through this and he shot him out. Or you basically cut communication? I know my son,

Speaker 14:         25:53          he would always tell me. Then whenever I hand would go way when I was in adult. What does an adult mean? Does that mean 1820 maybe 20 lesson. Okay, so you thought as soon as I reached the age of 20 then I won't have these problems. Yeah. So did you wake up on your 20th birthday and think I thought they made me, things would change right away.

Speaker 3:          26:23          Okay.

Speaker 14:         26:24          But they didn't, after that, Emmanuel says he got really depressed

Speaker 3:          26:31          and

Speaker 14:         26:31          that's how things might've stayed

Speaker 3:          26:34          until dad had a heart attack.

Speaker 14:         26:41          Blair comes to the hospital, finds dead unconscious in the bed, and he realizes this is my big chance because he was not in a position to intervene. And you're thinking, I'm thinking the first thing that's going to happen is that we're going to get a diagnosis because we're waiting for it for so many years, 26 or older or whatever. He goes like 25 means he's going to get help. You know, he's, he has to go, here's the, okay, 2005 so where are we coming into now we're at 42nd street times square

Speaker 18:         27:10          time square is one of Emanuel's favorite areas to hang out and I figured I wanted to be on his surf so they're outside. The crowd is just beginning to arrive. It was starting to snow a little bit and rain some too. Yeah. Blair turns to me and he says, oh, have you ever heard of [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          27:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         27:33          autism? I said, I highly suspect that you have some form of autism and I want us to find some way for you to get a diagnosis.

Speaker 3:          27:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         27:52          oh, and I said six. Don't read the word of this to death.

Speaker 3:          28:04          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         28:05          Dr. How do I pronounce your name? FDIC. Yeah. And agnostic. And pretty soon after new years, oh, and where are you from? Manual gets his diagnosis. He goes right here on this couch. I did get a feeling from my beginning of the direction that he was going to meet criteria for autism. And a month later she told me did. I was on the autistic spectrum. It was official,

Speaker 19:         28:29          um, k football, even Maria, uh, good.

Speaker 14:         28:35          And so at the age of 26, finally Maria, he, his life completely changed. So I gave him a tape recorder to record his life. Hello with me venue. He's meeting with the speech pathologist a couple of hours a week also. He's joined this program. I know tastings. Started making friends. Oh, do I say hello? Hey Jason. Peace out. Got a girlfriend.

Speaker 20:         29:03          Hey, it's me, Emmanuel once again. And there's one lady that I haven't talked about your name, Norma. And we went to central park and we took pitches and it was great.

Speaker 14:         29:19          But I want you to say, I thought that people who are diagnosed with autism don't this, the definition is they don't want to socialize. Well ms not because I don't do want to buy [inaudible] this is hard to do. He know. But here's the thing about a manual. He's had this whole new life. He hasn't told dad about any of it. Hello? Anything. Not

Speaker 10:         29:42          the girl, the friends, the diagnosis. His Dad doesn't know anything's different. So how long have you been keeping it a secret?

Speaker 14:         29:50          Uh, it's been since 2005. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         29:54          So basically for the last two years I manual has been leading this double life outside. He's a person with autism, then he comes home. Nothing's wrong. Why [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         30:04          well, um, just the fainting, the, anyone, um, really, um, believe in,

Speaker 10:         30:12          but he knows he's got to tell his dad who he really is. Do and he keeps saying he will. Yeah,

Speaker 20:         30:18          I'm say within a month soon. I'm not quite sure. We can, I am a little bit nervous about telling him maybe within a few minutes, assuming, let me tell him in like two weeks or so. Another day, a mind telling method. I mean Blair [inaudible] well tomorrow maybe one or no. Yeah, maybe I'm just thinking about it a little bit too much. I don't know. Men. Finally one night I just want to saying that I told him and about my diagnosis, um, I said I really have something important to say and don't get angry. And then I told him that I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and he asked me what it was and then I told them it is high functioning autism.

Speaker 10:         31:14          Uh, I was shocked. That would, that would be a good way to put it. So do you think he has Asperger's? Yes. Yes I do.

Speaker 3:          31:28          Okay.

Speaker 10:         31:28          When I look at this syndrome for a lot of good parts of it, it's e manual, but I never at any point felt that that Emmanuel was in need of any deep psychological or psych psychiatric help.

Speaker 3:          31:45          But

Speaker 10:         31:48          you mean what makes you qualified to say that? Just being a loving parent as I'm talking to him. We're sitting there on the couch in front of us on the coffee table, is all of the manuals, notebooks from age five onwards and they're, they're really good stuff. I mean it's, it's stuff that you and I would write and he saved it all. But the question that I feel like I gotta ask her and I just have one more question on my list if I can ask you that one is, um, now that you know that there is something wrong with your son, that there always was this disorder, that it's incurable. Do you think you did the right thing? So d, do you wish that he had gotten the diagnosis earlier? No, because I think that he's better off at this point in time. Why wouldn't it make a difference to know earlier what's why you're acting. So I

Speaker 8:          32:40          didn't want you manual to get a diagnosis that would put him in a box, like a label. And then dad says to me, remember, look, I mean if I let the school give him some kind of diagnosis, they would have thrown him in special ed and say, oh, he's a retard. Look, he can't even talk. I mean, that would have destroyed them. Do what? Cause irreparable damage. I asked the doctor, was there any truth to that? If a manual was put into special Ed, hypothetically, he wasn't a district's. If the five class, the technical word for special ed would not have raised his academic potential. He, he said graduate from Saint John's with a degree in psychology. Kids who graduated district 75 don't do that. Just to put that in perspective, Emmanuel comes from a neighborhood where about 10% of the kids ever graduate college, and my GPA was like 3.4 and change. Wow. And he's got Asperger's. So now we're kind of in the opposite. We're kind of vindicating really what his father did. Right. Well, in terms of his academic achievement, his father did the right thing. The problem with his dad's choice and he had no way of knowing at the time was the lack of peer groups with teammates down. It seems like a cruel choice, but with choice. So if you were your father and you were raising your kid at that time, would you have made the same choice he did?

Speaker 20:         34:03          Uh, well con, well, if I had known what I known now, then maybe I would have maybe back to him a little more for me. You get to interact with others who were like, I am, who are like, I am

Speaker 9:          34:38          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          35:17          hello, I'm Jad Boom Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab. This hour we're going to talking about diagnosis, diagnosis, the easy kind. We're not going to talk about it. Easy would be you come into my office and I'm a doctor. You have a broken arm. I take a picture. I say, Hey, you've got a broken arm. The picture says so. Yeah. Cause you can see the break right there. But let's suppose you came into my office and you sad. You tell me that your sex drive is down. Yay. I'm the doctors who are gonna sit. But just between you and me. All right. Well, right away my learning tells me that you may be a candidate for depression, but how do I know that you're depressed? What do you mean? How do we know we talk about it? You just said, well you can't measure sadness or depression. You can't go to a test tube and count anything.

Speaker 1:          36:02          Right. It's not hard science. Yeah, because till now, what if I put you in, you know, one of those FMR try machines that we've talked about so often? Yeah. I snap a picture of your brain in action and I look at it and from your picture I say that you are depressed. You're going to tell me I'm depressed. Just from looking at a picture of my brain. Yes, no way. Look, it's now here. Photographic diagnosis of mental illness is happening. There is no question and that by the way is Eric Candela professor up at Columbia University who just happens to have won the Nobel prize for medicine. Let me give you a little historical background. Did you get a note? Oh, I don't think you did. I still don't believe you. And what just cause he's got a Nobel prize. I'm going to suddenly turn it on. You're not.

Speaker 1:          36:50          So let's do this step by step. Okay. Step one. Imagine you're slipping into an FMRI machine. Okay. Right now I want you to just look at my face. Why is that so difficult? I just wanna where this is going anywhere here. Okay. I'm looking at your face now that you're looking at my face, different regions of the brain, they become active. There are cells in your brain that are saying, I know him. The cells are more active. They need energy. Just like when you run, you have to breathe fast and to get the energy, your heart pumps more blood. The body sends a rush of fresh blood with that particular group of cells and because the blood has iron in it, the magnet and the brain scanner can see the iron and therefore see the blood flow and take pictures of it. Many, many pictures in real time.

Speaker 1:          37:42          I'll show you a very nice example of this. Eric's now heading off across his ample office with an extraordinary view of the Hudson Valley and he brought over a picture of a human brain with different colors in different areas, and he told me, when you look at a face, when you image the face, this area lights up. You're pointing to an area of the gray area of the brain. You're on your forehead kind of. That's right. That's right. If you look at a house, some other area lights up, but this area does not light up. You look at another face. This area lights up again every time you see a face, the same area. Yup. But you haven't told me anything about emotions yet. That's true. So let's move on to step two because we use faces to tell what someone else is thinking or someone else's feeling.

Speaker 1:          38:24          Looking at faces also triggers an area deep in the brain that is concerned with emotion called the Amygdala. Now very recently number of people have at the make the looking at faces and it's extremely interesting. Step three. Okay, I'm going to take you now to London. Hello. Hi. Yeah, hi. Yeah, that's good. It's [inaudible] who's this? Oh wait, sorry. Who are you? I'm Cynthia [inaudible]. My psychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry. King's college. London. And Are you liking your thirties or your forties or fifties this is part of the interview I want cause like, cause I wanted to establish that she came into psychiatry. Trying to think, when did I graduate medical school. I didn't have very critical time. I finished my training in 97 I training psychiatry in 97 that's 1997 when the Fmri machines were first becoming available. And so Cynthia was able to do a rather amazing study what in this study she got together a group of people who were clinically depressed, depressed people, and then another group of people who are normal healthy people and she put them in the brain scan machine and showed them facial expressions, thesis ranging from more neutral expressions to more sad expressions.

Speaker 1:          39:37          So they saw a sad face and then a neutral face and then a sad face. That's right. And what the person in the machine was supposed to do is look at these faces and decide whether it was a man or a woman's face. What does that have to do with anything? Because, because while they were doing that, how they're making the decision, the emotion of the face is being processed automatically. The amygdala sees the emotion on the faces at that moment and the machine, it's like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. And they were hundreds of pictures. 10th of a second to 10th of a second. A 10th of a second. That's right. Did you see a difference between the people who were depressed and the people who were normal? Yes. Was it a significant difference or just barely difference as a group it was a significant difference and now she takes the big step.

Speaker 1:          40:25          Step four from the pattern she sees in bunches of people, she feeds all those patterns into a computer called machine learning, told the program. This is a pattern of brain activity and depress people. This is a pattern of brain activity in healthy people. And then she shows the computer a brain scan of a new person. So this is someone in the computers never met before. Exactly. And she did this a bunch of time, right? A whole bunch of people and each time the computer tries to get, is this new person depressed or not? Oh and and what? What happened? More than 85% of the time, 86% of the time the algorithm correctly diagnosed whether that person was depressed or healthy

Speaker 9:          41:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         41:09          with just a brain scan, a computer and a patient. No doctor needed Cynthia's computer got the diagnosis right. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:18          6% of the time a computer. We saw the results. I was like, wow, this is amazing.

Speaker 16:         41:25          Wait a second. Has she repeated this? Well, this is actually the very first time that this has been done with depression and so it was

Speaker 1:          41:32          just a pilot study and like you say, someone else will have to do it again and again and again, but according to Cynthia potentials, fantastic. Psychiatry is going to be absolutely revolutionized by this. I think this method can be applied to any psychiatric disorder, any autism. It's a Freeney obsessive compulsive disorder. No Way. Come on. Why not? Every one of these illnesses ultimately must have an anatomical basis, every one of these illnesses, so this means that it will soon or one day be possible for a patient to come in and you take a picture of him in real time or of her and you will have a diagnostic tool. That's what you're saying? Absolutely. Absolutely. You mean to tell me that they're going to put people in machines and just go boom, no, no, wait, wait, wait. This is not a casual thing. You go to the doctor, you tell the doctor that you're feeling a certain way.

Speaker 1:          42:27          The doctor will talk to you and then he would come to you and say, well my learning and the test tells me that you're ill. So that's all it's happening here is now the medical doctor was out at habitats. We haven't, there's nothing in this that feels invasive to you. Well obviously huddling into the deep depths of your personhood. No, this is, if you believe that mental illness is a mental illness, it is a structural condition which can be fixed. So it's not the deep inner you, it's the broken you. So it's like the broken arm. You started off with it that c you would put the two side by side think I would. And then of course you get to the next, come on rubber. I mean human beings are way too messy for that. You're too messy for it to be that easy.

Speaker 1:          43:09          No, no way. So you think this is out of science's reach? Really? It's just too, there's a part of me that does think it is out of science. Because you think you think that they're looking deep inside you. That's what you don't like. I do. I mean, don't get me wrong, I find brain scans fascinating when it comes to questions like where is the soul? Where does consciousness, that kind of stuff, but don't kind of get in my head and tell me what's what's right and what's wrong. Sad and sick. Don't you want to get better? Yes, but I enjoy the comfortable ambiguity that would come from a situation like sitting in a therapist office and saying, well, I'm, how am I feeling? I'm feeling this way or that way and in the messiness of trying to just rely on how you're feeling, there's a vast landscape of of things that can happen.

Speaker 1:          43:51          Choices. You can make, therapies you can pursue this way. Let's say you are sick and you know that you're sick machine or no. Okay. [inaudible] if you are feeling badly, wouldn't it be nice if a machine could help you find the right kind of help? What do you mean? Well, Eric took me through a little thought experiment, a mind experiment. You've developed a psychotherapy and I've developed a psychotherapy. We each claim it's the best in the world. Now we have an objective way of seeing this machine allows you to independently of any evaluation, see the outcome of treatment and so you can audit the doctor, audit the doctor and give you evidence that it's working or no. Okay. Yeah, a little bit on board. I G I can give you 10% buy in now. Okay, so how far off is this stuff? Is it going to come soon?

Speaker 1:          44:39          This is very early in the game obviously, but I get ask him like how far into the future are we talking about here? Soon or mid after long after you're dead. I'm going to be around a lot, but the question stands, will you make it to see that that people will actually have a, you don't want can't in medicine in all honesty, give a timeline for many of these things. Can imaging methodology right now is quite sophisticated but it's still primitive compared with needs to be. You're picking this up in status in this ascending. You become excited as the thing is beginning to emerge. We see it for the first time on the horizon. You saying we've got to the story too early. That's what you're saying, just right. It's not going to be interesting. 20 years from now, it'll be obvious. Or in 20 years it'll be obvious that we were wrong. Okay. That's a real possibility because what we don't know is alive. Vast. Yeah. And a, I want to tell you a story now about just how wrong people can be. Okay. It begins with a mystery, sudden infant death syndrome, perfectly healthy child goes to sleep and dies during the night.

Speaker 3:          45:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          45:51          it's about the worst thing that can happen to a parent. And each year it does happen about 7,000 times. It's still, no one knows why. Oh, and by the way, that was Robert Sapolsky. He's a professor of neuroscience at Stanford University, and the Spolsky tells this story of the moment sids was diagnosed for the first time, or at least classified in a terrible mistake that was made around 1900 or so. People were being made to recognize this as a disease entity and nobody knew what was up. So people decided, let's go dissect sid skids. Meaning when a baby would die, they would perform an autopsy. Exactly, yes. Checked the baby's inside. See if there's anything different in them from normal kids. That seems logical. Absolutely. They measure the size of the baby's lungs. Yep. Normal. They measured the size of the heart. Yep. Nothing strange there. Stomach, kidney, liver. Yep. Those are all fine. Then they would look in the throat.

Speaker 3:          46:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          46:48          they look in there and they say, oh my God, these sids kids, they have enormous famous glance. The thymus of famous. What is the famous, what is wonder? Well, it is a little tiny pink gland that is right. Your player red beyond your color though, Huh? At the base of your throat and its job is to help you fight disease makes one type of cell critical to your immune system, especially in times of stress. Any case, normally this little organ is about the size of a tiny tube of toothpaste, like the tribal coin, but in these six kids it was huge. MongoDB, enormous. Twice size. Exactly. And since the thymus is dangerously close to the windpipe, doctors came up with a hypothesis, perfectly reasonable hypothesis, which was that maybe if you're one of these babies with an enlarged thymus and you're asleep and somehow you roll over wrong [inaudible] well that gland might press down on your trachea and suffocate you during the night.

Speaker 1:          47:49          Oh, so medical mystery solved. Really? No, they even came up with a name for it. It was called status find mackolen phatic in the spoons. It was an all the pediatric textbooks by the 1920s and you would look in there and there'd be pictures. There would be pictures of the dissector fine mrs normal size and here on the right in large abnormally large status find the colon fat. And in no time at all, doctors came up with a treatment, perfectly logical therapy, which is that if we're going to help these babies, we've got to shrink their thymus gland. And to do that, the best solution obviously is to irradiate their throats or radiate their throats to shrink their thymus gland.

Speaker 17:         48:40          Come on the child's throat with trillions of radioactive particles.

Speaker 1:          48:47          You literally, you Betcha. And this was considered like something every good loving parents should do. Absolutely. If you worry about your child being at risk for sids, go and get their throats irradiated to shrink the thymus gland and did it work? Yes. Shrank the thymus gland. But he says it did have another effect. Decades later. You've killed 20 to 30,000 people with thyroid cancer.

Speaker 9:          49:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          49:13          20 30,000 deaths. That's a, that's a real number. Yeah, that's a, that's a fairly big one. So here's my question. How could these doctors have gotten it so, so, so, so, so wrong. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. I don't. You know what you mean? You just answered your own question a minute ago. No, no, I didn't. I'm about to answer it right now. They're, they're playing with radiation. You just said that. But what they, what? They didn't know that radiation would hurt you. They had no, it was like, that's not technology, but that's not what I was going to

Speaker 9:          49:47          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          49:47          This was, you know, a couple of decades into radiation having been discovered. I could cope, start performing near miracles of diagnosis and discovery. People were just tossing around radiation all over the place. Iodine one 31 radioactive sodium right off gamma rays neutron and this was a period with madame Curie dipping her arm into vats of uranium. Radioactivity is harmless in dying. Soon afterwards from cancer, people who would go into shoe stores and they would have their feet. Yes, x ray is a wonderful invention. I had that. You had that. I did naturally take off your shoes and you can look at your balloons. That's exactly what that, how would you do? That's what that was. That was the thing you could do at the shoe store. It was very cool. Yeah. Showing how cutting edge of a shoe store or they aren't yet

Speaker 4:          50:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          50:37          your explanation. No, that may look like the explanation. I made sure every radiation, we played a role, but if you would have, let me say what I was going to say, I would have told you the real explanation. Yes. Preceded the radiation by like a couple hundred years. Hello? I don't no idea what you're talking. I'm going to tell you back in the 17 hundreds okay. That far back, that far back before radiation, before your grandpa four, uh, before the civil war or the Eiffel tower or Napoleon, I'm talking when the red coats were still wearing red. Yeah. Yeah. This was shortly after the revolutionary war. Right about this time says, supposedly the first med schools started to pop up in America and a supply and demand issue came into effect because with these med schools came med students, all students who needed to learn about anatomy and of course in order to do that, they needed bodies, you know, to dissect this produced this whole occupation. You could be a resurrection or resurrect Shanice. Yup. And they would go out and dig up bodies that's at night.

Speaker 1:          51:43          Then sell them to the anatomist as the medical schools. I'll need two more by Thursday. Dang. Now, here's the key points. Since demand was so high, the resurrection just had to go where the bodies were easiest to get, which meant, you know, avoiding the fancy graveyards. If you were wealthy, you could have yourself buried in what was called a patent coffin, which was a tripled way or coffin, which was meant to be resurrection as proof. But if you are not wealthy, no fancy coffin for you, you'd probably just be buried in a sack in some poppers field, just a few inches under the soil. Very accessible for these resurrection lists. Not surprisingly, that's where they weren't always telling the same topic. Are you explaining why children died there? Me. Alright. What I'm trying to make is that the grave robbers targeted the poor so much so it's sometimes when they, you know, people would catch these resurrection that's in the act and see like, oh my God, that's my dad. You're digging up. There'd be riots.

Speaker 4:          52:54          Stop stealing off treats. We're called out and wires were shot. Are we talking like hundreds of people? Torch bearing was townies versus the people you were trying to dissect their dead relatives. This

Speaker 1:          53:11          is a lot of history. I'm very fascinated in quotes. What does this have to do with kids dying of fire? Right? Let me bring it home. Not that it hasn't been interesting, but bring it home. Okay. As a result of all of this hubbub over a grave robbing country after country Europe decided, no, let's standardize how science gets it's cadavers. Forget all this grave robbing. So they passed laws which formalized anyone who died in a poor house, a, their body would be turned over to the anatomists. This was like the cadaver version of direct deposit. Okay, so great. Robyn was gone, but now all the bodies used by medicine and not just some, but nearly all now came from the poor estimates were by the end of that century, 99% of the body's used for, for anatomy lessons had been derived from poor houses and that seemed okay until 1936 a guy named Hans Lea showed that being poor actually warps your body. And now Robert, now we come back to the gates of the mysteriously enlarged thymus. Cause if you're poor, you're either worried about your job, you're worried about feeding your family, you're worried about the bills. In other words, you are stressed out and during chronic stress your immune system goes down the tubes. And since the time is this part of the immune system, if you are chronically stressed, the thymus gland shrinks.

Speaker 6:          54:35          [inaudible] for 150 years, doctors had been dissecting cadavers, pointing at organs which they thought were normal, but which were in fact shrunken from a life of poverty and stress and saying that's normal. So that when these sids babies show up with these gigantic Thomas', oh my God, in fact, that was the first time they'd ever seen a normal one. People had no idea what was normal and what was abnormal and they got it backwards. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          55:38          Robert Sapolsky, a professor of neuroscience at Stanford University. He's the author of many great books including monkey love, the trouble with testosterone from our information on him or anything that you heard in this hour.
