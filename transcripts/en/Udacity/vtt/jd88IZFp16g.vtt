00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.589
In the previous examples,

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.520
we looked at how to write accessible
styles for individual components.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.080
But let's take a step back for
a moment, and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.890
consider how we can apply accessibility
best practices to our entire site.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.050
I'm sure you're familiar with the
concepts around building a responsive

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.450
website and why it's a best
practice to design responsively so

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.250
you get a great multi-device experience.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.440
But did you realize that responsive
design is also a huge win for

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.080
accessibility?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.840
Let me show you some examples of how you
can use responsive design to improve

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.160
the experience on your site for
all your users.
