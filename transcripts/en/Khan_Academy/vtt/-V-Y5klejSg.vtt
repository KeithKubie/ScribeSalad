00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:02.864
We have now talked a lot about the demand curve

00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:04.842
and the consumer surplus;

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.048
now let's look at the other side.

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:08.911
Let's think about the supply curve

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.511
and you could imagine that there might be

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:13.025
something called the producer surplus.

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:15.513
So let's say that this is price axis,

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:17.823
this is the quantity axis

00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:23.741
and let's say that we are running some type of a berry farm

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.492
and this is our supply curve.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:34.010
That is the supply curve and this is our demand curve.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.790
So that is the demand

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.380
and just like what we did to the supply curve,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.510
for the demand curve, now instead of thinking of a price and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.279
think about how much quantity would be supplied,

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:47.060
let's think about a given quantity and think about what price

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.294
would it have to be in order for the producers to produce

00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:52.082
that quantity.

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:53.673
And let's say that this quantity right over here, this is

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:58.005
in thousands of pounds of berries, thousands of pounds.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.081
So this is 1 thousand pounds, 2 thousand pounds, 3 thousand

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:06.478
pounds, 4 thousand pounds, and 5 thousand pounds.

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:10.276
And let's say this price right over here is 1 dollar per pound,

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:16.148
$2, $3, $4, maybe I could make it more even,

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:22.977
so this is $3, this is $4, this is $5 per pound.

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:27.897
Let me write this all in per pound.

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:32.382
So let's say that we want the suppliers to produce

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:39.062
1 thousand pounds of berries, so this is we want them to

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:40.531
produce 1 thousand pounds of berries,

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.857
What does the price have to be for them to produce

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:47.908
1 thousand pounds of berries. Well think of it from the suppliers

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.878
from the berry farmers' point of view.  If they are going

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.362
to produce 1 thousand pounds of berries. in order for them

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:56.142
to produce it, in order to convince them produce it,

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:59.913
they have to get at minimum as much as they would get

00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:04.395
using the same resources to produce something else.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:08.307
So if they could get a dollar per pound or equivalent in dollars

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:10.975
of a dollar per pound for those first thousand pounds,

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.177
so about a thousand dollars. If they could get that by using their

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:19.465
land for an apple orchard or using it to graze  or maybe renting

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:22.676
out the land to someone else, that's the minimum you would

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:23.978
have to pay them. Because if you pay them less than that

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:27.916
they would go do the other thing. They would go and rent

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:31.252
their land out or they will allow their land for grazing.

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:34.353
So you would have to pay them the opportunity cost

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:37.867
for them to produce a thousand pounds. So the opportunity

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:41.502
cost for them to producing a thousand pounds would be right

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.820
over there. And this is on average first thousand pounds

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.421
you could also think that the very first pound, the opportunity

00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:51.000
cost would be right over there, and the next pound would be right

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.507
after that. The five hundred pound would be there,

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.071
the thousand pound would right be there. or you could say

00:02:56.071 --> 00:03:00.424
the first thousand pound on average would be right over there.

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:03.333
Now let's say that we wanted them to produce another

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.916
thousand pounds. So we want the market or this entire farm

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:10.137
to produce or maybe it's multiple farms to produce a total

00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:12.607
of two thousand pounds. What would we have to do?

00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:17.233
Well, same exact thing. We kind of assuming the market

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.699
is already producing that first thousand pounds. So now we

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.199
would have to think about what are they giving up to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.634
produce that next thousand pounds. And now we would

00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:28.196
assume that for that first thousand pounds, they would have

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:32.344
used the land and the inputs that are most suitable

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:39.080
so this is the most suitable resources. So we are talking

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.576
about the labour that really knows how to grow berries.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:44.478
The land where the berries are the best grown and maybe

00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:46.907
they are really close to transportation networks so it's much

00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:50.216
cheaper to produce and ship from there. But now if we want

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:52.796
another two thousand pounds of berries at this time period

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:58.244
and maybe this per year if we want another thousand pounds.

00:03:58.244 --> 00:04:01.428
They are now going to less suitable resources,

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:04.499
maybe the land is slightly further away from the transportation resources,

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.697
they are now going to have labours that are slightly less

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:09.813
efficient, they are going have to take land away from that.

00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:12.701
might have been slightly more suitable for other things.

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:16.213
So now the opportunity cost for these growers for the next thousand pounds

00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:18.645
is going to be slightly higher.

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.435
So their opportunity cost is going to be like that on average

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:27.076
for the next thousand pounds. You could that the opportunity cost for the one thousand pounds will be right over there

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.712
for the two thousand pounds would be right over there. But

00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:34.208
on average for the two thousand pounds, this is their opportunity cost

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:37.908
now, same thing, the next thousand pounds after that If we

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:41.482
want to get the market, if we want the whole supply be three thousand pounds

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:44.064
they would have to produce, they would have to get that

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:47.948
their opportunity across that incremental thousand pounds

00:04:47.948 --> 00:04:50.698
that opportunity cost of that incremental thousand pounds.

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:55.360
So view it as this way, the supply curve no longer and it is

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.929
the same exact curve, before we used to say, oh if we want

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.299
how much would people produce if the price were 3 dollars.

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:05.247
Oh they produce 3 thousand pounds, now we are looking at

00:05:05.247 --> 00:05:08.683
the other way, we are saying if we want the suppliers to

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:12.462
produce 3 thousand pounds, what would the price actually

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:16.599
have to be. Now with that out of the way, now we can think

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.858
about the supply curve is really a opportunity cost curve

00:05:19.858 --> 00:05:23.514
for the suppliers. And let's say that this is supply and the

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:26.742
demand, and then this would be the actual price which

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:29.397
supply equals demand right over there so let's

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:32.448
just say that is the market price. So what's going on

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.201
over here, all of the suppliers, so this is the price

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.065
here let's just for making the math simple, let's just say

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:41.114
that price here is 4 dollars and the quantity demanded

00:05:41.114 --> 00:05:44.745
and the quantity supplied here is 4 thousand pounds. What's going on

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:48.333
here, the very first 4 thousandth pound produced by the

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.714
suppliers, the opportunity cost for them to produce it

00:05:50.714 --> 00:05:52.326
would be 4 dollars. We are gonna get exactly 4 dollars for it

00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:58.915
so they are right on the fence. but for the first three

00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:04.029
thousand 999 pounds, the opportunity cost of producing it

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.063
was lower than the price to get it, so in this situation

00:06:08.063 --> 00:06:12.416
the producers are getting more, for the first 3999 pounds.

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:16.798
They are getting more for their berries than their opportunity

00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.561
cost and just like we talked about, the consumer surplus,

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:25.428
this is the producer surplus. So, for example, for the first thousand pounds right here,

00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:29.934
the producers, their opportunity cost was a little over a dollar a pound

00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:32.408
but they are getting 4 dollars a pound for it.

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.162
For the next thousand pounds, the opportunity cost is approaching

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:38.967
2 dollars per pound, like a $1.75, just eyeballing it.

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:41.531
Once again, they are getting 4 dollars a pound for it

00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.198
so they are getting this surplus, so if you think about

00:06:44.198 --> 00:06:48.381
the entire market, the producers as a whole, they are getting this entire

00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:52.696
area, this entire area represents the excess value that they are getting above and beyond

00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:57.764
their opportunity cost, and we call this right over here the

00:06:57.764 --> 00:07:03.903
producer surplus, the producer surplus. And we are assuming

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:07.384
or we will assume a linear supply curve

00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.259
right over here.  This is just a triangle, the area of

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:15.949
a triangle. This length right on this side is just 4-1,

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.646
it's just 3, 3 dollars per pound

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:24.213
and then this length right over here is 4 thousand

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:27.049
pounds, 4 thousand pounds. So to find the producer surplus,

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:28.831
we are just finding the area of this region.

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.543
So, let me write this, the producer surplus

00:07:31.543 --> 00:07:34.598
here is going to be, I will use the same color,

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:38.197
3 times,  I want to do it with pink,

00:07:38.197 --> 00:07:45.515
3 times the 4 thousand, and that would give us

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.044
the area of this entire rectangle, so we have to divide it

00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:51.878
by 2.  That's just finding the area of the triangle,

00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:55.647
so times one half, dividing by 2.  And so this gives us one

00:07:55.647 --> 00:08:01.166
half times 4 thousand is 2 thousand times 3 is 6 thousand.

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:03.750
And you could look at the unit, it's 6 thousand

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.100
or 3 dollars per pound times thousand of pounds per week

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.548
so we end up with, so the, we end up with 6 thousand dollars

00:08:14.548 --> 99:59:59.999
of producers' surplus per week.
