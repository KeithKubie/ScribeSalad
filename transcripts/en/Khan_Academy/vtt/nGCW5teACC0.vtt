00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.490
Let g of x equal
negative 4x plus 7.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.870
What is the value of the limit
as x approaches negative 1

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.060
of all of this?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.900
So before we think about this,
let's just visualize the line.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.140
And then we can think about
what they're asking here.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.110
So let me draw some axes here.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.875
So this is my vertical axis
and this is my horizontal axis.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.360
And let's say this is my x-axis.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.250
We'll label that the x-axis.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.159
I'll graph g of
x. g of x is going

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.290
to have a positive-- I guess
you would say y-intercept.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.650
or vertical axis intercept.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.358
It's going to have a
slope of negative 4,

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:40.367
so it's going to look
something like this.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.200
Let me draw my best.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.700
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.350
And we already know the slope
here is going to be negative 4.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340
We get that right from
this slope intercept

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.774
form of the equation, slope
is equal to negative 4.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.190
And they ask us,
what is the limit

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.710
as x approaches negative 1
of all of this kind of stuff?

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.110
So let's plot the
point negative 1.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.980
So when x is
negative 1, so that's

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.610
this point right over here.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.630
And this point right over here
would be the point negative 1,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.660
g of negative 1.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.620
Let me label everything else.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.710
So I could call this my y-axis.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.360
I could call this graph.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.310
This is the graph of
y is equal to g of x.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.030
So what they're
doing right over here

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.310
is they're finding the slope
between an arbitrary point x, g

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.530
of x, and this point
right over here.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.410
So let's do that.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.330
So let's take another x.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.510
So let's say this is x.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.790
This would be the x, g of x.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.290
And this expression
right over here,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.200
notice it is your change
in the vertical axis.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.940
That would be your g of x.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.940
Let me make it this way.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.240
So this would be your
change in the vertical axis.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.635
That would be g of x
minus g of negative 1.

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:02.010
And then that's over-- actually,
let me write it this way

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.420
so you can keep track of the
colors-- minus g of negative 1,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.920
all of that over your change
in the horizontal axis.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.860
Well, your change in
the horizontal axis

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.270
is this distance, which is the
same thing as this distance.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.520
Notice your change in vertical
over change in horizontal,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.670
change in vertical over
change in horizontal,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.310
reviewing the green
point as the endpoint.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.270
So it's going to be
x minus negative 1.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.240
And this is the exact
same expression.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.830
These are the exact
same expression.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.210
You can simplify them,
minus negative 1,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.640
and this becomes plus.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.480
This could become a plus 1.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.914
But these are the
exact same expression.

00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:48.330
So this is the
expression, really,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.710
for the slope between
negative 1 and g of negative 1

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.840
and an arbitrary x.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.040
Well, we already know that
no matter what x you pick,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.180
the slope between x, g of , and
this point right over here is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.310
going to be constant.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.090
It's going to be the
slope of the line.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.310
It's going to be
equal to negative 4.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.620
This thing is going to
be equal to negative 4.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.640
It's going to be
equal to negative 4.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.760
Doesn't matter how close
x gets, and weather

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.140
x comes from the right or
whether x comes from the left.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.750
So this thing, taking
the limit of this,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.400
this just gets
you to negative 4.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.580
It's really just the
slope of the line.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.670
So even if you were to take
the limit as x approaches

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.740
negative 1, as x gets
closer and closer and closer

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.400
to negative 1, well
then, these points

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.170
are just going to get closer
and closer and closer.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.067
But every time you
calculate the slope,

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:42.150
it's just going to be the
slope of the line, which

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.810
is negative 4.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.560
Now, you could also
do this algebraically.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.360
And let's try to do
it algebraically.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.760
So let's actually
just take the limit

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.410
as x approaches
negative 1 of g of x.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.640
Well, they already
told us what g of x is.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.980
It is negative 4x plus
7, minus g of negative 1.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.890
So that's minus, what
is g of negative 1?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.310
Negative 1 times
4 is positive 4.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.430
Positive 4 plus 7 is 11.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:22.210
All of that over x plus 1,
all of that over x plus 1.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.791
And that's really
x minus negative 1,

00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.290
is you want to think
of it that way.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.630
But I'll just write x
plus 1 this way here.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.870
So this is going to
be equal to the limit

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.230
as x approaches negative 1 of,
in our numerator-- let's see.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.680
7 minus 11 is negative 4.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.120
We can factor out a negative 4.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.490
It's a negative 4 times x plus
1, all of that over x plus 1.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.130
And then since we're just
trying to find the limit as x

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.350
approaches negative 1, so
we can cancel those out.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.120
And this is going to be
non-zero for any x value

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.650
other than negative 1.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.800
And so this is going to
be equal to negative 4.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.346
So either way, we
get negative 4.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.220
But if you just realize,
hey, this is a line.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.719
It's going to have
a constant slope.

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.190
This is just the slope
of between some arbitrary

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.390
point on the line and the
point negative 1, 11, really.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.000
Negative 1, 11, you say, well
that's just going to the same

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.958
as the slope of a line.

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.840
It's negative 4.
