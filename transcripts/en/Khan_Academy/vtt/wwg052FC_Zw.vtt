00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:02.781
- [Instructor] So let's
assume that this entire square

00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.904
represents a whole.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.682
And we can see that part
of it is shaded in in blue.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.499
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.160
is try to represent the
part that is shaded in blue

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.327
as a fraction,

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.391
as a decimal,

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:26.038
and as a percent.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.512
So pause the video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:34.598
Well, let's first think
about it as a fraction.

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:38.075
So, the whole is split
into one, two, three, four,

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:42.463
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10 equal sections,

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:45.564
and six of them are filled in.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:49.433
So the blue represents 6/10 of a whole,

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.168
or it represents, you
could just say, 6/10.

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:53.574
And you could also rewrite that.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.554
If you divide the numerator
and the denominator by two,

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:59.971
that's the same thing as three over five.

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:02.383
Fair enough.

00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:04.723
Now let's represent it as a decimal.

00:01:04.723 --> 00:01:05.930
What decimal would it be?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.797
Pause the video again and
see if you can do that.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:12.964
Well, 6/10, we could literally
just go to our place value.

00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:16.132
So that's the ones
place, we have a decimal.

00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:18.366
And then you have your tenths place.

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.642
And so we have 6/10,

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.677
so you could just put it right over there.

00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:26.844
We are putting a six in the
tenths place to represent 6/10.

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:31.275
Now, what about a percentage?

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:34.339
Well, percent means per 100,

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:37.922
so one way to think
about it is six over 10

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.545
is the same thing as what per 100?

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.950
That is equal to, if we
multiply the numerator

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.727
and the denominator by 10,

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.727
that's the same thing as 60 per 100.

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:53.085
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:56.536
60 per, instead of 100 you could say cent.

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:59.786
And so this would be equal to 60%.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.538
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.293
So here, once again, our entire
square represents a whole.

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.235
So see if you can represent this

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.777
as the part that's shaded
in blue as a fraction.

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:16.185
Pause the video and do that.

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:19.188
Well, you can see that
this is a 10 by 10 grid,

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.111
so there's 100 equal sections here.

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.325
100 equal sections.

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:26.996
Each of these squares represents 1/100.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.890
And how many of them are there?

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.557
Well, let's see, this
row is 10, 20, 30, 40,

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:36.655
and then one, two, three, four.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:40.155
So this is 44 over 100, 44/100.

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.954
And we could actually
represent this in other ways.

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:49.161
We could divide the numerator
and the denominator by four,

00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.859
in which case you would get 11 over 25.

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.581
That's another way to
represent this same fraction.

00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.391
Now, what about as a decimal?

00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:01.433
Well, 44/100, you could say,

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:03.441
well, you have your ones place,

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.539
and then this is the same thing.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.737
You could literally
just say this is 44/100.

00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:10.913
This is another way of
representing 44/100.

00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:15.080
It's 4/10 and 4/100 is 44/100.

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.796
And then if you were to do a percent,

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:21.382
well, this is 44 per 100, or 44/100,

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:25.549
but even here I like look
at it as 44 per 100 or 44%.

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.264
So this is going to be 44%.

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:32.231
And we're done.
