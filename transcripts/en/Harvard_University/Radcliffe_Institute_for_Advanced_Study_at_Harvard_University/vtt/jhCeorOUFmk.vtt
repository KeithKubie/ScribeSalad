00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.310
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.550
And welcome to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.210
Good morning.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.590
Can I hear back from you?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.465
Great.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.730
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.310
I'm Dean of the Institute.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.129
And I'm so pleased you've
joined us for our annual gender

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.390
conference.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.840
Here at Radcliffe, we foster
pathbreaking, interdisciplinary

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.300
inquiry into complex
issues like the one

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.580
we will deal with today.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.830
We do this by convening
and supporting

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.860
leading scholars,
practitioners, scientists,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.160
and artists from across
Harvard and around the world.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540
And we are committed to sharing
their work with broad audiences

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.650
through events like today's, and
many more throughout the year.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.170
Today, in addition
to this conference,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.260
we have an exhibition by
renowned visual artist

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.530
and a current Radcliffe
Fellow, Bouchra Khalili,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.960
on view at our
Johnson-Kulukundis Family

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.870
Gallery.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.110
Bouchra's installation titled
Foreign Office examines Algiers

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.790
between 1962 and
1972 when the city

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.480
was a hub of revolutionary
liberation movements.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.960
The exhibition will be open
through Saturday, April 21,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200
but I'm hoping that some of
you will take the opportunity

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.170
over the course of today,
perhaps during the lunch break,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.130
to go and see the exhibition.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.410
It's in Byerly Hall, which is
two buildings down on the left

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.150
after you exit Knafel.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.430
Bouchra's exhibition
and today's conference

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.490
are all part of our
programming this year

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.790
and next around the
theme of citizenship.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.430
We have one more event
planned in a few weeks

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.540
around this theme.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.730
It's an evening that is entitled
Red Sox Nation: Exploring

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.650
Sports and Citizenship.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.230
It will take place on Friday,
April 27 at 7:00 in this room.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.580
And I think it should be a
fascinating and fun discussion

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.010
with speakers from the
Red Sox, as well as WBUR.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.130
We will conclude this academic
year's public programming

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.710
with Radcliffe Day,
an annual event where

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.980
we present the Radcliffe
Medal to an individual who

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.740
has had a transformative
impact on our society.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.820
This year on Friday,
May 25, we will

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.160
honor Hillary Rodham Clinton.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.240
The day will open with a
panel discussion on the US

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.440
in the world today, moderated
by Professor Nicholas Burns

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.710
of the Harvard Kennedy School,
with foreign policy experts

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.290
David Ignatius,
Meghan O'Sullivan,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.950
Anne-Marie Slaughter,
and Michele Flournoy.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.010
Former Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.650
who herself received the
Radcliffe Medal in 2001,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.430
will then offer a personal
tribute to Clinton

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.680
in the second half
of the program.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.310
After that, Massachusetts
Attorney General Maura Healey

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.510
will engage Clinton in a
wide-ranging conversation.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.510
Now we are already at
capacity for Radcliffe Day.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.560
But I hope if you are not
included in that number

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.410
that you will join us
virtually by tuning in

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.680
to the live webcast that will be
available through our website.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.330
And we really do
hope many people will

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.100
enjoy the day with us.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.860
For more information, please
take one of our Radcliffe Day

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.580
postcards.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.590
There are some in
the back of this room

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.200
and down on the
registration desk.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.390
Now before I introduce
today's topic,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.380
I'd like to extend my gratitude
to the many people, speakers

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.730
and organizers, who've
made this day possible.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.040
We began last night with
a fabulous opening event,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.740
Show and Tell: An
Evening About Citizenship

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.750
with Documentary Filmmakers.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
And so I want to include
them in my thanks,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.650
and also mention all the
people behind the scenes whose

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.570
hard work made today possible.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.700
And that includes
Becky Wasserman,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.000
who's the Executive Director
of Academic Ventures, Jessica

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.460
Viklund, Radcliffe's
Director of Events,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.165
and their outstanding teams.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:00.790
So let's give them
a round of applause.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.927
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.000
Thanks also to
Dan Carpenter, who

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.570
chaired the faculty organizing
committee for the conference,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.240
as well as the committee
members, Professor Sarah

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.410
Bleich, Melani Cammett, Jane
Kamensky, Michele Lamont,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.970
and Mark Tushnet.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.130
Finally, I'm grateful to
the Institute's supporters,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.430
many of whom are
here with us today.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.180
Your generosity ensures that
we can continue to host events

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.570
like this one, and that we
can make them free and open

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.580
to the public.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.390
Citizenship is one of
the defining and dividing

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.230
issues of our time,
and it means far more

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.110
than formal membership
in a nation state

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.780
or the possession of a passport.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.210
Citizenship informs
participation

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.470
in the social,
economic, cultural,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.750
and political
activities of a nation,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.670
and it is a critical
component of belonging.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.290
With more than 65 million people
displaced from their homes

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.980
and with nationalism on the
rise in many parts of the world,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.130
citizenship has taken
on even greater salience

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.230
in our current moment.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.210
That said, some might ask,
but why devote a conference

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.420
to citizenship and gender?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.630
Radcliffe's thematic initiative,
exploring citizenship,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.530
is timed in part to anticipate
the centennial of National

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.590
Women's Suffrage in
2020, since we thought

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.490
it was important to embed that
milestone within the larger

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.530
context of citizenship rights.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.040
But even if at least
some American women

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.420
have enjoyed full political
franchise for almost a century,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.000
the link between
gender and rights

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.490
and the rights and
obligations of citizenship

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.510
is hardly a settled issue.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.540
Still today, gender has
an important bearing

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.900
on many aspects of citizenship
and belonging around the world.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.710
Some of the most fundamental
citizenship rights

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.460
continue to be negotiated
and redrawn along gender

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.570
lines with real
impact on real people.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.300
Many of us are aware of the
very limited political voting

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.930
rights afforded women in
countries like Saudi Arabia,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.010
but it is notable that even in a
wealthy, institutionally strong

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.830
democracy like
Switzerland, women only

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.230
gained the right to vote
in federal elections

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.430
as recently as 1971.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.060
And it wasn't until 1990 that
Switzerland's highest court

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.270
ordered the last holdout
canton to stop barring women

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.120
from voting on local issues.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.940
Beyond voting rights,
women around the world

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.420
are far more likely than men
to earn their livelihoods

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.630
in domestic work, often
as migrant laborers,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.010
and often without the benefit
of legal and social protections.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.670
Moreover, according to the
United Nations, only about half

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.230
of married women worldwide can
freely make personal decisions

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.840
about their health
care, sexual relations,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.290
and contraceptive use.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.160
Even here in the United States,
certain basic legal rights

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.050
still reflect gender inequality
and traditional gender norms.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.320
Not even a year ago,
the US Supreme Court

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.370
struck down sections of the
Immigration and Nationality Act

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.060
under which unmarried American
mothers and fathers living

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.600
abroad had to meet
different standards in order

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.100
for their children to acquire
US citizenship at birth.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.620
Under the old law,
in certain instances,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.860
a US citizen mother could
transmit citizenship

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.100
to her child, while a father
in the exact same situation

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.620
could not, and vice versa.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.970
In a nearly unanimous decision--

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.570
those are rare-- the
Supreme Court ruled

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.060
that these disparate
requirements violated

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.760
the Fifth Amendment's
Equal Protection Clause.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.670
The court urged Congress
to remedy the issue,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.280
and in the interim, the
residency requirement

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.590
that had previously
applied to fathers

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.050
would apply to all parents.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.740
Writing for the Court,
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.400
called the differentiation
between fathers and mothers

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.470
"stunningly anachronistic."

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.500
And she argued that it
reflected-- and I quote her--

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.550
"two once habitual but now
untenable assumptions."

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.530
One assumption
was that a husband

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.960
is the principal
figure in a household,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.780
in charge of wife and children.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.809
The second and related
notion was that outside

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.080
of a marriage--
and I quote her--

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.870
"an unwed mother is the
natural and sole guardian."

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.570
These stereotypes lead
to an intricate system

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.120
of gender differentiated
regulations

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.870
that played a critical role in
US citizenship and nationality

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.580
law until 2017.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.100
I will share just one more brief
illustration of the interplay

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.740
between gender and citizenship.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.440
As all of us have
experienced in our lives,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.250
we frequently need personal
identification documents,

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.830
whether for employment,
for school enrollment,

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.650
for health care, for housing.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.220
These IDs typically
indicate our gender,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.740
and herein lies the problem.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.260
For many transgender
people across this country,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.370
the process of
updating and using IDs

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.770
can be fraught with challenges.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.290
Potential difficulties
include denied

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.200
access to public
and private services

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.540
and the risk of verbal
harassment or even

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.190
physical violence.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.280
And in states with
voter ID laws,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.890
the lack of usable
identification

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.410
could deprive citizens
of their basic right

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.440
to participate in our democracy.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.830
According to research by the
National Center for Transgender

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:57.550
Equality, as of 2015,
68% of transgender people

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.390
lack even one form of ID
with their preferred name

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.740
and gender.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.100
Only 11% had their
preferred name and gender

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.650
on all of their IDs.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.070
And correcting this is not just
a simple matter of heading down

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.410
to the motor vehicle registry.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.720
In February, the American
Civil Liberties Union

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.200
filed suit, challenging
an Alabama law that

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.890
requires transgender
people to show proof

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.400
of gender-confirming surgery
before the state would

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.030
issue a driver's license
that reflects their identity.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.560
Eight other states have similar
rules, according to the ACLU.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.890
Not all transgender
people want or can

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.470
afford this type of surgery.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.340
But more broadly, the ACLU
contends that a medical

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.050
procedure cannot be a
prerequisite for acquiring

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.950
a government-issued ID.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.530
To complicate matters
further, Alabama

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.760
is one of 34 states in the
country that either requires

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.030
or requests voters to show
acceptable identification

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.530
at the polls.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.480
This creates a very real risk
that transgendered individuals

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.380
who present incongruent IDs will
be denied their voting rights.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.680
So I hope these
examples illustrate

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.280
that gender continues to
intersect with citizenship

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.740
in very tangible ways.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.260
Before us today is a totally
complex, multifaceted topic,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.500
so I am delighted that we have
such a distinguished lineup

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.520
of speakers to help deepen our
understanding of the issues

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.000
at hand, and to suggest, I hope,
some productive ways forward.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.400
So thank you all for
being here today.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.250
And I hope at the
end of the afternoon

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.750
when the conference
is over that you

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.725
will join us for a reception
next door in Fay House.

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:53.580
It is now my great pleasure
to introduce EJ Dionne, who

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.890
will moderate our first panel.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.360
EJ is a distinguished
journalist and author,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.370
a political commentator
whom you may recognize--

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.030
certainly will recognize
his voice from NPR and PBS--

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.150
and an op ed columnist
for The Washington Post.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:14.100
Here at Harvard, EJ has been
the 2017-18 Bloomberg Visiting

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.190
Professor with appointments
in the Divinity School,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.200
the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.790
and the Kennedy School.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.670
He is also a senior fellow
in governance studies

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.150
at the Brookings
Institution and a professor

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.410
at Georgetown's McCourt
School of Public Policy.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.540
I also should add that EJ is
a good friend of the Radcliffe

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.680
Institute.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.680
Please join me in welcoming
EJ and our first panel

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.380
to the stage.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.224
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:57.182 --> 00:12:57.890
- Thank you, Liz.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.050
I appreciated that comment
on voice and not face.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.620
There's an old line
that he was born

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.600
with a face made for radio.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.060
Thank you.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.970
Thank you very much.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.970
I can't tell you what an
honor it is to be here,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.220
and particularly to honor Liz
and her extraordinary work

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.720
here.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.480
That is one of the
central reasons I am here.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.760
And I think that the
nature of this panel

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.760
and this whole conversation
speaks to Liz's commitment

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.600
to gender justice in
the context of a broader

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.080
commitment to social
and political equality,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.500
and to democratic values.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.400
Liz is a democratic and
egalitarian feminist,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.530
and I think so many
of us appreciate that.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.980
I also, as a
lifelong Red Sox fan,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.480
want to salute her for
this forthcoming panel.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.020
In my lifetime, the
Red Sox are proof

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.050
that it is possible to rise
from the bottom to the top,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.710
and that's from
oppression to victory,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.190
which is the whole purpose
of the Radcliffe Institute.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.760
So thank you.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.060
Thank you very much.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.690
I've got to say, I
also love the hashtag

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.590
for this event, #radwhobelongs.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.120
You can read that
in so many ways.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.860
I am honored also to be part
of this discussion with three

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.960
brilliant thinkers.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.080
I'm just going to right off
the top introduce them briefly.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.160
There are more detailed
bios in your programs

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.040
that do them justice.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.620
I'll introduce them in the
order in which I understand

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.980
everybody is going to speak.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.680
Kari Hong.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.780
First, she is an
Assistant Professor

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.900
of Law at Boston
College Law School.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.250
Martha Jones, the Society
of Black Alumni Presidential

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.640
Professor and Professor of
History at Johns Hopkins

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.270
University.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.560
And Tali Mendelberg, John
Work Garrett Professor

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.220
of Politics and Director of
the Program on Inequality

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.580
at the Mamdouha S. Bobst--

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.960
how'd I do--

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.960
Center for Peace and Justice
at Princeton University.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.390
The topic for this
panel is rights, duties,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.840
and responsibilities.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.970
And I'm going to keep my
opening remarks very brief.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.700
I think it's
entirely appropriate

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.590
to begin a panel on citizenship
with a discussion of rights

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.540
and duties and
responsibilities, because these

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.030
are at the core of
what it means to be

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.600
a citizen in a liberal
democratic society.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.780
As citizens, we're
granted certain freedoms,

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.620
but we also face
expectations about how

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.270
we are to engage with each other
and with our political system.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.010
The first words in
the US constitution--

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.850
I love to do this.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.960
What is the first word of the
Constitution of the United

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.500
States?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.440
- We.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.940
- Yes.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.020
And we don't say we enough
anymore in this country.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.460
The first words are
"We the people."

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.505
And they convey something
very important of who

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.020
we think of ourselves.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.850
They speak of the
obligations we have

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.060
to each other and our nation.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.660
Democracy fails when
citizens don't exercise

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.000
their duties and
responsibilities, including

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.960
voting and organizing.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.630
And if I may say
so, this is a year

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.120
when I think it's
especially important

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.890
to think about our duties to
engage in those activities.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.220
I want to raise at the
start the importance

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.180
of thinking about rights,
duties, and responsibilities

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.780
through many analytical lenses.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.320
And I think the wonderful
thing about this panel

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.340
is that's exactly what
they will do today.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.620
Our focus is on
gender, but I think

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.210
we also want to keep in mind
the dynamics of citizenship

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.150
and of gendered
citizenship, and how

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.610
they are affected
by race, class,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.220
immigration status,
and a variety

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.310
of other social factors.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.119
Class is a framework that
in many prosperous parts

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.150
of our society can be
uncomfortable approaching.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.210
And yet it is clear that
socioeconomic status

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.250
and growing income
inequality are

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.470
powerful forces shaping the
contours of American society

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.700
and politics.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.750
Class dynamics often interact
with gender dynamics.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.700
The persistent gender
wage gap, for example,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.390
means that many women find
themselves more economically

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.400
vulnerable than
their male peers,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.760
and are thus barred from
fully equal participation,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.460
not only because of
lingering sexism,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.700
but also because of
the hidden and not so

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.930
hidden injuries of class.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.770
I would note the teachers
strike in Oklahoma

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.690
as an example of this.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.880
And it's worth
noting that about 75%

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.110
of the people in that
underpaid profession are women.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.150
In the conversation this
morning, our panelists

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.550
will help us think
through what you could

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.790
call an intersectional analysis
that brings in race, class,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.380
and other social determinants
to give us a fuller

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.800
understanding of what you might
call compounding privileges,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.100
and also compounding lack
of privilege that influence

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.710
political access and power.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.470
Martha Jones will speak from
a historical perspective

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.380
about race, gender, and
birthright citizenship.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.290
Kari will provide an
overview of the asylum

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.460
process and its problems and
discuss some possible reforms,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.790
focusing in particular on
the value asylum seekers

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.680
bring to our nation.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.930
And finally, Tali
Mendelberg will

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.930
present her fascinating
research about gender dynamics

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.480
in public speech and
group decision making,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.772
and its implications
for civic engagement.

00:18:55.772 --> 00:18:57.480
I just want to tell
one story, and then I

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.640
will go on to the panel.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.000
This and the last year, my
son was doing some organizing

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.210
at Connecticut.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.530
And he was doing
the door knocking.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.410
He was trying to organize
anti-Trump feeling

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.400
into political action.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.302
By the end, he was
doing door knocking.

00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:14.760
He was knocking on
doors a couple--

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.620
a weekend before the election.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.910
Knocked on a gentleman's door.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.160
Happened to be African
American, and I

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.940
think that's important to his
appreciation for the rights

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.830
of citizenship, as we'll see.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.440
At one point in the
conversation my son asks him,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.880
are you going to be
voting on Tuesday?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.860
And the man looked at my
son very seriously and said,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.530
it's our job.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.050
And in many ways,
I think this panel

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.250
is about our job as
citizens, men and women

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.630
committed to equality
and democracy.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.520
So I'm honored to
be here, honored

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.770
to introduce this discussion.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.420
After the panelists
speak, I will

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.810
ask some initial questions, and
I will open it up very quickly

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.500
to this distinguished audience.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.590
And with that, I bring on Kari.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.220
Bless you all for
being here today.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.986
Thank you so much.

00:20:06.986 --> 00:20:07.486
Thank you.

00:20:07.486 --> 00:20:12.246
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.180
- I just realized I never
tested the PowerPoint.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.270
Is it set?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.990
- Things here operate perfectly.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.770
- All right.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.660
OK.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.620
Wonderful.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.480
Well, thank you all
for inviting me here.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.770
Thank you all for being here.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.270
It's just been an incredible--

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.080
it's an incredible honor to be
with this grouping of people

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.270
and have this
conversation today.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.920
Now as an immigration professor
and as an immigration lawyer,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.670
being relevant in the past
year has been very much

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.230
a mixed blessing.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.010
After working with immigrant
clients for over 20 years,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.280
I have found that ICE raids
and the current anti-immigrant

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.780
rhetoric to be nothing
short of an extended viewing

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.730
of the scene in Star Wars
III where the Army of Clones

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:07.170
turned against the Jedi and
killed them all off one by one.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.360
I should say as a mother
of small children,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.100
my current literary
references are

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.400
limited to Star Wars
movies, and PAW Patrol.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.210
But that said, I
do run optimistic.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.900
With that hope in place, I
wish to discuss asylum law

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.830
as the means by which people
acquire new citizenship,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.260
but also contribute
to our existing

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.300
citizenship in this country.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.690
And I'll be focusing on what is
wrong with our current policies

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.690
and looking for the future,
what can make it better?

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.000
Now since Trump's
election, asylum

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.370
has been a part of his
transformation of immigration

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.090
law.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.980
In his first week
of office, everyone

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.350
knows that one of his
first executive orders

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.850
was the travel ban.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.180
But in the same week, he also
issued two other executive

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.150
orders relating to his
wider immigration crackdown.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.940
Starting in that first
week and continuing

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.950
until the very
present, Trump has

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.220
been attacking the procedural
protections asylum seekers have

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.150
and the character of
those who seek asylum.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.090
Trump has been
remarkable, and I actually

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.510
agree he is a
genius in realizing

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:17.100
that rhetoric and
optics are as if not

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.880
more powerful than the
actual policy changes.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.480
He has been effective in framing
asylum seekers and refugees

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.914
as terrorists,
burdens, and frauds.

00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:28.830
Just this past week,
Trump announced his plans

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.010
to use the military force
to stop what he called--

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.130
which is false-- an impending
invasion of asylum seekers

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.960
who are barbarians,
ready to kill and rape

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.790
Americans at will.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.770
But quietly, Attorney
General Sessions

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.020
is making dramatic
policy changes.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.790
He is making it more
difficult for those

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.940
fleeing from Central America
to qualify for asylum.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.830
And just this week, he
announced a new policy

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.050
to penalize
immigration judges who

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:57.795
do not close 700
cases each year,

00:22:57.795 --> 00:23:01.680
a policy that privileges speed
over due process and fairness.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.140
Now Trump is also using
other administrative remedies

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.370
to interfere with
substantive rights.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.630
He's seeking to expand something
called expedited removal,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.960
the authority by which one
immigration officer has

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.820
the power to deport
someone without a hearing

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.520
and without an appeal.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.580
He is using detention
to weaponize misery,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.550
to encourage people to give
up actual asylum claims

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.550
and deter others whose
lives are in danger

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.710
not to come to
the United States.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.110
The most shocking example
of weaponizing detention

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.980
is the separation of 53
children from their parents

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.620
when their parents presented
themselves at the border asking

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.820
for asylum.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.880
The ACLU has filed a lawsuit
to end this practice.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.410
The Washington Post has
called this "gratuitous malice

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.695
towards children."

00:23:47.695 --> 00:23:49.320
But the Department
of Homeland Security

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.720
defends this, saying it's
simply protecting children

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.090
from human traffickers,
a patently false claim.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.830
Now all of these practices
are worthy of alarm,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.570
and they're worthy of criticism.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.950
But I want to highlight that the
Trump administration is doing

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.840
nothing new than how prior
administrations, including

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.800
and especially the Obama
administration, has done.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.500
Even the most shocking
example of separating mothers

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.780
from their children
is only different

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.430
in degree, not in kind,
from the past 20 years.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.830
So before continuing,
I wish to start

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.880
with definitions of procedural
overview of the asylum process.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.900
Refugees are people who are
outside the United States

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.510
and ask either the United
Nations or an embassy

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.430
for protection from harm.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.820
There is an extensive
two-year vetting process

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.190
before they are admitted
into the country.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.590
When they arrive,
they are partnered

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.870
with religious or
community-based groups that

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.550
assist in their resettlement.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.970
Since 1980, over
three million refugees

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.010
have been resettled
in our country,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.120
and not a single one has
committed an act of terrorism.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.130
Asylum, by contrast,
is protection

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.920
for people who are living
in the United States.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.250
This is available to those who
are fleeing persecution, which

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.970
is legally defined as a
likelihood of harm or death

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.750
arising from political opinion,
religion, nationality, race,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.640
or particular social group.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.535
This applies to those
who arrive and have asked

00:25:20.535 --> 00:25:23.340
at the border for
protection, but also this

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.920
is available for people who
are in the United States

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.300
on student visas, on tourist
visas if conditions change.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.820
Either a coup happens
in their home country

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.530
or a personal
religious conversion

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.230
occurs so that they
are now in danger.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.570
They can then apply
for asylum, even

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.260
though when they
left their country,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.440
they were not in
danger at that time.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.990
Now it's important to remember
that the actual number

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.350
of asylum seekers and
refugees is relatively small.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.790
In 2017, 120,000
refugees were admitted

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.230
into the United States.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:00.240
37,000 asylees or asylum
seekers were admitted.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.440
Asylum seekers were
3% of all immigrants

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.710
who received any form of legal
status in the United States.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.690
Combined, refugees and asylum
seekers are 13% of all those

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.530
who receive legal status.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.500
So these are very small
numbers, so it's puzzling to me

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.860
why the systematic
campaign against them

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.330
has been occurring.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.600
So with my remaining time, I
wish to highlight two points.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.240
One, identify specific
ways that the laws

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.110
have failed and attacked asylum
seekers for the past 20 years,

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.750
and then second, identify
important reforms to pursue

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.650
both now and later once the
political power shifts away

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.840
from the Trump administration.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.310
First starting in 1995,
the Clinton administration

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.250
took away the
automatic work permit

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.190
for those who were
seeking asylum.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.970
This was justified as a
way to end asylum fraud,

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.480
but the instances of fraud
have never been substantiated.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.110
Second, President
Clinton also favored

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.590
administrative
efficiency over accuracy.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.890
He imposed a one-year
deadline by which

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.840
people had to apply for asylum.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.650
At the time, the United Nations
criticized the United States

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.810
for adopting this
rule, but we've had it

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.670
for 20 years and counting.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.680
For people then
who were otherwise

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.080
shown to face a likelihood
of harm or death

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.880
in their home country,
they are barred

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.950
from getting asylum if
they do not fill out

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.080
the right paperwork in time.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.960
Third, in 1996, there's
a law called IIRIRA,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.840
the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.610
Act, which created a rule so
that anyone who's denied asylum

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.030
in the United States, Canada,
or Mexico cannot apply

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.150
in a bordering country without
first returning to their own

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.610
country where they fear harm.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.000
Fourth, expedited removal
was created in 1996

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.830
again under President Clinton.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.910
And Obama has used this
with ruthless efficiency.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:28:00.550
From 1996 until 2016,
5.5 million people

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.420
have been ordered deported.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.080
But through expedited
removal and reinstatement,

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.040
another rapid removal
procedure, 4.2 million

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.050
have never had a hearing.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.990
They have been turned away
by one immigration officer.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.030
This means that
4.2 million people

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.660
have deported in the last
20 years without a hearing,

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.780
without a lawyer, and
without an appeal.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.740
In the past 20 years,
76% of all deportations

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.240
have been done
without a hearing,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.150
and expedited removal
accounts were half of this.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.370
Expedited removal
allows for anyone

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.870
who appears at the
border who says

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.330
they are afraid that they
technically will have a right

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.800
to apply for asylum.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.680
But if they do not claim a
fear, they are turned away.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.930
Now this is supposed to
protect asylum seekers,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.120
but in practice,
two recent reports

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.580
show that the error rate
is exceptionally high.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.150
Mistakes are made both
accidentally and intentionally,

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.060
and there is no review or
appeal to correct them.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.090
Examples of the mistakes
include a border patrol officer

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.450
denying a claim to
a Chinese Christian

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.130
because he did not go to church.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.020
The border patrol
officer did not

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.780
know that Chinese Christians are
so repressed they do not have

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.970
a formal church they can go to.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.480
Another asylum seeker was denied
because the officer did not

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.110
believe that Uzbekistan
was a real country.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.840
And the officers who conduct
these interviews in Spanish

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.450
are not required to
be fluent in Spanish.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.640
In a court hearing,
the court appointed

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.240
Spanish translator was unable
to understand the border patrol

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.080
officer when she was explaining
what she says to asylum seekers

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.220
to explain the legal
rights that they have.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.877
Now there is an
extraordinary lawyer

00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:39.460
named Stephen Manning,
who's developed

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.550
a database for volunteer
attorney corps to share files

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.400
at detention centers, which
has allowed numerous volunteer

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.040
attorneys to help represent
thousands of people.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.060
In a study of 35,000
people, these lawyers

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.450
reversed and reduced
expedited order removals

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:02.410
at rates of 97% in one detention
center and 99% at the other.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.230
This means that when
someone has a lawyer,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.780
that expedited
removal is reversed.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.750
Expedited removal then is
efficient and effective only

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.770
in turning away those who are
entitled to legal protection.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.890
Now fifth, in 2005
under President Bush,

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.610
Congress passed the Real ID Act,
which makes any inconsistency

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.220
a basis to deny asylum.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.970
This means if you're
fleeing for your life

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.770
and you use a false
name at the border

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.080
because you used a
false passport to escape

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.970
from your government,
an asylum officer

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.070
can deny your entire
request for asylum

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.650
because you lied to an officer.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.200
Congress enacted this law to
overturn the practice used

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.900
by the Ninth Circuit to
only deny consistencies

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.150
that go to, quote, "the
heart of asylum claim."

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.317
So if you lied about
fleeing your country

00:30:46.317 --> 00:30:48.400
for being a political
activist when in fact you're

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.410
not a political
activist, that is

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.840
a lie that goes to the
heart of the asylum claim.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.170
Now substantively, the
Real ID Act makes no sense.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.630
Attorney General Mukasey,
Attorney General Gonzales,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.250
and even Attorney
General Sessions

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.120
have all been caught lying
to Congress while serving

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.650
as attorney general.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.170
Now their first offense
was to ask for context

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.420
before being judged
about their lie,

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.030
and also whether there's
a legitimate reason

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.330
for the lying.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:20.170
However, asylum seekers are
not afforded that privilege.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.755
Now since the 1980s
on a given day,

00:31:24.755 --> 00:31:28.460
there were 30 immigrants
that were in detention.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:34.330
Today there are 400,000 at a
cost that begins at $2 billion

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.410
a year.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.260
In response to the optics of
the Central American refugee

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.504
crisis when women
and children were

00:31:40.504 --> 00:31:41.920
at our border in
large numbers, it

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.530
was President Obama
who used detention

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.480
to weaponize the
latest in deterrence.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.510
He said in interviews and
sent Vice President Biden

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.490
to Central America
to tell people not

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.990
to come to the United States.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.806
He chose to create
family detention centers

00:31:55.806 --> 00:31:57.430
to try and discourage
those who arrived

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.780
to give up their claims.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.180
He even went so far as
to apply for a daycare

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.520
license for these
detention centers,

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.010
putting up playground
equipment and jails,

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.230
saying that these
conditions of confinement

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.420
with no schools and
no normal childhood

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.400
serve the interests of children.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.830
Obama was the one
who adopted a policy

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.810
that children as young
as four years old

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.840
have to represent themselves
in immigration court

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.430
without a lawyer.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.980
This is a critical moment
to ask why we are doing this

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.704
and why we have been doing this.

00:32:25.704 --> 00:32:27.370
This question is
particularly important,

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.070
because by government
numbers, 88% of everyone

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.990
who presents themselves
at the border

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.260
has a legitimate
claim for asylum.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.960
So in so turning to
reforms, I believe rhetoric

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.780
is as important as policy.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.770
My first proposal for reform is
to shift the framing of asylum

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.960
from policing fraud,
which does not exist,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.080
to accommodating
reasonable fear.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.200
If 90% of asylum seekers
have a chance of winning,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.690
we should start resettling
them rather than

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.540
making it harder to give up
the relief that they are owed.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.430
We need to hire
more asylum officers

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.950
and train them so they can
more quickly decide the cases

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.050
and have a lighter
workload to do that.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.280
We need to repeal the one-year
bar to let documented fear,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.050
not filing deadlines,
determine who gets relief.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.480
And we need to return to the
heart of the asylum claim

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.810
standard to make sure that only
material inconsistencies can

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.280
deny claims.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.130
Now second, the shift
is away from containing

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.250
people in detention to
supporting community

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.180
integration.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.360
We need to end detention
for all asylum seekers.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.270
We need to end family
detention centers.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.820
And we need to end
expedited removal.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.990
If the only way we can
deport 4.2 million people

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.120
is by taking away the
protections of a hearing,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.850
a judge, and judicial
review, perhaps we

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:47.210
shouldn't be deporting
4.2 million people.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.220
If this is unrealistic,
we have to start

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.960
by providing
lawyers to all those

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.540
who are subjected to
expedited removal.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.040
And this is a process
that's already

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.260
been started in many
states and cities who

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.291
fund lawyers to represent
people who are detained.

00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.540
And also, we finally just
need to treat asylum seekers

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.784
like we do refugees.

00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:05.450
We need to greet them
with work permits.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.790
We need to provide them with
English lessons in the way

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.860
that Canada does.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.810
And we need to partner with
religious and community groups

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.239
to assist in their integration.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.270
Now third, I think the most
important power of Trump

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.909
has been how effectively
he communicates rhetoric.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.010
Policy changes are not enough.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.790
We must counter this
persistent effort and campaign

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.090
to explain the value
that asylum seekers have

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.480
and the contributions they
make to the United States.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.389
We all have fantasies, I
think, that if we were tested,

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.210
we would have chosen
the morally right path.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.090
I think we believe that if we
had lived in Hitler's Germany,

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.679
we all would have
been first in line

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.840
to hide Anne Frank
and her family.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.580
But I think watching how many
people have the actual bravery

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.850
or power to stand up to
Trump has been very humbling.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.800
Trump said he only wants
merit-based immigration.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.320
But do we really
want someone who's

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.310
been successful in North
Korea or successful in Putin's

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.180
Russia?

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.740
What have they done?

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.220
Who have they hurt
to succeed in systems

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.499
of corruption and persecution?

00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:11.540
It is important to realize
that those who show up

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.720
poor at our borders are the
ones who have the bravery

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.910
to stand up to oppression
and corruption,

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.940
and did so at the cost of
their well-being and worldly

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.020
possessions.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.000
The asylum seekers
are arriving heroes.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.980
They are the ones who should
be getting the military parade,

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.530
not detention.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.130
Now for all of us who
have immigrant members

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.430
in our family, we really do
understand the unique guardians

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.670
of American values that
asylum seekers have.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.040
As a personal
anecdote, my father

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.270
was in World War II orphan.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.780
He was adopted at age
five by my grandparents,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.190
who were US citizens.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.560
He went on and served in
the US military for 20 years

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.200
to show his gratitude
for our country.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.300
Growing up, whenever
my siblings and I

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.010
engaged in political
discussions,

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:59.600
he was the first to say, we
are lucky to live in a country

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.780
where you can disagree
with the government.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.020
He knew this.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.800
He knew this firsthand,
because his biological father

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.440
was arrested by the
Soviets and sent to Siberia

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.210
for criticizing Stalin.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.210
My father never saw his
biological father again.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.850
My biological grandfather
lost his children

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.740
and he lost his freedom.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.490
My father has explained
to me the value

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.150
of the First Amendment in a way
that a law school class never

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.520
has.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.040
His ability to
transmit the gratitude

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.050
for the freedoms our country
has is something only

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.760
those who have lived in
countries without them

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.100
can truly appreciate.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.220
The final piece then
we need to confront

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.960
Trump's policies of malice,
but also Obama and Clinton's

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.950
policies of callous
indifference,

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.840
is to continue the
public education efforts

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.450
on the invaluable
contributions that the poor

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.490
and the persecuted
provide to our country

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.080
so that there is a political
will to transform and reform

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.920
how we welcome asylum seekers
once the political power

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.625
returns.

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.125
Thank you.

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:13.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.900
- I think everyone
in this room is--

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.149
whatever they
remember about today,

00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:29.190
we're going to remember
the story of your father.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.485
Thank you so much for that.

00:37:32.485 --> 00:37:33.460
And-- yes.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.390
And now Martha Jones.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.890
Sorry.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.900
I was so transfixed
by that story

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.930
that I forgot to
introduce Martha Jones.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.430
- Thank you, EJ.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.180
Good morning.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.380
- Good morning.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.960
- I also want to thank
the Radcliffe Institute,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.100
and in particular Dan
Carpenter, for bringing us

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.530
together this morning.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.770
Our discussion about
gender and citizenship

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.900
can proceed only with
a sense of urgency.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.950
I think you've already
heard that this morning.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.610
Perhaps you, like
me, are a witness

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:10.390
to a humanitarian crisis
here in the United States.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.510
Our family, friends,
and neighbors

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.100
are being deemed
outsiders and criminals.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.780
Their detention and
for many expulsion

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.560
is a testament to how
citizenship and specifically

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.410
birthright citizenship serves
as both a haven and a scythe.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.130
The so-called accident
of birth wraps many of us

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.720
in an unassailable
cloak of belonging.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.940
That same arbiter tears apart
families, exiles soldiers,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.670
and brings about
raids in workplaces,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.400
cutting a cruel line.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.160
I'm a historian of citizenship,
drawn to this subject

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.070
by the early 19th
century struggles

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.660
of black Americans, many of
them the descendants of slaves.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.230
Their struggles for a
formal, unassailable claim

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:08.270
to place to an indelible sort
of belonging, to the soil

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.320
as well as the body
politic is my subject.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.980
I could not know when I
began this work a decade ago

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.770
that the early struggles
of African Americans

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.160
would resonate so strongly
through the circumstances

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.710
of today's black and
brown immigrants.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.860
Thus, my remarks today
turn on a critical juncture

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.870
in the long history
of citizenship

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.000
in the United States.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.795
The 14th Amendment's
constitutionalization

00:39:36.795 --> 00:39:42.970
of jus soli or birthright
citizenship in 1868

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.950
is my subject, and
this is the same period

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.850
we heard Liz Cohen
speak about last night

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.330
when she referred to the
film Birth of a Nation.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.330
And if that film offered
a parody of the Civil War

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.850
and Reconstruction
eras, I'll counter

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.370
with a history written
from the archives

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.570
rather than with lightning,
as director DW Griffith once

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.450
put it.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.060
Birthright is the
primary regime to which

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:13.980
most residents of the United
States are subject until today.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.820
Its advent marked, on the one
hand, a radical transformation

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.570
in what had been an ill-defined
regime of national belonging.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.050
At the same time, it was
an incomplete revolution

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.140
or unfinished, to borrow
Eric Foner's framing.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.100
It is a story for me
today in three parts.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.360
Race, gender, and foreignness.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.060
150 years ago, the US was at
work defining citizenship.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.840
It was an effort to fix one
of the central oversights

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.240
of the nation's founding
constitution, which

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.400
had been silent on the subject.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.180
Some argued that the framers
intended citizenship only

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.830
for white Americans.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.850
Race was a prerequisite.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.390
Black Americans, former
slaves and their descendants,

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.730
lived amidst ambiguity.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.680
In the decade before
the Civil War,

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.870
they numbered nearly
500,000 or 1.6%

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.060
of the nation's population.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.970
Most had lived in the US for
generations, building families,

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.150
schools, churches.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.120
Their labor was an
engine of prosperity,

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.950
whether on rural farmlands
or urban cityscapes.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.400
Still, free black Americans
lived under constant pressure

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.140
to leave the country.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.560
So-called black laws
limited their travel, work,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.070
and public gatherings.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.000
Colonization societies
organized to send them

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.570
to Africa, the
Caribbean, or Canada.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:47.980
In 1857, the Supreme Court ruled
in Dred Scott versus Sanford

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.080
that black people
were not citizens.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.970
These forces all aimed to
remove African Americans

00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:00.270
from the nation, whether
by coercion or force.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.890
A lack of citizenship defined
a decades-long reign of terror

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.530
that reached into daily life.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.620
If they were not citizens,
could black Americans

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.870
own homes and businesses?

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.290
Could they worship freely and
govern their own churches?

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:18.510
Could they control the
custody and education

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.770
of their children?

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.550
Could they travel to visit
family or secure jobs?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.190
Could they use the courts
to protect their wages

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.080
or their personal safety?

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.750
No authority would say
for sure where they stood.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.080
The answer came only
through a revolution.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.460
Four years of civil war and the
near dissolution of the nation

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.430
brought about an end to
slavery and the enactment

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.800
of a new constitutional regime.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.160
The adoption of the
14th Amendment in 1868

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.760
guaranteed citizenship
to those born in the US,

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.100
including former slaves.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.870
Black Americans,
of course, would

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.500
face subsequent challenges
to their civil and political

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.680
rights, but after
the 14th Amendment,

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.260
they were ensured that
never again would they

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.655
face the threat of
arbitrary wholesale removal.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.210
Gender.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.710
Along with birthright
citizenship,

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.500
gender was first introduced
into the Constitution

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.510
with a 14th Amendment
provision that

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.960
aimed to guarantee black
men the right to vote.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.960
The exclusion of women of
all races from the franchise

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.060
remained permissible.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.480
Women, at least
those born in the US,

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.560
were now clearly citizens.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.770
If this had long been assumed
in the case of white women,

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.560
for black women, this
was a new status.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.960
What bundle of rights
might attend citizenship?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.190
They were numerous, but when it
came to the elective franchise,

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:51.480
it appeared that women would
be guaranteed a lesser bundle.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.210
No community was more
troubled by this turn

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.510
than that of radical
allies, abolitionists

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.700
and women's rights advocates.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.680
Their conventions
were fraught over what

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.320
position to take on
the new constitution,

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.240
and factions emerged.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.420
One view is best evoked by
Wendell Phillips' declaration

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.050
that this hour
belongs to the Negro.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.870
This remark signaled
acquiescence

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.660
to a gendered political
order in which only men could

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.450
exercise formal authority.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.610
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
captured the essence

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.360
of the competing faction when
she decried the possibility

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.740
that white women could be made
into the political inferiors

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.000
of black men who were,
quote, "unwashed and fresh

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.410
from the slave
plantations of the South."

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.570
Differences largely
framed as those

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:47.820
between white women and
African American men cut deep.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.820
Black women might have been
at the rhetorical margins

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.520
of this debate, but
they were present.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.020
And at least one, poet and
essayist Frances Ellen Watkins

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.260
Harper, intervened
to reframe it.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.870
Her approach to the
question of rights

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.560
was as much intersectional
as it was universal.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.890
The year was 1866,
and she declared,

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:17.470
"We are all bound up together in
one great bundle of humanity."

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.840
The nation, in
Harper's view, was

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.320
embarking on a grand
and glorious revolution,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.050
and she argued that any
endeavor to transform

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.320
the standing of American
women required consideration

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.980
of society's weakest
and feeblest members,

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:38.360
alongside those individuals with
their hands across the helm.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.750
In making her case, Harper
drew upon her vantage point

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.390
as a colored woman
who, she explained,

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.240
had felt every man's
hand against her

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.730
and hers against every man.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.240
Harper cast herself as bound up
with the burdens of blackness

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.240
and the myriad injustices
that flowed from sex.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.380
But if being an African American
woman in the mid 19th century

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.270
might have engendered
self-doubt, in Harper,

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.210
it fostered confidence
and conviction.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.510
She was among an unprivileged
class of Americans,

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:15.220
yet held herself out as the
embodiment of the nation.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.510
The most vexing challenges
of freedom, of citizenship,

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.670
and the Constitution
itself, she argued,

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:29.940
should respond to her call that
"We are all bound up together."

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.870
Foreignness.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.300
If birthright guaranteed
that some were citizens,

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.100
we'd be mistaken to
think that the question

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.560
of national belonging
was settled.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.130
A nagging vestige of the
pre-Civil War legal regime

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:47.380
was the Naturalization Act of
1790, which limited eligibility

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.780
for citizenship
or naturalization

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.430
to free white persons.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.310
Black people were barred
from naturalization, even

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.590
after the 14th Amendment.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.040
Some lawmakers proposed
striking white,

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.530
the word white from the act.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.870
This met with
opposition from others

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:09.040
who feared that this change
would open the door not

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.370
to black naturalization,
but to the naturalization

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.530
of Chinese immigrants.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.740
The revision's final language
extended naturalization

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.280
to those of African
descent, but no provision

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.820
regarding Chinese
immigrants was included.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.780
And by 1882, the first of
the Chinese Exclusion Acts

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.220
closed this door tight.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.580
What of the US-born children
of Chinese immigrants,

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.430
the descendants of
permanent aliens?

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.050
Were they citizens?

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:43.430
Perhaps not.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.760
A view emerged in which it was
argued those born in the US

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.850
but exempted from domestic
law and regulation

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.620
were not citizens.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:56.540
The argument went that Chinese
immigrants' indelible loyalty

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:01.430
to the emperor of China was
passed on to their children.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:04.100
Such children were said
to be permanent aliens

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.810
like their parents.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.570
When the case of the United
States versus Wong Kim Ark

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.510
reached the Supreme
Court in 1897,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.490
it reflected the degree
to which thinking

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.330
about the 14th Amendment and
birthright remained contested.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:23.670
Not only were highly influential
legal minds prepared to opine

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.850
that the US-born children of
Chinese immigrants were not

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:33.260
citizens, low-level officials
like Custom agents--

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.890
and I'm hearing Kari's
talk in mind today--

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.740
these low-level
officials at the border

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.390
in places like San Francisco
were the critical agents

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:51.210
in denying the re-entry of
US-born Chinese descended

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.660
people into the US.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.600
Wong Kim Ark would go on
both to the US District Court

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.970
and then to the
US Supreme Court.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.110
Only then would he
be granted his claim

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.040
as a citizen of
the United States.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.080
Birthright citizenship
has a history

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.634
that extends across nearly
all of the 19th century,

00:49:17.634 --> 00:49:19.050
and there are three
takeaways from

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.870
these early American contests
that I want to leave you with.

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:27.460
First is that citizenship,
even its formal parameters,

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.280
have shifted across time.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.980
Citizenship has always
been a contested category,

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.130
a site for battles
over resources

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.430
and power, sometimes
taken up by those

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.530
who aim to expand its
parameters, but also by those--

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.070
such as those who
excluded Wong Kim Ark,

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.350
taken up by those
who would use it

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.810
as an instrument of exclusion.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.480
And it's likely to remain so.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.800
There was a question asked last
night about the rule of law,

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.950
and my answer this morning
is that the rule of law, when

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.960
it comes to
citizenship, has always

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.590
been a moving target and
a point of disagreement.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.170
And our own moment
is no exception.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:15.130
The second point is that
some 19th century Americans,

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.770
like Frances Ellen
Watkins Harper,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.890
understood keenly the limits of
citizenship for framing rights.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:23.620
She offered instead what today--

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.590
I think what we would
term human rights.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.440
When she situated herself
and other black women

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.770
as bellwethers for the nation,
she challenged the premise

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:37.270
that any constitution, even
one radically transformed,

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.930
can wholly meet our human needs.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.780
And our strategies
today will benefit

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.140
from thinking beyond the
domestic to the global

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.580
and to the human.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.920
Certainly, this history
is a cautionary tale,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.380
one that instructs us about
how the state can fail

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.980
to recognize, account for,
and incorporate communities

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.370
in our very midst.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.250
There is much to
admire in the work

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.520
of the Reconstruction-era
lawmakers, their adoption

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.990
of the 14th Amendment.

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.990
But today, their definition
of what makes an American

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:13.980
falls short of addressing
our citizenship crisis.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.650
For today's
unauthorized immigrants,

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.140
the 14th Amendment
provides no relief.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.280
The once radical promise
of birthright citizenship

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.080
is beyond their reach.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.630
Their lives tell
part of the story.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.940
The Pew Research
Center estimated

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:34.060
in 2015 that 11 million
unauthorized immigrants--

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.560
3.4% of the overall population--

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.570
lived in the US.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.510
They have built families,
homes, and businesses

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.400
across generations.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.770
Their labors drive
economic growth.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.560
They are integral to the
country in which they live.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.070
And still, they have no access
to the rights of citizens.

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:57.460
They have no unassailable
claim to place.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:02.350
2017 began with anti-immigrant
threats of mass deportation.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.500
What followed has been
more quotidian, but no less

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.700
harrowing.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.940
With no path to citizenship,
the 14th Amendment instead

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.340
becomes a generational scythe.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.110
Families of mixed
status confront

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.980
dislocation and separation
as birthright slices

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.100
through households, severing
cross-generational ties.

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.340
It is a haunted
existence that produces

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:29.500
lives subject to the arbitrary
winds of political policy.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.170
A new reign of
terror is underway.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:36.220
As it was in 1868, people living
in the United States today

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.730
face schemes that aim
to forcibly excise them

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.230
from the nation.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:44.650
The resulting crisis
exposes the Constitution's

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:47.650
unintended but tragic
limits, and calls

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.100
out for solutions as
bold and as imaginative

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.001
as the 14th Amendment once was.

00:52:54.001 --> 00:52:55.000
Thank you all very much.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.291
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.470
- Thank you so much.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.516
And now Tali Mendelberg.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:25.770
- So thank you very much, Dean
Cohen and Professor Carpenter

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.920
and EJ for inviting me here.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.900
And thank you all for
coming to this very

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:35.580
important and informative forum.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.380
This is a wonderful conference.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.900
I don't often have
the opportunity

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.530
to participate both in
scholarly discussion

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.680
and activism and the
arts all at once,

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.780
so really, a rare opportunity.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.430
Wonderful.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.830
My remarks are
based on a project

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:58.860
that I have been working on
to understand women's silence.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.450
And as we all have seen
in this Me Too moment,

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.590
it is all the more urgent
that women speak up.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:12.900
Unless women feel and
are in fact empowered

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.350
to speak their minds
and to articulate

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.920
their distinctive
perspectives, our society

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:25.130
can never achieve its
democratic aspirations.

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:29.520
So our personal inspiration
for this project--

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.420
and when I say our,
I mean my co-author,

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.400
Chris Karpowitz and myself--

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:39.080
our inspiration is
Madeleine Albright

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.770
who broke the glass ceiling
of American diplomacy

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:48.380
and national security and
wrote in her autobiography what

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.410
is essentially the
motto for our project.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.240
And she wrote as follows.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.990
"Early in my career, I
went to numerous meetings

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:00.440
where I was the
only woman present.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:04.040
I would want to contribute
to the conversation,

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:08.540
but I would think, if
I say that, everyone

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:12.000
will think it's really stupid.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.260
And then a man would say
exactly the same thing,

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:21.380
and the participants would
find it utterly brilliant."

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.070
And to this day, she
wrote, "I sometimes feel

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:29.960
a squirm of anxiety when
I interrupt a discussion

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.330
in a room with only men."

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.690
So the question for us
is, how is it that a woman

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:41.490
as tough and as talented
enough to become

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:45.600
the first female secretary
of state of the United States

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.180
find herself tongue-tied?

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.790
And not just when
she initially started

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:53.280
attending these
high-level meetings,

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.480
but afterwards too, continually.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.430
And we think that
the reason that she

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:04.070
finds this twinge of anxiety
repeatedly is the same reason

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:08.910
that Cecile Richards, a woman
also tough and talented enough

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:15.720
to lead Planned Parenthood, was
cut off 44 times when she spoke

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.250
at a congressional hearing.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:21.570
This was not a simple
case of partisan politics.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:25.140
When a political scientist
named Laura [INAUDIBLE] examined

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.340
Senate confirmation hearings
systematically over many years,

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.890
she found that
senators at the time--

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:35.510
all-male senators--
systematically

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:39.380
interrupt and challenge
the testimony of women

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.870
much more than that of men.

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:43.910
And the key is,
they did that even

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:49.010
for the women who shared
their own political ideology.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:55.000
Public speech remains an act
of highly gendered authority.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.840
Women who break the glass
ceiling with their bodies

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.860
still have to figure out
how to exercise authority

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.660
with their voices.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:08.140
It is no coincidence
that Albright had trouble

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.750
as the lone woman in the room.

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:15.620
Just about any woman who has sat
through a mostly male meeting

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.440
has had a similar experience.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.990
Even informally
open meetings where

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:24.560
access is given to
all on the surface,

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.020
women tend to hang back.

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:30.860
Frank Bryan, another political
scientist and an enthusiast

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.290
of the New England
Town Meeting, spent

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:39.440
decades lovingly cataloging more
than 1,000 of these meetings.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.500
And he found that women talked
about half as much as men.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.630
Most of the men
at these meetings

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:53.350
spoke, and most of
the women did not.

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.750
All this should deeply,
deeply disconcert

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.980
those who rejoice when
paltry numbers of women

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.160
rise to power, whether
it is in government

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.890
or in corporate boards
where there's recently

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:09.550
been much discussion about
the small numbers of women

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.850
and whether that enables
behavior such as this coming

00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:17.670
to light now with the Me Too
movement, or at the workplace.

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.920
In spite of all the progress
that one might point to,

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.000
gender role
expectations are still

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.010
deeply, deeply internalized
by women as well as men.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:32.220
To be a good man is
to exercise authority.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:36.240
To be a good woman is
to follow authority.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:40.320
When women assert authority,
particularly over men,

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.180
they cross that fundamental
gender boundary.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.540
So my co-author and
I wanted to know,

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.740
what could be done to actually
alleviate this problem?

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.830
So we carried out an experiment.

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:58.190
We recruited about
500 men and women,

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:00.170
and then we randomly
assembled them

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:03.500
into five-member
discussion groups.

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:08.060
And we charged these groups
with discussing and deciding

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:12.100
how society should
distribute income.

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.130
To ensure that they took
this task seriously,

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.440
we told the groups
that they would

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.550
experience the consequences
of their decision firsthand.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:24.730
They would perform a
task to earn money,

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:27.940
and their take-home
pay from the experiment

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.950
would then be
adjusted by the tax

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:32.410
that their group actually set.

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:35.470
And the tax would
go to support those

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:39.850
who earned the least, in the
experiment and hypothetically

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.660
in society at large.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.110
So this allowed us
to study how women

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:47.860
voice their perspectives
about poverty,

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.070
their perspectives
about income inequality,

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:55.450
and their perspectives about
the needs of women and children

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.580
who are disproportionately
affected

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:02.200
by poverty and by wealth
and income inequality.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.690
We expected that groups
that had more women

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:08.620
would be more respectful
of women's contributions

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.000
to the discussion.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.480
We thought these groups would
allow more time for women

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.620
to speak.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.750
We thought they would
allow women to raise

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.570
their distinctive perspectives.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:23.320
And we thought that women
would be interrupted negatively

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.400
far less.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.730
In short, we thought these
groups would treat women,

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:31.480
see women as
influential contributors

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.300
to the group's decision.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.800
These hypotheses will sound
familiar to those of you who

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.940
have been exposed to the
pathbreaking theory of Rosabeth

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:46.230
Moss Kanter, who found
in her pioneering work

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.710
that where women are a
small proportion of a group

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:54.180
or of an organization,
they are marginalized.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.830
They are disempowered.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.080
They are negatively stereotyped.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.280
They suffered discrimination
and even harassment by men.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280
So all of this discussion
about sexual harassment

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.300
in the workplace would come
as absolutely no surprise

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:14.070
to followers of Kanter's theory,
especially where women are not

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:19.850
a majority of the group, are not
a majority of the organization.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.000
But the theory is that
where women's numbers exceed

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.020
a critical mass, these ill
effects would all diminish.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.450
We should be seeing
less sexual harassment

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:33.050
in workplaces where women
have the power of numbers

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:36.500
to set the tone, to set
the norms of behavior,

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.690
and to receive equal respect.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.050
So critical mass theory has
been extremely influential,

01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:43.400
and for good reason.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.850
Organizations such as the
United Nations have actually

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:50.990
declared-- and I quote from a
United Nations declaration--

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:55.490
"The figure of 30% forms
the so-called critical mass

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.890
believed to be
necessary for women

01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.690
to make a visible impact
on the style and content

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.560
of political decision making."

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.080
Since then, since
this UN declaration,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.830
over 100 countries have
endorsed this goal.

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:16.060
Norway, for example, has
actually legislated quotas

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.400
on its corporate
boards, publicly traded

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.670
corporate boards.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:23.580
They have set a 40%
minimum quota, a hard quota

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.540
by law, for these
boards to meet.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.530
So this all sounds
terrific, and there's

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:32.890
only one problem with it,
which is that it doesn't work.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.258
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:38.050
At least it doesn't
work consistently,

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:43.620
and it certainly does not
work at the 30% critical mass.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.650
Norwegian quotas
have not noticeably

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.980
increased women's influence
on corporate boards,

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.320
although the
verdict is still out

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.120
since the introduction
of those quotas

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.730
coincided with the onset
of the great recession.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:02.210
But research in other countries
in a variety of situations

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:06.010
looking at various government
entities, committees, and so on

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:10.460
finds at best mixed support
for critical mass theory.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:15.770
So in our experiment, we found
that critical mass can matter,

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.080
but it depends.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.920
What is needed is a much
larger critical mass

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.950
than scholars and
organizations have assumed.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:26.460
And when you really
think about it,

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.870
this makes sense,
because 30% or even 40%

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:35.000
still leaves women in a distinct
minority of those present.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.490
Group decisions moreover
are made by majority rule,

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.660
and majority rule means not only
that the majority preference

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.000
will win, but it also means
that the majority identity

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.160
category, the majority identity
group in that situation will

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.580
set the tone, will set the
norms, and will determine,

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.980
who is it who gets respect?

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.870
Who is it who is going
to be listened to?

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:07.100
So we thought the majority
identity in the room

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.110
is going to be crucial.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:13.340
And we thought that assigning
a group to use majority rule

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.760
is going to empower women
when they are the majority

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.290
identity in the situation,
in the decision making group.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.770
And our findings, in fact,
bear out this hypothesis.

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:31.160
We are randomly instructed our
groups to use majority rule.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.580
When women comprised a super
majority of those present,

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:38.390
when they comprised 80% of
the members of the group,

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:41.150
the average woman
and the average man

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:43.430
were indistinguishable.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:47.000
They were indistinguishable
in how long they talked,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.050
whether they were later rated
by other members as influential,

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:54.380
and how often they expressed
their authentic views, which

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.390
we had assessed ahead of time.

01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.500
This was not true for
groups in which women were

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.530
a minority of those present.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.600
And we also found
that women suffered

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.050
fewer negative interruptions
from men specifically.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:13.400
Remember back to our discussion
of the congressional hearings.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.500
Those negative
interruptions really matter,

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.040
and they're correlated
with women's status.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.300
Well, in these
empowered groups where

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.060
women had 80% of
the members, they

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.510
suffered far fewer of these
negative interruptions.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:29.750
And they also talked
less about topics

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.910
that tend to be of
distinctive concern

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.340
to men, topics
about how to reduce

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.390
taxes, topics about finance.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.140
They talked a lot more
about the needs of families,

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.720
and they talked a lot more
about the needs of children.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.140
This is not a surprise
given that women are still

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.180
expected to fulfill
these nurturing roles,

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.340
and they are still expected to
be the ones primarily in charge

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:59.370
of taking care of children
and nurturing people in need.

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:02.480
So in these groups,
women advocated

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.600
for more generous distribution
to people living under poverty.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.570
Now a variety of
research has shown

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.550
that women are, in
fact, more likely

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:15.440
than men to prioritize
alleviating poverty,

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.570
prioritize taking care
of children, people who

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:22.350
are vulnerable, prioritize
giving more generous assistance

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:23.580
to the poor.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.690
And in that sense, increased
talk about those issues

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:33.300
represents an increased focus on
women's distinctive priorities.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.000
Groups with female
supermajorities

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.430
were also more
likely than groups

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:41.910
with very few women, these
Madeleine Albright groups--

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:46.080
to enact these views into
their actual set policies.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.530
They voted to set a minimum
guaranteed income for those

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:53.490
in poverty that was
half again as generous

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:59.790
as the minimum guaranteed income
set by groups with few women.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:03.600
Our groups were a very
diverse mix of men and women.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.220
They were a variety of ages.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.220
There were a variety
of social backgrounds

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.070
and a variety of
political perspectives.

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.580
We recruited groups in a very
conservative community, a very

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.460
religious community, and
in a very liberal, secular

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.570
community.

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.620
And we found that these gendered
patterns were very similar

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:27.000
across these diverse communities
and diverse individuals.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.760
Now by contrast where
women composed only 20%--

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.370
these are the Madeleine
Albright groups--

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.740
the same percentage
that's common,

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.610
not just in many meetings
but also on city councils,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:43.480
also in the US House, also
in the US Senate, women

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.210
spoke traumatically less often.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:49.090
They raised far fewer
times the concerns

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.340
that are distinctive to women.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.030
They talked far less about the
needs of women and children

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.240
in poverty.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.590
They were interrupted by
men at a far higher rate,

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:01.750
and they were less
likely at the end

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.900
to be identified by
the other members

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:08.620
as the most influential
member of the group.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.160
These same groups also set
a very low poverty line.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.100
They set a very low
minimum guaranteed income

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.700
that resembled the actual
low guaranteed minimum income

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.790
that our policies,
in fact, provide.

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:24.250
So our groups
simulate what might

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.790
happen if women's presence
on corporate boards

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:31.029
or in legislatures or
other places of power

01:08:31.029 --> 01:08:32.620
were dramatically greater.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.330
But in reality, of
course, the road

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:37.270
to female empowerment,
the female majority,

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:41.290
supermajority is going to
be very long and extremely

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:43.029
painfully slow.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:45.340
The institutions that
most need these reforms

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.279
are the ones that are
least likely to convert

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:52.120
from a supermajority of men
to a supermajority of women.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.810
So another possibility is to
replace majority rule, which

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:59.350
creates these very
negative dynamics for women

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.640
in the minority, with
unanimous or consensus rule.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.100
Of course, we have
settings that already

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.060
use consensus rule formally
like the American jury system.

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.149
But to paraphrase Oscar
Wilde, "unanimous rule

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.590
takes up too many evenings."

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:18.840
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.600
But before I go to
what actually can

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.014
be done about unanimous
rule without taking

01:09:24.014 --> 01:09:25.680
"up too many evenings,"
let me just tell

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.420
you what happened
with our groups

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:32.130
when we randomly assigned
them to use unanimous rule.

01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:36.090
We thought this would create
an inclusive and respectful

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:38.880
conversational norms
that would invite women

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.710
into the discussion
and empower them.

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:47.130
And indeed, we found that under
this unanimous rule situation,

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.229
women did not fare
quite as well as they

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:53.160
did in the supermajority
condition with majority rule,

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.760
but they did much better than
these Madeleine Albright groups

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.320
did under majority rule, right?

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.900
So forcing the group to
use a consensus process

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.690
did, in fact, considerably
close the gender gap.

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:10.440
Women received far fewer
negative interruptions.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.740
They were able to move that
minimum guaranteed income

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.310
up quite a bit.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.700
But there is a
wrinkle, and that is

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.430
that where women were a
majority of the group,

01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:23.670
unanimous rule
actually backfired.

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.680
So the irony is
that the groups most

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.730
likely to adopt a consensus
process in the real world

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:32.490
tend to be groups that
are predominantly female.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:36.180
And we found that when we
analyzed race dialogue groups

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.180
that were studied by the
scholar Kathy Cramer Walsh

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.440
in the Midwest.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.590
These groups attracted
predominantly women.

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:47.460
They had very explicit rules
that promoted a consensus

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.060
discussion process.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.510
But when we looked at how often
women spoke and what they said,

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.960
we found these same
negative patterns

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.530
that we found in our
discussion groups.

01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:03.540
So what we recommend
then is fitting the rule,

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.810
fitting the conversational
norm to the numbers

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:11.430
of women in the group, where
women make up a large majority.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:14.730
Then the desirable rule
for gender equality

01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.120
is not a consensus
process, but a majority

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.970
rule that empowers
women to actually set

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.030
the conversational
norm in the group.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.090
However, when women
are a small minority,

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.430
as they are in many of
these discussion settings--

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.100
in corporate
boards, governments,

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.520
in the workplaces--

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.670
when we have the Madeleine
Albright situation,

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:38.290
we should encourage groups
to use a consensus process.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:39.980
Well, what does that
really look like?

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.230
If we don't want to take
"up too many evenings,"

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.480
what does that really
mean in practice?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.910
Well, what we
recommend is adopting

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:48.890
the kinds of
conversational norms

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:51.830
that our unanimous
rule groups did.

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:56.150
Give each person a set,
designated amount of flow time.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:12:00.650
Allow each person to join
the conversation by default.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.320
Don't leave it up to
individuals to decide

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.590
when to merge into that
fast-going highway,

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:09.650
just like Madeleine
Albright was talking about.

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:13.290
It's a huge barrier
for women in particular

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:17.180
to try to figure out when
to join that conversation.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.480
And set a conversational
norm of equal respect.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.540
Do not allow people to
negatively interrupt.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.290
All of these gender-free
rules on the surface

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:31.040
end up having a vastly
disproportionate impact

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.280
on women in the group.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.222
So thank you very much,
and I look forward

01:12:35.222 --> 01:12:36.055
to the conversation.

01:12:36.055 --> 01:12:41.320
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:46.730
- Thank you so much.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:50.970
I realize that I may play the
Madeleine Albright role here,

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:54.020
and so I'm going to
ask all my questions

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.700
with a twinge of anxiety.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.475
[LAUGH]

01:12:56.475 --> 01:12:58.430
Thank you.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:00.590
I always like to think
of what the Fox News

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:03.080
headline on an event will be.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.970
And Kari gave it to us.

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:08.670
Trump declared genius
at Radcliffe conference.

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:09.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:14.810
So you could explain
that if you want.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.000
I have a lot of
questions, and I want

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.010
to have a chance to
go to the audience.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:20.690
- Fake news.

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:21.564
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.860
- I want to have a chance
to go to the audience.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:28.730
Maybe I could ask
all of my questions

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:31.310
as background, because
if I read that right,

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:33.245
does that mean we only
have nine minutes left?

01:13:33.245 --> 01:13:34.510
- Just for you.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:35.930
- Oh, just for me.

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:36.430
Oh, OK.

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.970
Good.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:37.470
All right.

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:39.430
Then I'll see you.

01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:42.730
You should time these
things, as you suggest.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:46.600
What I might do is package
the three questions

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.000
that I have for each of you.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.410
And then if I can, I
wanted to get to one more.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:56.890
So then I'll ask Kari, and
then Martha, and then Tali.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:58.570
That's unfair to
Kari, because she will

01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:00.020
have no time to think about it.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:00.520
They will.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.770
But you'll forgive that, I hope.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:06.035
You get to go first.

01:14:06.035 --> 01:14:07.570
Two questions.

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:11.890
One, just a factual matter which
is, did the Obama policy become

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:15.490
less aggressive over the
period of the administration?

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:19.930
Or was it-- my understanding
is there was a shift.

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:22.510
I'm just curious.

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.900
And what I also just wanted
you to talk about a bit

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:31.480
is how immigrants,
refugees, and asylum seekers

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.960
tend to get conflated in
the public discussion,

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.680
and how that can be a real
problem in talking about this.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.340
And if you could talk about
how we think about that.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:46.450
For Martha, I was so
struck by your comments

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:50.770
on the post-Civil war,
post-Reconstruction period.

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:52.660
And I guess I want to
ask both a specific

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.600
and a general
question, which is,

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.570
how we cast one
group's suffering

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.770
against another group's
suffering over and over again

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.930
in our history, and how we check
the rise of political equality

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.930
by emphasizing the claims
of one excluded group

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:12.910
over those of another
excluded group,

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:15.530
I'd just like you
to talk about that.

01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:19.010
And then more concretely,
we need a solution

01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:20.665
as bold as the 14th Amendment.

01:15:20.665 --> 01:15:22.990
Now you could go on,
I think, for a while

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.290
about what that means.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:30.160
But I would love you to
give us a taste of this.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.390
And for Tali, a small factual
question and then a larger

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:35.940
question.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.400
The small one is,
what evidence is there

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.250
that the forces
you are describing

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:46.930
about gender in a given
meeting or a given conversation

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:51.500
are also present by race or
class or immigration status?

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.800
In other words, how
much does the presence

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.650
of a group in certain
numbers affect it?

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.930
Or is it different with gender?

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:00.940
And then the larger
question-- and I'm

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.910
going to ask you this question,
because I want somebody

01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:05.970
to talk about it.

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:10.180
You also wrote a great book that
won a big APSA award, The Race

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.590
Card.

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:16.720
And your comments today about
how women's voices are often

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.440
not raised or
interrupted or not heard,

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:25.450
I can't resist asking you to
talk about the 2016 election.

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:28.840
And what does your
research tell us

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.440
about the way Hillary
Clinton was or was not

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.330
heard during that campaign?

01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:39.820
I'm sticking a rather
large question at you,

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:47.000
but I don't think you
will mind taking that on.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.321
So let's start with
Kari, Martha, and Tali.

01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:51.820
Sure.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:55.300
So in terms of the
question of, was Obama--

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:59.230
did he ever kind of abate his
aggression towards immigrants?

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:02.590
And it depends on
what your metric is.

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.520
I mean, the expedited
removal started in 1996.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.240
And at the time, it was supposed
to be just at the border

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.220
where people, if they
had just been crossing,

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.070
this used to kind of justify
turning people away who had

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.380
no ties or no right to be here.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:21.490
In 2002, Bush extended to
the border to 100 miles

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:26.920
from any border, which includes
Boston, which basically

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.160
includes 2/3 of the
country because it

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.200
is the southern border, it
is the California coast,

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.840
it is the northern
border, it is in Chicago.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.020
It's any waterway within
100 miles of that border

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.730
is where people
are now subjected

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:42.570
to these expedited
removal rules.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:46.510
In 2014, that's when Obama
had the peak of the detention

01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:50.290
and the peak of communicating
directly with people in Central

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.750
America, giving the
same message to them

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:55.264
in the radios and the
television that Trump

01:17:55.264 --> 01:17:56.680
is doing through
tweets by saying,

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.763
don't come to our country.

01:17:57.763 --> 01:17:59.980
You are not welcome here.

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.980
But Obama-- 5.5 million people
were deported in 20 years.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.410
Three million were
deported by Obama.

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:12.160
And 76% of those were
without hearings.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.220
So he persisted-- in
2015, he continued

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.070
with trying to get daycare
licenses for these family

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.270
detention centers.

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:21.610
It was a court that actually
rescinded that policy.

01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:22.900
He did not.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.600
And he went to court,
and he defended,

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.810
and he fought, and he won
in preventing children

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.610
from having rights to counsel.

01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:33.130
So that was an ongoing
policy that he continued

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.230
to pursue until the end.

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:37.010
- Thank you.

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:38.410
Martha?

01:18:38.410 --> 01:18:39.850
- Thank you.

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.350
I think another way of
putting your first question

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:48.210
would be to ask about how it
is that we came to see the body

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:50.760
politic voting and
political culture

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.270
as a zero-sum game
in a democracy.

01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:58.680
And this example from
the mid-19th century

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.990
of the debates between and
among former abolitionists

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:09.990
and women's rights advocates
is one that I think comes to us

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:16.740
and functions oftentimes more
so as a myth than as history.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.460
And so I think that's one of
my intended interventions.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.890
It's to say that when I
introduce a figure like Frances

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:28.650
Ellen Watkins Harper
in this discussion,

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:32.460
it's a reminder that the
body politic in 1868--

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:38.820
certainly in 2018-- could never
be reduced to African American

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.910
men's interests versus the
interests of white women.

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.830
That wasn't true 150 years ago.

01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:47.590
That wasn't true in 2008, and
it certainly isn't true today.

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:52.170
So I guess I'm concurring in
part with Kari's point, which

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:56.840
is, there is a power
to storytelling,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.980
to myth production.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.830
And part of my work, of
course, is to try and meet that

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.710
with some history that
disrupts that, and reminds us

01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:09.300
that the kind of thorny,
complicated textured questions

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.210
around citizenship, around
political rights that we

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.520
grapple with today
are old questions.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.500
And they were as thorny and as
troubled as they were before.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.480
On the question of
the 14th Amendment,

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.730
five years ago if we had
convened this meeting,

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.600
I would have been
much more circumspect.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.610
I might have even been
mum on the question

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:32.700
of the 14th Amendment and
its birthright provision.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:36.420
It's to say that five
years ago, law professors,

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:38.010
we were debating this question.

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:39.600
There were some
who were advocating

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.380
the repeal of the 14th Amendment
and its birthright provision,

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.200
advocating in the
alternative for a kind

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.170
of affirmative affirmation,
oath-based system

01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:51.540
for citizenship in
the United States.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.930
I was among those who was
reluctant, because in a sense,

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.510
I didn't want to let
the cat out of the bag.

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:59.130
I didn't want to
let, if you will,

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:01.830
the opposition
know that there was

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:03.690
this thing called
birthright citizenship

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:05.100
in the Constitution.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.300
And that it is--

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.820
while robust in that the
amendment of the Constitution

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.000
is a complex process, that it
is vulnerable to amendment,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.260
to rethinking.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.270
Well, today that cat is
out of the bag, I think.

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:25.110
And part of my point today is to
urge us to seize that question

01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:28.950
and not leave it to those
who would undo birthright

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:31.280
for the purposes of exclusion.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.850
Those of us who advocate
for thinking and rethinking

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:39.810
about citizenship as an
instrument of inclusion

01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:41.920
also have to think
critically about

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:47.160
birthright and strategize
about how we want to redo that.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.630
So there were those who have
advocated repeal, replacement

01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:54.630
with a kind of
affirmation system, others

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:58.200
who have proposed
folding in service

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.880
such as military service
as a door to citizenship.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.920
I had been thinking a lot about
family and the ways in which--

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.930
I'm not going to say
family values, right?

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:13.120
Because that's not the phrasing
or the connotation I intend.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.760
But the value of family, the
centrality of our expanding

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.770
and changing notions
of family is still

01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:24.150
a core that might be
drawn more closely

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:28.800
to constitutional thinking
about, who is a citizen,

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.780
and why?

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.370
- And you might create
left-right coalitions.

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:33.550
[LAUGH]

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.329
I actually want to get
to that at some point,

01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:37.620
but thank you for that comment.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:45.420
So I've thrown a big
one at you, Tali,

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.637
because I knew you had
good ideas about it.

01:22:47.637 --> 01:22:49.095
- Flattery will
get you everywhere.

01:22:49.095 --> 01:22:49.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.880
I'm happy to talk
about that as well.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.100
So let me take the
first question first.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:59.730
Do we have evidence that a
similar dynamic to what I've

01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:04.320
identified for gender also
exists for race, class,

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.150
immigration status?

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:10.080
And I would expand the question
to other types of identities

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.490
as well.

01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:15.030
And the unfortunate answer
is that we have very, very

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:17.140
little research
on this question,

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.760
and we desperately
need that research.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.470
So if there are any enterprising
scholars in the room,

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:30.870
I hope that you will put that at
the top of your priority list.

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:35.620
And it is something that I'm
thinking about how to study.

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.580
Want I would suspect,
what we do know

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:43.710
is that members of
identity groups with lower

01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:48.270
levels of authority in society
do have greater difficulty

01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:52.110
in merging into that
highway of the conversation.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.320
Just as Madeleine
Albright indicated,

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320
these marginalized
identities unfortunately

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.300
do carry not just
a social stigma,

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:05.340
but they carry a specific
deficit of authority.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.340
And that means both
it's difficult to join

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:13.140
the conversation, and that when
one does join the conversation,

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:16.770
one tends to experience
a lesser respect

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:21.960
and experiences oneself as
less valued as an individual,

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.590
experiences one's
perspective and one's

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:28.740
very selfhood as less valued.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.960
And we do have
qualitative studies

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.360
that point to that effect.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.720
We have powerful
testimonies by people

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.620
who point to that effect.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.430
I would just add just a
little bit of evidence

01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:44.730
from research that I conducted
with a former graduate

01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:47.970
student of mine,
Matt Tokeshi, who

01:24:47.970 --> 01:24:50.250
is now a professor at Williams.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:53.250
We did a systematic
study of whether

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:57.300
African American candidates for
high-level office such a Senate

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:01.620
or governor are able to talk
about race in the same way

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.020
that an identical
white candidate might

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.490
talk about race.

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:09.900
And we found that unfortunately,
the answer is far from yes.

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:12.990
A white candidate has
much more latitude

01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:17.520
to say, to talk about
racial discrimination

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.266
and to point to
racial inequalities,

01:25:22.266 --> 01:25:26.940
to point out when their
opponent in Trump style

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.900
has played the race
card against them.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.600
And by contrast, an
African American candidate

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.220
who's identical--

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:36.900
these are experiments,
so we keep

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.970
everything identical
about the candidates

01:25:38.970 --> 01:25:40.440
except for their race.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.980
An African American candidate
has far less leeway,

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.970
and often tends to incur
harmful consequences,

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:51.810
and loses electoral
support from white voters.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:54.030
So just a little bit
of evidence suggesting

01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:56.640
that we should probably
expect, unfortunately,

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.270
a similar dynamic
when it comes to race

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:02.280
and probably immigration status.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.940
Any kind of identity
that unfortunately

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:10.140
experiences a gap in authority.

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:19.180
As to 2016, I believe that
Trump represented a singularity.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:22.240
That's not to say that
there won't be imitators,

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.510
but that his instance,
his candidacy

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:30.250
represented a sharp break
with other past practices

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:31.810
of campaigning.

01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:34.810
And I think that he
benefited in that respect

01:26:34.810 --> 01:26:38.920
a great deal from being
a television reality show

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.450
personality.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:44.080
And a lot of the ways that
voters read him, the way they

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.900
interpreted him and
what he represented

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:53.230
was colored through that lens
of TV reality, reality shows.

01:26:53.230 --> 01:26:57.310
So I think that in that sense,
there's a little bit of hope

01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:02.470
there, except that his
incredible success might now

01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:05.690
be imitated by others.

01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:08.290
So in my book, The
Race Card, I pointed

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:11.470
to the importance of
conversational norms

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:13.180
of equality.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.600
And I documented how,
over the past few decades

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.140
since the 1950s,
there has been a rise

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.600
in a very important
and very consequential

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.120
norm that prohibited
people from sounding

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.830
as if they were racist.

01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.920
And that norm represented
a great deal of progress.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.170
Trump clearly violated that norm
without very much consequence,

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:36.970
almost with impunity.

01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:39.280
And so in that sense, I
think he really represented

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.290
a sharp break from the past.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.260
All of that created a
perfect storm for someone

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.110
like Hillary Clinton,
who on top of that

01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:51.210
probably experienced the adverse
consequences of lingering

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:54.790
outright sexism on
top of all of that.

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:57.525
- Thank you so much.

01:27:57.525 --> 01:27:59.275
That was a great and
comprehensive answer.

01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:01.270
I appreciate that.

01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:04.530
A lot of people are going
to go away with that.

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:05.950
It is time for questions.

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:08.490
There-- is it one mic in
the middle of the room?

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:11.350
Is that the one I see?

01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:13.629
Please feel free to come up.

01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:15.670
While people are gathering,
I'm going to give you

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:16.970
a background question.

01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:19.330
Don't answer it now, but if
you could bear it in mind.

01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:22.735
I'd be just fascinated
if you have any thoughts.

01:28:22.735 --> 01:28:24.610
Well, there's somebody
already at the mic, so

01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:25.510
why don't you start?

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:27.730
I'll get to my background
question again.

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:31.480
Please identify yourselves
when you ask a question.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.980
As a friend of
mine likes to say,

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.510
if you could have
a question mark

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:35.634
at the end of the sentence.

01:28:35.634 --> 01:28:36.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:38.110
- Yes.

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:45.520
I'm Peggy Weisenberg, a devotee
of the Radcliffe Institute.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:51.910
I for many years worked as the
lawyer for birth registration

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.090
in Massachusetts.

01:28:55.780 --> 01:29:03.010
And I wanted to follow up on EJ
Dionne's dialogue with Martha

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:11.200
about what bold ways might
you be advocating for.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.010
I don't see Jacqueline
Bhabha here.

01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:22.570
She has a joint appointment
with the law and Kennedy School,

01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:29.380
and hosted a conference
about birthright citizenship.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.080
And there I learned--

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.710
I mean, there's a concern
about statelessness,

01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:43.870
and the UN really wants to have
birth registration systems.

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:50.520
And some countries
don't use either birth--

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.460
well, they use
different methods.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:30:01.690
But one as I recall
was looking to housing,

01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:04.940
looking at housing
and residency.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.870
And so I'm wondering
from Martha,

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:15.730
given the current climate
and the controversy

01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:20.470
over the census, which is
a different way of counting

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:30.950
than birth registration,
if we should be looking to,

01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:32.240
who's a resident?

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.990
Anybody who's a resident
of Massachusetts

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:38.420
is a citizen of Massachusetts.

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:44.350
Anyone born here is
a citizen of the US.

01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:47.230
So what do you think
about residency?

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:53.620
Not just family ties,
anchor babies, whatever.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:56.710
- Well, your question goes right
to the heart of the question,

01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:58.640
doesn't it?

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.860
Which is to say perhaps
we could contrast

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:09.490
our case to myriad examples
in Europe about how European

01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:15.160
nations grapple with the
status and the inevitability

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:19.040
of refugees, be they
economic, political,

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.120
or otherwise would be a
way to think about that.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.140
Should we begin to distinguish
between residents and citizens

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.130
in ways?

01:31:27.130 --> 01:31:30.400
The question of
how Massachusetts

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.210
deems a resident and the
United States deems a resident,

01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:39.460
doesn't it feel like we're
on the cusp of that question

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:43.000
as both states and
municipalities begin

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.870
to invoke the asylum
principle for their territory?

01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:53.140
So I think partly
we are there, right?

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.820
We are asking those questions.

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:58.660
And I'm happy to hear about the
conference that you attended.

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.760
I'm happy for this
conversation, because I

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.405
think it's time for us to have
that conversation in the open

01:32:04.405 --> 01:32:07.750
and to be prepared for
the kinds of debates.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:11.050
I think if once upon
a time, you know,

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:14.920
the asylum city,
the asylum state

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.845
was an aspirational
and a symbolic gesture.

01:32:19.845 --> 01:32:22.330
Well, we're about to
see that tested, I

01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:24.880
think, in legal ways that
will take us right back

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.850
to the 19th century for me and
debates about what it meant

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:33.450
when the state of
Massachusetts regarded

01:32:33.450 --> 01:32:39.440
a former slave as a citizen
and the United States did not.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.700
So thank you for that.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.580
- Thank you.

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.680
Please.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.920
- I'm Jody Lisberger.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.920
I'm a professor of gender
and women's studies

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.406
from the University
of Rhode Island.

01:32:48.406 --> 01:32:51.180
Tali, this is a
question for you.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.080
I'm interested in the
studies that you're doing,

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.410
but I find the work so
gendered, reifying gender

01:32:57.410 --> 01:33:01.460
in terms of how you're
very strongly delineating

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.840
men and women.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.500
And I'm also thinking about
gender fluidity and the number

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:11.180
of people in our world who do
not identify strictly as male

01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:14.490
or female or men as women.

01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:18.090
You said in your comment
that norms, as a quote,

01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.880
"determine who
will get respect."

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.670
What are you doing
to change the norms?

01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:26.670
That is, you seem to put
the burden of responsibility

01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:30.480
on women, what you
call women speaking up.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.310
What about shifting
the norms so that men

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:37.150
who you identify as
men, and I think there

01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.850
are people all
across the spectrums,

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:43.810
identifying those patterns of
behavior and changing them?

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:45.750
- Could I just--

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:46.310
are you done?

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.809
I'm sorry.

01:33:46.809 --> 01:33:47.780
I don't want to--

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:50.230
what I wanted to do, I
think, just because-- so that

01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:52.079
says four minutes, 17 seconds.

01:33:52.079 --> 01:33:53.870
We maybe have a little
more time than that.

01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:56.720
Could I take two
questions at once so

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.670
that we could get
more of you in?

01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:01.040
Please.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.480
- My name is Priscilla Douglas.

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.090
I used to teach at
Radcliffe seminars.

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:07.510
My area is leadership.

01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:14.800
I'm wondering about the tone,
the mood of this country that

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.690
affects the conversation and the
policies that are being adapted

01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:23.320
around race, immigration.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.350
In my opinion, the tone and mood
around previous administrations

01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:33.370
is significantly different from
the tone, the mood, the hatred

01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:39.230
around what's happening today,
compounded by disinformation.

01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:43.810
So what do you think about
the tone and the mood

01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:45.780
and the influence on policy?

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:46.280
- Thanks.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.040
That's a great question.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.687
Who wants to start?

01:34:49.687 --> 01:34:50.770
Kari, why don't you start?

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:51.760
- Sure.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.570
On that tone, I think
that's the challenge

01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:58.720
that the left needs to take on.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.280
Martha, I loved your talk.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:05.220
But if I can push back, why
not embrace family values?

01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.000
And I say that
because if it was only

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.290
used in the context of gay
marriage to should just say--

01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.880
as a nice way to
discriminate against people,

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.480
or why not put this
as a moral aspiration

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.070
that we all should have?

01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:20.560
Because if we do start
talking about morality,

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.490
part of the morality--

01:35:21.490 --> 01:35:25.870
I completely agree with you that
immigration is a family system.

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.015
And that whether it be the
mixed families or what have you,

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:31.990
and the court are recognizing
that the rights of immigrants

01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:34.420
aren't foreigners and
strangers at the borders.

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.190
It's the rights to
citizens to have

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:38.580
these people as
part of our families

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:40.280
and part of our communities.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.940
And so I completely
agree that I think

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.540
it's time for the left to take
a very forceful moral view,

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.810
and defend it and defend it well
to explain why we need a more

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:53.950
inclusive world and why we need
more immigrants in particular

01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:56.410
to be a part of our community.

01:35:56.410 --> 01:35:56.950
- Thank you.

01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:59.850
Anyone else want to take on
any of the other questions?

01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:00.440
Yeah?

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.080
- Yeah.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.880
Thank you for that question.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.670
On gender fluidity,
I agree absolutely

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:10.980
that it's vitally important
to theorize and empirically,

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:16.790
systematically investigate the
situation faced by gender fluid

01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:18.420
people.

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:24.780
I don't agree that this study
reifies hard gender categories,

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:30.130
but rather, the attempt
is to understand how many,

01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:34.350
many people who do
identify as cisgender

01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:37.960
conduct themselves in
the halls of power.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.610
And so I would say,
this is an initial step

01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:46.500
to understand that category,
the cisgender category.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.430
And I very much hope that
this theoretical framework

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:54.270
and this methodology of
systematically counting

01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:57.960
each time someone is
interrupted, systematically

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.380
counting, how many times
does a person articulate

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:05.520
their unique perspective,
systematically measuring

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.040
all kinds of outcomes,
including the hard dollar

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.650
amounts that policy
sets, which influences

01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:13.290
people's lives in
very concrete ways,

01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:16.500
I would hope that people would
find some utility in that

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.000
as well, and expand it to
other kinds of identities.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.320
How do we change the norms?

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.750
I certainly don't intend to
be putting the burden on women

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:32.360
or any other identity category
that is already disadvantaged.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.823
To the contrary,
this is not Lean In.

01:37:34.823 --> 01:37:36.195
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:36.195 --> 01:37:39.370
This is, we need to
change the structure.

01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:40.650
We need to change the rules.

01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:43.510
We need to change institutions.

01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:45.310
But we need to do
it in a smart way,

01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:47.400
and recognize that
the numbers of women

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.320
present are going
to matter in how

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.910
the rules change gender dynamics
and narrow inequalities.

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:58.740
We need to think hard
about, is everyone present

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.090
really given free and
easy access to the floor?

01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.730
We all need to
interrogate that, and we

01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:07.800
need to do it through
changing these rules,

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.480
changing these structures.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.000
And in addition, part
of what we've identified

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.310
is that a very
destructive mechanism that

01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:18.060
makes all of this work is
men's verbal aggression

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:18.840
towards women.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.135
And so in that
sense, this is a call

01:38:21.135 --> 01:38:26.970
and an invitation to men in
general to be more self-aware.

01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:31.590
So again, this is not,
women need to change things.

01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:35.160
But rather, it is
a call for women

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.450
to realize that it is
possible to gain empowerment

01:38:39.450 --> 01:38:41.040
by changing the rules.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:41.540
- Thank you.

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:43.500
Now we are theoretically
at the end.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.970
If each of you could ask
really really, really fast--

01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:50.160
and I'll let Martha
sort of close,

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.920
because you were the one
person not in this last round.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.080
So if you can be really quick,
I want to include both of you.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:56.580
- Sure.

01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:56.900
Good morning.

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:57.990
My name is Diane Felicio.

01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:01.370
A quick follow-up
question for Tali.

01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:05.730
Women leaders leading
women leaders.

01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:08.470
I find myself in that
situation quite a bit.

01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:11.040
Especially politically
curious if your research

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.540
can speak to that at all.

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:13.405
- And--

01:39:13.405 --> 01:39:14.375
- She's got it.

01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:14.990
She's ours.

01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.610
- Oh, OK.

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:16.425
[LAUGH]

01:39:16.425 --> 01:39:17.976
Perfect.

01:39:17.976 --> 01:39:20.580
- I was going to
answer Tali's question.

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:22.046
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.740
- Tali, you want to
go quick on that?

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:28.210
I'll let Martha close, and then
I have one quick thing to say.

01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:28.710
- Yes.

01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:29.850
Thanks for that.

01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:32.130
There is emerging
evidence that having

01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:37.470
women in very visible and
concretely powerful positions

01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:40.680
does have an influence
on recruiting more

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.530
women into positions of power.

01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:48.510
If a cisgender woman
is governor of a state,

01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:52.110
recent results suggest
that she does quite a bit

01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.780
to promote the entry
of women into office.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:59.280
And we also know that
voters, cisgender women

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.070
in the electorate, are
much more likely to gain

01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:05.400
political knowledge and gain
political empowerment when

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.730
they see women in actual,
visible, concrete positions

01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:10.280
of power.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.500
- And finally, Martha.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.500
- So if I could, I'll
just come back to briefly

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.840
Priscilla Douglas'
question about tone.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.820
I appreciate it
very much, because I

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:24.860
think there's a way in
which we can come back

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:30.060
to values and morality and
this kind of discourse.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:35.810
But it is also true that Jody's
question suggested to me--

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:38.510
many of us, I'll
say, I am learning

01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:41.180
to do that with a new
kind of nuance, right?

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:47.180
Which is to say when I invoke
categories like gender,

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.920
like race, the meanings
and the nuances,

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.690
the subtleties, the textures of
those categories have shifted.

01:40:53.690 --> 01:40:57.590
And I have to be mindful of
the transgendered members

01:40:57.590 --> 01:41:00.320
of my community just
as I am aware of men

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.340
and women in my community, or
people who identify as such.

01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:08.930
I find myself using Ta-Nehisi
Coates' somewhat awkward

01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:09.710
phrasing, right?

01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:11.660
People who believe
themselves to be white.

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:14.510
People who are believed to be
white rather than white people.

01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:17.360
And this is a burden on us.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.650
I think it's an
imperative on us to speak

01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:26.975
through the sort of tone
that we would call for,

01:41:26.975 --> 01:41:30.740
to insist on the kind
of nuance as well that I

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.730
think is missing from this
particular historical moment.

01:41:34.730 --> 01:41:37.040
So thank you so much
for that question.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:37.610
- Thank you.

01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:40.910
I want to close with one
sentence and a quotation.

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:43.190
The one sentence is I'm
very grateful for what you

01:41:43.190 --> 01:41:45.170
said just a moment ago, Kari.

01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:47.600
Because for at
least three decades,

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.820
I have been obsessed
with a paradox

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.710
in our political
conversation that it's

01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:55.210
the political right that talks
a lot about family values,

01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:56.780
but feminists and
progressives who

01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:00.050
talk the most about what
it takes to make families

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:02.090
and childrearing work better.

01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:04.970
And somehow, we have to bring
those conversations together,

01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:08.510
or challenge the prevailing--
what family values is

01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:12.650
taken to mean and try to make
it mean something substantive.

01:42:12.650 --> 01:42:15.650
The quotation I can't resist
ending this panel with

01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:17.180
is from somebody
many of you know,

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.870
Rose Schneiderman, the famous
American trade unionist.

01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:24.610
And it seemed appropriate for
an opening panel on citizenship.

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:27.020
"What the woman who
labors wants is the right

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:31.550
to live, not simply exist, the
right to life as the rich woman

01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:36.050
has the right to life, and
the sun and music and art.

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:39.110
You have nothing that the
humblest worker has not

01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:40.940
a right to have also.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:45.530
The worker must have bread,
but she must have roses too.

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:47.510
Help, you women of privilege.

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:50.240
Give her the ballot
to fight with."

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240
Thank you, Martha.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.360
Thank you, Kari.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.500
And thank you, Tali.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:58.050
[APPLAUSE]
