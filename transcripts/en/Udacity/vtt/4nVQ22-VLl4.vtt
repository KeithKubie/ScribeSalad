00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.189
So in 2000 I started
a company called Glare Soft.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.917
And Glare Soft was interesting because
right around then personal computers

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:10.756
were becoming powerful enough to sort of
replace what you would go to a recording

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:12.520
studio to use as a musician.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.693
And so, a handful of us around the world
started these small tiny software

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:22.702
companies, building this pioneering
technology that actually could

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:27.969
replace some analog synthesizer in
your PC and we did that until 2006.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.151
We sold the company to a larger
audio software company and

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.884
it was an amazing experience.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.451
We grew a lot,
we sold a lot of products at one point

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.029
we were in Apple retail
which was super exciting.

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:41.623
Send my parents the to Apple store and
I wrote the software.

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.834
So yeah that was the company
that I created and

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:45.880
I'm still to this day
really proud of it.
