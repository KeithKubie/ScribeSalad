00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.986
I was interrupted in the last
video by a phone call.

00:00:03.986 --> 00:00:06.740
I was actually expecting a phone
call from someone whose

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.550
call I wanted to take, but that
ended up being one of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.730
those robocallers.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.210
So, anyway, I was
on problem 163.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.090
Let me just start it over so
that I don't interrupt your

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.090
train of thought.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.820
A fruit salad mixture consists
of apples, peaches, and grapes

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.290
in the ratio of 6:5:2.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.570
So the ratio of apples to
peaches to grapes is equal to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.470
6:5:2 by weight.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.510
If 39 pounds of the mixture is
prepared, the mixture include

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.980
how many more pounds of
apples than grapes?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760
So they essentially want us to
figure out what the apples

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.050
minus the grapes are equal to.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.250
So we have 39 pounds, so the
pounds of apples plus the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.540
peaches plus the grapes,
that equals 39 pounds.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.690
And to do a ratio problem like
this, the easiest way is to

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.850
say let's just define the number
of pounds of apples

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.910
being 6 times some number x.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.400
If the apples are 6 times
some number x,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.010
what are the peaches?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.120
We know that the ratio of the
apples to the peaches are 6:5,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.660
so the peaches are going
to have to be 5

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.150
times some number x.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.350
By the same logic, the grapes
are going to have to be 2

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.850
times some number x.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.240
And if you try out the ratio the
apples to the grapes is 6x

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.860
over 2x, which is 6:2.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.170
So it all works out.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.390
So let's use this information
to substitute back there and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.230
see what x is equal to.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.670
So we get 6x plus 5x plus
2x is equal to 39.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.580
6 plus 5 is 11 plus 2 is 13.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.860
13x is equal to 39.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.840
x is equal to 3.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.630
And so how many apples
are there?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.860
6x, there are 18 apples.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.000
We don't have to figure out the
peaches, but we can do it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.030
fast. There are 15 peaches, and
then there are 6 grapes.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.000
And if you want to know how
many more apples there are

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.620
than grapes, 18 minus 6 is equal
to 12-- actually these

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.720
are all in pounds.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.250
There are 12 pounds more
of apples than grapes.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040
And that's choice B.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.370
Problem 164.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.430
Louise has x more dollars
than Jim has.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.240
So L is equal to Jim plus x, and
together they have a total

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.060
of y dollars.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.650
So L plus J is equal to y.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.610
Which of the following
represents the number of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.410
dollars that Jim has?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.350
So they want Jim equals,
and they want it in

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.240
terms of x and y.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.700
So let's take this L and
substitute it here so that we

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.340
have an equation that this has
J's, x's, and y's in it.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.690
So if L is equal to J plus
x, we can substitute.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.830
So we get J plus x, instead of
an L, plus J is equal to y.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.630
That is that, just that.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.810
And you get 2J plus
x is equal to y.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.180
Subtract x from both sides.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.820
2J is equal to y minus x.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.720
And we get J is equal
to y minus x over 2.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.660
And that is choice A.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.430
Problem 165.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.680
Let's switch colors.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.885
During a certain season, a team
won 80% of its first 100

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:46.486
games, and 50% of
the remaining.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.910
If the team won 70% of its games
for the entire season,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.230
so they won 70% of the total,
what was the total number of

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.000
games that the team played?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.560
So how do we figure out the
total number of games that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.000
they played?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.900
It'll be 100 plus remainder.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.410
So let's think of it this way.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.260
If we wanted to figure out the
total percentage that they

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.500
won, we would want the
number that they won.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.390
So how many games
did they win?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:32.000
They won 80% of their first 100
games, so that's 80 games,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.930
plus 50% of the remainder
games.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.100
So plus 0.5 times
the remainder.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.450
That's how many games
they've won.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.220
Now, how many games
did they play?

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.680
The total number of games is
going to be 100 plus whatever

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.330
this remainder number
of games are.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.990
That's their total
number of games.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.050
And the problem tells us that
this ratio, the total

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.830
percentage-- this is of all the
games they won divided by

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.920
all the games they played--
that that is

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.720
equal to 0.7 or 70%.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.530
If we multiply both sides of
this equation by 100 plus r,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.480
we get 80 plus 0.5r is equal
to-- 0.7 times 100 is equal to

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.735
70 plus 0.7r.

00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:19.970
Now let's subtract 70
from both sides.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.570
You get 10 plus 0.5r
is equal to 0.7r.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.490
And then if we subtract 0.5r
from both sides, we get 10 is

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.490
equal to 0.2r, or r is
equal to 10 over 0.2.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.640
And 10 over 0.2, 0.2 is
the same thing as 1/5.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.000
So this is 10 times 5, so
that's equal to 50.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.710
So the remainder games were 50,
so they want to know the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.100
total number of games
the team plays.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.000
So it's going to be the
first 100 games plus

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.320
the remainder games.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.870
So 100 plus 50.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.040
They played 150 games,
which is choice D.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.730
We're on problem 166.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.260
Of 30 applicants for a job,
14 had at least 4 years of

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.960
experience.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.780
So experience greater
than 4, we have 14.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.620
I just make up notation
as we go.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.430
Of 30 applicants for a job,
14 had at least 4 years of

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.170
experience, 18 had degrees--
so we say degrees, we have

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.120
18-- and 3 had less than 4 years
of experience and did

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.370
not have a degree.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:51.490
So experience was less than
4 years' experience and no

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:59.390
degree, and that is 3 people.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.250
How many of the applicants had
at least 4 years of experience

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.500
and a degree?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.550
So let's see how we can
think about it.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.380
There's 30 applicants
for a job.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.250
So let me draw our universe.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.770
If I did all of the
applicants, let me

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.540
draw it like this.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.910
So that's the whole applicant
universe, and that's 30.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.940
And we know that 14 had more
than 4 years of experience.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.590
Let me do that in this color.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:47.810
So this attribute, I'll make it
look like that, so that's

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.535
the 14 that have experience
greater than 4 years.

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.470
And that's 14 of them.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:01.810
And then 18 have a degree.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.940
And I'm assuming that there's
some overlap between the

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.900
degrees in the 14.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.310
We don't know that for sure, but
let's say that this point

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:15.270
right here I'll draw
another circle.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.730
So let's say that circle looks
something like that.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.746
So let's call this the
degreed people.

00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:25.710
And there's 18 of them
in this whole circle.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.190
And then they say that there
were 3 people with experience

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.610
less than 4 and no degree.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.700
So they're outside of both
of these circles.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.750
So this right here is 3.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.820
Now, what are they asking?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.590
I've already forgotten that.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.190
How many of the applicants had
at least 4 years experience

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.370
and a degree?

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:52.710
So they're asking for this
intersection right here.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.190
So there's one question
we can answer.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.870
What's the sum of this
population, the population

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.535
that has more than 4 years of
experience or a degree?

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:04.340
So let me circle.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.010
What's this sum right here?

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.580
This and this.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.880
It's going to be whatever's left
after you take out the 3

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.680
people who have nothing.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.530
So that's going to
be 27 people.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.780
So 27 people have at
least 4 years of

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.880
experience or a degree.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.920
Now, how can relate that
to the 14 and 18?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.780
So what happens if we just
add the 14 and the 18?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.390
When we have the 14, we're
going to count

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.720
these people once.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.940
And if we were add that
to 18, we would count

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.180
these people twice.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.260
So if we wanted this number--
if we wanted the number of

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.210
people who are in this circle or
this circle-- what we would

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:54.050
want to do is add the 14 to the
18, but then subtract out

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.390
once the people who are
this intersection.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.380
Let's call them B.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.180
That's a B.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.680
I know you can't read it.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.280
Let's say there B people
in that intersection.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.270
You'll subtract that out once.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.120
I want that to really
make sense for you.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.530
If we want to know the total
number of people in this

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:16.110
circle and this circle combined,
when we say 18

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.180
people, that's including
some people here.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.270
And if we were add that to 14
people, where once again some

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.660
of those 14 are here again,
are these people.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.030
So when we just add 18 to 14,
we're counting this twice.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.090
So if we want to know the actual
number in the circle or

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.220
the circle, since we add 18 to
14 we count it twice, we wants

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.060
to subtract these
people out once.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.010
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.650
But anyway, now we're
ready to solve.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.710
We get 27 is equal to--
14 plus 18 is

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:47.050
equal to 32 minus B.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.640
27 from both sides, you get
