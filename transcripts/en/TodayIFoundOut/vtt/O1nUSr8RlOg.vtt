00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:11.990
A 
comedy-genius, Moranis quietly vanished from

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.350
acting in 1997, when he was last seen on screen
in the movie titled ‘Big Bully.’

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.160
He had been slowly disappearing from the public
eye after his wife’s death from breast cancer

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.210
that had spread to her liver in 1991.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.960
Why the disappearing act?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.550
He chose to leave Hollywood to be a stay-at-home
dad and raise his children.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.830
A few months ago (July of 2013), he opened
up about his unpopular choice to walk away

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.420
from fame at the peak of his career during
a rare interview on Bullseye with Jesse Thorn.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
(Definitely worth a full listen if you’re
a fan of Moranis.)

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.290
The actor says he simply wanted to recreate
the same wonderful childhood for his kids

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.290
that he experienced.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.989
In his own words:

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.440
Well, stuff happens to people everyday and
they make adjustments in their lives for all

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.560
kinds of reasons, and there was nothing unusual
about what happened or what I did.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.920
I think the reason people were intrigued about
the decisions I was making, and sometimes

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.130
seem to have almost admiration for it, had
less to do with the fact that I was doing

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.030
what I was doing and more to do with what
they thought I was walking away from- as if

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.109
what I was walking away from had far greater
value than anything else might.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.620
The decision in my case to become a stay at
home dad, which people do all the time, I

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.990
guess wouldn’t have meant much to people
if I had had a very simple kind of “make-a-living”

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.959
existence and decided, “You know what?

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:27.490
I need to spend more time at home.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.709
I’m not going to do that.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.409
I’m going to do this part time and then
work out of my house to do this and this and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.409
this.”

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.740
But because I came from celebrity and fame
and what was a peak of a career, that was

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.499
intriguing to people and to me it wasn’t
that.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.899
It wasn’t anything to do with that.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.179
It was just work and it was time to make an
adjustment…

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.880
I was trying to recreate a lot of the joy
I experienced as a kid…

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.009
[I] kind of decided to follow the adage of
“90% of the success is showing up or being

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.020
there” and I found that to be true.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.049
Just being there was the best thing I could
do.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.109
That’s what I experienced with my mother
at home all the time and so when my kids came

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.219
home there was music and there were lights
on there were great smells coming out of the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.269
kitchen and it was just always a joyous place
to be and that’s what I wanted, what I wanted

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.269
to create.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.330
I didn’t walk away from [my creativity],
I applied all my creativity to my home life,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.730
to me kids, to my family.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.599
I was the same person, I didn’t change,
I just shifted my focus.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.849
So does he miss acting?

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.629
I missed the people, and I missed the very
refreshing nature of doing something radically

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.180
different every day.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.439
Raising kids and being a stay at home parent,
especially being a single stay at home parent,

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.790
is a lot of sameness.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.659
It’s a very different kind of life than
being on a set with Aykroyd and Murray and

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.900
Steve Martin…

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.689
Will Moranis make a return to the limelight?

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.290
After all, his kids are grown now.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.810
I’m not interested in doing anything I’ve
done in the past.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.790
In terms of being on camera, I have no idea.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.489
It’s not something I’ve given any thought
to at all…

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.629
I have never had a plan, I’ve never had
any forethought of anything I’ve ever done.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.709
I just kind of looked at opportunities, said
no to most things and sometimes whatever was

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.500
left standing was the thing that I went for
and sometimes something came along that was

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:25.650
so appealing I just jumped 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.750
at it…

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:44.769
In the end, Moranis summed up his disappearance
from acting quite well:

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.930
I’m a single parent and I just found that
it was too difficult to manage raising my

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.950
kids and doing the travelling involved in
making movies.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.269
So I took a little bit of a break.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.150
And the little bit of a break turned into
a longer break, and then I found that I really

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:16.930
didn’t miss it.
