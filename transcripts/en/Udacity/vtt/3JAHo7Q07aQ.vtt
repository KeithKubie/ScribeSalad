00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:03.980
Assume this application is strongly memory bandwidth bound

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.545
whereas memory bandwidth is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.050
If we run the same application

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.601
on a different GPU with half as much memory bandwidth

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.859
and twice as many SMs,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.859
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
