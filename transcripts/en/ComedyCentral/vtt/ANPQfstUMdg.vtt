00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:02.803
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
INCONSISTENCIES.

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:06.907
YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT SAYS
THEY'RE AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:08.475
UNTIL THEY'RE FOR IT.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.911
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THAT'S
EVERYBODY, AND I ALMOST THINK,

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.248
THEN, I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT
IF THEY MADE THIS INDIVIDUAL

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.449
CASES.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.784
YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS LIBERTY
CASE IS AN INTERESTING ONE,

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:22.022
BECAUSE I REMEMBER BACK RIGHT
AFTER 9/11 THEY HAD WHAT WAS

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.491
CALLED THE GROUND ZERO MOSQUE.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.260
EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST THAT.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.828
YOU CAN'T BUILD THAT.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.697
MAYBE A QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.800
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A GAY
COUPLE GETTING MARRIED AND

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.970
SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY A CAKE
FROM A BAKER, WELL THAT'S

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.207
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, EXACT SAME
PEOPLE STANDING UP FOR ONE 

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.441
OR THE OTHER.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.343
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE INCONSISTENCIES
AND LACK OF GENUINENESS ARE WHAT

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:44.778
BOTHER REPUBLICANS --

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.080
WHY CONGRESS HAS ABOUT A 10%
APPROVAL RATING.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.315
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.919
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY
RIGHT, PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT THINGS

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.254
THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHAT THE
ISSUE IS AND NOT WITH THEIR

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.389
PERSONAL BIAS INTO IT.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.025
&gt;&gt; Jon: OR MAKE AN ARGUMENT,
YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.128
LIBERTY ARGUMENT FEELS LIKE 
THEY'RE WORKED BACKWARDS FROM 

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:10.771
WE ARE AGAINST THE COURTS
GRANTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.140
RIGHT TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY, AND
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.041
GET OUT OF THAT.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.442
MAYBE WE'LL TRY THE STATES
RIGHTS ARGUMENT.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.376
OKAY, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.045
NOW LET'S TRY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.913
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING
WE NEED TO SEPARATE OUT.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.683
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THEY TOLD ME
THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD A

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.752
MOSQUE AT 9/11, I WAS HORRIFIED
AND THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIBLE

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.755
THING, BUT AM NOT FOR A LAW TO
PREVENT THEM.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.258
IF YOU WANT TO MARCH DOWN THE
STREET AND ARE PART OF THE

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.695
K.K.K., I AM HORRIFIED BYT
THAT AND OBJECT TO IT, BUT THERE

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.698
ARE CERTAIN-- THE FIRST
AMENDMENT IS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:38.498
BE DESPICABLE.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.767
IT'S EASY TO ACCEPT -- 

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.271
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T HARDLY
EQUATE THE MOSQUE WITH THE

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.907
K.K.K. OR GAY MARRIAGE WITH THE
K.K.K. --

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.175
I HEAR THAT ARGUMENT A LOT.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:51.144
&gt;&gt; THE THING IS I THINK YOU CAN
PERSONALLY OBJECT TO THINGS THE

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.346
LAW WILL ALLOW.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.682
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO SAY
THAT WE ACCEPT EVERYONE ELSE'S

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.917
BELIEFS ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:01.688
SO FOR EXAMPLE, I'M ABSOLUTELY
FOR THE LAW ALLOWING -- NOT

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.491
PREVENTING A MOSQUE TO BE BUILT,
HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, I

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.327
I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY BAD
IDEA TO BUILD A MOSQUE AT THE 

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.595
9/11 SITE.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.597
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DO KNOW  THOUGH THAT
THERE WAS A MOSQUE THERE

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.498
ALREADY?

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.599
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.468
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M REALLY FASCINATED BY
THE IDEA OF RELIGIOUS

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.437
PERSECUTION IN THIS COUNTRY
BECAUSE THE DEPTH OF FEELING

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.705
SEEMS REAL.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.742
&gt;&gt; FREEDOM DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE
ALL HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYBODY

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:26.480
ELSE'S -- WHO THEY ARE, WHAT
THEY ARE, WHAT THE RELIGION IS.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.248
WE DON'T HAVE TO LIKE EVERYBODY.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.384
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO
BE HAPPY BAKING IT.

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:35.122
&gt;&gt; THE THING IS, WHERE I WOULD
SEPARATE IT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:38.291
PERSONAL OPINIONS, THEY'RE
AFRAID -- SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.427
IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THEIR
PERSONAL RELIGIOUS OPINIONS

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:43.764
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED EVEN
IN THEIR CHURCH. AND THERE ARE

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:46.199
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.136
OKAY, YOU GIVE A DEDUCTION TO
YOUR CHURCH, SO WHO'S MONEY

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.337
IS THAT?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.838
IS THAT NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
MONEY AND THEY CAN REGULATE THE

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.373
CHURCH BECAUSE IT'S A DEDUCTION.
71
00:02:53,373 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THIS.
