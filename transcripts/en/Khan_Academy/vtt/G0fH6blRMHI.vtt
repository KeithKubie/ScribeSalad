00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.070
Luis receives a gift card worth
$25 to an online retailer that

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.270
sells digital music and games.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.880
Each song costs $1,
and each game costs $2.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
He wants to buy at least
15 items with his card.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.920
Set up a system of inequalities
that represents this scenario

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.310
and identify the range
of possible purchases

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.650
using a graph.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's define
some variables here.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.030
So he's going to
buy music and games.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:38.910
So let's let m equal the number
of songs he buys, and let g

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.939
be equal to the number of games.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:43.480
Actually, just so
it's more intuitive

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.070
let's let s be the
number of songs.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.707
And let's let g be equal to the
number of games that he buys.

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:02.290
So they give us some
information here.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.770
They say that he wants to buy at
least 15 items with this card.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.290
So that means that
the total number

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.120
of items, the number of songs
plus the number of games,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.210
have to be at least 15.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.380
So this sentence
right here tells us

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.960
that s plus g-- that's
the total number

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.720
of items-- it has
to be at least 15.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
So it has to be greater
than or equal to 15.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.920
It can be 15 or
larger, it could be

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
16, 17 18, so on and so forth.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.720
It also tells us that he
has a gift card worth $25,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
and each song costs $1
and each game costs $2.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.620
So he can't spend
any more than $25.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.840
So how much is he going
to spend as a function

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.400
of the songs and the games?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.130
So each song costs $1.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.580
So he's going to spend
the number of dollars

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.230
times the number of songs.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.750
So if he buys 10 songs
is going to spend $10.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.430
Plus, for each game,
he is going to spend

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.580
$2, plus 2 times
the number of games.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.250
So if he buys five
songs and five games,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.550
the five songs are going to cost
$5, 5 times 1, plus 5 times 2

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.039
for the games, plus 10.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.540
So it's going to be $15.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.140
So this is how much he
spends on songs and games.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.040
I could have put a 1
out here for dollars,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.020
but this is how much he spent--
or 1 for it's $1 per song.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.870
But this is how much he spends
in dollars on songs and games.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.820
And he only has a
gift card worth $25.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.870
The total amount he
spends has to be less than

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.690
or equal to $25.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.980
He can spend exactly
$25 if he has to.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.000
He just can't spend $25.01.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.320
So we have a system
of inequalities here,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.800
and now we can
essentially graph them.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.360
And so to graph
them we just have

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.380
to pick one something to
go on the vertical axis

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.250
and the horizontal axis.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.020
And actually I'm only going to
draw the first quadrant here

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.580
since he's only going to buy
a positive number of songs

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.630
and games.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.510
So let's let the songs
on the vertical axis,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.050
and let's let the games
on the horizontal axis.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.240
And then what I like to do
is, I like to express it

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.840
in terms of-- or if I'm
putting s as the vertical axis,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.860
I like to solve for
s, so it kind of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.810
goes in the traditional
slope intercept form.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.430
So this first thing up
here, if we subtract g

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.220
from both sides of this,
we get that the songs

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.570
have to be greater than or
equal to negative g plus 15.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.446
And then this one over
here, if we subtract 2g

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:30.820
from both sides-- I'm going
to do it in that same magenta

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.520
color-- if we subtract
2g from both sides,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.490
so that we isolate
the s on the left,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:45.300
we get s is less than or
equal to negative 2g plus 25.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.770
And now we can try
to graph these,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.590
and we could just
look at points.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.430
Or we could look at the slope
intercept of the boundary line.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.014
So over here, if
he buys no games,

00:03:58.014 --> 00:04:00.430
then s is going to be-- well
just think about the boundary

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.930
line here.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.550
So the boundary line for
this constraint over here

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.380
is going to be s is equal
to negative g plus 15.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.390
So if he buys no games
he will buy 15 songs.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.780
So let's make this
5, 10, 15 songs.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.690
So the s intercept,
we could say, is 15.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.070
If he buys no games
he'll buy 15 songs,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.350
based on that constraint.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.940
Now what happens if
he buys no songs.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.720
If he buys no
songs, then you have

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.250
0 is equal to
negative g plus 15,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.680
or you could say that
g is equal to 15.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.630
So if he buys no songs then he's
going to have to buy 15 games.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.560
So it's 5, 10, and 15.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.650
So that would be a point
on the boundary line.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.900
And we're actually going to
include the boundary line,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.280
because it's greater
than or equal to.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.000
So I'll draw a solid line here.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.980
So this is our boundary
line, but it's not just

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.729
the boundary line.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.930
It's not s plus
g is equal to 15.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.620
It's s plus g has to be
greater than or equal to 15.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.520
Or s is greater than or
equal to negative g plus 15.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.320
So when you look at it this
way, you see s for any g,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.540
negative g plus 15, is
going to hit the line,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.110
or it's going to hit right at
the boundary line for the s.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.160
But it's that s
and any of the s's

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.255
that are greater, so we're
going to be above the line.

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.630
And if you just
want to make sure

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.350
you can verify that
we're above the line.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.891
You could try something that's
on the other side of the line,

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.290
maybe 0, 0.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.600
0, 0 definitely doesn't work.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.290
0 plus 0 is not greater
than or equal to 15.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.320
And if you try something
out here like 15 comma

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.700
15-- 15 plus 15 is 30, which
is greater than or equal to 15.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.280
So we feel pretty good that it's
this whole area above the line.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.890
And now let's look at
this second constraint.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.340
The boundary line is s is
equal to negative 2g plus 25.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.330
So once again, the s intercept,
or if g is equal to 0,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
s is equal to 25.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.520
So we go to 20, and then 25.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.070
If g is 0, s is 25.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.785
And then if s is 0, what is g?

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:10.720
If s is 0, we get 0 is equal
to negative 2g plus 25.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.830
We can add 2g to both sides.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.780
You get 2g is equal to 25.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.280
You can divide both sides by 2.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.610
You get g is equal
to 25/2, which

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.690
is the same thing as 12 and 1/2.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.130
So if s is 0, g is 12 and 1/2.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.250
Something like this-- 12
and 1/2 would put us-- well

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.969
it's actually going
to be-- that's 5,

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.260
so 12 and 1/2 is going to be
right in between these two

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.630
guys.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.120
It's going to be
right over there.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.430
And once again we're
including the boundary line

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.240
because it's less
than or equal to,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.700
so we'll include
the boundary line.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.590
So I'll draw a solid straight
line, just like that.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.650
That's supposed to
intersect right over there.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.260
And then you can think
about it two ways.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.720
You could just say, well, for
any g, negative 2g plus 25

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.350
will put us on
the boundary line,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.656
and we want all the s values
that are less than that.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:07.380
We are going to be
below this line.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.360
And you can verify it.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.000
Take some points that's on
either side of this magenta

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.280
line, 0, 0 should work.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.610
If you have 0 plus 0, that
is less than or equal to 25,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.590
so that works.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.260
15 comma 15 shouldn't work.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.799
15 plus 2 times 15 is 3
times 15, so that's 45,

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:26.340
and that's not less
than or equal 25.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.790
So stuff out here above the
magenta line won't work.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.040
Stuff below the
magenta line will work.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.370
Now the range of combinations
of songs and games

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.990
that will actually
work are the overlap

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.790
of these two inequalities.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.340
The way we've visually
drawn it right here,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:49.490
they only overlap right
over here, this region

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.550
that I'm shading
in here in blue.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.780
But it will include
the boundaries

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.170
because both of
those constraints

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.745
were-- included the equal.

00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.120
This is greater
than or equal to,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.369
this is less than or equal to.

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:01.150
So it will include
the boundaries.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.420
So any combination
of songs and games

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.980
that fit in this
boundary right here

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.898
will satisfy his constraints.
