00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.240
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Ok welcome
and we thank several of you

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.280 position:56%
who got here very early and on time.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.200 position:56%
So I'd like to introduce first the
participants in the program, the ???

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.500
Charter School.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.350
You want to raise your hand;
everyone knows who you are.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
Or public school in Washington
D.C. raise your hands.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.140
And how about Oak view and Fairfax
Virginia; they came the farthest.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.560
Welcome to the young reader
center at the library of Congress.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.780
Has anyone been to the
Library of Congress before?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.710
Anybody raise your hand.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.270
This is your first time, well,
we've very happy to have you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.410
and we hope you come
back again to the library

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.350
and to the young reader
center, which is where you are.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.060
We are very very excited this
morning to have a special guest

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.230
who came the farthest
from Hollywood California.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.070
Octavia Spencer is a very famous
actress in film and television,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.330
but she's also an author.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.290
And she's written a book
Randi Rodes Ninja Detective,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.240 position:56%
the case of the time capsule bandit.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.970
And she's here today to
talk to you about her book.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.680
How it came about and to see if you
have any questions about the book

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.690
and about her interest in
children and literature.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.130
So here she is, Octavia Spencer.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.930
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
That would be me.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.080
Thank you.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.680
So I like to do, I get
paid to talk as a living,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.040
so I like to do a little bit of
talking and a lot of interacting

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.350 position:56%
because you guys have come from far
and wide; some of you from very far.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.150
I'd like to talk to
you a little bit.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.040
Is that ok if I do a
little bit of talking

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.130
and then you guys can
ask me questions?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.430
What?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.730
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.030
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Ok, here's the rule.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.050
If you when you when we get to
that part of question and answer,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.340 position:56%
since I don't know your name, say
your name and then ask you question,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.400 position:56%
but if somebody does this, I want to
know hum, what are we going to do?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.500
We're going to say no.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.950 position:56%
Ok? So that they think of it, right?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.840
Because we want the person from
the back, we want you to be able

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.330
to hear what this person says and
we want them to hear what you say.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.630
Is that cool?

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.930
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.740
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Alright,
what do you want to know?

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.460
My book, I was, I know
it's hard to believe now,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.300
but I was actually
your age some time ago.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:32.450
And I really enjoy going to school
but I had a problem with reading.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.280
And my grades weren't very good,
but my teachers knew that I was,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.280
that I could handle the work
they really believed in me

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.420
and I didn't understand why
things were the way they were;

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.890
as far as studying goes.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.220
I didn't understand why had such a
hard time, so I had to study harder

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.810 position:56%
than most just to be with the class,
just to be where we were in class,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.960
just to be on the same level
as the other kids in my class.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.790
How many of you know,
have heard of dyslexia?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.840
Yes, that's I like, I don't like
to call it a learning disability,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.190
I like to call it a challenge
because disability means

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.150
that you're not able, you disabled,
you can't do and I like and turn

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.390
that around and say, well I
might it might take me longer,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.820
but I can get there.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.130
And I eventually did
because I wrote a book.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.740
Took me a long time
to write that book

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.740
and I'll you why I wrote the
type of book that I wrote.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.600
Randi Rhodes Ninja Detectives;
first of all I wanted

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.560
to me a ninja [Laughter]
believe it or not.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.220
And but you know Ninja jujitsu is
not something that they're going

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.080
to teach a little girl in Alabama.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.180
So anything karate, karate',
actually, or Taekwondo

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.110
or anything involving martial arts;
I just you know like most kids,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.840
six or seven, I just
said, its Ninja.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.140
They're all Ninja's.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.010
So I know that Ninja Jujitsu is
very different from Taekwondo,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.660
but in the world of
my characters one

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.890
of the little boys really
wants, you know, be a Ninja.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.280
And I also like mysteries and the
one thing that helped me learn

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.690
that helped me stay in
engage in my studies,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.080
believe it or not, were mysteries.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.610
And because you know, what
I found is with a mystery,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.210
you're always trying to figure
out what happened right?

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.150
You're always trying to
figure out who did what right?

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.890 position:56%
So I would read my mystery books
and that would help me in my studies

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.960
because it made me want
to ask those questions.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.210
Remember I said there
are no dumb questions,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.800
not knowing the answer
is the dumb part right.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.200
So you know, if you're
respectful about wanting

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.390 position:56%
to know it's always a good thing to
have a question in your heart right?

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.570
If you didn't know now, now you do.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.760
Ok, so I decided to write a book
about kids, who solved mysteries;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.870
who look a lot like some
of you in this room.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.650
Because it helped me.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.000
Mysteries helped me.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.990
And so if any of you guys
have a learning challenge,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.830 position:56%
not a learning disability, hopefully
this story will be engaging enough

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.600
to keep you interested.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.450
And to keep you reading, to
keep you wanting to know more.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.500
The other thing is
because I am a detective

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.110
at heart, I like to know things.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.410
I told you that.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.970
And since I like to know things, I
thought you'd like to know things.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.590
Right? Right?

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.890
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.390
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Oh, maybe not.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.820
Well see my detectives show,
teach you how to detect.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.970
Like let see they teach you how
to make the cast of a foot print,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.010
you know, you know what that is?

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.720
If you walk outside in the dirt

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.360
and you leave your foot print my
detectives actually teach you how

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.660 position:56%
to do that in the back of this book.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.460
So but you got to read the book to
get, you can't just open the back

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.300
of it and learn how to do that.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.600
And my detectives, how many
of you guys like ice cream?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.970
Ah, yeah, I thought you might.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.230
One of the characters in the
book owns an ice cream parlor.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.520
And my detectives actually
don't teach you how to do that,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.970
but there is a five minute recipe
to ice cream; how to make ice cream

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.360
in the back of this book.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.510 position:56%
It's all that stuff that I like to
do and I figured if I like to do it,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.810
they'd like to do it right?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.110
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.640
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: And like right
here I'm putting my finger on this,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.450 position:56%
can you guys see where my finger is?

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.790
Can you see my finger print?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.090
&gt;&gt; No.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.390
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: No you can't.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.600
But I teach you how to get that
off, how to lift the finger print.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.020
Ah, you didn't know that did you?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.820
Yes, but you got to read this book.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:27.460
So I'm glad you guys are taking
this home and meeting my kids.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.540
Did I just spill the beans?

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.840
I think I did.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.140
I spilled beans.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.040
Ah I spilled the beans.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.020 position:56%
But Randy, DC and Pudge are my kids.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.430
And they've been with me
for a long, long time.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.640
And I, I really love to read.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.910
It's still hard for me; still
takes me a long time to read a book

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.280
and the minute I look at a book
and see it's like that thick,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.480
I just get so depressed because I
hope it's going to be a good one.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.510
If it's not a good book
that's that thick it's like,

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.960
oh, the time I've wasted.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.860
But here's the good news.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.980
I've not read a book that that's
thick that hasn't been good.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:25.050
So if you pick up a book and it's
that thick and you're like oh,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.040
there's so many other things
that I'd rather be doing

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.100
than reading this book;
get to the end of it

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.060
and if you didn't like it, it's ok.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.050
But if you did like it
will make seeing a book

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:45.450
that thick again not
so daunting, right?

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.440
You won't look at that
book and go it's too thick.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.990
I used to do that.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.310
I still do, not going
to, not going to kid you.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.380
But I actually haven't
found one that's been bad

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.400
so they don't scare me as much.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.150
Who did that?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.820
Jacob, is that you
Jacob, my dear Jacob.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.180 position:56%
So why don't we open this up and you
guys since we have like a good hour,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.370
you can ask me questions
and I can answer them

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.650
and then we can learn a
little bit about each other.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.050
Is that ok?

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.350
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.650
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Alright, I like you guys.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.680
Ok, let's start.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.530
Yes what's your name?

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.330
Deon.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.860
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.080
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Ok, I spill the beans.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.340
I don't know if you knew, but
you probably might be, maybe,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.710
possibly, each getting a book.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.100
[Laughing] And because you all
showed up to say hey to me today.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.450
I wrote my name in this book
so you wouldn't throw it away.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.880
[ Applause ]

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.050
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Ok?

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.760
I signed them all for you so
you won't throw them away.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.660
Because if it's not signed, like
uh, I'm going to throw it away,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.620
I don't know, I don't
know about that book.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.920
Who's next with the question?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.450
Yes ma'am, you've got to,
don't be shy; you looked away

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.860
that means you're going to be shy.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.160
What's your name?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.460
&gt;&gt; Aida

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.760
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Aida,
what's your question honey?

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.060
&gt;&gt; My question is, what was
it like acting in the help?

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.620
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: What was
it like acting in the help?

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.790
How many of you even
have heard of the help?

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.090
&gt;&gt; I've seen it.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.400
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
You've seen it, well.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.220
That she says looking
directly at me.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:39.060
Well I'll tell you this Aida,
movies, that's my job acting.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.930
And sometimes the subject matter is
fun, but what those women had to do

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.350
and during that time
period in history,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.440
for women of color,
wasn't a fun time.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.780 position:56%
So no it was not fun because I had
to go places that I never had to go.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.710
That I know that my grandmother
had to go emotionally,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.330
so it wasn't a fun thing to do.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.580
But I had fun meeting new
friends and making new friends

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.480
and because we did
something special,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.940
they're all still very close to me.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:28.400
And my life has been forever
enhanced because of the help.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.110
Did I answer your question?

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.720
Ok, yes, oh, what's your name?

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.750
Who? What's your name?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.650
Steven, ok.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.640
&gt;&gt; How many books have you made?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.960
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: I just
turned in my second book Steven.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.510
So after you read this one, get
ready for the second one ok?

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:54.360
[ Applause ]

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.120
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Ok, we've
got to get someone else sweetie.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.590
Anybody else back there,
ok what's your name?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.890
&gt;&gt; Nadia

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.190
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Nadia very nice Nadia.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.490
Did you guys here that?

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.790
Nadia, alright Nadia.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.060
&gt;&gt; How many movies were you in?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.690
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Oh how many
movies, oh I don't know sweetie

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.000
because there were some we
just don't count anymore.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.340
About a hundred I guess.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.070
Well, don't be too impressed guys,
don't be too impressed because, ok,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.910
let's describe this
as a movie set right?

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:29.280
I've always had something
to say in a movie, always,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.680
but sometimes that something
to say would be like,

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.980
how many books have you written?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.220
Two, but you have to count
that as a movie that you're in.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.800
We did a lot of those types of
projects, about a hundred movies;

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.660
about a hundred TV
shows, I'm thinking.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.580
I don't really know.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.070
Yes, what's your name?

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.370
&gt;&gt; John

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.670
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: John.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.230
&gt;&gt; Have you ever been in a cartoon?

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.130
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: I
have been in a cartoon

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.780
and I'm working on one right now.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.080
Whew [Laughter].

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.380
Ah, cartoon; let's see, oh yeah,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.880
it's one that you wouldn't
have been able watch though.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.450
Wait, no yeah, the family guy,
not the family guy, family dad,

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.510
somebody like that; American Dad.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.770
[ Laughter ]

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.550
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Yeah American
Dad, but I'm actually working

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.580
on a movie right now called Boo,
and it is really, really fun;

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.160
the bureau of other
worldly operations.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.720
And it's basically FBI ghost.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.950
It's pretty fun.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.270
Yes ma'am.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.570
Name?

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.870
&gt;&gt; Isabella

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.170
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Isabella.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.470
&gt;&gt; Where are you from?

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Where am I from?

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.070
That's a very good question.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.980
Well I'm from London Isabella.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.370
No, I'm from Montgomery Alabama,
which is, oh I was about to say,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.850
I thought I was in Atlanta.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:07.300
I was just in Atlanta working so
my brain, which is right next door,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.410
it is not right next
door to where we are.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.350
I am from Montgomery Alabama.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.860
Do you know it?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.160
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.250
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: You've heard
of it, you've never been there?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.840
Ok, where are you from?

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.140
&gt;&gt; D.C.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:27.100
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: D.C., I like
D.C. Someone we haven't, yes ma'am.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.400
&gt;&gt; Lyla

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.700
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Lyla.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.740
&gt;&gt; Ok, would you let me
co-write in one of your books?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.040
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: She asked me

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.420
if I would let her
co-write in one of my books.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.210
Can I tell you what you can do?

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.670
You can write your own book.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.420
You don't need to co-write
with anybody.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.770
You can write your own book.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.770
The world is your oyster.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.380 position:56%
And right now, you put down
whatever, there's no right or wrong.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:56.820 position:56%
I tell you what though, you write it
and send it to me and I'll read it.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.120
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.580
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Is that a deal?

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.730
We'll make sure you get
Paul's email address, alright?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.790
Now don't, don't make
me check in and say

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.450
when am I going to get pages.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.640
I will stay on you now.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.170
Someone else, we've got the same
people who want to ask questions.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.250
You guys just bored of me already?

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.290
Usually takes about two hours
before people become bored.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.720
Yes honey, what's your name?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.020
&gt;&gt; Jaaki

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.880
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Jaaki, say that again?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.980
&gt;&gt; Have you written any poems?

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.450
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Have
I written any poems?

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.110
Yes I have.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:40.850
Have you? Ok, that, why
did you ask me that?

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.500
Do you like poems?

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.800
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.050
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
What's your favorite poem?

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.660
Do you know one right
now that you can say?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.400
That have really good words in it.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.170
I'm making you nervous
right now, ok.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.040
But I have written poems.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.930
You can write poems too.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.860
Ok, next to you.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.840
Oh, what was that name?

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.220
&gt;&gt; Alfonzo.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.520
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Alfonzo.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.100
&gt;&gt; Have you ever, like

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.400
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
What is Alfonzo doing?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.700
No. Ok Alfonzo.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.860
You've got to speak up.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:29.330
&gt;&gt; Have you ever learned anything
that was too easy in school?

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.630
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Have
I ever learned anything

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.540
that was too easy in school?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.200
Yeah, I have learned some
things that were too easy

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.090 position:56%
and then what happens is you sit
there and your mind starts wondering

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:48.750
because it's too easy
right, until test day;

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.060
when you should have been paying
attention because you knew it

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:59.880
at the time and then when test
day happens, you forgot the steps

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.280
to show your work and problems.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.960
Sometimes things are
going to be easier

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.060
or sometimes they're
going to be a challenge.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.960
But yeah, I have, I can say yeah.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.000
I have, have you?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.580
Yeah, I thought you were smart guy.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.430
That's a good thing thought;
that's a very good thing.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.500
Anybody else who hasn't
asked a question yet?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.800
Yes ma'am right here.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.520
&gt;&gt; My names Shamia.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.850
Which movie have you
started in a month?

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:41.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: Which movie have
I started; that hasn't happened yet.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.680
I'm about to be on
a television show.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.380
I've never done TV
full time so it's going

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.380
to be very different
and excited about it.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.430
But I don't know, that's my job.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:06.230
It seems very, very glamorous
because it's movies and television.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.390
But I'm going to let you
guys in on a little secret.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:16.730
We wake up really, really early and
we go to bed really, really late.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:24.720
You travel a lot and you
don't get to see your families

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.020
as much as you'd like to.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.610
And sometimes I have a problem
being on stage and seeing people,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.910
and when I found out
that we were going

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.160
to be taping this I got
real nervous, oh gosh.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.720
So, but it's my job and oop,
what's going on over here?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.310
What's going, when I'm
talking you listen, right?

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.200
We don't do that, ok?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.990
So that's just what I do.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:57.160
It may seem like it's
really, really glamorous

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.730 position:56%
because you guys see the parts where
we're, you know, in pretty dresses

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.800
and people taking pictures
in magazines.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.740
That part is really
the least fun for me.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.130
The, you know, pictures in
the magazines and all of that.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.760
That's not the fun part.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.140
But I really love what I do,
but you should also know the

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.360
down side of it, too, you know.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.580
It's like, that's that, is
that ok, I mean you know.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.220
You guys want to know
the truth right?

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.520
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.820
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
Good, good I like that.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.120
Yes Sir.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.160
&gt;&gt; Deon, which part do
you play in American Dad?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.250
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: I
don't know, it was a nurse

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.920
or somebody in American Dad.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.450
Now what do you, I
don't think that show,

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.550
I don't think you guys can
be watching American Dad.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.850
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer: That's not a,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.960
that's not a good show
for I don't think.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.190
Or maybe I'm thinking
of the wrong thing.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:01.430
This boo movie is a perfect
movie for you to watch.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:08.070
Anybody else, I'm going to
come back to you sweetie,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:19.230
I want to give people who
haven't had a chance, yes ma'am.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.870
&gt;&gt; Lauren,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.170
&gt;&gt; Octavia Spencer:
What's your name hun?

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.470
Ah!

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.080

You wouldn't believe it now but and
certain situations I'm very shy.

not be shy; strangely enough

Ok, it took me seven years.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:13.120
Because guys you have to write and
you have to rewrite and you have

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.990
to keep changing things because
the story changes and you want

to make it better and
better and better.

with this movie stuff.

The longest, a, well, that's
a, that's a tough question.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:35.330
See, we took I did an action
movie in Prague which I was there

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:43.630 position:56%
for five months in Prague and I, we,

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.560
but the Help I filmed
it in four months.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:55.900
So I worked in Prague
longer than I did the Help,

but I have a bigger part in the Help
than I did in the one in Prague.

a lot of research that you have

to do to figure out like let's say,
I was going to play you in a move,

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:22.920
I would have to figure out how you
start your day; why you say a line

that you would say it; why
you like your hair braided.

everything about the character

them and so for me I like learning.
