00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.600
In this lesson, we'll learn how to split the data.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.560
First, we have the training data, this is the data that we use to train a model.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.280
Secondly, we have validation data, this data is used to select a model.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.710
Third, we have the test data,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.830
this is the data we use to report the performance of a model.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.110
Now, training is error is used to tune the performance of

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.990
the model on the training set.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.880
A validation error is used to select the model that works best among

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.630
many models.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.260
We then use the test error to calculate the performance of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.010
the model that we have already selected.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.280
In the next few videos, we will introduce each of these errors and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.300
how we use them to make the decision to eventually use a specific model to solve

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.710
our problem, and to identify cars in the connected cars data set.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.660
There are no general rules how best one should split the data for

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.910
each of the three purposes.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.030
Depending on the size or the volume of the data set, one would decide to split

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.620
in proportion of 50 for training, 25 to validate and 25 to test.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.340
Often, one might need more for training or validation.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.720
There are also constraints from the model itself and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.000
the complexity at which we build the model.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.830
We will talk about model complexity shortly.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.380
It is important to note that the test data needs to be

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.870
set aside until a particular validated model has been selected.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.110
This gives us an unbiased estimate of the performance of the model.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.600
More specifically, when we are building the model,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.560
we do not examine the test data at all.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.785
This is to avoid biasing our results on the test set.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.670
This is an essential part of the validation process.
