00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.140
Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.545
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:04.574
We just had a baby, which is awesome.

00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:07.179
I mean, every single child we've brought into our house

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.802
has taught us a tremendous amount.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.342
And you would think that you kind of learned the ropes

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:12.039
and you're just like pro at it over time,

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.549
but it doesn't really work that way.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.569
You learn on a deeper level with each individual child.

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:18.840
So today on Smarter Every Day

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.990
you might know that I'm a dude that just really loves my family,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.858
a lot.

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:25.352
And I just really want to be the best dad I can be.

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:29.090
Today I want to talk about the things that I've learned through the experience

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.758
and the process of us having a baby.

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:33.028
It's really interesting.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:35.597
For example, we have learned over the years

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:37.466
that the absolute best thing for us,

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.363
when we're pregnant,

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.506
is to go on a trip together during the second trimester.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.473
The reason is she's over morning sickness from the first trimester

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:47.615
and she's not like gigantic pregnant in the third trimester yet,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.985
so we were super thrilled this year when I got invited to speak at TEDx in Vienna Austria

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.155
because that gave us an opportunity to get away

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.123
and just for two days connect as a couple.

00:00:58.123 --> 00:00:59.087
We're at the..

00:00:59.087 --> 00:01:00.030
- Hofburg.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.816
- What does that mean? ... I don't know either.

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:03.819
Anyway we're in Austria.

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.772
At some point you'll notice that your wife's body is growing

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:08.620
and it's very interesting.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.197
Being an engineer, I took this opportunity to take her weight

00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:14.135
and plot it on a graph, so I could determine what the..

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:15.574
[beep]

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:18.940
I am more attracted to my wife when she's pregnant.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.574
It's like a protect her kind of thing.

00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:22.272
I don't get it, but it's true.

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:24.084
And at some point along the way,

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:28.074
you think to yourself, man she is so attractive we should hire a photographer

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:29.792
and get a pregnancy photo made.

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:31.493
And it seems like a really good idea.

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:32.996
But it's not.

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:34.161
It's not a good idea.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.928
I don't know why, but pregnancy photos end up being really really awkward.

00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:39.756
If you do want to do artistic type photos,

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:42.063
what we recommend is light painting.

00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:44.627
It's really cool. We have a friend named Wes Whaley that light paints

00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.870
and what we do is we go down to a really dark warehouse,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.706
you open the shutter on your camera and then you can add light to the picture

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.009
almost like you're adding tint to a canvas.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.235
It's really cool.

00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:57.116
You can combine colors, you can even take multiple exposures.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.047
You can backlight multiple silhouettes from different angles.

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:01.839
It's very artistic and the end product,

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:07.114
you have the silhouette which is that thing that you find beautiful about the pregnant female form.

00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:09.344
So the hospital experience itself is incredible.

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:11.353
There's so much on the line,

00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:15.906
you are just.. you cannot prepare emotionally for the hospital experience, it's amazing.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.579
So a lot of people think of having a baby as what it means to become a parent,

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.800
but that's not it at all.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.772
Parenting is a much bigger issue.

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:25.174
But, this is an interesting part of it, right?

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:27.708
- This is interesting, yes.

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:28.476
- It is interesting.

00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:33.383
So my wife actually was in the medical field, so she knows what all these things mean.

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:37.890
I don't really. I know that these are contractions down here,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.893
this is her body pushing the baby out.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.290
This is the baby's heart rate.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.280
- Destin Sandlin.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.975
- What?

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:46.154
So explain what happens when your water breaks.

00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:47.088
- It hurts.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:50.036
- A really big deal is picking the doctor.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.765
If you get a doctor that you trust,

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:53.966
it can make all the difference in the world.

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:57.516
This is Dr Callison, and she has delivered all four of my babies.

00:02:58.506 --> 00:02:59.606
- Congratulations.

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:00.572
- Thank you very much.

00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:02.702
- The smartest, sweetest babies in the world. [laughs]

00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:04.816
- She's a great doctor.

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:08.116
When you first see your baby you have this uncontrollable urge to learn

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:09.614
everything about how their bodies work.

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:14.024
This time I learned that there is a vitamin K shot that the nurses give them to promote blood clotting

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.792
because they don't have a lot in their bodies at that point.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.363
I also learned that the umbilical cord has three vessels in it.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:19.494
I had no idea.

00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:22.065
I thought it had just an artery and a return vein.

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:24.790
But it doesn't. It has two arteries supplying blood flow to the baby,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.609
and one return to the placenta.

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.275
Childbirth changes hearts on many levels.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:33.118
It changes your heart, because you just.. you look at the world differently.

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:34.471
You're not living for yourself any more,

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.720
you're living for this child.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.080
But it also changes the heart of the child.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.916
When the baby comes out and it takes a breath,

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:41.819
what happens is amazing.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.143
There's a hole in the heart, right in the middle,

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:45.524
called the foramen ovale.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.955
And that breath changes the pressure in the heart

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:50.059
and slaps that hole shut.

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.889
That re-routes the plumbing of the entire heart,

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.044
changing the entire blood flow of the baby.

00:03:55.044 --> 00:03:56.728
The baby's heart changes in an instant.

00:03:56.728 --> 00:03:59.069
There's also something called the ductus arteriosus

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.143
that changes more slowly over time.

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:05.225
But what was amazing this time is even though I had learned this back in episode 42

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.141
with my last child, this time I knew it going in

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.707
and I got to hear it with my own ears.

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:13.110
- Theres, the circulation in their heart changes,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.022
and so when the ductus starts closing you'll hear a murmur.

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:20.525
- This moment was poetic.

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:25.390
My daughter, that I was meeting, was actually changing my heart in that moment,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.242
and at the same time I was listening to her heart physically change.

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:31.336
Our hearts were changing together.

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:33.436
It's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing.

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:38.179
Another really cool thing was to watch my children interact with their new sister for the first time.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:40.409
You could see in their eyes they went from, you know,

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.378
just a brother and a sister and a little brother,

00:04:42.378 --> 00:04:44.712
to all of a sudden they're all.. big, right?

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:46.914
You got big brothers now, and a big sister.

00:04:46.914 --> 00:04:49.421
And they understand the responsibility.

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.814
It's an amazing thing.

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:52.858
So I know this was really personal, and I hope you're cool with that.

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:56.889
I know it's different, but I just really love my family, I do.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.223
And I wanted to say that.

00:04:58.223 --> 00:05:00.586
Because I think it's cool to have that heart change,

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:04.809
and I think that, I think it's really cool when dads step up and participate.

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.633
And I want to be a dad that does that.

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:08.303
So, I'm Destin,

00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:09.672
you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:05:09.672 --> 00:05:11.274
have a good one.

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:13.899
OK I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.746
I had an opportunity to be sponsored by the company Casper,

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:20.853
which makes mattresses, and I believe my wife's direct quote was

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:24.270
"I've given you four babies, I need a good bed".

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.420
Yes Maam.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.024
[Whispered] The first two weeks are very, very hard.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:32.262
I'm about to open the mattress, do you wanna see it?

00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:42.004
[hissing]

00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:44.375
OK you unzip it, and it starts breathing.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:46.676
It's like it's waking up.

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:48.302
It's taking in the air.

00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:50.581
Anyway, if you're interested in getting a Casper mattress,

00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.775
they're made with Latex and memory foam,

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:54.785
so it's like the right amount of spring.

00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:56.376
Are you excited?

00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:57.947
- I'm tired.

00:05:58.278 --> 00:06:02.425
- [laughs] Are you glad we were sponsored by a mattress company?

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:05.094
- I'm glad we were sponsored by a mattress company.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:11.756
- [laugh] Alright, so if you would like to support Smarter Every Day,

Goodnight.

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:43.731
- What are you doing?

00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.602
- What do you mean what am I doing? I'm putting you to sleep.

00:06:46.602 --> 00:06:48.070
- We need sheets on the bed.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.279
- No you don't.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.640
Oh can we rip the tags off?!
