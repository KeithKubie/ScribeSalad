00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.859
so this is 1 million Square feet 2 million Square feet 3 million square feet and so on and

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.390
Like we've done in the last few videos when we've been talking about consumer and producer surplus

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.479
I want to view the demand curve right over here

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.520
I want to view that as a marginal

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.219
Benefit curve, so for this first the very first view square feet right here

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.149
How much benefit is it for the renters the consumers well It's a huge benefit for them. It's worth over $4 per square foot

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.770
That's not necessarily what they're going to pay for it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.809
but that's what it's worth to them, and I'm going to view these the supply curve as a

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.719
Marginal cost curve or the opportunity cost for producing that extra incremental unit so right down here when we have very few square feet

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.589
[maybe] the land is cheap or all the cheapest land is available

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.479
you just start or the land that's most suitable for building and so the cost the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.769
Opportunity cost for the suppliers of that those first few square feet are very low

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
And so it makes sense that they will supply it because they'll produce it their cost of producing

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.349
It is very low the benefit to the consumers is very high so if the price if the price is anywhere between these two things

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.710
The consumer will get some surplus of the prices let's say there that this consumer will get some surplus and the producer

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.619
Will get some surplus right over there?

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.109
And so the market as a whole will be getting a ton of surplus depending on how it is divided now

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.959
We haven't talked about where that price is just yet although

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960
I think you see where this is going, [so]

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.258
[the] Producers will keep producing more [and] more units as long as the marginal benefit [is] higher than the marginal cost there is this

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.160
Surplus there that can be divvied up between the consumers and and the suppliers depending on where the price is

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.259
Marginal benefit higher than Marginal cost marginal benefit higher than marginal cost [all] the way up to that point

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.050
All the way until [we] get to all the way until we get to three million square feet per month

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.069
After that, it doesn't make [sense] if so, there's some builder that says hey

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.039
Let me add some more square feet to the market. This is what it cost them

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.780
It's going to cost them over three dollars like well people aren't [even] going to get three dollars of benefit from those

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.760
Incremental square feet so no one's going to get it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.760
So there's no reason [for] anyone to build

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.279
Beyond that point and so that's why this ends up being the equilibrium quantity and the price at which that happens

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.050
the price at which that happens

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.239
[and] I rigged this so we get nice clean numbers is three dollars per square foot per month

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.259
Now three dollars per square foot per month is a pretty pricey rent if you have a thousand square foot apartment a thousand square foot

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
That's my old apartment. That's like a two-bedroom two-bath

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.640
Apartment, that's Roughly a three thousand dollars a month for that apartment. So that's pretty pricey

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.649
this is the type of rent that you would see in someplace like San Francisco and let's say that the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.589
[Mayor] does not like this is this is unaffordable people aren't able to live in our city

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.820
And so they they they institute rent control?

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.619
Rent control, which is essentially a price ceiling they say that the rent per square foot cannot be above a certain amount?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.419
That's not normally how rent control is instituted, but just for the sake of our model

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.190
Let's view it that way normally they [say] you can't increase rent beyond a certain amount, but let's say that they say rent control

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.910
they essentially put a price ceiling on what rent can be charged, so [they] put a price ceiling a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.199
price ceiling or a rent ceiling a price ceiling at

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
[$2] per square foot per month

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.269
[$2] per square foot

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.470
Square foot

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.030
per month

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.380
So let's [think] about what's going to happen and also let's think about what's happening to the total surplus the producer and the consumer surplus

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.009
So before well actually before we even think about the rent control

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.399
Let's think about what the total surplus is you had the consumer surplus?

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.390
So if this is the price right over here you had a consumer surplus of this area right over here

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.120
[and] I don't know if this if this right over here

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.149
Let's call this four and [a] half if this is four point five

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.930
Then this side of the triangle right over here is going to be one point five

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.379
That is one point five and this right over here is three million?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.040
[three] times 1.5 is four point five

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.210
four point five

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.359
Million and then we divide by [two] that if you just multiply these year the area of the whole rectangle you divide by two

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.859
You get two point two five million is [that] right?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.030
Yes 1.5, or times one half of three that gives you two point two five million

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.790
million Dollars

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.829
So in the equilibrium if you just let the [market] be before the rent control and this

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.139
Equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity the consumer surplus is two point two five million dollars

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.939
That's how much more benefit the consumers are getting collectively versus what they have to pay [for]

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.260
Living in that living in those houses and then the producer surplus

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.739
The producer Surplus is this entire area right over here, and if we assume let's say that this right [over] here

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.369
And it doesn't look [like] it, but to make the math easy let's say that that is

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.210
$0.50

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.940
Let's say that is [$0.50] so this whole side right [over] here is going to be two dollars [fifty]

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.329
So this is going to be two point five right over here this length right over here is still three so it's going to be

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.150
two point five times three times 1/2

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.729
two point five times three would give you the area of the whole rectangle

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.370
You have to multiply by half to get the area of that triangle, so two times [three] so let me just write this down

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.829
So it's two point five times

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.220
Three is that is seven point five 25 times 3 is 75 and then 75

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.919
75 divided by two

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.459
75 divided by two gets you what it's Thirty Seven Thirty seven point five

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.910
So this is going to be three point seven three point seven five so this the producer surplus is

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.460
3.7

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.359
3.75 and since this is in Millions. It's three point Seven five million

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.049
dollars and so that's the total value that the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:27.459
producers are getting above and beyond their costs of production and so the total surplus the total benefit that the market as a whole if

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.520
you add the

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.880
Consumers and the [producers] is [2.25]

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.750
Plus three point seven five so that gets us to what that gets us [to] six million dollars of total surplus

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.700
So there are six million dollars six million total

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.190
total surplus, so that's good because it's we're at an efficient price efficient clear equilibrium price and

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.419
Production we're able to produce all this total surplus now. Let's go back to the rent control situation. We're instituting

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.139
Instituting a price ceiling of [$2] per square foot

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.229
So the price is by government mandate being set at $2 per square foot

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.830
$2 per square foot right over there now if the price is set for $2 per square foot

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.690
What is the quantity going to be how much rent is going to supply if they can only get $2 per square foot?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.190
Maybe some of the landlord's say you know

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.380
I'll just break [down] this wall and expand my [own] apartment

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.029
Or I'm not going to rent these out as much or maybe people who are renting out spare bedrooms say oh

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.309
I'm not going to rent out those pair of bedrooms anymore

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.109
I'm just going [to] keep them as a guestroom [so] the total quantity goes down the total quantity

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.199
Goes down to 2 million Square feet a month now

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.590
this is an interesting situation because it 2 million square feet a month at

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.090
2 million Square feet of month the Marginal Benefit the Marginal Benefit is

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.809
much higher than the marginal cost the marginal benefit of an extra unit is

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.410
over $3 [the] marginal cost of an extra unit is

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.650
Right around $2 so in a in an open market and efficient market in an unfettered market people say well

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.480
I'll just build more [units] because people are going to get benefit from them and we can have a price in between and we'll both

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.039
Be able to experience some surplus, but now you won't even though. There's this benefit

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.509
That's in excess of $3 because the price can't be higher than $2

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.270
There's no incentive for any of these people to either

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.019
build more units or maybe offer the units that they have off

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.120
Up for sale and actually maybe we shouldn't talk about building this more long run, but even the units that are there

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.870
I won't want to rent my [guestroom] out because I'm like oh, it's [too] much of [that]. You know

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.910
I'm not going to get my I'm not going to get my marginal cost my marginal cost here is

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
Over $2 and all I'm allowed [to] get is $2 so I don't want to offer that extra unit

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.450
So what happens in this situation?

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.239
when the price is set right over here when the price is said right over here, the

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.479
Consumers who happen to be able to rent at this price? Who are able to get these first two million square feet per month?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.480
they get an even larger [for]

00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:01.000
Those those at least for those two million square feet [their] consumer surplus is this thing right over here is

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.119
This thing right [over] there and the producer surplus

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.799
Unambiguously shrinks the producer surplus is this stuff right over here?

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:15.189
But you see that the total surplus is now smaller than the total surplus was when we had an unfettered market

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:20.140
We no longer are able to access this part right over here of the surplus

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:27.549
So this right over [here] you could view this as lost lost benefit to society benefit above the cost

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:35.469
This is lost surplus, and we call this in economic terms. We call this right over here the deadweight loss the deadweight

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.220
weight Loss

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.339
this is benefit to the market that could have gone to either the consumers or the

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:48.129
Producers that somehow was taken away from this market because this market was made less efficient by [this]

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.570
Artificial price ceiling right over here, and you [can] measure the Deadweight Loss once again

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:59.589
It's only it's the area of this triangle right over here, [and] so if you say if you say this right over here

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:05.049
So this this length right over here is clearly [just] [1] that's [1] and if we say that this height

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.120
This height right over here. It looks like it is this is about [1] and [1/2]

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.260
This is about 1 and 1/2

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.699
Then the area of this triangle this white triangle right over here the deadweight loss let me write over here the deadweight loss is going

00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:23.109
To be equal to 1 times 1.5 times 1.5

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.909
Times 1/2 right 1 point 1 Time 1 times 1.5

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.490
Is double the area of the triangle you multiply times 1/2 to get the area so that becomes 1/2 times?

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.719
1.5, which is 0.75 so that gives us a [dead] [lot], but it's point 7 5 million so it's

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.399
[750,000] dollars, [so] this area right over here

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.420
$750,000 which is lost to the market so now the total surplus is going to be

00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.640
750,000 dollars less than the 6 million dollars so because of that rent control it'll now go down to five hundred

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:03.219
Five point two five million, I took

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:10.368
750,000 out of this so it might have benefited the renters who happened to who are able to get apartments?

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:15.349
[it] won't be a benefit the renters who now that they're not going to be able find an apartment it

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.679
unambiguously reduced the Producer Surplus and

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:25.339
It reduced the total surplus the total amount of benefit that the market as a whole was getting
