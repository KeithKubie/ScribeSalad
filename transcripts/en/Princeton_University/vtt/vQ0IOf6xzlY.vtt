00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:08.149 position:66%
Daniel Linke:
So, you were 38 when you became president,

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.149 position:66%
Daniel Linke:
So, you were 38 when you became president,

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.009 position:78%
Daniel Linke:
and looking back now, do you think you were ready?

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.330 position:72%
William G. Bowen:
Well, as ready as anyone really can be. I had,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.199 position:77%
William G. Bowen:
of course, two advantages... two huge advantages.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.630 position:92%
William G. Bowen:
One was the fact that I was young, and therefore had energy

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.010 position:89%
William G. Bowen:
and stamina and could work extraordinary hours, as I did.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.370 position:81%
William G. Bowen:
The second advantage is that, of course, having been
in the provost's office for

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.620
William G. Bowen:
five tumultuous years,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.160 position:97%
William G. Bowen:
I really understood very well what the presidency was all about.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.080 position:78%
William G. Bowen:
Now that I think about it, I had a third advantage

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.120 position:69%
William G. Bowen:
which many other people don't have, which is

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.720 position:63%
William G. Bowen:
that I knew so many people at Princeton.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.400
William G. Bowen:
I always felt that we're

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.210
William G. Bowen:
all in this together.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.300 position:67%
William G. Bowen:
Let's figure out how we can help each other

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.470
William G. Bowen:
and get the job done.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.000 position:97%
Daniel Linke:
As provost, the CPUC and the provost work very closely together.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.490
William G. Bowen:
Absolutely.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.150 position:80%
Daniel Linke:
So, tell me about your involvement in that process.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
William G. Bowen:
I had a lot to do with the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.970
William G. Bowen:
construction of the CPUC

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.640
William G. Bowen:
and it was one of the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.650 position:73%
William G. Bowen:
more useful things I did for Princeton, because
what it did was impose a structure,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.200 position:95%
William G. Bowen:
an order, on a process that was otherwise all over the place.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.400 position:84%
William G. Bowen:
It was a strongly positive thing, at least in my view.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.549 position:89%
Daniel Linke:
So, did you assume co-education was an eventuality before

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.860
Daniel Linke:
the Patterson Committee?

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.190 position:58%
William G. Bowen:
Oh yes, I had thought for a long time

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.420 position:80%
William G. Bowen:
that Princeton simply had to become co-educational.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.300 position:77%
William G. Bowen:
There wasn't a real choice at the end of the day.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.710
William G. Bowen:
There would be costs that would

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.380 position:63%
William G. Bowen:
cut across the institution in every way.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.550 position:61%
William G. Bowen:
Faculty, the best faculty, many of them
would not have stayed.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.140 position:58%
William G. Bowen:
We wouldn't have been able to recruit

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.840 position:83%
William G. Bowen:
the students, male as well as female, that we needed.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.780 position:73%
William G. Bowen:
The University would have become anachronistic,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.309
William G. Bowen:
and so for me it was

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.540
William G. Bowen:
the issue, because it did affect

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.469 position:81%
William G. Bowen:
everything else. What it came down to was to signify

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.649 position:80%
William G. Bowen:
the capacity of a great university, which Princeton
certainly was pre-coeducation,

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:32.000 position:75%
William G. Bowen:
to change and to become better than it was then.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.449
William G. Bowen:
The challenges really

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.929 position:80%
William G. Bowen:
to achieving the greater diversity that
we all wanted, I think that almost everyone wanted,

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:45.629 position:80%
William G. Bowen:
were just finding very good candidates in a society
that was still

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.349 position:80%
William G. Bowen:
quite segregated and where educational opportunity,
pre-college, was by no means equally

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.379 position:66%
William G. Bowen:
distributed. And so we had to find ways --
as we did with the help of

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.149 position:70%
William G. Bowen:
minority students themselves and other people

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.969
William G. Bowen:
to reach out, to be more effective

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.290 position:75%
William G. Bowen:
in persuading people of all races and colors and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.729
William G. Bowen:
attitudes to come to Princeton.

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.339
William G. Bowen:
So one of my goals

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:18.439 position:77%
William G. Bowen:
was to help not only minority students and women,

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.390 position:70%
William G. Bowen:
but also Jewish students, feel more included.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.569 position:97%
William G. Bowen:
Probably the most important thing that I did, in the last half anyway,

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.939
William G. Bowen:
it gets ahead of the

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.559 position:86%
William G. Bowen:
timeline a bit, the last half of my time in Nassau Hall

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.180
William G. Bowen:
was to build the life sciences.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.400
William G. Bowen:
I remember well losing some top

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.980 position:88%
William G. Bowen:
young faculty in the life sciences, because there
weren't the facilities and there weren't the colleagues.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.189 position:63%
William G. Bowen:
So finally, we'd had enough of this, and

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.349
William G. Bowen:
we decided, the group of us

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.729 position:84%
William G. Bowen:
that were leading the University at that time, that we
were going to do whatever it took.

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.520 position:98%
William G. Bowen:
We were going to spend the money -- and we did. And that's when

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.109 position:63%
William G. Bowen:
we attracted Arnie Levine and Tom Shenk,

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.439
William G. Bowen:
Shirley Tilghman, and just a host

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.989 position:67%
William G. Bowen:
of outstanding people. I remember very well
walking across the campus with Shenk

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.049 position:61%
William G. Bowen:
shortly after he had come to Princeton,

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.609 position:95%
William G. Bowen:
and he said he just wanted to thank me for all
the support I had provided for molecular biology and the life

00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:30.919
William G. Bowen:
sciences, and I said,

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.360
William G. Bowen:
"Thank you, but all I want is

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.889 position:69%
William G. Bowen:
success." He said, "Well, we will build here

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.320 position:84%
William G. Bowen:
the best molecular biology department in the country."

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:59.000
