1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,040
Yeah, well it's, if it didn't
exist, it would be way more
interesting than bigfoot.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,720
Yeah, right. Like everybody's like so
into big foot being real. Yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,360
I don't get big plays. Can you talk to
me about that? Like do you think what,

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,960
what is, what's the concept
of big fight? I mean, I know,
okay. It's a big hairy guy,

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,610
but yeah. Well, I mean really come on.

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,611
What is it most likely there
was interaction between
human beings and something

7
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,680
called the gigantic Opeth Agus for
thousands and thousands of years.

8
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:35,681
It's a giant bipedal hominid that existed
in Asia that was between eight and 10

9
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:40,620
feet tall. It was real and it was
basically in like the orangutan family.

10
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,300
It looks almost orangutan like, but
enormous. And that was a real thing.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,410
And they didn't find out about this until
like the 1920s they found a tooth in

12
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:53,150
an apothecary shop in China and a,
and anthropologists examined his tooth.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,510
It was like, where the fuck
did you get this? And they,

14
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:59,480
they took them to the site and they dug
up more things and bones and jawbones

15
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,250
and they determine from the job on,

16
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,140
I'm sorry if I'm fucking
any of this up scientists,

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,160
but they determined from the job
on that they think it was bipedal,

18
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,770
that it stood up on two
legs and so then they said,

19
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,690
well how big would this thing be?
And then in the proportionate, yeah,

20
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,260
like the feelings. Are you ever seen
one? A real one looks like? Yeah. I just,

21
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,080
sometimes when they say like,
oh up in Michigan, I'm like,

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,490
is it really like what are they saying?
Bullshit.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,000
Most of it is the people
seeing shadows in the trees.

24
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,790
They want to believe it's big foot and
they're seen bears that are walking on

25
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,730
two legs.
But if there was a thing,

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,240
what's really interesting is that's
where it would be because if it did come

27
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:38,710
across the larynx, the Bering land
bridge, like they believe humans did.

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,660
If that did happen, the many animals
Maton navigated from there to here.

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,523
That way.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,940
That's where Alaska and
the Pacific northwest,

31
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,500
that would be the natural path.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,860
And then if you think about how
densely wooded that area is, right,

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,160
that would be a natural habitat for
something that's hiding from people.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,150
The problem is you can't really hide
from shit anymore. It's just too hard.

35
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,800
They'd see from space up, something
would catch you on a trail camera.

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,080
Some,
there's trail cameras that are everywhere.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,970
They're four k like did you see those?

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,630
These a guy and his father got caught
poaching of mother bear in her den.

39
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,500
It's ill, it's horrific, it's horrible.

40
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,910
And it's not just horrible because the,
they poached this mother bear in their,

41
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,400
Dan left the babies essentially to die.

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,450
But they were talking about how they're
not going to get caught doing it.

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,510
Like no one's gonna tie us to this.
And the way they were caught,

44
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:39,100
there was a four k camera that
was right behind them that was,

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,140
that was observing this, this whole
area where this does bear was den,

46
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,800
den. They have these trail cameras
now. They're incredibly accurate.

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,120
There's so like, it's so
high definition, right?

48
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,030
We're super clear on the audio is clear.
Would catch one of those fucking things.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,100
Yeah.
Out then.

50
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,310
But I think there is something to
be said for the tooth fairy and

51
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,900
thinking we don't know
everything like them.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,150
The magic of stuff on known and behind.

53
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,720
I mean for me it doesn't have
to be big foot, but I I love,

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,160
I love the idea that we haven't seen
everything. We don't know everything.

55
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,270
And obviously we know that was
space and who knows, you know,

56
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,560
dimensions and time and universe,

57
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,950
but something mythical is pretty fun.
Well,

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,190
what's interesting is that there was
a bunch of different kinds of humans.

59
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,300
That's what's interesting.

60
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,900
And they found these bones in Russia
that I think they call them the dentist

61
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:39,790
Soviet [inaudible]. They found a coco.
This is within the last 10 15 years.

62
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,180
They found a completely different
species of humans that lived in Russia.

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,900
They found those little people on the
island of Flores that was only like 10

64
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,370
years ago.
I mean there's,

65
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:52,030
there's probably dozens more that
they just haven't uncovered somewhere.

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,410
So if there was at one point in time,
some big giant Hominid,

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,730
it's totally possible.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,870
I just don't think you'd have
to eat so much to be alive.

69
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:05,230
10 feet have constantly,
it's like a bear. Yeah.

70
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,110
Like you find bear shit everywhere.
Where's the, where's the gorilla? Shit?

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,970
Where's the the big foot shit? Whatever
it, is it city? Is it eating plants?

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,570
Is it any animals? What the fuck
is it? Eating right can eat a lot.
