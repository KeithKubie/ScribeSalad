LAURENCE EAVES: The number today
I'd like to talk to you

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.040
about is 69.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.800
And it turns out to be an
important number for this

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.350
little pocket calculator.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.370
Well, in order to explain
this, I need to tell you

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.100
something about factorial
numbers.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.170
I'm going to just start off by
explaining what the symbol

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:26.130
factorial n is, where n is an
integer, eg, 1, 2, 3, 4, any

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.990
integer like that.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.400
Well, it's n with an exclamation
mark after it.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130
And it's got a special meaning
in mathematics.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.390
It doesn't mean n,
shouted out loud.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020
It's just got a special
symbol in mathematics.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.940
Now, factorial 1 is trivial.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.760
1 factorial is just itself.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.220
But factorial 2, well, that's
pretty uninteresting as well.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.990
It's just 1 times 2, and
that's equal to 2.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.120
And factorial 3 is equal to 1
times 2 times 3, which is

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.060
equal to 6.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.590
And factorial 4 is 1 times 2
times 3 times 4, which is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.850
equal to 24.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.150
Now, if we go to factorial 5,
that's about as far as I can

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.540
go without having to write
things down and work out

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.040
easily in my head, but
that's equal to 120.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.350
So these numbers increase
quite quickly.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.820
So it's fun just to work out
factorial 20, and I can do

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.750
that by continuing
this process.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.130
But it's much easier to get
out my pocket calculator.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.920
So let's do 20.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.540
So there's 20 going in, and
now I notice, to get the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.060
factorial, there it is.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.560
It's x with an exclamation mark
in, and that's in yellow.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.910
So I've got to press the Shift
key, and then I press the key,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.070
20 factorial all ready to go.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.950
So now I put equals, and this
comes out to be 2.432902008--

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.480
and that was the
important bit--

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.650
times 10 to the 18.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.620
So this is now really quite
a large number.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.860
That number is much, much bigger
than the number of

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.980
stars in our galaxy and a bit
smaller than the number of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.060
stars in the observable
universe.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.370
Now 69, if we work out factorial
69, it turns out

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.400
that this is the largest number,
factorial number, that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.530
I can calculate on my little
pocket calculator here.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.440
69, and then we do Shift, and
what do I get for that?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.110
I get 1.711224524--

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.990
and that's when my calculator
stops-- times 10 to the 98.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.680
Now, you can see we're getting
quite close to this big number

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.230
of 10 to the 100 here.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.290
And it turns out that that is
the largest number, I can--

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.780
factorial number I can complete
on my calculator.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.920
If I go to the next number,
factorial 70, which, of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.130
course, is just factorial
69 times 70.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.630
So I'll put in, and then try
to work out the factorial.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.806
What do I get?

00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:58.290
BRADY HARAN: Error.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.280
LAURENCE EAVES: So I get
error, which means the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.670
number's become too big
for my calculator.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.490
Now, factorial numbers are
interesting in themselves.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.310
But for us physicists, they
really are very important in

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.730
statistics and in statistical
physics.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.320
These things crop up in very
beautiful ways and lead to all

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.930
sorts of exotic things, like the
properties of electrons,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.540
and even the properties of
those other sources of

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.200
particles, bosons.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.450
But that's a bit of
another story.
