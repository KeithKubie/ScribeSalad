Now you make think it's a bunch of trouble to add all these comments into your

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.510
code but let me show you something. Here is a part of the documentation of the

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.780
java string class. When you scroll through it you'll see someone wrote a lot of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.129
documentation here, and actually let me tell you who that someone was. You can

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.580
get the source code for the string class, it's a part of the java development

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.290
kit. So, here is a part of the actual source code, here is a method and over

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.648
here. The programmer wrote a pretty long java.comment and not just one. If you

00:00:28.648 --> 00:00:33.940
scroll through this file, you will see that every method has a comment. Here's

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.620
another one and you'll see that every method has a comment so if the programmer

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.499
that give us java can write those comments, so can you.
