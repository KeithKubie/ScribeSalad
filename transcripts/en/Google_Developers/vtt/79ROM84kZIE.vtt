00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:07.410
STEWART MILES:
I'm Stewart Miles.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm a software engineer on
Firebase and Fun Propulsion

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.250
Labs.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.145
[INAUDIBLE] I'm here to talk
to you about Firebase today.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:16.770
Firebase is a suite
of services to help

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
you build unique experiences
and grow successful businesses.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.529
So we're part of all of the
different stages of development

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.820
when you're building your game.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.960
It helps you develop, grow,
and earn more from your games.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.950
And many of the features are
provided at absolutely no cost.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.660
I'll provide an overview of
a subset of the features.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.960
So after working with
our development community

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
for the past few months, I'm
proud to announce today the 3.0

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.670
release of our mobile SDKs for
C++ and Unity developers that

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.340
target iOS and Android.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.320
So you'll be able
to access Firebase

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810
from your favorite game engine.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.610
And Firebase supports
iOS, Android, and the web,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.760
and we have admin
SDKs for your service.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.630
If you're selling
a premium game,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.390
it's valuable to
measure user engagement

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.480
to understand whether players
will return or purchase

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.662
your next release.

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:06.870
This is especially important
in freemium games, where

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.150
you might want to measure
engagement to make sure

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.300
that users are converting on
your ads as much as possible,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.650
while perhaps purchasing
in-app content.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.340
Firebase analytics allows you
to measure umlimited player

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.980
behavior at no cost.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.350
Firebase analytics provides
a pre-built dashboard

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.150
for common data
analysis scenarios,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.510
and implicitly captures
events like the first time

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.980
your game is opened by user,
engagement time, retention,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.005
in-app purchases
where it's possible,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.180
and user demographics as
well, with minimum effort.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.064
And also you can log
your own custom events

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:39.980
on top of all of that.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.360
In addition, our
dashboard allows

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.420
you to find your own audiences,
cohorts, and funnels,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.850
and user properties.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.110
If our dashboard isn't
sufficient for your needs,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.180
you can pool data
using Google Cloud's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.540
BigQuery or into your
own analysis tools.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.570
Or you could even use Google's
data studio for data analysis

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.110
as well.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.120
So try it out now.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.260
It's really, really easy.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.250
This is all the code that you
need if you're a c++ developer.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.940
There is some build
stuff if you're C++,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.840
but this is all you could need
to get going with analytics.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.980
And this gives you all the
built-in event tracking.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.669
In Unity, you just
import a plug-in,

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.210
you write a couple
of lines of code--

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.740
this is the key one here--

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.170
and you're off and running.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350
That's it.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.170
We also have Firebase
remote config.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.120
It's an experiment
framework which

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
enables you to adjust
game parameters in order

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.560
to maximize user engagement.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.060
So you can deploy
your game, and you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.140
can adjust parameters without
redeploying a new build.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.230
For example, if you suspect
players are leaving your game

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.254
due to your ad
display strategy, you

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:43.670
can run an experiment where
you reduce the frequency of ad

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.495
display or move your ad display
points to see whether it

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:48.920
affects user retention.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.310
Or perhaps people just prefer
blue cats in their games.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.920
You can also use remote config
to change any parameters

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.560
in your game, like
UI, ad placement,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.590
difficulty, or whatever
you can imagine.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.210
We provide a web interface
for remote configuration

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.229
so non-programming
members of your team

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.770
can configure and
run an experiments.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.490
So, game designers, operations
teams, things like that.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.330
In addition, Firebase provides
push notification support.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.310
So we have Cloud messaging
notifications that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.830
enable you to reengage players.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.572
So this is trying to bring
them back into your game.

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:23.030
For example, if you've just
added new content to your game,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.490
you could send a
push notification

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.715
to users who have completed--

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:28.340
I don't know-- a good
chunk of the game

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.630
to tell them to come back
and try out the new content.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.210
We also provide a web UI
for push notifications,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.270
again allowing
non-engineering team members

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.110
to send notifications
to players of the game.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.169
After notifications
have been sent,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.710
we also have a
dashboard that enables

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.090
you to measure their impact.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.490
So we have a funnel report,
and all of the analytics

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.320
get bubbled up into
Firebase analytics

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.040
as well, which can
pull out into BigQuery.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.200
To grow your audience
or reengage players,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200
we provide dynamic
links and app invites.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.120
For example, a player
could share a game

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.690
where you feed sushi to animals,
they click the Invite button,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.090
they select who to share with,
they will receive an email link

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.390
to the game, and then when
they click on the link,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.766
it will install the
game and potentially

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:15.890
provide them with a reward.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.100
You can decide what to do
with the link yourself.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.570
In addition, the
player who shared

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.530
can also be rewarded something
for sharing the game.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.180
We have an
authentication API that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.740
allows you to authenticate with
multiple identity providers.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.560
Users can sign
anonymously, and then later

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.260
upgrade to an identity provider.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.350
Like out of the box, like
one of these, or they

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.560
can use an anonymous account.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.150
We also have a
real-time database,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.890
which allows you to
store game state,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.410
like available
characters, maps, etc.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.930
Set updates are synchronized
in hundreds of milliseconds,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.060
so you could build
turn-based games, or just

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.860
store data for
your game in there.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.800
You could also do something like
building collaborative editing

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.920
of maps in a marble rolling
game, like one of our demos,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.720
or you could build
leaderboards with the database.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720
Finally, Firebase
storage allows you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.460
to store large chunks of data.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.130
This distributed
quickly for CDN.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.525
It also allows you to set
content protection rules,

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:16.460
so that you could do things
like offer premium content.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.080
If you want to find
out more, we've

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.270
got a session on
Firebase at 12:45

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.280
on Thursday, AdMob at
3 o'clock on Thursday,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.160
and you can also download demos.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.960
