00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:02.430
INTERVIEWER 1: Interacting
with wild animals

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.600
is a popular touristy thing
to do all over the world.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.180
You can feed monkeys
at a park in Japan.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.960
You can ride
elephants in Thailand.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.010
We actually did a
video on that one.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.910
You can even feed parrots
in downtown San Francisco,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.580
though the city really
doesn't want you to.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240
Taming wild animals
isn't always a good idea

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.990
but it's undeniably exciting.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560
It gets us up close and
personal with nature

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.030
in a way that's
usually fun and safe.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.170
I say usually because there are
interactions like this and some

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.765
like this.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.690
So this isn't quite as
harrowing as it looks,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.900
but it still makes me nervous.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.120
It's a picture from the city of
Harar, Ethiopia, a place where

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
people live in very close
proximity with hyenas.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.374
And I do mean close.

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:52.290
JOSH SHEFMAN: Every
night, wild spotted hyenas

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.250
would sulk into the
city looking for food.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.916
INTERVIEWER 1: That, by the way,
is the photographer Joshua Paul

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:57.670
Shefman.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.128
JOSH SHEFMAN: At a designated
spot outside the ancient city

00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:02.280
walls, a hyena man would
bring the pale meat

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.090
as tourists would gather
to watch, and most

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.824
shockingly, to participate
in a very intimate feeding.

00:01:06.824 --> 00:01:08.740
INTERVIEWER 1: Joshua
is a travel photographer

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.180
based in Toronto.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.850
And while he too was a little
freaked out by the scene,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.300
like any photojournalist,
he had to get the shot.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.050
JOSH SHEFMAN: Here, a
small child egged on

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.840
by his unabashedly eager
parents takes a slightly risky

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.730
opportunity to feed
these carnivores

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.645
as they prance back
and forth around him.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:25.870
By the look on his face,
it was pretty obvious he

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.150
didn't feel too secure.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.810
But who could
possibly blame him?

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.310
I thought the parents
irresponsible.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.370
But at the same time,
I felt I had to capture

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.910
what was to come next.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.430
INTERVIEWER 1: What came next,
the feeding of these hyenas,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.490
actually has a bit
of history in Harar.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.990
JOSH SHEFMAN: For
at least 50 years,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.200
wild hyenas have been fed
by a farmer and his family

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.410
outside the gates of
these ancient walls, all

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.807
done apparently
to encourage them

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.600
to spare the city's livestock.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.429
Today, this practice has become
a big tourist draw to Harar.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.720
INTERVIEWER 1: The farmers
there are right to keep tabs

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.190
on their livestock.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.710
Hyenas are often thought
of as dirty scavengers,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.150
but that's not accurate.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.640
95% of their food comes
from kills they make.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.710
They're hunters.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500
And while hyena attacks
on humans are rare,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.220
they do happen, which
makes it seem like this

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.032
all the more unnerving.

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:12.740
JOSH SHEFMAN: While
habituated to humans,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.890
these were still very clearly
wild animals-- animals with one

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.866
of the strongest jaws
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.740
Nevertheless, the hyenas
were only interested

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.716
in the free meal.

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:22.090
INTERVIEWER 1:
Given all of that,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.000
it's hard to know what
we're even looking at here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.580
Is this a tradition, a matter
of practicality, a tourist trap?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130
It might be all the above.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.300
The fact is that
people and hyenas

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.570
have been sharing spaces
in this part of Africa

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.700
for a long, long time.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.970
And that creates a complicated
relationship, albeit one

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.740
that makes for a more dramatic
picture than parrots eating out

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.640
of your hand.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.730

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.270
safari.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.220
INTERVIEWER 2: But of course,
lounging in a pool and watching

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.470
impala was nothing
compared to what

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.710
Johan and Audrey saw on safari.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.240
INTERVIEWER 1: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.970
Thanks for watching.
