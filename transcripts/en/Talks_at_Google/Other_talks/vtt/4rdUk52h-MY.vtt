00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.530
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, good afternoon everyone.
I wanted to welcome you to another outstanding

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.490
Authors@Google Talk. Now, one thing that I
wanted you to keep in mind while I give my

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.500
intro, is I wanted you to specifically pay
attention to any time I reference the University

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.560
of Illinois, of YouTube, or the word "indeed."
We are indeed very pleased to be joined today

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.199
by a Nobel Prize winner, Chris Chabris, for
today's talk. I take that back. He's actually

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.090
an Ig Nobel Prize winner, which is pretty
much the same thing except the speeches are

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.430
shorter and the talks are a little bit more
meaningful. Along with his colleague, Dan

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.140
Simons, Chris has created a landmark video,
which I'm sure many of you have seen. It is

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.350
called "The Invisible Gorilla" and he'll probably
talk about that at length today during our

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.620
conversation. And it's went viral on YouTube.
Many of you have probably seen it. I remember

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.950
when I saw it for my first time viewing, I
am actually a graduate of the University of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.320
Illinois in Champaign, and so Dan works there
and I thought for certain that the elevator

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.401
in the movie was our elevator in the psychology
building. So, I was paying attention to that

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.920
for the entire program. I missed everything
else and it turns out the elevator was at

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.650
Harvard. So, I was clearly mistaken. But,
I didn't get to see the bonus feature. Now,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.191
Chris received his PhD from Harvard and now
he's an Assistant Professor of Psychology

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:32.280
at Union College. His research focuses on
cognitive illusions and perception, and also

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.240
group behavior and group think. And he's published
papers on everything from beauty to the Mozart

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.140
effect to the beauty of the Mozart effect.
He'll be speaking to us today about his latest

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.229
book, which is entitled "The Invisible Gorilla".
It speaks about how perception affects the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.700
gorillas in our midst. Indeed, truth is all
around us if we're only there to see it. Be

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.650
sure, as the talk goes forward, to count any
instances of passes, both aerial and bounce

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.730
passes. Without further ado, please join me
in welcoming Chris to Google. Thank you.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.869
[applause]

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:18.060
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Thank you very much. I'm
glad you got in that "Ig" part of the Ig Nobel

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
Prize. I have students who sometimes write
to me and say, "Oh, I'd be very honored to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.380
work with a Nobel Prize winner on research."
And I usually don't write back and explain

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.840
that they made a mistake. I just let them
keep on believing that. So, I'd like to start

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.310
today by showing you a famous experiment in
selective looking. And this is not, perhaps,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.150
the experiment you're thinking of. This is
actually an experiment done by Ulric Neisser,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.450
one of the pioneers of cognitive psychology,
in the 1970s. And this is the experiment that

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.150
inspired Dan Simons and I to do the Invisible
Gorilla experiment that many of you know about

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.480
and that we'll talk about shortly. What Neisser
did in the 1970s was create a video showing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.370
six people passing two basketballs around.
Three people are dressed in white and three

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.879
people are dressed in black. And your task
is to focus on the people dressed in white

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.040
and count the number of times they pass the
ball, and to do this counting silently in

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.900
your head. And at the end of the video, you'll
be asked a question about it. OK, so, can

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.510
I have a volunteer? Oh, come on. Don't be
shy. I'm gonna start cold calling if I don't

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.870
get any volunteers. 24. OK, the volunteer
even knew the question I was gonna ask. OK,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.090
24 passes. Now, raise your hand if you notice
something else besides the people throwing

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.290
the ball around. What did you notice?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.290
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible].

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.290
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Excuse me?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.290
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible].

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.560
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: The lady with an umbrella,
right. So, in Neisser's original study, a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.570
woman carrying an umbrella walks through during
the passing of the basketballs. But if you

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.140
notice this, if you look at this video carefully,
you don't even have to look very carefully,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.709
you can see that it's unusual. For one thing,
everyone's a ghost in this video. And the

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.760
way Neisser created this was using a technique
with mirrors to record several videos and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.739
then project them together and make a video
where everyone overlaps at once. And this

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.519
experiment had been known somewhat in the
psychology community, but I personally was

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.080
not aware of it. Dan knew about it. Dan Simons
knew about it when he and I met at Harvard

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.590
University in the late 1990s. And there was
a little bit of suspicion that maybe the reason

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.030
why people don't notice this woman walking
across the screen is that everyone's a ghost

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.930
and she's actually a little bit hard to see.
And there are strange things; people are walking

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.620
through each other and so on. Does it really
demonstrate something important? How fragile

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.900
is that ability to notice these unexpected
objects? So, unexpected events. So, Dan and

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.360
I were teaching a course in research methods
to the undergraduates at Harvard. In this

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.530
course, each student was supposed to produce
their own experiment and collect data and

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.220
write it up at the end of the term. But Dan
had a great idea, which was why don't we make

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.850
it fun for everybody and have one experiment
that we can all work on together as well.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.970
Now, there aren't that many psychology experiments
which require ten or twelve people, but Dan

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.711
knew about Neisser's experiment and decided
we should film it and recreate it in the Psychology

00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:08.220
Department, but with a few twists. So, one
of those twists was going to be that we would

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.520
do it live with everybody moving around in-between,
in and out and so on so that if we still found

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.740
that people didn't notice something unexpected,
it wouldn't be because everybody was a ghost.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.180
The other twist was to try some things other
than a woman carrying an umbrella. Maybe a

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.700
woman carrying an umbrella is kind of hard
to see because it's not that surprising; it's

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.880
not that unexpected. What about something
else? Well, one of the other professors in

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.140
the department had a gorilla suit lying around
in his lab. Someone always has a gorilla suit

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.350
lying around, right? So, we borrowed that,
that's "borrowed" and had one of our students

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.070
put the gorilla suit on and walk across in
the video. And we wound up producing a video

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.990
that looks somewhat like this next one. And
here again, even if you know about this already,

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.330
I'd like you to really try it for yourself
and try hard to focus on the people wearing

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.280
white shirts and ignore the people wearing
black shirts, and count the number of times

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.210
the white-shirted people pass the ball. And
once again, I'll ask you at the end how many,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.550
how many you counted. Here we go.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.360
Ok, so what's the count on that one?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.371
&gt;&gt;audience #2: 16.

00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.871
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: 16. OK, most people got 16?
All right. Raise your hand if you noticed

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:23.850
a gorilla walking across the screen. OK, did
anyone not notice the gorilla? OK. Raise your

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.660
hand if you noticed anything else unusual.
Ok, I only see like, three hands up in the

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.181
whole room. So, you sir, what did you notice?

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.919
&gt;&gt;audience #3: The curtains changed from red
to yellow.

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.270
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: The curtains changed from
red to yellow. So, raise your hand if you

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.100
noticed that the curtain changed from red
to yellow. I mean, you can see that it's yellow

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.830
now. OK, so I only see about two hands. Did
anyone notice anything else unusual? [pause]

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.830
You, sir.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.332
&gt;&gt;audience #4: One of the people in the black
shirt left.

00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:49.580
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: One of the people in the
black shirts left, that's correct. Did anyone

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.819
else notice that one of the people in the
black shirts left? OK, nobody. So, I fooled

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.919
you. You thought there was gonna be a gorilla
and you opened your mind to the possibility

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.740
the gorilla might appear. You were able to
prime yourself to notice a gorilla, but that

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.430
didn't mean that you were gonna notice all
the unexpected things that happened. There

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.321
were two other unexpected things that happened.
This is a video that was created by Dan Simons

00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:15.039
this year. He calls it "the monkey business
illusion" and the idea is that expecting the

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.639
unexpected, or knowing that your attention
is limited and you might not notice things,

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.280
doesn't necessarily enable you to notice all
the unexpected things that are going on around

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.190
you. If you had known in advance that something
might change color, you might have picked

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.410
up on the curtain, but then you might not
have noticed the gorilla. So, there's no,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:41.810
the trick to this is deeper than just something
you don't notice. [pause] In psychology jargon,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.430
this phenomenon is known as "inattentional
blindness" now and this is a term that was

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.520
popularized by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock in
their book of the same name. And the idea

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.800
is that when we're not paying attention to
something, it can be as though we're actually

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.590
blind to it. It's as though the thing isn't
there or as though we don't see it at all.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.910
It's not as though we should have catch a
faint glimpse of it, but not a really good

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.930
perception of it. When people are told afterwards
that there was a gorilla walking across in

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.880
our original video that they didn't see, they
don't suddenly say, "Oh, yeah. There was a

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.471
gorilla, but I just forgot to mention it to
you." Instead, they say, "No way. There was

00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:16.650
no gorilla there." Or, in the original experiment
where we had video tapes, they said, "Well,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.460
show me the tape again," and we would rewind
it and play it again and they'd say, "Well,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.030
that wasn't there in the first place. Maybe
you switched the tapes on me or used some

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.470
kind of sleight of hand or something like
that." On the other hand, people who see the

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.320
gorilla, or probably the people who saw the
color change or the person walk away this

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.839
time, think it's very clear and obvious and
they are surprised that other people missed

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:39.249
it. So, as we thought about this experiment
more and more, we realized that it wasn't

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:43.099
just telling us something about inattentional
blindness, it wasn't just a dramatic demonstration

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.629
of inattentional blindness and incidentally,
just to illustrate how dramatic a demonstration

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:51.809
this is, other researchers later ran this
experiment using an eye tracking device, which

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:55.329
records exactly where subjects are looking
at all times and found that some subjects

00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:59.509
who missed the gorilla in the original video
had actually looked right at it for up to

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:03.230
a full second and still missed it. So, it's
not just that their eyes happened to be pushed,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.429
pointing the wrong way. There's actually some
kind of cognitive blindness to this thing.

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:11.380
And that's really interesting, but the more
we thought about it, the more we thought there

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.350
was something even more surprising about it.
And that was, in fact, the surprise that people

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.360
have about the results of this experiment.
It really conflicts with some deep belief

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.569
we have about how our minds work. Something
about our experience tells us that we really

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:27.939
should be noticing all the important things
that happen, especially if they're right in

00:09:27.939 --> 00:09:32.040
front of our eyes and they last for a full
nine seconds, like our original gorilla thumping

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.390
event did. And this belief that we're noticing
and paying attention to much more of the world

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:44.050
around us then we really are, is what we've
called the illusion of attention. The illusion

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.239
is that we're noticing and paying attention
to far more than we actually are. Now, we

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:54.499
call this an illusion deliberately. It's in
some ways by analogy to visual illusions.

00:09:54.499 --> 00:09:58.920
So, this is a famous visual illusion. Look
at these two tables and raise your hand if

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.860
you think the table on the left is longer
than the table on the right. OK, so I'm gonna

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.089
raise my hand, too, because to me, the one
on the left definitely looks longer than the

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:12.589
one on the right. Now, if I had a nice, clever
animation, I could rotate that table on the

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:16.239
left and overlay it on the table on the right
and you would see that they are the exact

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:20.899
same dimensions in all respects. And it is
a pure illusion that the one on the left looks

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:27.250
long and narrow and the one on the right looks
wide. It has to do with perspective and the

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.499
way our perceptual system actually wants to
experience a three-dimensional world as opposed

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:36.079
to something projected on a two-dimensional
screen. But no amount of, no amount of knowing

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:39.170
what I just told you is gonna make it look
any different; it still looks longer. It's

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.709
an illusion, it's built in to the way our
perceptual systems work and we would argue

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:47.190
that illusions like the illusion of attention
are built in to the way we think about our

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.209
own minds. I see someone there going like
this and trying to like, imagine it. If I

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:54.139
had a stick up there I could prove it to you.
I could stretch a stick out and then move

00:10:54.139 --> 00:11:00.839
it around. That's what I do when I teach this
to students. Trust me on this one. It's really

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:05.230
built in to the structure of how we understand
our own minds. I see someone who's still doing

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.230
it; they still don't believe me.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.999
[laughter]

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:14.920
Trust me, please. I'm up here giving a talk.
You're supposed to trust me. So, so, this

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.059
illusion of attention, the more we thought
about it, we realized was actually an example

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:26.249
of a more general phenomenon about the mind
and we call this the idea of every day illusions.

00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:30.519
So, I'm gonna get a couple of definitions
out on the screen now for what I'm going to

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:34.999
be talking about for the rest of the time
today. Every day illusions are intuitive,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:40.029
commonsense beliefs that we all have about
how our own minds work that are systematically

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:48.129
wrong, not easy to overcome, and can get us
into big trouble if we aren't aware of them.

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:51.329
Now, one way the illusion of attention can
get us into big trouble is the way that it

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:55.759
causes us to talk on our cell phones while
we're driving. The illusion causes us to talk

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:59.620
on our cell phones while we're driving because
it convinces us that we're able to see and

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.129
notice everything we need to do while we're
driving just as well when we're talking on

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:08.879
a phone as when we're not talking on a phone.
The illusion of attention tells us that because

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:12.519
we have this rich perceptual experience, we
see the road in front of us. It's not like

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:15.889
we're looking someplace else to talk on the
phone. We see the road in front of us; we're

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:18.720
getting the same visual input hitting our
retinas and going into our visual systems

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.929
and so on, that we must be noticing and perceiving
all the important stuff out there. And that's

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:26.819
actually not true. When you're talking on
the cell phone, you're depleting a central

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:32.089
resource of attention that actually applies
to all perceptual modalities and to thinking

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:35.220
in general, not just vision. So, talking on
the phone, even though that's an auditory

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.290
language task, decreases your ability to notice
unexpected things. And it's noticing unexpected

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.089
things which is really what keeps you out
of most accidents on the road. You know when

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:48.259
someone cuts you off or when someone goes
into the walkway or when you're in somebody's

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:52.869
blind spot and so on. If we didn't have this
illusion, if we really understood how limited

00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:56.290
our perceptual inattention systems would be,
we probably wouldn't do things like talk on

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.379
cell phones. And of course, incidentally,
by the way, it's not holding the phone that's

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.009
the problem, it's not the number of hands
you have driving, it's the amount of your

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:06.480
mind you have paying attention to the task
of driving. So, hands free phones don't really

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.730
solve the problem, either. Now notice that
I said that these illusions are intuitive

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:17.109
beliefs. So, by intuition, I mean a kind of
rapid thinking that we aren't even aware we're

00:13:17.109 --> 00:13:21.230
doing most of the time. Intuition is what
we're using when we make a quick judgment

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.720
or decision without thinking about it, which
is to say that intuition comprises most of

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.579
the thinking we do in our lives. Now I realize
that there are other definitions of intuition.

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:32.540
Some people think of intuition as some kind
of spiritual phenomenon where you just sort

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.350
of come into contact with the truth or something
like that, through some ineffable process.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.439
That's not really what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about rapid thinking and decisions

00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:44.459
made without reflection. So when we pick up
the cell phone and talk while we're driving,

00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:47.800
we're doing that because of an intuition that
tells us that we're not driving any worse.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.970
We haven't really stopped to analyze the problem
very carefully or think about research on

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.549
attention and so on, we just go with it. We
don't feel like we're driving any worse when

00:13:56.549 --> 00:14:00.230
we're talking on the phone. So that's, those
are every day illusions and in our book, we

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.749
talk about six every day illusions. I'm gonna
talk about the rest of them for the rest of

00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:08.480
this talk and as well as that, I'm gonna talk
about intuition a little bit. Here's another

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.500
example of an everyday illusion. This one
is called the illusion of memory. The illusion

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.509
of memory is the idea that our memories are
more complete, detailed, accurate, permanent

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:25.619
and objective than they really are. Those
qualities detail, accuracy, permanence, objectivity

00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:30.470
and completeness are qualities that we act
as though our memories have in much greater

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.189
abundance than they really do. Now of course,
you may say, "Yeah, I don't remember what

00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:37.509
I had for breakfast three weeks ago." I'm
not talking about that kind of memory failure.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:42.360
I'm talking about something much larger than
that. For example, you're gonna see now a

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.819
video of an experiment done by Dan Simons,
my co-author of the book, and his colleague,

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:51.290
Dan Levin, when they were grad students at
Cornell. This is an experiment where an experimenter

00:14:51.290 --> 00:15:00.279
would approach a pedestrian on a courtyard
on a quad. So here is the subject in this

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:03.299
experiment and here's the experimenter and
the experimenter simply, without telling him

00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:07.919
anything about the fact that he's in an experiment,
says, "Please give me directions to the gym."

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:11.749
And there's not gonna be any audio here, but
it doesn't matter. You can see what, you can

00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:18.029
see what happens next. So as he's giving directions,
two other people carrying a door have rudely

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:22.179
cut between the experimenter and the subject
and one of the people carrying the door switch

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:24.470
places with the original experimenter.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.470
[laughter]

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:30.489
Now the guy left talking to the subject is
Dan Simons, himself, and you'll see shortly

00:15:30.489 --> 00:15:34.839
that the subject actually, having looked earlier
directly at the first experimenter, now looks

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:42.229
directly at Dan for quite a while as he's
completing his instructions. And Dan now says,

00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:45.439
"Oh, by the way, you were just a subject in
a psychology experiment and let me explain

00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:49.689
to you what's going on. Did you notice that
I'm a different person than the one you were

00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:50.689
talking about earlier?"

00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:53.429
[laughter]

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:57.000
And, surprisingly in this experiment, the
response of about half of the participants

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.109
is, "No, I have no idea that you're a different
person." Some people notice it, some people

00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:07.229
don't. And it's not just, this man, this is
an older gentleman, but it's not a function

00:16:07.229 --> 00:16:11.259
of how old you are. Likewise, the ability
to notice the gorilla is not a function of

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:14.769
how old or young you are or how well-educated
you are, or whether you're intelligent or

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:18.579
stupid, or what your personality type is.
As far as we've been able to tell and other

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:22.910
research has been able to tell, these things
are built in features that are universal to

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.939
the human mind. Now we haven't gone into all
the countries of the world and tested these

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:30.359
things out, but as far as we can tell, at
least within our country and other places

00:16:30.359 --> 00:16:33.499
where this has been studied, it's not some
kind of special personality trait or some

00:16:33.499 --> 00:16:38.249
kind of reflection on the strength of your
mental abilities. It's a general property

00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:44.610
of the human mind. In this case, the phenomenon
is known as change blindness. So, we can be

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.619
blind to significant changes in our visual
world if our attention is not called to those

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:54.499
changes while they're happening. So, if right
now, I blinked out of existence and was instantly

00:16:54.499 --> 00:16:58.329
reproduced, replaced by a different person,
you guys would all notice, but that's only

00:16:58.329 --> 00:17:02.470
because you would have seen the change. If
something distracted you, like a big billboard

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:08.339
came in front and I was replaced by someone
else, maybe someone else who is also a male

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.360
about 40 years old or something like that,
you might not notice the difference. Probably

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.309
most of you would, but some of you might not.
It's a surprising finding. You can't change

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:19.309
a man into a woman it turns out or a woman
into a man and in this way and have people

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:23.559
miss that. You typically can't change much
older people into much younger people, or

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:29.370
change say, a construction worker into a policeman
or a professor into a mailman, or something

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:34.190
like that. But that's about, that's about
it. What's going on here? Well, our memories,

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.660
it seems, are encoding much less detail about
the world around us or if they're encoding

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.419
it, they're dumping it very quickly and not
maintaining it for very long and that's not

00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:46.440
the way we think our memories work. So this
is the illusion of memory; the idea that our

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.470
memories are more complete and permanent and
accurate than they really are. If you turn

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.341
it around and think about it a little bit,
why would we have this illusion of memory?

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:59.759
Or, put another way, why would our memory
systems be so limited? Some people say, "Well,

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:03.240
is that a defect? Like, how come we don't
save all that information?" And I could turn

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.309
it around and say, "Well, why would you want
to save all that information? Your brain would

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:09.259
get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,
accumulating all those details all your life

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:12.470
and if you built a big brain, in order to
be able to do that you'd never get out of

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.169
your mother during the process of being born."
There's a severe constraint on the size of

00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:20.940
the brain and you just can't go on adding
functions willy nilly to it or else the species

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.799
won't continue on. And perhaps remembering
all the details we think we're remembering

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:29.320
is not really a very useful mental function
to have. Maybe remembering the kind of person

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.380
we're talking to and whether they're male
or female and simple categories is most of

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:41.351
what we, is most of what we really need. OK,
so let me show you one more example of this

00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:46.419
change blindness phenomenon. I'm gonna show
you this example for two reasons. One, there's

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:53.610
a Google employee pictured in it. I don't
think he's here today, though. And two, when

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.090
we wanted to do more studies of this kind,
when Dan came to Harvard-- this initial study

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.220
was done at Cornell-- when Dan came to Harvard
and he started working with me, we wanted

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.750
to do more of this kind of thing, but the
Human Subjects Review Committee at Harvard

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.120
had a somewhat different view of this than
at Cornell and they said, "Well, you really

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.039
can't just go up to people on the street and
start experimenting with them without getting

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:14.710
their consent." And we said things like, "Well,
but people get approached for directions all

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.130
the time in Harvard Square. What's the big
deal? This kind of thing happens to people

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.220
all the time." And they said, "Well, no, you
really ought to get consent first." So we

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.299
came up with a different experimental setting
that enables, that enables us to get consent.

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:31.700
And here's an illustration of it from a program
that the BBC did several years ago. I've turned

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:38.440
off the sound so you won't be hearing the
narration, but I'll narrate it a little bit.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.560
Now, what you're gonna see is first you're
going to see the two people and the subject.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.440
We changed one of them into the other. You
might recognize the first guy, if any of you

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.350
know him here. Notice they're wearing different
color shirts and they have different faces,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:59.490
different hairstyles. We set up a booth, set
up a counter in the Psychology Building and

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.380
put an "Experiment Here" sign and recruited
subjects in the basement and said, in the

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.001
lobby and said, "Why don't you go up and participate
in an experiment?" And when they came up out

00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.160
of the elevator and they approached the counter,
they saw the first guy standing behind it.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.610
And he said, "Here. Fill out this consent
form first and then the experiment will begin."

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.120
This is Dan, by the way, explaining this.
So, they fill out the consent form. Sometimes,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.779
they would read it, but usually they would
just sign it, hand it back, and now this would

00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:22.779
happen.

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:25.149
[laughter]

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:28.980
The first guy would duck down and the second
guy would come up and hand them a form and

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.240
say, "Go down to that room, go down the hall
to that room and you'll meet someone there

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.841
who will tell you about the rest of the experiment."

00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:36.010
[laughter]

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.930
Now, crucially, what the consent form had
said was, "In this study, you're going to

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.100
be exposed, you're going to be exposed to
an event and you'll be asked questions about

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.200
it." But it didn't say when you're going to
be exposed to the event. So as soon as they

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.930
hand that consent form back with their signature,
the event starts right then.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:50.930
[laughter]

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.389
And there, early in that point, not in the
mindset of, "I gotta be on guard. The psychologists

00:20:55.389 --> 00:21:00.350
are gonna trick me now." And the rest of this
video will just show more examples of this.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.270
So, in this case once again, a significant
percentage of people, when asked a few seconds

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.409
later, "Well, did you notice that the guy
who came back up from behind the counter was

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:11.950
a different guy than the one who went down?"
they said, "No, I had no idea." And one of

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.559
the ones you may see here, if I let the video
run on long enough, was an undergraduate at

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:21.370
Harvard--oh, here she is--this is Elisabeth
Kensinger who's now a very excellent, important

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:26.559
professor at BU studying memory, and she did
not notice the change. It turns out being

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:29.790
a professor who studies memory does not really
enable you to notice all these, all these

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.029
changes in the world--

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:32.029
[laughter]

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:37.300
in the world around you. We have a story in
the book about how a friend of ours told at

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.150
a party that Dan and I were both at, an entire
story that happened to me and not to him,

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.779
but pretending as though it was his own story
and he had completely forgotten the source

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:48.799
of that memory and thought he had experienced
himself the joy of sitting down next to Patrick

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.159
Stewart at dinner.

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:51.350
[laughter]

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.580
That happened to me, not to him.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.580
[laughter]

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.789
And he studied, and he studies false memory,
incidentally.

00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:57.720
[laughter]

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.809
So, well the video continues with more and
more of this. So, I've shown you two examples

00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:06.250
of every day illusions that can have a significant
effect on how we perceive and understand the

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:11.560
world in our daily lives. I think there are
a lot of deeper applications of this kind

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.429
of thing beyond just these visual examples
we've shown you. Inattentional blindness or

00:22:15.429 --> 00:22:19.230
the illusion of attention can apply to information
in general and the information that we think

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.650
we're paying attention to and using when we
make decisions, and change blindness and the

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.710
illusion of memory can apply in many different
circumstances. I mean, for one thing, I'm

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.960
not really here to provide advice on how to
live your life, but if you start fighting

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.929
with your husband or wife or boyfriend or
girlfriend or whoever about whose memory for

00:22:35.929 --> 00:22:40.080
what happened a month ago is exactly right
and whose is wrong, you should just stop because

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.240
the chances are high that neither of you remembers
exactly what was said a month ago and you're

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.590
wasting your time and just getting mad at
each other without ever coming to any resolution.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.590
[laughter]

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.960
On the other hand, if you're clever you might
consult your sent mail folder or your saved

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.190
messages folder or your calendar, because
it turns out nowadays we do leave a lot of

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.460
electronic trails that can help us reconstruct
the past that we didn't have before. And you

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.630
guys may know of even better tools to reconstruct
what you've been doing, your browser history

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.640
and so on. Sometimes you can use that to,
to figure out what's going on. OK, so enough

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.440
of this. It goes on and on with more people.
Some of them actually notice. I think this

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.909
person actually notices what's going on.

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:14.909
[laughter]

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:15.909
Yeah, so.

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:19.080
[laughter]

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.419
Some, some people do notice. By the way, I
don't know if any of you, if you noticed,

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:26.271
but Dan's wearing a different shirt than he
was at the beginning of this, of this video.

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:29.590
[laughter]

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.351
Once again, trust me on that one. OK, so now
I've showed you some of these illusions and

00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:37.529
now I'm gonna switch gears to something different.
As Monty Python used to say, "And now for

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:42.700
something completely different." Gonna take
a little bit of a detour now into a poetry,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.299
a poetry reading. It'll be very short.

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:47.809
[reads]

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:51.889
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."

00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:56.580
You might recognize this. This is one of the
most famous lines in all of English language

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.171
poetry. It's by Elizabeth Barrett Browning
from her work, "Sonnets from the Portuguese".

00:24:02.171 --> 00:24:06.500
I think this was Sonnet number 43 out of 44.
And of course it goes on to enumerate various

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.250
different ways. Now, Elizabeth Barrett Browning
wrote these lines and the rest of it during

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:18.799
her courtship with Robert Browning. And there
they are. This is Elizabeth and that's Robert.

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:24.320
They make a really fine couple, I think, especially
by the standards of the 1850s. Remarkably

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:31.421
modern hairstyles. Now this, this book, even
though it came out in 1850, already by the

00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:39.070
late 19th Century, it was very prized and
recognized as an important work. And in 1885,

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:45.460
a British book dealer and collector named
Thomas J. Wise, pictured here, was offered

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:52.010
for sale by another collector that he ran
into, a privately printed edition of the Sonnets

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.080
from the Portuguese, that the Brownings had
printed, or that Elizabeth Barrett Browning

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.840
had printed a few years earlier, before the
actual first known printing in the 1850 book.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.629
And he paid ten pounds for this and got some
of his collector friends to also buy copies.

00:25:06.629 --> 00:25:10.860
And he actually snapped up several copies
and started then selling them to other dealers

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:17.640
and collectors and libraries and other institutions
around the world. And after that, he began

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.210
discovering other similar works. For example,
something by, something by Tennyson. This

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:30.330
volume, this is actually the volume that Wise
discovered from 1887 and this was, once again,

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.700
a privately printed edition of something that
came out later in the first known edition.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.059
So what Wise was discovering was all these
items which fit pretty well into the body

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:44.840
of an author's known work. It wasn't a completely
new work, but it was a new edition. And he

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.999
sold these around the world to collectors,
libraries, universities, and so on and did

00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:56.450
this for many, for many decades. He became
known as Great Britain's best bibliographer

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:05.610
and book collector later in his life. Unfortunately
for Wise, in the 1930s, two younger British

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:12.309
book dealers conducted an investigation of
some of these pamphlets and discovered through

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:16.420
a variety of techniques that many of them
were fraudulent. That is, Wise had printed

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:22.409
them up himself, along with some conspirators
and was passing them off as originals. The

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:27.370
techniques these collectors, these dealers,
used to discover the fraud were of the deductive

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:32.409
logic varieties. So for example, on this one
right here, they noticed that these ornaments

00:26:32.409 --> 00:26:37.230
that were used to decorate the cover had actually
not been designed until about 15 years after

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.430
the date on the cover of the pamphlet. In
the case of the "Sonnets of the Portuguese",

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.809
they put the paper under a microscope and
detected that it was made of wood pulp and

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:50.080
they knew that wood pulp was not actually
used to make paper in Great Britain until

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.679
the 1870s, so it could not have been printed
in that form in the 1840s. And they also identified

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:58.470
numerous other ways that the printings were
inconsistent with everything else that was

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.850
known fact about how books were made at the
time and these authors' works and so on. They

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.960
published their indictment, I mean a very
long book, explaining without really coming

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.409
right out and saying it, that Wise had committed
a fraud. Now, why did I tell you this whole

00:27:10.409 --> 00:27:16.059
long, this whole long story? Well, here's
a case where scientific analysis and logical

00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:20.639
deduction really proved that Wise had been
committing forgery for quite a long period

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:27.749
of time. He denied it, of course, but everyone
believes that he did. This story of detecting

00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:34.340
forgeries using scientific analysis and the
contrast between that and the intuitive decisions

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.980
that were made by all the collectors and dealers
and libraries who saw this stuff and said,

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.389
"Well, this book looks good. This looks like
it makes sense. Superficially, it looks like

00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:45.980
something we should add to our collection."
This may remind you of a story that you've

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.249
heard about if you read Malcolm Gladwell's
book "Blink", which is subtitled "The Power

00:27:50.249 --> 00:27:55.629
of Thinking without Thinking". Now in Gladwell's
book, he begins by telling the story of a

00:27:55.629 --> 00:28:02.440
ancient Greek statue, known as a Kouros, and
here's the, and this is an example I'm gonna,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:10.279
what I'm gonna tell you is the myth of intuition.
Here's the statue. Now, this statue was discovered

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:15.760
and it was in the possession of a collector
from Switzerland who offered to sell it to

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.769
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for ten million
dollars. And the Getty Museum commissioned

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:23.310
some scientific tests which suggested that
the marble the statue was made of was, in

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.540
fact, from ancient Greece, from the proper
time period and place as it would have been

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:31.361
if this were an authentic statue. So the Getty
forked over the ten million dollars and then

00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:36.169
later they had some other collectors and art
historians and art experts look at the statue

00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:41.539
and as Gladwell recounts in his book, they
said things like, "Well I hope you didn't

00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:48.820
pay for this yet," or they said they felt
a revulsion or it left them feeling cold or

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.580
it just didn't look right. So they could tell
by looking at it that there was something

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.179
wrong with it that the scientific analysis
of the material in the statue couldn't, couldn't

00:28:57.179 --> 00:29:02.049
tell. And Gladwell presents this as the triumph
of intuition. They were able to intuitively,

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:06.179
within a second or two, know that this was
wrong, know that it was a forgery, whereas

00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:11.700
the scientific experts had not been able to
prove that and in fact, were convinced otherwise.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.139
Gladwell uses this to open his case in this
book for the power of intuition, or as he

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:23.110
calls it, rapid cognition. Now incidentally,
the Getty Museum and various experts are not

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.960
yet in full consensus about whether this statue
is a forgery. For example, the caption in

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.580
their own catalog says, "About 530 B.C, or
modern forgery."

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580
[laughter]

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.350
So, it's not completely, it's not completely
agreed yet that this is a forgery, but even,

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.249
but even if it is, what are we to make of
these two contrasting examples, one in which

00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:45.629
intuition detected a fraud that scientific
analysis didn't and the one that I presented

00:29:45.629 --> 00:29:51.000
of Thomas J. Wise, where intuition, intuitive
thinking wound up acquiring and spending a

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.910
lot of money on these things for collections
that turned out to be wasted money and only

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:59.521
really careful logical deduction and scientific
analysis proved him to be a forger? I think,

00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:03.639
actually, that the Thomas J. Wise case is
probably much more representative of the relationship

00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:08.179
between intuition and logical analysis in
the case of art forgeries. I will bet you

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:13.080
that many forgers go to their graves having
fooled everyone and never get detected. Usually,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.999
it's a sort of intuitive thinking that accepts
these things as accurate and only scientific

00:30:18.999 --> 00:30:22.950
analysis, or some kind of logical analysis
that proves them wrong. For example, the Hitler

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.890
Diaries were accepted as genuine and made
public in Germany, until it turned out that

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.669
the paper they were written on was made after
World War II. So, they could only have been

00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:34.179
authentic if Hitler was down there in Brazil
writing them out or something like that, after

00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:40.480
World War II was over, and sending them back.
Now, what we call the myth of intuition is

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.429
this idea that intuition has special powers
as a mode of thinking to figure things out

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:52.909
that rational analysis and other forms of
thinking cannot do. At this point, now statues,

00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:56.029
even a ten million dollar statue, well it's
just statues, what's the big deal if people

00:30:56.029 --> 00:31:01.519
think this way? Its fast, it's efficient,
doesn't cause too much damage, except to museums

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:06.149
and art collectors and they're not really
all that sympathetic. Who are the real victims

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:11.899
here? Well, at this point, this is where this
man comes into our story. In case you don't

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:17.360
recognize him, this is Bernard Madoff, the
biggest and most famous Ponzi schemer in world

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.340
financial history. Now what does Bernard Madoff
have to do with the myth of intuition? Well,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.860
one thing that's not realized often about
Madoff is the real story of why he was not

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:35.610
caught before he wound up engaging in 50 billion
dollars worth of fraud and looting lots of

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:41.879
institutions and individuals out of all of
their funds? The whistle, the Inspector General

00:31:41.879 --> 00:31:45.730
of the Securities and Exchange Commission
did an exhaustive report on this and documented

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.669
the fact that the SEC investigated Madoff
many times over the years because they had

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:53.379
received tips from people. They had their
suspicions that something was wrong. And here

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:58.759
he explains why they did not actually catch
Madoff. This is a quote from the Inspector

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:03.830
General of the SEC. He wrote, "In one of the
examinations that the SEC conducted, they

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.619
asked Madoff how he was able to achieve these
returns. Madoff's returns were extraordinary

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:11.700
and always consistent. He never had a down
period, no matter how bad the market. And

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.279
they asked him, "How are you able to do this?"
Bernie Madoff said to them that he had a 'gut

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:18.809
feel' of how to time the market. They asked
him, what is the basis for his gut feel. And

00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:21.940
he said it was his observations of the trading
room. He said he could actually sit on the

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.809
trading room floor and 'feel the market' and
know exactly when to buy and exactly when

00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:28.980
to sell. And Madoff always bought at the right
price, and always sold at the right price,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.629
day after day, year after year. Inexplicably,
the SEC just accepted these answers and went

00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:41.610
on." Now, I think the most important word
in this whole passage is one that they didn't

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.960
underline, and that is the word "inexplicably."
This behavior's only inexplicable if you forget

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.929
about the fact that people actually believe
that it is possible to use one's intuition,

00:32:50.929 --> 00:32:55.179
or gut feels, to time the market and make
all kinds of other significant decisions in

00:32:55.179 --> 00:33:01.869
ways that, in ways that rational analysis,
or logic, or other kinds of methods, thinking

00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:06.460
can't match. So, it's only inexplicable if
you don't realize that that myth is out there

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.299
and that we think about intuition that way
a lot of the time. Now, this raises another

00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:18.049
question, well how is, what else contributed
to Bernie Madoff's success? I think it's interesting

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:22.789
and it plays in to one of our other, one of
our other illusions. The whistle blower in

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:29.379
the Madoff case, Harry Markopolos, wrote extensively
about this. And he provides some interesting

00:33:29.379 --> 00:33:34.769
quotes to explain what was going on in people's
minds when they encountered Bernard Madoff.

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:38.600
Well, Simona Suh, who was an investigator
in the SECs New York office, said that Madoff

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.100
[quote] "didn't fit the profile of a Ponzi
schemer in the world that we knew then." Now

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.090
what did she mean by this? Well, as Markopolos
tells us, 'There's a reason why Madoff was

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.980
able to pull off the largest financial crime
in history. Madoff was so smooth, so convincing

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.440
that even an experienced journalist like Mike
Ocrant, (who had uncovered other Ponzi schemes,)

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.010
came away from that interview doubting what
he knew to be true.' So, Ocrant had actually

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.630
investigated Madoff, determined that he was
a Ponzi schemer, and went to confront him

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.549
with this information and get his side of
the story, and at the end of the interview,

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:12.329
he wasn't even sure anymore himself. Ocrant,
himself, was the editor of an industry publication

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:16.419
for hedge funds said [quote] "He never complained;
he was responsive to every question. He did

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:23.599
it without hesitation. There wasn't even a
hint of guilt or shame or remorse." So, sometimes

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:29.349
the way criminals are able to pull off their
crimes is by exploiting what we call in the

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:36.579
book, the illusion of confidence. Interestingly,
the word "con man" has the same root as confidence.

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:42.500
The illusion of confidence has two aspects.
One of them is that we tend to interpret another

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:48.980
person's confidence, their smoothness, their
quick answers, their strong presentations

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:55.500
an indication of honesty, accuracy, truthfulness,
skill, competence, good memory, whatever it

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.390
is they're trying to convince us of, the more
confident they are, the more we believe them.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.109
Now, it's of course perhaps true that people
who are right should be more confident, but

00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:10.750
we over interpret that connection; we take
it for more than it actually is. Now, this

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.049
is our third every day illusion after attention
and memory. Now we're at the illusion of confidence.

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:21.170
Madoff is a little bit unusual as a criminal.
And he's like the James Bond master villain,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.770
like in his secret hideout with all the fancy
gadgets and so on. This time it was at the

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.619
top of a skyscraper in New York, not in some
Caribbean island, but he's really not typical

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:33.680
of criminals. Most criminals are not as good
as Madoff; they don't get away with 50 billion

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.880
dollar schemes for that long. Most criminals
are actually fairly incompetent. So now, to

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.450
illustrate this point, I would like to ask
the person who received an envelope from me

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:51.050
earlier to please stand up now. I handed out
an envelope earlier to someone. OK. So can

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:56.880
you open that envelope and show us what's
inside? What is that?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.119
&gt;&gt;audience #5: I'm assuming a fake bill for
one million dollars.

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:01.190
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: It's a one million dollar
bill, correct?

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.190
[audience #5 laughs]

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.190
OK, so what's your name, by the way?

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.190
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Jessica.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.020
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Jessica. OK, so Jessica,
what do you think would happen if you went

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:12.200
out to the supermarket and tried to use that
one million dollar bill to pay for your next

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200
batch of groceries?

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.921
&gt;&gt;audience #5: They would probably laugh at
me.

00:36:15.921 --> 00:36:17.690
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: They would probably laugh
at you and they probably wouldn't cash it

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:18.690
for you, right?

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.690
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Right.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:26.560
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: OK. So, Jessica is much smarter,
it turns out, than this man, a man who flew

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.540
into a rage at the Giant Eagle supermarket
when employees refused to cash a million-dollar

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.540
bill.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540
[laughter]

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.510
This was an Associated Press story from Pittsburgh.
Now, it's interesting that a guy went in to

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.530
a supermarket and tried to cash a million-dollar
bill. What's more interesting is that he flew

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.350
into a rage when they refused to do this,
suggesting that perhaps he thought that they

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.950
should, or they would negotiate his million-dollar
bill. I also wonder where he got the million

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:55.031
dollar bill, but in any case. Maybe it was
handed out at a talk he went to.

00:36:55.031 --> 00:36:58.190
[laughter]

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:03.560
What this illustrates is a mismatch between
this guy's assessment of his own abilities

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.121
and his actual ability. He thinks he's better
at crime than he really is if he thinks he

00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:12.490
can get away with this, is this one. According
to Inspector Gareth Woods of the Cheshire

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:16.180
Police, "there are some pretty stupid criminals
around, but to leave your own name at the

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:21.770
scene of the crime takes the biscuit." Now,
the crime was graffiti and it was committed

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:28.190
by someone named Peter Addison, who wrote,
"Peter Addison was here" on a wall. Another

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.640
stupid criminal. And then finally, this man.
Lieutenant Terry Hastings said, "I just don't

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.420
know why he didn't see a uniformed police
officer standing basically right in front

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.569
of him. My guess is he's just not the brightest
of people." Now, what he's referring to is

00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:45.569
this gentleman right here, who attempted to
rob a bank where there was a police officer

00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:49.299
sitting in the lobby of the bank the entire
time. If you can find this video online, by

00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:53.260
the way, it's actually very funny. The police
officer tries to arrest him, but he resists

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.801
and they wind up wrestling in the bank and
running around the bank chasing each other

00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:59.390
for quite a while. It's very entertaining
surveillance camera footage.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.049
[laughter]

00:38:02.049 --> 00:38:05.110
The guy had come in to the bank and cased
it for a couple of minutes before he actually

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.300
went up to the teller and tried to rob it
and that whole time the video shows the guy

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.049
sitting right there behind the desk, waiting
to catch him. Now, Lieutenant Terry Hastings

00:38:14.049 --> 00:38:17.360
is suffering a little bit from the illusion
of attention because as we've all seen, it

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.020
is possible to walk around some place and
not notice something important that's happening

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.890
in front of you; that's the illusion of attention.
Nonetheless, all these examples illustrate

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:33.930
criminals who seem to think that they're better
at crime than they really are. Now, [pause]

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.630
this illustrates the second aspect of the
illusion of confidence, which is that we tend

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:43.640
to overrate our own abilities in various areas.
We're overconfident in our own skills. Let

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.060
me try a little test on you to see how overconfident
you are in your own skills. I have a question

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.650
that I got that I adapted from a study by
Justin Kruger and David Dunning, two very

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:59.809
clever social psychologists. For each one
of you, I'd like you to think what percent

00:38:59.809 --> 00:39:04.290
of Google employees have a worse sense of
humor than your own? Now, I know you're all

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.110
here at my talk, so you're probably some of
the funnier people here, but try to be honest

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.710
with yourself and think about what percentage
of Google employees have a worse sense of

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.170
humor than your own. Just get a number in
your head, what that percentage might be.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:20.750
And now you've got that percentage, let's
test your own sense of humor and see how funny

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.910
you really are. I'm gonna give you two jokes
and would like you to tell me which one is

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.910
funnier.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.849
[laughter]

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:33.690
Here's joke one. Question: What is as big
as a man, but weighs nothing? Answer: His

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.599
shadow. Joke two. I heard someone laugh.

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:40.470
[laughter]

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:44.150
Joke two. If a kid asks where rain comes from,
I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.910
crying." And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is "probably

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.130
because of something you did."

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.160
[laughter]

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.549
Now, by actual laughter, it seems like most
of you think joke two is funnier than joke

00:39:55.549 --> 00:40:00.619
one and you should pat yourselves on the back
because in fact, when Kruger and Dunning presented

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:04.119
these two jokes, as well as a number of other
jokes to a panel of professional comedians,

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:07.799
the professional comedians rated joke two
as the funniest out of the entire group and

00:40:07.799 --> 00:40:13.730
joke one as the least funny out of the entire
group. And by using these ratings by professional

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.859
comedians, and then giving all these same
jokes to students in their experiment, they

00:40:16.859 --> 00:40:22.280
were able to figure out how well student ratings
of funniness of jokes agreed with professional

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.119
comedian ratings of funniness of jokes. And
they used those correspondences between the

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:31.109
students and the comedians as a more or less
objective measure of how good the student's

00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:34.039
sense of humor was. Now, of course it's really
how well their sense of humor matches that

00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:37.859
of a professional comedian, but a professional
comedian is paid to understand what's funny

00:40:37.859 --> 00:40:41.270
and to implement that in their own, in their
own act. So, it's not really as bad a test

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:48.819
as you might think. So they compared how funny
people actually were with how funny they thought

00:40:48.819 --> 00:40:56.730
they were. And here's what they found. The
straight diagonal line just indicates the

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.599
actual test score on this humor test, so those
who were in the bottom quartile, by definition,

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:05.740
scored 12 and a half percent in this test.
And those who were in the second quartile,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.030
by definition, 37 and a half percent and so
on if you just divide them into quartiles.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:14.480
But notice that the perceived ability, that
is, what percentage of people who they thought

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.950
were less funny then they were, is actually
above 50 for all of these groups. And the

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:24.130
largest difference between perceived funniness
and actual funniness is found in those who

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.130
were the least funny.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.130
[laughter]

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:30.569
So, this was dubbed by Kruger and Dunning,
the unskilled and unaware of it phenomenon.

00:41:30.569 --> 00:41:34.420
That those who were least skilled at something
are least aware of their actual skill level,

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.039
or exhibit the greatest discrepancy between
how good they think they are and how good

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:43.410
they really are. Now, of course once again
it's just like the statues before and so on.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.460
This is sense of humor and sense of humor
 -- maybe it's not that important, although

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.901
I do have to say that it is right up there
in all the personal ads. You always see sense

00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:54.130
of humor in all the dating sites and so on,
it's number one. And incidentally, I just

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:58.940
heard of some recent research that is not
published yet, so I don't wanna talk about

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.170
it too much, but someone said that sense of
humor is actually one of the best predictors

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.530
of how good you are in bed, it turns out.
So, it's really more important than we think

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.530
sometimes.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.530
[laughter]

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:12.210
Nonetheless, it is a little bit; it is a little
bit fanciful. Now what about something more

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.140
serious and more important, and especially
something more objective, where instead of

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.190
using these kind of tests, we really know
how good people are? Are people still overconfident

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.970
in their own abilities when they have all
the information they need to truly know how

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.750
good they are? Well, Dan Simons and I, along
with Dan Benjamin, who is now an economics

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:33.010
professor at Cornell, a few years ago, did
a study to look at this. We went to the environment

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.799
of competitive chess and we visited chess
tournaments like this one. Now, chess is an

00:42:36.799 --> 00:42:40.690
interesting arena to study because chess has
an objective statistical rating system that

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:44.420
tells you, in essence, exactly how good you
are, will tell you exactly what your probability

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.010
is at beating anyone else based on their rating
and the ratings are frequently updated, players

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.600
all know their own ratings and most of them
have a pretty good idea how the ratings are

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.160
actually calculated. So, we went to this chess
tournament and asked them two simple questions

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:01.220
of the players. One, what's your current chess
rating? And two, what should your rating be

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.840
to accurately reflect your skill?

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840
[laughter]

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:10.039
So, we got two numbers from them and we simply
subtracted them. And it turns out that, on

00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:13.890
average, players think that they are significantly
underrated, meaning they think their ratings

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:18.049
should be higher to reflect their true skill.
In fact, they think they are so underrated

00:43:18.049 --> 00:43:23.250
that their true self should beat their rated
self by a score of two to one in a match,

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:27.319
which is a really significant difference.
They think they are significantly underrated.

00:43:27.319 --> 00:43:32.000
And moreover, those at the lower end of the
rating scale, the worst chess players, think

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.170
they are more underrated then those at the
top end of the scale. So, unskilled unaware

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.570
of it is not just an artifact of something
where we don't have a good idea how good we

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.950
are. It's something that applies even when
we have objective information about our own

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.230
skills. It really shows that the illusion
of confidence is part of our self assessment

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:55.350
across the board and is resistant to data
in many ways. Now, that was the illusion of

00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:00.360
confidence, and let me move on to a related
illusion, which can be illustrated best by

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.220
an experiment by the British psychologist,
Rebecca Lawson. Again, very simple. No high-tech

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.930
experiments here today. Rebecca Lawson asked
subjects, how well do you understand how a

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.859
bicycle works? Asked them to rate on a scale
of zero to seven how well they understand

00:44:14.859 --> 00:44:19.819
how a bicycle works; zero meaning "I have
no idea"; seven meaning "I'm really very knowledgeable

00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:25.660
about how bicycles work." And then she surprised
them with the following question: Draw a bicycle,

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:33.040
being sure to show the frame, pedals, and
chain. You might think for a second how well

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:40.161
you could do this task. It's also fun to transpose
the whole situation to a toilet. How well

00:44:40.161 --> 00:44:43.630
do you understand how a toilet works, and
now draw the mechanism of a toilet. Now, you

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.010
guys, there are probably a lot of engineers
in the audience and so on, so you guys are

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.750
probably a bad audience for this thing and
you would do better than the subjects in Lawson's

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.760
study. Here's some of what they produced.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.500
[laughter]

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:59.661
These are examples from Lawson's actual paper.
Now, I hear a lot of laughter in the audience.

00:44:59.661 --> 00:45:04.030
Perhaps that is because you have noticed that
in all four cases, the chain connects the

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:09.119
two wheels to each other. And also, this is
one of my favorites here, the pedals are suspended--

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.119
[laughter]

00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:14.059
kind of like a hammock between the two, in
the frame. I don't see how you can possible

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:21.020
power the chain to turn the wheels with that
pedal. At any rate, ironically, drawing C

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.520
was actually the most experienced bicycle
rider of these four and yet, she has the chains

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.369
connected. She rode an average of once per
day. And what this shows us is that just riding

00:45:30.369 --> 00:45:34.339
a bicycle doesn't really necessarily give
us a good idea of its workings, just seeing

00:45:34.339 --> 00:45:39.650
it every day. It doesn't really tell us that
much of permanence, it seems. It really sticks

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:44.480
in our minds that we can express in an abstract
way. Probably if you set these people down

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.309
in front of a bicycle they would have a much
better idea of how the mechanism works, but

00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:52.230
they gave pretty high ratings to the answer
to her question on a zero to seven scale.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:56.511
So, their intuitive idea about how much they
knew didn't match the reality of how much

00:45:56.511 --> 00:46:00.260
knowledge they could actually produce and
use. Now, in an analogy for you guys that

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:06.010
I think is very relevant here, I know now,
thanks in part to your work, we all have access

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:09.660
to tremendous amounts of information, like
literally instantaneously. I mean, I see now,

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.690
I don't even have to finish my query before
all the information comes back at me; I get

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:17.740
it after the first three letters. Well, that
can create a powerful sense that I have more

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.590
knowledge than I really do because I can access
it so easily. It's in the world around me,

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:27.960
it's at every computer around me now, so one
consequence of that is that we-- oops, sorry

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.730
I skipped ahead a little bit-- is that we
may get an overestimate of our own knowledge

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:35.770
because knowledge that's really out in the
world, like in the bicycle or in the toilet

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:40.710
or on the Internet somewhere, we think is
in our own heads because it's easy to access

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.641
from outside of us. Now, if you thought bicycles,
which are really pretty simple were hard,

00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:50.400
what about this? Now, I don't know if you're
familiar with this particular image, I'll

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.250
read it to you. It says "Abacus 2007-AC1.
Two billion dollars synthetic CDO referencing

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:01.099
a static RMBS portfolio, selected by ACM Management,
LLC" and it has the Goldman Sachs logo up

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:07.849
in the corner. This is the famous collateralized
debt obligation that the SEC sued Goldman

00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:12.390
Sachs over earlier this year and wound up
settling the case for I believe 550 million

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:20.579
dollar payment. It was very abstract, complex
financial instruments like this that were,

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:26.380
in some ways, at the heart of the financial
crisis of the recent years and the difficulty

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.010
people had understanding these, or the belief
they had that they understood them much better

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.180
than they did may have contributed to the
difficulties that we all suffered. Retrospectively,

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.150
there was some great reporting on the financial
crisis that suggested that really, people

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.760
did not understand these things as well as
they thought they did. Now, for example, Vincent

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:48.530
Daniel, at FrontPoint Partners, a hedge fund,
told Michael Lewis that "when talking to CDO

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:52.260
salespeople, you figure out if they even know
what they're talking about, and a lot of times

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.609
they don't." And there's a lot of other testimony
that people who bought and sold and traded

00:47:56.609 --> 00:47:59.690
these instruments didn't understand them as
well as they thought they did and as a result,

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:05.339
did not understand the risks and bought too
much of this stuff that which, in turn, led

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:10.360
to too much of it being created and so on.
These are examples of what we call the illusion

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.700
of knowledge; the idea that our knowledge
and understanding of the world is deeper and

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.441
more complete than it really is. Oftentimes,
when you scratch the surface of our knowledge,

00:48:18.441 --> 00:48:22.650
it turns out that we have familiarity with
something. We know some terminology and jargon,

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:30.240
but we don't really have deep understanding.
OK. I'm gonna skip the next, skip the next

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.680
slide and go straight to our fifth illusion,
which is the illusion of cause. And this is

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.349
the idea that we understand cause and effect
better than we do. John Cassidy, writing in

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:43.329
The New Yorker, says, "It is inarguable that
Geithner's stabilization plan has proved more

00:48:43.329 --> 00:48:48.079
effective than many observers expected, this
one included." And note what he says. It's

00:48:48.079 --> 00:48:54.099
inarguable that something that the government
did in 2009 has proved effective. Now, what's

00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:58.309
the evidence we have, really, that something
the government does is effective or has any

00:48:58.309 --> 00:49:03.210
particular effect at all? Well, we know what
the conditions were in 2009, and we know what

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.690
they are today to the extent we can measure
them in each case what the financial conditions

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:11.020
are and we know that they're different and
better now than they were in 2009. But that

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:15.640
provides no proof that any one particular
action taken in 2009, no matter how well intentioned

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.740
or carefully designed, was actually the cause
of the change. Of course, we don't know if

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.809
things would have gotten better without that
action or maybe they would have gotten worse

00:49:21.809 --> 00:49:25.020
without that action. Maybe they would have
gotten even more better without that action,

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.970
or maybe what he did really was effective.
We just don't know, but we assume that when

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:33.420
something is done at time one, and then there's
a change at time two, that what was done at

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:38.480
time one was the cause. And this is the way
we reason causally throughout our lives. We

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.309
think that things that happen in sequence
happen because of cause and effect. Often,

00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:47.980
that kind of reasoning is purely an illusion
and I can't really explain this any better

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.201
really than to show you this example.

00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:53.059
[computer beeps]

00:49:53.059 --> 00:49:55.960
This really makes the point better than I
possibly can, so I'm gonna turn the talk over

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.570
to the Simpsons. OK, so if I were writing
an article about this, I could say, "Well,

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:04.380
it's inarguable that the institution of the
Bear Patrol prevented bears from invading

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.460
the town of Springfield." But all I know is
that after the Bear Patrol was started, there

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.150
were no more bears and that after I started
carrying around that rock there were no more

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:16.760
tigers and so on. This may seem almost laughable
now that I describe it to you and oftentimes,

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.420
when you see these illusions in action, they
seem at once obvious and trivial, but once

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.060
again, when you think about this this affects
huge amounts of our decision-making. Now,

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.121
we can't always run a randomized experiment
to test the effect of every different kind

00:50:28.121 --> 00:50:33.250
of policy we'd want to do, but we shouldn't
just be stalemated and stymied and not try

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.310
anything. But we should just realize what
the true strength of our evidence and our

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:41.200
reasons for our beliefs actually is. And a
lot of times, it's lower than we think and

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.289
we act as though we're much more certain of
cause and effect than we really are. Now,

00:50:46.289 --> 00:50:51.920
let me mention our final, every day illusion,
which is the illusion of potential. As was

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:59.380
mentioned in the introduction, I've studied
the Mozart Effect and the Mozart Effect is

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.039
the idea that if you listen to Mozart's music
for ten minutes or so before you take a test,

00:51:04.039 --> 00:51:08.380
like an IQ test or an SAT, you'll do better
than you would have if you just sat in silence

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:14.059
or listened to something else, like heavy
metal or whatever. And this was based on a

00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:17.250
study that came out in 1993 in the journal
Nature. And as soon as that study came out,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:21.609
well the CD music companies rushed in to produce
a Mozart [ ] makes you smarter, Train Your

00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:25.740
Brain With Mozart, Baby Mozart. The Baby Einstein
Company, which many of you may be familiar

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.529
with, especially if you're parents, was founded
around the same time to take advantage of

00:51:29.529 --> 00:51:34.730
the notion that this kind of exposure to music
and other works of genius could really have

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:40.410
a powerful effect on our minds. Now, it turns
out they don't. I looked at this later and

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:44.410
it turns out almost no other labs were able
to replicate these initial Mozart Effect findings.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:48.470
They found pretty much nothing. If there was
a small effect of listening to Mozart before

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.390
you did something, it was probably because
it put you in a better mood than just sitting

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:55.089
alone silently for ten minutes did. When you're
in a better mood, you wind up doing a little

00:51:55.089 --> 00:51:59.309
bit better on tests and other things you have
to do; nothing really all that shocking about

00:51:59.309 --> 00:52:05.099
Mozart. The illusion of potential is the belief
we all have that it's very easy to unlock

00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:09.210
our reserves of brain power and mental ability
and skill. Now, we're not saying we don't

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.750
have reserves of brain power and mental ability
and skill that we can unlock; it's just not

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.289
that easy. You have to do things like study
and practice and get educated and so on. That

00:52:17.289 --> 00:52:21.780
is how we increase our skills, not just by
listening to music for ten minutes or playing

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.990
video games that are gonna reverse our brain
age and make our minds younger and so on.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:28.430
What typically happens when you do that is
you get better at the games, but you don't

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:31.730
get much better at anything else. So, if it's
fun for you, go ahead and do it, just don't

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:37.270
believe that it's making your IQ any higher.
Now, I wanna end, I wanna sum up some of what

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:42.251
I've been talking about today by talking about
a self help phenomenon known as The Secret.

00:52:42.251 --> 00:52:47.650
I don't know how many of you are familiar
with this idea, but as the cover of the DVD

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:53.250
informs us, The Secret has travelled through
centuries to reach us. The Secret is something,

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:57.309
according to the people who've written these
books, namely in particular, Rhonda Byrne,

00:52:57.309 --> 00:53:01.940
an Australian TV producer, The Secret is the
law of attraction. It's another way of saying

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.609
the power of positive thinking. If you think
positive thoughts, positive things will come

00:53:05.609 --> 00:53:09.630
to you, but if you think negative thoughts,
negative things will come to you. And it really

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.520
is that simple; and it really works that way,
according to them. If you think about your

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.880
bills and get worried about the bills that
you're having trouble paying, you're gonna

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.710
get more bills and you're gonna have more
trouble paying them. But if you think about

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:22.190
getting checks in the mail, or funds deposited
in your bank account, it'll happen. I mean,

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:25.550
it really is that simple. You laugh, but it
really is that simple. That's an example that

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:29.470
comes right out of these books. These books
are on the bestseller list, millions of copies

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:36.750
sold, and so on. Why do people believe this
stuff? Well, it turns out, I think, that these

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:41.309
books are really masterfully exploiting many
of the illusions we've talked about today

00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:44.160
and other facts about how the mind works and
notice that travelling through centuries,

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.430
these ideas have been around for centuries
in fact. And one of the reasons why these

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.200
ideas have succeeded so well is that they
really take advantage of some of the holes

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.119
in our rationality that are illustrated by
these illusions. Now, the real secret to The

00:53:56.119 --> 00:54:00.150
Secret is based mostly on something called
illusory correlation. So, how many of you

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.930
had this experience? You're thinking about
someone who you haven't seen for years and

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.810
then suddenly the phone rings and there they
are; you get a message from them. Or, well

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:12.329
I don't know if this has happened to you guys
nowadays, you have good jobs already, but

00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:15.580
you went for a job interview and you're thinking
about "boy, I'd really like get that job offer"

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:20.329
and then a few hours later the job offer comes.
And you notice enough of these coincidences

00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:25.030
in your life; you might think that you actually
had caused them with your own thoughts. And

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:29.809
I think that's what happens to people that
believe in these ideas. They notice what's

00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:33.750
called an illusory correlation. They think
about the times when two things happened together

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.309
and they don't think about all of the times
that they weren't thinking about their friend,

00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:39.441
but then their friend called. Or the times
that you were thinking about your friend,

00:54:39.441 --> 00:54:45.130
but he didn't call or the times, quote unquote,
where you weren't thinking about your friend

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:47.609
and he didn't call, which is pretty much all
of your life.

00:54:47.609 --> 00:54:48.609
[laughter]

00:54:48.609 --> 00:54:52.880
People don't factor all that stuff into their
calculations of how unusual these events really

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.299
are. If they did, they would see that inevitably,
sometime two things are gonna go together;

00:54:56.299 --> 00:55:01.421
it's just by chance. The illusion of potential
is also involved here. Wouldn't it be great

00:55:01.421 --> 00:55:05.059
if we all did have the potential to massively
change our lives just by thinking positive

00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:10.420
thoughts? The illusion of knowledge; there's
all kinds of physics, quantum mechanics mumbo

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:14.599
jumbo that's thrown at us to explain this
stuff and that can create the illusion that

00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:18.170
we understand these ideas better than we do.
And then social proof in the argument from

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:22.500
authority that really deploys experts to tell
us that these things are right and show how

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:28.040
many people have believed this, including
supposedly Jesus and various important historical

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:36.890
figures. The idea of The Secret and The Power,
these two books -- is really that they perfectly

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:41.460
exploit every day illusions to convince people
to believe things for which there's zero real

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.460
evidence. Now, why did I bring all this stuff
up? Well, these illusions have important consequences.

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.970
They're a lot beyond, a lot beyond this. They're
not just trivial interesting facts about how

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:54.190
our minds work; they really affect our every
day behavior. That's why we call them every

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:57.331
day illusions. We're thinking, according to
these illusions, and a lot of the time and

00:55:57.331 --> 00:56:01.299
if we become aware of them, we might be able
to make better decisions in a lot of different

00:56:01.299 --> 00:56:09.700
areas of our lives. Now, I wanna sum up with
one final message and I'd like to, I'd like

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:15.450
to refer back to Woody Allen's famous stand-up
comedy routine from the 1960s. And he used

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:20.609
to conclude by saying, "Well, I wish I had
an affirmative message to leave you with,

00:56:20.609 --> 00:56:23.700
but I don't. So would you settle for two negative
messages?"

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:24.700
[laughter]

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.810
Now, I realize that some of these messages
that I've been trying to send you may seem

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:33.029
a little bit negative. Our minds are limited,
we don't pay attention to as much as we think

00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:36.670
we do, we don't notice as much, we don't remember
as much, we pay attention to confidence more

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:41.900
than we should, we don't have incredible powers
and so on. Boy, what a downer this guy is.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.220
Well, first of all, I didn't build the mind
this way, I'm just telling you how it actually

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.490
is, so don't blame me for that. But two, I
think it's much better to live in the world

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:55.069
if you actually know all that stuff than if
you don't. You can waste incredible amounts

00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:58.819
of effort thinking positive thoughts when
you could actually be doing something instead

00:56:58.819 --> 00:57:04.420
to get what you want. You can waste, you can
do a lot of bad things if you follow these

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.790
illusions too much and you can do a lot of
better things and make better decisions if

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:12.940
you're aware of them. So, that's my final
message, is think about these things and start

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.271
to notice how they affect your own behavior
and your own lives and thank you very much.

00:57:17.271 --> 00:57:18.271
[applause]

00:57:18.271 --> 00:57:25.799
&gt;&gt;presenter: Now we have some time for a few
brief questions if anyone wants to use the

00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:28.160
Q&amp;A mic and ask a question.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.480
[pause]

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:36.930
&gt;&gt;audience #6: So the most remarkable thing
about the bike drawings to me was not that

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.579
everyone has such a messed up idea about how
bikes work, but everyone drew the exact same

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:42.579
handlebars.

00:57:42.579 --> 00:57:43.579
[laughter]

00:57:43.579 --> 00:57:48.609
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: You're very observant. Actually,
I, what she did in the experiment was she

00:57:48.609 --> 00:57:53.200
drew in the handlebars and the seat and so
on and asked them to add the frame and the

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.350
chain, the bottom part of the frame and the
chain and the pedals. So, she put the easy

00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:00.930
parts in and asked people to fill in the difficult
ones, so that's why the, those top parts all

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:05.080
look the same. I think you'd get similar results
if you ask people to draw from scratch.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:11.849
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Right. But the simplicity of
the initial drawing probably influenced what

00:58:11.849 --> 00:58:12.849
people drew later, right?

00:58:12.849 --> 00:58:16.359
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Oh, you mean you think because
it's started out as a simple-looking line

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:19.789
drawing, that that maybe made them do it worse
than they would have otherwise?

00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:23.539
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Right. I mean, were they actually
told to draw as accurate as possible, like

00:58:23.539 --> 00:58:24.539
technically?

00:58:24.539 --> 00:58:29.010
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Oh, well I don't think they
were told to like, make a mechanical drawing

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:32.970
version of it. I don't think that they necessarily
had that skill. I don't think that really

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:38.289
actually matters all that much because no
matter how little drawing skill you have,

00:58:38.289 --> 00:58:41.599
you should still be able to not connect the
chain to both wheels, right? I mean, that's

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:46.059
like a functional error more than a drawing
or an artistic error. Right. But yeah, you

00:58:46.059 --> 00:58:49.910
did definitely notice the, that it wasn't
exactly the way I described it; I simplified

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:51.190
it a little bit.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:53.839
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Thanks.

00:58:53.839 --> 00:58:56.490
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Who's next?

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:57.859
&gt;&gt;audience #7: You wanna come up?

00:58:57.859 --> 00:58:59.690
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: OK, how about the guy at
the mic first?

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:06.420
&gt;&gt;audience #7: OK, so going back to the bicycle
experiment, you in an offhand way you said

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:13.400
that perhaps that the fact that people have
access to more information than they used

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:20.150
to have means that what we think that we have
more information internally than we actually

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:27.000
do, and I was wondering if you could explore
that more in the book or if you could just

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.119
elaborate more on that if you see like, is
there any study where people don't have access

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:38.299
to libraries or computers or say like, you
talk to people who ride their bicycle every

00:59:38.299 --> 00:59:43.769
day versus somebody who doesn't ride a bicycle,
if you could just talk some more about that.

00:59:43.769 --> 00:59:46.430
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Yeah, that's a really good
question. I did throw that in as kind of an

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:50.589
offhand observation and the reason why I did
was that we haven't actually done any studies

00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:56.089
on this. I think it would be really interesting
to do some cognitive psychology research on

00:59:56.089 --> 01:00:00.040
what's the measurable effect of having more
or less access to information about a particular

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.940
topic. How does that affect how much, how
well you think you understand that and so

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.869
on and I can't really, I can't really tell
you what the results would be because we haven't

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:12.080
actually done that yet, so it's more of a
hypothesis than a subtle conclusion. And I

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.589
don't mean to say, by the way, that having
access to more information, heaven forbid

01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:19.410
in this building, to say that having access
to more information is a bad thing. I think

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:25.000
it's undoubtedly, overall an extremely great
thing, but there may be some side effects

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.710
on our perception of how much we actually
understand. And I base this partly on my observation

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:38.329
of students sometimes that it's easy for students
in courses to think they understand things

01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:41.319
better than they really do and I think part
of the reason for that is that the information

01:00:41.319 --> 01:00:44.340
is so accessible. Not only is there a textbook,
but they can look things up on Wikipedia and

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.600
now we put our PowerPoint slides online, they
go to lectures and so on. The information

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.029
comes at them in a lot of different forms
a lot of the time, but I don't think it necessarily

01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:55.309
helps them understand how well they understand
the topic. They still say after they did badly

01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:57.960
on the test, they say, "Well, how did I do
so badly on the test? I really looked at all

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:03.420
that information." And so on. But I definitely
agree that this is a very fruitful area for

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.080
more experiments that I would like to work
on.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.410
&gt;&gt;audience #7: But so you seem to be suggesting
that you think that somehow easier access

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:15.740
to information is making people conflate,
I don't know, like--

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.560
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: What's in their head with
what's out in the world?

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:24.220
&gt;&gt;audience #7: Or maybe in the last example,
like facts with some, I don't know, deep understanding

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220
or--

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:33.210
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Yeah, essentially yes -- that
the easier it is to access information the

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.769
harder it is to tell the difference between
information that we actually know and information

01:01:36.769 --> 01:01:44.819
that we can easily retrieve. That's, that's
the hypothesis. And you look skeptical, which

01:01:44.819 --> 01:01:45.819
I think is good.

01:01:45.819 --> 01:01:46.819
[Chris laughs]

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:49.430
Cause it definitely hasn't been, it definitely
hasn't been tested extensively. I think it's

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:52.000
an interesting hypothesis for investigation.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.010
&gt;&gt;audience #7: Thank you.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:58.650
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Thanks. There was someone
over here, or maybe he's over, back over here

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:00.450
now. Oh, OK. Yeah?

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:04.119
&gt;&gt;audience #8: I just had a question about
that million dollar bill you gave to her.

01:02:04.119 --> 01:02:05.119
[Chris laughs]

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:09.009
I've seen videos of, I don't know how real
these videos are, they're from some like,

01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:14.640
mentalist guy, but he like, pays for things
with blank, with like white paper--

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Mm-hmm.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.549
&gt;&gt;audience #8: that's roughly in the shape
of dollar bills. And I was just, I mean, is

01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:19.890
that the same thing?

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:23.759
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: I haven't seen the videos
you're talking about, but I suspect what's

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:30.130
going on there is that if you distract the
people in certain ways from what you're doing,

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:32.932
they may just take what you hand them and
stick them in the cash register or something

01:02:32.932 --> 01:02:36.170
like that. Now, of course, if this guy wanted
to buy a milkshake with a million-dollar bill,

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:40.029
he probably could have got away with it. It
was the expecting change that was the problem

01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:42.890
and in order to get your change from a million-dollar
bill, the cashier's gotta look at it and see

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:45.880
that it's a million-dollar bill and so on.
So, I don't think it's exactly the same--

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880
&gt;&gt;audience #8: Sure.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.630
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: but in a way, a lot of what
mentalists do and magicians, of course, is

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.430
manipulate your attention. So, they manipulate
what you're paying attention to and what you're

01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:56.010
thinking about at any particular time, it's
very easy with all the stuff that we can miss

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:59.589
in the world to imagine that we could miss
actually what we're stuffing in the cash register

01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:02.030
or something like that. Thanks.

01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:06.740
&gt;&gt;audience #9: So, in the experiments that
you did, you mentioned that there were some

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.930
people who were perceptive, who noticed that
experimenters had changed or whatever.

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:11.930
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Mm-hmm.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:15.089
&gt;&gt;audience #9: I was wondering if there was
anything else about these people. Were they

01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:19.079
happier? Were they sadder? Were they miserable?
Had they had three divorces? I don't know

01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:20.170
anything that you might have come up with.

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:22.109
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Well, we didn't test a three
divorce hypothesis.

01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:24.440
[laughter]

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:31.819
That might correlate with the happiness or
sadness. In general, the answer is that nothing

01:03:31.819 --> 01:03:38.369
has been found that at all strongly predicts
whether people notice unexpected things in

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:43.910
inattentional blindness experiments or noticed
changes in change blindness experiments. Things

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:47.150
you think might, like their working memory
capacity, how much stuff can they maintain

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:51.150
in memory at one time, doesn't seem to. Dan
Simons has been doing some research on this.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:55.750
I even, by the way, ran a study where we included
the gorilla test, along with a lot of other

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.220
tests and then we got DNA from the subjects
and looked to see if there were any genes

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.079
that the gorilla noticers had that the missers
didn't and we didn't find anything. But, of

01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:06.330
course, it's very hard to find, find genes
for things like that so I was a little bit

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:11.390
quixotic, but Dan has found maybe some faint
hints that personality variables might affect

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:16.799
it, but they're extremely small effects and
hard to see so that your success or failure

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:21.680
at noticing something is really a bad personality
test, a really bad measure of anything. And

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.780
I think most of it is circumstance and luck
and whatever's happen, whatever's going on

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:32.000
in your brain at that time and so on. There's,
you know? I hesitate to just call it random

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.440
because there's nothing truly random, but
from our point of view it would be random.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440
Thanks.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:42.260
&gt;&gt;audience #10: I have another question about
the million-dollar bill experiment. So, you

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.539
use that as an example, or at least the way
I interpret it, you used it as an example

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:50.589
of somebody whose perception of their skill
at deceiving was far off from their actual

01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:51.589
skill and they--

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:52.839
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Or for his skill at crime,
yeah.

01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:56.089
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Yeah. But isn't it possible,
I guess the way I interpret it when I saw

01:04:56.089 --> 01:05:02.000
that, was that maybe he used his anger at
not receiving change as an additional projection

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.130
of confidence that it was valid and that he
should be receiving money back.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.710
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Well, that's certainly possible
and sometimes when I get angry at a customer

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.110
service person, it helps a little bit.

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.450
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Right.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:17.220
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Yeah, that's a possible explanation
and I like that you called it the million-dollar

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.780
bill experiment cause we didn't actually do
an experiment with million-dollar bills. It

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.720
would be interesting to do that. You've given
me an idea just now, so what we'll have to

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.890
include you as a co-author if we do a million-dollar
bill experiment. I think there may be something

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:37.250
to what you're saying and I have to say in
honesty, I used it in part for the humor value,

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:42.770
but you can easily find lists of all these
stupid -- Google stupid crimes and you'll

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:47.920
get a lot of them. And I can't help but think
that one thing that's going on in these cases

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.839
is that the criminals think they're better
at crime than they really are. Now, there

01:05:50.839 --> 01:05:53.790
are probably other things happening, too,
like "where did this guy get the million-dollar

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:56.880
bill and how did he think he came into it
without paying for it with a million dollars"

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.460
or something like that. So, there's obviously
more to the story and maybe you're right about

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.900
that he was just trying to really like, wow
them with even more confidence.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.539
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Yeah, I don't know.

01:06:04.539 --> 01:06:05.640
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Could be.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.020
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Thinking about it.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.020
[pause]

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.490
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Hi. Interesting talk, I loved
it.

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:10.490
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Thank you.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:13.630
&gt;&gt;audience #11: You mentioned the distinction
between what we know in the head and what

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:14.809
we can infer from the environment.

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:15.809
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Right.

01:06:15.809 --> 01:06:18.960
&gt;&gt;audience #11: And these days, more and more
of our knowledge or whatever we know is shifted

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.200
onto things we carry, like cell phones.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.200
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.510
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Like, ten years ago, if you
ask someone to give, speak out the five closest

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.450
people's phone numbers, they could do that.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.450
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Right.

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.230
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Today, I don't think anyone
would be able to cite those numbers.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:31.230
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Right.

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:34.130
&gt;&gt;audience #11: So, it's all just [ ] cognition,
so do we really need to make a distinction

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:35.710
between what's in the head versus what's with
me?

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:40.319
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Right, so this is an excellent
question. What is this boundary between the

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:48.589
head and this boundary right here that's made
up of bone and skin and so on. Is that really

01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:51.089
cognitively significant anymore, as significant
as it used to be? And I think the answer is

01:06:51.089 --> 01:06:57.460
no. To some, it's not as, it's not completely
unimportant, it's not irrelevant, but it's

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:03.310
not as important for the reason you say. And
maybe we should start to, instead of studying

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:06.640
the individual, abilities of the individual
as much as we did, which is the traditional

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.809
way in cognitive psychology and cognitive
neuroscience, start to study the abilities

01:07:09.809 --> 01:07:15.250
of the human computer or the human device
partnership, or the human Internet partnership

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:21.000
or of groups of people working together which
increasingly happens in workplaces much more

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.940
than it used to. And I actually, I started
doing a little bit of research on that myself

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.319
where I did something really trivial. I had
people do an IQ test, not an IQ test, sorry.

01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:34.099
I had them do a GRE, a standardized test with
or without a computer that they had access

01:07:34.099 --> 01:07:37.319
to just for fun to see what would happen and
how much smarter do they get when they have

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:44.000
a computer. And it turns out, good news. They
do better. But maybe not, maybe not as much

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.410
better as you might think and it might differ
depending on what kind of materials they are

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:52.289
and so on. And so I think we, that's a very
faint first step at starting to study exactly

01:07:52.289 --> 01:07:56.250
the phenomenon you're talking about and move
that into what psychologists study when they

01:07:56.250 --> 01:08:01.240
study intelligence and human abilities and
so on. It's a good suggestion.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.309
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:04.730
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: The million-dollar question
was coming, though.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:05.809
&gt;&gt;presenter: Oh, it's really quick.

01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:08.140
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: She gets to ask one cause
she got the million-dollar bill.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.280
&gt;&gt;audience #12: Yeah, it's really quick. I
was wondering, in the experiments that you

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.480
do with people looking for the gorilla or
the one with the umbrella or whatever, have

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.880
you guys ever gone into biology, neurobiology
to see what parts of the brain's actually,

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.560
are stimulated in the people that do see them?
And how does that differ?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.950
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Well, the answer, the answer
is for these kinds of experiments generally,

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:31.450
no. We haven't done that and part of the reason
for that is that it's a methodological challenge

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:35.890
to repeat these experiences enough times that
you can get enough data to really answer those

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:39.980
questions. Once people know there's a gorilla
coming, it's hard to redo the same thing again.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.771
There has been research on what goes on in
the brain when we pay attention to one thing

01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:47.390
and ignore other things, but we haven't, that's
not stuff that we've actually done ourselves.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:48.390
Thanks.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.370
&gt;&gt;presenter: Chris, that was an amazing talk,
thank you very much for speaking with us.

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:51.370
&gt;&gt;Chris Chabris: Thank you.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:51.580
