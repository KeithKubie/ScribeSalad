something worse than that and I think
 

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.100
something worse than that and I think
that's something I wish had been focused

someone who provided training on these

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:03.580
someone who provided training on these
 

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.250
someone who provided training on these
issues and was trained in such a way

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:05.260
issues and was trained in such a way
 

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.080
issues and was trained in such a way
that he thought it was okay for him to

you saw his institution back him up
after he did that so I think he wasn't

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:17.049
after he did that so I think he wasn't
 

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:18.269
after he did that so I think he wasn't
being a bad apple he was doing what he

00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279
being a bad apple he was doing what he
 

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:21.840
being a bad apple he was doing what he
was trained to do and we need to enact

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:21.850
was trained to do and we need to enact
 

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.120

change on an institutional level to stop
 

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.470
change on an institutional level to stop
that from happening again because it

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480
that from happening again because it
 

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.789
that from happening again because it
happens to thousands of people who don't

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799
happens to thousands of people who don't
 

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.110
happens to thousands of people who don't
have the connections officer gates has

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120
have the connections officer gates has
 

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.180
have the connections officer gates has
and the consequences are not going to be

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:30.190
and the consequences are not going to be
 

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.799

a beer with the president you know it's

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:31.809
a beer with the president you know it's
 

00:29:31.809 --> 00:29:33.060
a beer with the president you know it's
going to when it escalates is going to

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.070
going to when it escalates is going to
 

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.549
going to when it escalates is going to
escalate to a Taser or a night stick or

00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559
escalate to a Taser or a night stick or
 

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.320
escalate to a Taser or a night stick or
something worse than that and I think

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:37.330
something worse than that and I think
 

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.870
something worse than that and I think
that's something I wish had been focused

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880
that's something I wish had been focused
 

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.370
that's something I wish had been focused

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:41.380
on more I mean it's great for us to
 

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.190
on more I mean it's great for us to
encourage conversation but I wish that

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200
encourage conversation but I wish that
 

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.019
encourage conversation but I wish that
President Obama had also taken some time

00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:46.029
President Obama had also taken some time
 

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:48.570
President Obama had also taken some time
to note that there are bigger things

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:48.580
to note that there are bigger things
 

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.129
to note that there are bigger things
than conversation that need to happen

00:29:50.129 --> 00:29:50.139
than conversation that need to happen
 

00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:52.889
