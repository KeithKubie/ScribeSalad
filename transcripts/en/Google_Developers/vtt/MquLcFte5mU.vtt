JEREMY WALKER: Hi, my
name's Jeremy Walker.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.660
We're continuing
our talk on GEEs.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.130
Those are Google
Developer experts

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.790
who help us out with the APIs.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.796
Again, we have three that
came out for YouTube.

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.670
And today we're actually
to talk with someone

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.159
from all the way south,
from Argentina, Matias,

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.200
and he's going to tell us
a little bit about what

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.280
he's been up to.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.390
Enjoy the show.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.540
And we're continuing
our conversation

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.820
with our global YouTube
developer experts.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.040
So next, we have
our veteran, Matias.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.850
MATIAS MOLINAS: Hi,
I am from Argentina.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.230
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, he
covers South America.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.116
He's all over the place down
there, thankfully, for us.

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:46.490
And we were talking a little
bit about the Android Player

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.190
API, which for you
that don't know,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.780
it's an API that allows you to
play YouTube within your app.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.260
But before I jumped
into that, I wanted

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
to talk about something
that's a little related.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.996
You did a PhoneGap
Code Lab, and so I

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.620
wanted you to talk a little bit
about that and your experience.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.910
MATIAS MOLINAS: Yes, I tried
to use the YouTube Multiplayer

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.440
inside a PhoneGap app because
PhoneGap is a good framework

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.140
to make a proof of concepts,
your first app in a hack-a-thon

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.410
because you can
do that very fast.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.380
In my first test, I
used the iFrame player,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.300
but I believe that
maybe the Multiplayer

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.140
is better for an Android app.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.230
And I tried to use
Android Multiplayer using,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.060
actually building,
a PhoneGap line.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.000
And I realized that
it's too much better.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.190
The experience using
the Multiplayer

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.500
is better than
the iFrame player.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.329
JEREMY WALKER: Great, so you
developed the phone app after--

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.620
MATIAS MOLINAS: The year after.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.495
JEREMY WALKER: -Code
Lab-- which, by the way,

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.290
is really great.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.250
But you found that you had to
use the WebView so you can make

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.016
a really quick
hack-a-thon type deal.

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:05.390
So the Android Player API,
you didn't actually use there,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.630
but you were saying
that for the comparison

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.759
when you actually built
outside a phone app,

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.550
with the Android Player
versus the WebView,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.560
you found it a little bit easier
to use the Android Player API.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.200
MATIAS MOLINAS: Yes, I found
that it's-- in my [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.890
I used the iFrame player,
because I made all the app with

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.970
Javascript.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.050
I used that API to
get recommendations.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.770
But I believe that the Android
Player is the best experience,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.910
so I tried it.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.730
I realized that it is better.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.560
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, you know
the phone app thing was great.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.930
It's a great way to get
people started in Android

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.780
and maybe they aren't as
experienced with Android

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.180
development.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.260
So I guess when you were
using the Android Player API,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.630
did you have any feature
requests that you would like?

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.190
MATIAS MOLINAS: Yes, because
it is a mobile scenario.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.600
I believe that maybe more
buffering or maybe offline--

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.540
if you can manage the
video to play something

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.747
in an offline scenario,
it could be great.

00:03:20.747 --> 00:03:21.580
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.150
So buffering is something we're
always improving and optimizing

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.970
on from that Player API.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.830
And then we've heard a lot of
feature requests for offline,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.110
so we know that's a big
one from the audience.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.420
Matias, again,
thanks for running

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.940
around all of South America
and promoting the YouTube APIs.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.520
And thanks to the
audience for joining us.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.320
And look for, if you're
in South America,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.715
look to see Matias talking
about the YouTube APIs.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:48.830
Thanks.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.380
MATIAS MOLINAS: Thanks.
