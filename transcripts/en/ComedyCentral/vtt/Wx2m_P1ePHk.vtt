Now it's time
for tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.638
Let's begin.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.840
-(cheering, applause)
-It's time...

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.413
In this time of unparalleled
political divisiveness,

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:16.250
America has finally found a hero
it can rally behind.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.219
I'm speaking, of course,
about undecided debate attendee

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.388
and living Pringles mascot
Ken Bone.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.191
-(cheering, applause) -My new
favorite person in the universe.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.026
Even Twitter's Moments
feature, uh...

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.195
flat-out said, quote,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.365
"Ken Bone is
a national treasure."

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.633
Hyperbole?

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.001
I don't think so!

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.436
This guy is right up there
with Yellowstone National Park

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.071
and using donuts
as hamburger buns.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.074
I mean... check out
Ken's Facebook page,

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.777
where it turns out
he also plays Pokémon GO,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.314
but he plays as Obi-Wan Kenboni.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.082
(laughter)

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.385
I love you, Ken!

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.353
(applause)

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.090
(grunts)
I hope your Team Mystic, Ken,

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.826
but cut the red sweater--
I think you might be Team Valor.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.229
That's okay. We can cross
barriers and still be friends.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.299
Uh... in fact, he's taking on
legendary status.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.801
Like some kind of folk hero.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.437
♪

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.272
♪ Ken Bone.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.507
(laughter, applause)

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.809
-(cheering)
-Oh. How convenient.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.544
We have a folk hero here.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.646
So in honor of this
sensible Paul Bunyan,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.683
tonight's hashtag is
#KenBoneFacts. #KenBoneFacts.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.419
Examples might be:
Ken Bone is the fraternal twin

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.722
-of every NFL assistant coach,
and... -(laughter)

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.958
Ken Bone doesn't give
mustache rides,

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.960
he gives mustache journeys.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.929
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.568
And here to help us out
with this game,

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.971
all the way from his home
in Lizard's Thicket,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.806
the thrice-divorced
singer-songwriter,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.941
Slim Whiteman is here!

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:49.877
(cheering, applause)

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.546
MAN:
Yeah!

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.314
♪ Ken Bone.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:57.150
All right, perfect.
Thank you very much.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:02:00.687
So I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock, and begin.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.289
-Kurt.
-Uh...

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.691
Ken Bone owns over 1,000 DVD's,

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.960
but they're all
of the movie <i>Sully.</i>

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:09.863
-All right.
-(laughter)

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.532
♪ Ken Bone.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.433
-(laughter)
-All right.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.170
-(applause, whooping)
-Brian Posehn.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:20.307
-Ken Bone's sleep apnea machine
gets cable. -All right.

HARDWICK:
Kurt.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.513
Ken Bone's sweater isn't red,

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:28.482
it just blushes
when he wears it.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.050
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.019
(cheering, applause)

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:36.990
Brian Posehn.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.759
When Ken Bone is stuck in
traffic,

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:42.162
the "N" word he yells is nutmeg.

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:42.262
(Hardwick laughing)
