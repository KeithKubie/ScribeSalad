00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.330
Let us consider an example. We are shown initially three images, A, B and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.200
C. And you have to pick a candidate for the D image here on the top right.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.320
And it can be one of these six candidates that would go here in the D image.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.170
Given that A is to B, as C is to D,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.410
what would you pick among the six choices at the bottom to put into D?
