00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.710
- It's the real life
Frankenstein experiment

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.500
that tried to bring a
murderer back from the dead

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.210
but wound up killing
a man instead.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.880
This is "Dark History".

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.210
[music playing]

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
London, December 5, 1802--

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.920
at 4:30 PM, a man
named George Foster

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.250
leaves a tavern with his
estranged wife and daughter.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.420
At 5:00 PM, a nine-year-old girl
spots the family taking a walk

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540
along the Paddington Canal.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.170
Later that evening, George
Foster was seen at a pub

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.170
sharing a drink with a friend--

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.040
his wife and daughter
no longer with him.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.830
The next morning, John Atkins, a
boatman on the Paddington Canal

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.250
begins his day's work.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.540
But something's not right.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.250
He inspects beneath
the bow of his boat

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.670
and discovers the body of
George Foster's daughter.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.040
Atkins is ordered
to sweep the canal.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.420
Three days later, he finds
the body of Foster's wife

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.920
mere yards from where
she had enjoyed lunch

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.250
with husband and daughter.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.960
Foster is arrested
for the murders.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.750
Rumors swirled that
the trial was fast

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420
tracked through the
influence of a Mr.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.080
Pass, the right-hand man of
Giovanni Aldini, a respected

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.040
physicist and professor.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.460
George Foster is found guilty.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.880
He's sentenced to
death and dissection.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.380
It was customary at the time
to cut the bodies of murderers

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.960
into pieces making it
more difficult for them

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.120
to rise from the dead with
God's chosen on Judgement Day.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.250
But the body of George Foster
would not be dissected.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.960
Instead, it is delivered
to Giovanni Aldini, who

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420
is sorely in need of a
fresh corpse for a rather

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.290
macabre experiment.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.120
Aldini is the nephew of Luigi
Galvani, a renowned scientist

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.830
who had developed a
method of stimulating

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.500
muscles with an electrical
current called galvanism.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.460
Aldini is eager to
use this technique

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.170
to try to reanimate the dead.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.580
On a cold and dark
January night,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.830
a number of doctors
and curiosity seekers

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.620
gather in an operating theater.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.750
Word had spread that
Giovanni Aldini would

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.620
attempt to raise the dead.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.670
Aldini begins his experiment
by connecting conducting

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.830
rods to a powerful battery.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.170
He then carefully applies
the electrified rods

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.120
to Foster's face.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.000
Slowly, the jaw
begins to quiver.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.500
And the muscles of
the face contort

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.380
into a grotesque grimace.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.710
The audience watches
with a rising mixture

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.710
of fear and intrigue
when suddenly

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.540
Foster's left eye pops open.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.790
With a terrified gasp,
many in the crowd leave.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.120
What happens next is so
horrifying that it literally

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.460
scares a man to death.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.960
Aldini uses a conducting
rod to probe Foster's body.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.880
Suddenly the corpse clenches
its fists and punches the air.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.330
Its back arches violently--
legs kicking back and forth

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.880
as if trying to outrun
its eternal damnation.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.710
The body clanging against
the metal operating table

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.710
mixes with the
screams of onlookers

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.040
to produce a morbid
cacophony that echoes

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.920
throughout the
operating theater.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.080
Mr. Pass, who secured the
body of George Foster,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.250
is so disturbed, so
shocked, so horrified

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.580
he has a heart attack,
going to his own grave

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.830
believing that he
had helped bring

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.920
someone else back from theirs.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.580
Aldini would continue his
experiments, touring the globe,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.830
becoming world
famous, and inspiring

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.210
Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein".

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.250
He also developed a
small battery for the use

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.830
of experimenting on the dead.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.420
That invention would become
the basis for our modern day

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.250
cell phone battery.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.080
So be careful the next
time you answer your phone.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.540
[ringing]

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.670
It could be the dead calling.
