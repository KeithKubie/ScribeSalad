00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.899
Jay G. asks: Why do fruits change colour and
flavour when they ripen?

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.040
fruit-rainbowFruits and vegetables (see: The
Difference Between Fruits and Vegetables)

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.230
come in a wide array of colors that change
throughout their ripening process, with the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.400
brightest colors often occurring when the
fruit is optimally ripened.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.970
But why do fruits change color at all?

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.050
There are two ways to answer this question-
first, looking at what’s going on internally

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.540
while the fruit is ripening and second looking
at why these plants have evolved to do this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.899
at all, especially considering it’s seemingly
a massive waste of the plant’s energy and

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.859
resources to produce fruit of any color around
its seeds.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.690
While there are many different types of fruits,
speaking generally, many fruits start out

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.989
some shade of green thanks to an abundance
of chlorophyll, which, with the help of the

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.510
sun and nutrients from the soil, is used to
produce much of the contents of the fruit,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.379
at this stage mainly starch.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.960
At a certain point in the fruit’s development,
usually when the seed is nearly fully matured,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.509
the ripening process begins, in many fruits
triggered by the naturally produced hydrocarbon

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.060
gas ethylene.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.070
Exactly how ethylene facilitates ripening
is still an ongoing area of research, but,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.350
in a nutshell, receptors in the plant end
up binding to the ethylene.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.360
This triggers certain genes to turn off and
others to turn on, resulting in the creation

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.180
of various enzymes that facilitate the ripening
process, such as amylases, which converts

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.090
the starch to simple sugars, and pectinases,
which breaks down the cell walls of the fruit,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.049
softening it to make the inside more accessible.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.350
While the enticing innards are being sweetened
and made easier to access, the chlorophyll

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.100
is broken down via hydrolytic enzymes, ultimately
removing the green color.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.200
As this is happening some pigments are getting
synthesized while others that were there all

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.619
along, but masked by the chlorophyll, are
revealed.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.880
The two primary culprits producing the colors
here are carotenoids, which are generally

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.670
responsible for the orange and yellow colors
in fruits, and anthocyanins, which are usually

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.140
responsible for the purples, reds, and blues.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.039
(Incidentally, a similar process to this is
what’s happening in autumn with tree leaves,

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.780
Now for why certain plants have evolved to
produce colorful, tasty fruit.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.760
Other than in science fiction, plants are
relatively immobile so those that have survived

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.660
over the millennia have evolved a few ingenious
methods for spreading their seeds.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.780
Some have buoyant seeds that float on the
wind or water, others are carried and buried

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.060
by industrious rodents and mammals, while
still others stick to the fur and feathers

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.760
of passing fauna and hitch a ride.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.950
But perhaps the most common, and certainly
the most scatological, way seeds are spread

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.569
is when they are eaten, and later pooped out,
by animals.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.989
Beyond potentially spreading the seed far
and wide, this also has the side benefit of

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.690
providing the seed a good starter of nutrition.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.340
To facilitate this type of dispersal, fruits
have evolved to become tastier when their

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.489
seeds are ready and to change to a more noticeable
color as a potentially attractive signal to

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.769
animals that it is time to eat.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.980
Animals that eat fruits are frugivores, including
mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.900
Among these, it appears that birds and mammals
play the largest role in seed dispersal, and,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.560
in fact, more than 35% of all terrestrial
birds and 20% of non-marine mammals are frugivores,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560
at least to some extent.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.989
Nonetheless, the others have a role to play,
and fish are especially key to dispersing

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.909
tropical seeds, while tortoises and lizards
are integral to seed dispersal in insular

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.950
and arid ecosystems.[1]

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.849
As far back as the 19th century, Charles Darwin
in On the Origin of the Species (1859) noticed

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.379
that frugivores (or more particularly, birds)
more commonly ate brightly-colored, as opposed

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.299
to dull-colored, fruits.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.540
Subsequent studies discerned that, for European
birds, the fruit they ate was most frequently

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.019
red, while for those in the New World, and
neo- and sub- tropics, black fruits are the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.019
most popular.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.700
Interestingly, in those regions where fruit
eating birds were less common, multi-colored

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.450
fruits proliferated, and subsequent studies
showed that birds were more likely to remove

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.430
a fruit with more than one color than a mono-colored
fruit.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.370
Similarly, in at least one study, scientists
found that multi- and brighter- colored ripe

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.909
fruits were more common in the understory
(to be visible in the low light), while duller

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.170
colors were found higher up (where it is easier
for a fruit to be noticed).[2]

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.690
The hue, brightness and location of the variety
of different ripe fruit colors has led many

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.720
to conclude that color serves three purposes:
(1) it draws attention to the fruit; (2) it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.170
reveals (or camouflages) the fruit’s location
depending on ripening stage (often hiding

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.841
when not ripe and revealing when the seed
inside is ready for dispersal); and (3) it

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:41.900
signals when the fruit is ripe and, thus,
optimally tasty for its target consumer.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.430
Of course, there may be other reasons why
fruits have different colors, and one theory

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.020
holds that blue, brown and black fruits may
have evolved their dark colors as this “absorbs

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.590
more radiation . . . thereby raising fruit
temperatures [and] increasing metabolic and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.690
developmental rates.”[3]

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.770
Nonetheless, seed dispersal appears to be
the primary purpose of a fruit’s coloring,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.370
as is the production of the tasty, juicy pulp,
so sought after by the dispersers.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.910
In fact, it has been noted that “the energy
allocated to produce the pulp . . represents

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.170
a cost to the plant that probably has no purpose
other than to attract seed dispersers and

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.540
to protect the seeds.”[4]

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.630
In addition to transporting eaten seeds, it
is believed that disperser ingestion also

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.320
aids in seed germination.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.450
In the disperser’s gut, the pulp, which
if not removed could preclude sprouting, is

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.280
removed, as often is all or a part of the
tough outer seed coating – the removal of

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.460
which frequently speeds up germination.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.841
Another benefit of ingestion is that, as previously
mentioned, when the seeds finally leave the

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:42.070
disperser at a distant location, they are
surrounded by a rich source of potential fertilizer

00:05:42.070 --> 00:06:53.880
(known to you and me as fecal matter).
