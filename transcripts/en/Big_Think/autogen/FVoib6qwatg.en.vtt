00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.590
 
I wrote a book called how many people

can the earth support and I've made a

can the earth support and I've made a
 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.880

years writing that book I now think that

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560
years writing that book I now think that
 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.729
years writing that book I now think that
we should pay much more attention to the

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739
we should pay much more attention to the
 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.220
we should pay much more attention to the
quality of life of the people who we

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
quality of life of the people who we
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.160
quality of life of the people who we
have now and the quality of life for the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
have now and the quality of life for the
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.620
have now and the quality of life for the
children that we're going to have in the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630
children that we're going to have in the
 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.660
children that we're going to have in the
next year and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
next year and
 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.030
next year and
five years and 20 years and so I've

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
five years and 20 years and so I've
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.300
five years and 20 years and so I've
shifted my emphasis from trying to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
shifted my emphasis from trying to
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.650
shifted my emphasis from trying to
answer a question that's not well

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660
answer a question that's not well
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.050
answer a question that's not well
formulated in the first place to what

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
formulated in the first place to what
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.320
formulated in the first place to what
can we do to improve life for ourselves

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330
can we do to improve life for ourselves
 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.690
can we do to improve life for ourselves
and for the children and especially for

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
and for the children and especially for
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.479
and for the children and especially for
the billion people who are chronically

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489
the billion people who are chronically
 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.420
the billion people who are chronically
hungry now it's it's it's amazing to me

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
hungry now it's it's it's amazing to me
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.680
hungry now it's it's it's amazing to me
so you ask about how many people can the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
so you ask about how many people can the
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.610
so you ask about how many people can the
earth support last year we grew enough

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620
earth support last year we grew enough
 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.850
earth support last year we grew enough
grain to feed decently between nine and

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860
grain to feed decently between nine and
 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.460
grain to feed decently between nine and
eleven billion people okay we have under

eleven billion people okay we have under
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.930
eleven billion people okay we have under
seven billion and of those 1 billion are

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
seven billion and of those 1 billion are
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.880
seven billion and of those 1 billion are
chronically hungry they're not getting

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890
chronically hungry they're not getting
 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.940
chronically hungry they're not getting
enough how is it possible we're growing

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950
enough how is it possible we're growing
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.170
enough how is it possible we're growing
9 to 11 we've got a billion hungry

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
9 to 11 we've got a billion hungry
 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.900
9 to 11 we've got a billion hungry
people we're only seven billion

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
people we're only seven billion
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.130
people we're only seven billion
altogether how does that work for every

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140
altogether how does that work for every
 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.340
altogether how does that work for every
three kilograms of grain that goes into

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350
three kilograms of grain that goes into
 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.330
three kilograms of grain that goes into
a human mouth we put two kilograms of

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
a human mouth we put two kilograms of
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.530
a human mouth we put two kilograms of
grain into an animal mouth and we have

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540
grain into an animal mouth and we have
 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.670
grain into an animal mouth and we have
put animals in the queue for food ahead

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680
put animals in the queue for food ahead
 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.930
put animals in the queue for food ahead
of a billion people and the reason is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940
of a billion people and the reason is
 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.160
of a billion people and the reason is
the billion people are poor they got no

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
the billion people are poor they got no
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.970
the billion people are poor they got no
money and they're economically invisible

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980
money and they're economically invisible
 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.069
money and they're economically invisible
because the price of food doesn't take

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079
because the price of food doesn't take
 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.370
because the price of food doesn't take
account of hunger especially children

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380
account of hunger especially children
 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.080
account of hunger especially children
they've got no they don't have it and so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090
they've got no they don't have it and so
 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.630
they've got no they don't have it and so
they are hungry we've got a billion

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640
they are hungry we've got a billion
 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.030
they are hungry we've got a billion
hungry people and we're feeding forty

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040
hungry people and we're feeding forty
 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.020
hungry people and we're feeding forty
percent of the consumed grain to animals

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030
percent of the consumed grain to animals
 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.830
percent of the consumed grain to animals
not to mention the 16 that goes into the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840
not to mention the 16 that goes into the
 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.029
not to mention the 16 that goes into the
machines so I think we've got a problem

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039
machines so I think we've got a problem
 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.909
machines so I think we've got a problem
when we put machines and animals ahead

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919
when we put machines and animals ahead
 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.310
when we put machines and animals ahead
of people

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320
 
 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.650
 
well I don't know that it's it's wasted

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660
well I don't know that it's it's wasted
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.690
well I don't know that it's it's wasted
I mean when people the people who are

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
I mean when people the people who are
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.780
I mean when people the people who are
getting rich are demanding the meat they

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790
getting rich are demanding the meat they
 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.550
getting rich are demanding the meat they
want in the economic sense they buying

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560
want in the economic sense they buying
 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.350
want in the economic sense they buying
meat they want it and the farmers are

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
meat they want it and the farmers are
 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.270
meat they want it and the farmers are
supplying where there's demand what I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
supplying where there's demand what I
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.380
supplying where there's demand what I
think we need to do is take several
