00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The next piece about customer development to understand is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what is it you're actually doing outside the building?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And what I think about is you're really testing on the highest possible level

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
your understanding of the customer's problem or need.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You implicitly had a hypothesis.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to extract from implicit to have you make it explicit.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here's what the pain and the gain is we're actually doing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for these hypothetical customer segments that I've written down on my canvas.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Great, so how are we going to go do that?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Literally we're going to get out of the building,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
take our hypotheses, and we're not just getting out of the building

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and randomly talking to customers because if that was the case

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we could have just sent them a letter or sent an email.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we're looking for is not just data, it's insights,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and how this process will work is we'll get out of the building,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and then as we find those new insights we'll actually change the canvas.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Big idea.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll change the canvas by marking it up and saying,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you know, we thought the customers were these kinds of people.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Holy cow, they're actually these kinds of people,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and we thought the features we need, well, they're kind of different.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They're actually these features, so what we are doing outside the building

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is you start with these hypotheses.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In this case let's just take an example of the customers will be male,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
24-35, live in urban areas, and then we're going to design some experiments.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's go figure out maybe a Google AdWords campaign.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Or if it was a physical product, go out and meet them personally,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then run some tests and take a look and analyze the data.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But it's not just the data.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We're trying to understand did the results match the hypotheses?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And if not, just don't give up and say, "Well, it didn't."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
"Let's try another segment."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Understand why your initial hypotheses were wrong

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because it's this why not that might give you some insight.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What you might find out in this case is, oops, we kept getting

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
teen girls in suburbia, and you can either keep deciding

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
no, no, no, I want men, or you might go "Well, wait a minute."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
"The teen girls are actually enthusiastic,

00:01:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in fact, trying to figure out how to buy our product right now."
