00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.597
- Zuckerberg started Facebook in a dorm.

00:00:02.597 --> 00:00:04.743
Snowden exposed the NSA in a hotel.

00:00:04.743 --> 00:00:07.967
I'm a comedian who's been fired
from many social media jobs,

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:09.851
so what can I accomplish if I'm locked

00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:11.929
in a room for one week with just

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.258
an internet connection
and a thousand dollars?

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:16.706
This is Control Room.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:26.850
So, welcome to Control Room.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.616
The challenge for this episode is start

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:33.824
an alternative medicine
company from inside this room.

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:34.777
Now if you guys don't know,

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:36.822
alternative medicine companies,
there's a ton of them,

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.249
but I'm gonna talk about
two, Goop and LiveWater.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:41.920
And I wanna tell you guys about these,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.352
but I have to do it in a special segment

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:47.352
called My Viacom Approved Opinions.

00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:52.155
Just a little bit of background on this.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.729
Viacom, the parent
company of Comedy Central,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.742
hates this project.

00:00:57.742 --> 00:00:59.065
They hate everything about it.

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:01.539
Just in prep for the PowerPoint
that I'm showing you now,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.295
they sent me 257 emails about things

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.295
I am not allowed to say.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.806
One of the last ones
was this that just said,

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:11.749
it is our opinion that the creative team

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:13.136
should either change course

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:15.658
or stop development of this project.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.467
And most of the other emails

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.704
were about Gwyneth Paltrow or Goop,

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:24.675
and how I should not mention
them under any circumstance.

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:29.175
So in the segment, I am
obligated to keep it positive.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.557
So first, I wanna talk to
you guys about LiveWater.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:34.956
If you don't know,
LiveWater is unfiltered,

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:37.768
untreated, unsterilized spring water.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:42.440
Heres one of their jugs from
Instagram, which I like.

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:45.038
I think that that's good.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.008
That's great.

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.858
They sell a 2.5-gallon jug for 36.99.

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:52.713
Here's their real website.

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.236
And people had a lot to say about this.

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:57.505
This guy said, "Without water treatment,

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:59.006
there's acute and chronic risks."

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.291
Stuff like E. coli bacteria,
viruses, parasites,

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.373
and we don't have that because of our

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.711
very efficient water treatment process.

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.743
But what does this guy know?

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:08.298
He's just the Director of
the Healthy Living Program

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:11.105
at the Mayo Clinic, so probably an idiot.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:13.021
I instead choose to believe, again,

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.312
the brilliancy of the company who says,

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:16.145
"Tap water?

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:17.446
"You're drinking toilet water

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:19.742
"with birth control drugs in them."

00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:21.759
"They're putting in fluoride.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.249
"It's a mind-control drug that has

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.893
"no benefit to our dental health."

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:27.260
And who would be more in touch with nature

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.611
and the human body than this man who,

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.736
even in this press photo,

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.486
is staring directly into the sun?

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:42.972
And so now, I wanna talk about Goop.

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.839
And I gotta be careful, but I'm just gonna

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:45.985
point a couple things out,

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:46.967
keep it real straightforward.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.144
This is Goop's very slick, very cool logo.

00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:50.460
That's important to remember later

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.790
when I'm building my company.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.283
And then I wanna talk to
you about some of their,

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:54.698
these are real products that are

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.011
for sale on the Goop website.

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.000
This is their Aromatic Stress Treatment.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.170
You can pick this up for 80 bucks

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.457
and you get .16 ounces!

00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:07.790
This is their Psychic Vampire Repellent.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.656
I thought that it was
weird how they included

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:10.958
instructions on how to use this

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.922
as if it's not obvious
that this is a product

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:15.275
which you spray around the aura

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:16.108
to protect from psychic attack.

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:16.941
That's clearly what it's for.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:22.457
They have Chill Child, Kid Calming Mist.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.680
That's 27 bucks.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.644
And under almost all of the
products on the website,

00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:27.781
not all, but almost all,

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:29.994
there's this cool disclaimer that says,

00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:31.514
these statements have not been evaluated

00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:32.773
by the Food and Drug Administration.

00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:34.050
This is not intended to diagnose, treat,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.710
cure, or prevent any disease.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.546
And I don't think that
there's anything wrong

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:40.464
with me putting these
images next to each other.

00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:42.136
I don't think there's
anything wrong with me saying

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.794
that's a great deal.

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:46.284
I don't think there's anything wrong

00:03:46.284 --> 00:03:48.057
with me pointing to these two images

00:03:48.057 --> 00:03:51.105
and mentioning that Goop
is worth $250 million.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.899
I don't think there's
anything wrong with me showing

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.265
Gwyneth Paltrow's
beautiful, $10 million home,

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:56.387
or putting this on top of it,

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.469
or putting that on top of it.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:03.386
And that's fine, and those are
my Viacom Approved Opinions.

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:09.775
So again, back to the task here.

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:13.005
My task was to start an
alternative medicine company.

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:14.536
And what that means is I want to start

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:17.880
and operate an actual company
that has slick branding,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.297
that seems sophisticated,
this really means European.

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.401
And in order to prove how effective

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:27.022
those marketing tactics are,

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:29.535
I need to make sure
that the product itself

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.842
has to be a gross and
dangerous piece of nonsense.

00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:35.925
So my idea for this was a used tissue

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.509
that works like a vaccine,

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.551
in that someone sneezes on it.

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.658
And the you have the tissue.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.270
Someone else breathes that tissue in

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.749
so that they get sick now

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:50.064
and don't get sick later.

00:04:50.064 --> 00:04:52.731
And the tissue itself costs $80.

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.816
So the metrics I'm gonna use to determine

00:04:56.816 --> 00:04:58.786
whether this experiment is a success

00:04:58.786 --> 00:04:59.910
is do people believe it?

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.174
Will people use it?

00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:02.768
And do people like it?

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:04.645
So the first thing I needed was a brand.

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.348
And I used the Haagen Dazs Method.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.234
The Haagen Dazs Method, if you don't know,

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:10.269
is when you take a product
that's not Danish at all

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.823
and you give it a Danish
name so it seems cooler.

00:05:12.823 --> 00:05:14.872
So I went on Google Translate.

00:05:14.872 --> 00:05:17.683
I typed in tissue and it came
out Vaev, and I'm like yeah,

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:21.065
obviously that's the
name of the company now.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:22.172
Are you serious?

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:23.581
That's perfect!

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:24.581
What?
- Whoo!

00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.879
- And then I hit up my buddy
who's a graphic designer

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.485
and told him about the whole thing,

00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:30.762
told him I was locked in a room,

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:32.294
and he sent over these mock ups.

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:33.315
I picked this one.

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:35.402
And so that's the logo for the company.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.189
And I wanted a slick package.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.590
And you guys have seen those
knockoff iPhone boxes, right?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.743
They look pretty much like the
real thing, but they're fake?

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.768
Turns out, you can get
those on the internet

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:48.876
custom made for 50 cents a piece.

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:51.506
So I did that and it looks good.

00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:52.705
And then I was in the room.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.990
I ordered a bunch of Petri
dishes off of Amazon,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.859
some Kleenexes that I just
balled up, never sneezed on.

00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:59.744
And I started putting
these things together

00:05:59.744 --> 00:06:02.103
with stickers and gold tape
that I got from a craft store

00:06:02.103 --> 00:06:03.848
all delivered to the room.

00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:05.996
So this is the logo on
the little unit thing.

00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:07.769
On the back, we see the same warning

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:10.240
from the Goop products.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.846
On the side, you can see into it.

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:14.876
You see this quote, quote, "used tissue"

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.821
and some of our nice gold tape.

00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.738
It also has instructions
in English and Danish.

00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.520
It comes with two of these cool stickers

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.212
that say blessed you on them.

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:30.404
It's our little tagline.

00:06:30.404 --> 00:06:31.814
It's like Apple.

00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:33.790
Oh, and also it has this
trashcan on the back.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.812
I don't know what that
means or what it is,

00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:38.200
but I feel like it's on a lot of products,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.791
so it makes it look more legit.

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.481
So I put a bunch of these together,

00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.108
and when it was all said
and done and taken care of,

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:47.186
this product cost me $2 to make.

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.731
So I'm selling them for 80 is the idea,

00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.726
but I needed marketing materials.

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:53.247
Any good company has them.

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:54.705
So again, I'm locked in a room

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:56.974
so I spent a little bit of
time writing a commercial,

00:06:56.974 --> 00:06:58.900
and then I went online and found out

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.651
that I can get a casting room.

00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:02.560
And you can get it for like $34.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.329
I put out an ad on LA casting

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.965
for people to audition for this.

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.515
People came in to play these roles

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:09.005
in the commercial I wrote.

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:11.558
And then to save money, I
pulled every favor I could

00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:14.040
and I sent buddies of
mine that make videos

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.926
and stuff like that to my
buddy's garage in Silver Lake

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:19.706
and they set up a shitty studio thing

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:22.411
in the garage where they did everything

00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:23.992
they could to shoot this commercial.

00:07:23.992 --> 00:07:28.659
And I directed the entire
thing on FaceTime in the room.

00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:32.284
And this is the commercial we made.

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:35.476
- [Narrator] You tear your
muscles to become stronger.

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:38.559
You learn to fall to become a dancer.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:44.259
You callous your fingers
to become a musician.

00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.546
Why is your immune system any different?

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.803
Introducing a tissue powered

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:54.555
by the human body, for the human body.

00:07:54.555 --> 00:07:57.039
This flu season, keep your immune system

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.067
feeling like your immune system.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.844
Vaev.

00:08:02.844 --> 00:08:07.261
- So that's the commercial.

00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:12.936
So once all that was put together,

00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:15.419
I distilled everything down
to a Squarespace website,

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:17.794
and it took like 15 minutes to set up.

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.508
It cost 18 bucks, super cheap.

00:08:19.508 --> 00:08:22.245
And I also marked the
product sold out on the store

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.015
so that it would seem that there was this

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:26.465
incredible demand for the
thing that doesn't exist.

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:29.032
Then I created a Twitter account,

00:08:29.032 --> 00:08:30.630
bought some followers, and I used that

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.801
to announce all day long that
we just ran out of stock.

00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:34.169
We sold out again,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.433
and also to retweet any article

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.148
that had something to do with Sean Parker

00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:40.479
so that people thought he had
something to do with this.

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.941
And he doesn't but, that's kinda cool.

00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:44.036
You can just do that if you want.

00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:45.756
It's easy.

00:08:45.756 --> 00:08:47.441
Then I set up this Instagram page

00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:50.200
that has one of these splashy grid things.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.413
I mean, it's bullshit but
it looks cool I think.

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:56.351
Spent like 50 bucks buying some followers

00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:58.710
and included our other little tagline,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.960
a tissue unlike any you've #UsedBefore.

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:06.216
So now I had a website, a Twitter
account, and an Instagram.

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:08.040
So once it was all in place, I was like

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.619
I need a focus group to tell me

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:12.833
if people like this, right?

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:15.670
So I went on Craigslist
and I searched like hey.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.765
I made a post.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.485
Does anybody wanna come by
and do this focus group?

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:19.768
I went online and found out

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.386
that you can rent a legit-looking

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:23.848
focus group center for like 150 bucks.

00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:25.611
And then I sent a camera crew to go

00:09:25.611 --> 00:09:28.165
behind the one-way glass, film everything.

00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:29.875
I also hit up my friend, Tien Tran,

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:31.171
who's an amazing comedian.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.012
So the first thing that
we did was a product demo

00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:36.447
so that I could make it
clear exactly how disgusting

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:39.048
and ridiculous this
product and this idea is,

00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:41.215
and here's what they said.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.338
- Okay.

00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:40.890
To go back to the question,
do people like it?

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.723
Yes.

00:11:41.723 --> 00:11:43.547
What?

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:45.282
So now that I had a product that people

00:11:45.282 --> 00:11:46.744
seemed to be connecting with,

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:48.788
I wanted to find out if
I could hire somebody.

00:11:48.788 --> 00:11:50.205
Now this would be the ultimate test

00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:51.672
of do people believe it?

00:11:51.672 --> 00:11:52.829
Would somebody think yeah,

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:54.105
I could work for a company like that.

00:11:54.105 --> 00:11:57.425
So I went back to Craigslist
and I made a post,

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.060
but I was look for
something really specific.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.964
Keep in mind, this company
has no real product,

00:12:00.964 --> 00:12:04.547
no plan, and I possibly
committing a crime.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.038
So there's only one type that's perfect

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:10.121
for this situation and that is a bro.

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:16.704
You need a bro for this,

00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:21.208
and I feel like I found a perfect bro.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:25.958
This guy, I'm talking about
Scotty Babbitt, AKA Blizzard.

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.297
As soon as I got the
email with this resume,

00:12:30.297 --> 00:12:32.984
I knew he was our guy
because he was in not one,

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:35.387
but two, fraternities in college.

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:37.046
And also, under every photo,

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:40.213
somebody had commented the word scoot.

00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:44.403
Even when he showed up,
his buttons on his shirt

00:12:44.403 --> 00:12:46.563
were buttoned incorrectly.

00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:48.230
So this was the guy.

00:12:49.183 --> 00:12:52.329
This was our guy.

00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:55.912
Now, I don't have an
office space for this,

00:12:57.315 --> 00:12:58.846
so I hit up my buddy and asked if

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:00.689
I could use his brother's office.

00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:02.715
And if you have a chain of white guys

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.272
hooking you up with stuff,
can you do anything you want?

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:05.105
Yes.

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:05.938
Is that problematic? Yes.

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:06.771
Do I have time to get to it?

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:08.363
No, let's move on.

00:13:08.363 --> 00:13:10.157
The head of customer service is the job

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:11.567
that he was interviewing for.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.640
So I brought him in for this interview

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.066
and my friend Kiel, who's a comedian,

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:17.069
was the one interviewing him.

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:20.965
We set up a webcam directly
in front of his face,

00:13:20.965 --> 00:13:22.831
but just said that it was for a higher up

00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:24.826
in the company to review
the interview later.

00:13:24.826 --> 00:13:27.756
So for this interview,
he's under the impression

00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:31.495
that he's taking real calls
from real angry customers,

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:33.581
but what he doesn't
know is that those real

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:36.883
angry customers are me in the room.

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:39.313
And the only instruction
that he's been given

00:13:39.313 --> 00:13:43.063
is to deny everything,
and no one can sue us.

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:45.248
And so we were like,
let's see if he does it.

00:13:45.248 --> 00:13:47.399
So the first thing I did was called

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:49.103
and said that my son is sick,

00:13:49.103 --> 00:13:53.353
and here is what Scott had
to say to this customer.

00:14:38.582 --> 00:14:39.415
- What?

00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:42.438
What!

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.782
That happened so fast.

00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:47.730
He denied everything.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.710
And then, unprompted, he started

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.996
to deny him that we, again,
never told him to deny.

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:59.496
Here's what happened a second
later in that interview.

00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:56.171
You can Google it!

00:15:57.755 --> 00:16:00.589
So Scott's hired.

00:16:00.589 --> 00:16:03.139
Give it up for Scott!

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:04.705
Wow!

00:16:04.705 --> 00:16:05.538
What?

00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:10.786
So again, back to do people believe it?

00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:11.739
Yes.

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:12.572
What?

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:13.651
People believe it.

00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:15.778
So kinda the last thing for me to do

00:16:15.778 --> 00:16:17.394
is find out what happens when I take

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:18.628
this product into the world.

00:16:18.628 --> 00:16:21.829
What happens if we've got Vaev
out there with people, right?

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:22.860
Will people use it?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.628
And most of the time when
companies have new products,

00:16:25.628 --> 00:16:30.128
they have a promo team go
out and hand out free units.

00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:34.960
And the truth is, I can't
afford a promo unit like this,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.259
but what I can afford is my
girlfriend and her two friends

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:42.176
who conveniently did used
to work for Red Bull.

00:16:43.407 --> 00:16:45.566
This really only cost me the 60 bucks

00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:47.918
to get these matching polos made.

00:16:47.918 --> 00:16:50.526
Unfortunately, the one real edge

00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:53.025
that a company like that
has is these cool cars,

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.135
and obviously this is crazy expensive

00:16:55.135 --> 00:16:56.924
and I'm hocking used tissues here.

00:16:56.924 --> 00:16:57.800
What was I gonna do?

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.004
Go on Amazon and get a bunch

00:16:59.004 --> 00:17:01.375
of shipping boxes and then
spray paint them black

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.836
and get my friend if I can borrow

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:04.533
his girlfriend's MINI Cooper?

00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:06.256
I mean yes, of course
that's what I'm gonna do.

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:07.208
Yes.

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:09.478
And that cost about 80 bucks in total.

00:17:09.478 --> 00:17:12.962
And then the most expensive
thing on the entire project

00:17:12.962 --> 00:17:14.554
is this photo booth that we rented.

00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:17.241
But we told people if you come in here

00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:19.328
and get a cool gif for your Instagram,

00:17:19.328 --> 00:17:20.898
you gotta use one of our used tissues.

00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:22.912
But even with all that, it
felt like there was still

00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:26.995
no way people will use
this on the street, right?

00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:37.616
- So again, will people use it?

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.330
Yes.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.364
Yes, they will use it.

00:18:40.364 --> 00:18:41.568
Do people believe it?

00:18:41.568 --> 00:18:42.401
Yes.

00:18:42.401 --> 00:18:43.234
Do people like it?

00:18:43.234 --> 00:18:44.067
Frankly too much.

00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:45.673
Really, I mean.

00:18:45.673 --> 00:18:48.287
So the last thing I did, this
was my last day in the room,

00:18:48.287 --> 00:18:50.148
I was like can I get some kinda press?

00:18:50.148 --> 00:18:51.243
So I went online.

00:18:51.243 --> 00:18:52.429
I didn't have a lot of time at all

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:54.182
and I just Googled like, hey,

00:18:54.182 --> 00:18:57.737
is there addresses of
newspapers or whatever

00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:58.688
that I can send this to?

00:18:58.688 --> 00:19:00.280
And then I put together these envelopes

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.538
with the Vaev in them.

00:19:01.538 --> 00:19:03.069
That cost me like 30 bucks for postage.

00:19:03.069 --> 00:19:05.865
It came with this little
postcard that says we're huge

00:19:05.865 --> 00:19:09.279
fans of you and that there's
a human sneeze in here.

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:13.504
And it even outlined that
this is being sent by Oliver,

00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:16.260
Oliver Niessen, the fictional Danish CEO

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.669
of his company that's not real.

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:20.272
Unfortunately I didn't have
a lot of time in the room,

00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:22.842
so I didn't make him a Facebook.

00:19:22.842 --> 00:19:24.411
I couldn't make him a
LinkedIn or anything.

00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:26.399
There's no information
about this guy anywhere.

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:29.255
So I think that's maybe where I messed up

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:31.554
on this part, because
this company has no sales,

00:19:31.554 --> 00:19:34.806
no CEO that you can find anywhere online.

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.943
It's not incorporated anywhere.

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:37.453
It's not a real company.

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:40.260
And a simple Google search
will reveal all that stuff.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.864
So it would have been nice to get

00:19:41.864 --> 00:19:43.034
a little clipping or something somewhere,

00:19:43.034 --> 00:19:45.790
but that is unfortunately the end,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.777
'cause there's no way anybody
would write about this.

00:19:49.777 --> 00:19:51.120
Right?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.600
- The world's boldest tissue company.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.675
It's called Vaev tissue.
- Vaev.

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:56.858
- Vaev.
- Vaev.

00:19:56.858 --> 00:19:57.853
- Vaev.
- Vaev Tissue.

00:19:57.853 --> 00:19:59.801
- Vaev.

00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.545
- Vaev.
- A pre-infected.

00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:04.053
- Used tissue.
- For 80 bucks.

00:20:04.053 --> 00:20:07.088
- $80 a pop, and this
one's apparently true.

00:20:07.088 --> 00:20:08.118
- Is this real?
- I don't know.

00:20:08.118 --> 00:20:09.525
- [Reporter] I guess it
was in time magazine.

00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:11.263
- It's used tissues for $80.

00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:12.204
It's incredible.

00:20:12.204 --> 00:20:13.554
- [Reporter] Fox news says the tissues

00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:15.042
have been sold out for months now.

00:20:15.042 --> 00:20:16.966
- Tissues are in high demand.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.539
Used tissues.

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:19.372
- You ready?

00:20:19.372 --> 00:20:20.205
- No!

00:20:20.205 --> 00:20:21.038
I can't believe you just did that.

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:21.871
No!

00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:23.911
- The company apparently has customers.

00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:24.932
- I wanna see those people.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:25.923
- This is nasty.

00:20:25.923 --> 00:20:26.809
Plain old nasty.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.190
- I would never wanna go near them.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.440
- There's over 200 different
types of rhinovirus.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.480
Are you gonna stuff 200 different types

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.273
of tissues in your nose?

00:20:34.273 --> 00:20:35.106
- It's expensive.

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:35.939
It's dangerous.

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:36.988
It's disgusting and it won't work,

00:20:36.988 --> 00:20:38.931
so naturally it is sold out.

00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:40.794
Introducing, Dead.

00:20:40.794 --> 00:20:44.127
You've contracted giardia on your terms.

00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:46.929
- [Narrator] This flu season,
keep your immune system

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:49.969
feeling like your immune system.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.878
- Okay, I know, I know, I know!

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.558
But these tissues are so popular

00:20:56.558 --> 00:20:59.871
that the company says
that they have sold out.

00:20:59.871 --> 00:21:01.788
What do you guys think?

00:21:04.256 --> 00:21:07.673
- So the question is how did this happen?

00:21:14.553 --> 00:21:17.357
So to break it down, what happened was

00:21:17.357 --> 00:21:18.847
I put those in those envelopes

00:21:18.847 --> 00:21:20.834
and the only people that got back to me,

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:24.393
I don't know why, was Time Magazine.

00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:27.372
And we exchanged a couple of emails,

00:21:27.372 --> 00:21:29.480
and then after I left the room,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.111
over the period of a couple of months,

00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:33.529
I did a bunch of phone interviews

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:37.601
as the fictional Danish
CEO, Oliver Niessen.

00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:41.488
And then Time published
a seven-page writeup

00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:43.896
about this company that was packed

00:21:43.896 --> 00:21:48.074
with lies that this
CEO, whatever guy said,

00:21:48.074 --> 00:21:52.237
like a human sneeze is
safer than needles or pills.

00:21:52.237 --> 00:21:55.533
I told them that we have

00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:58.471
a stable of 10 go-to sneezers.

00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:04.885
And when they asked me whether
or not I pay the sneezers,

00:22:04.885 --> 00:22:06.932
I said I would rather not address

00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:09.849
my relationship with those people.

00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:14.430
So the headline came out
and it is a little careful.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.254
This is good journalism on the part

00:22:16.254 --> 00:22:17.543
of Mandy Oaklander at Time.

00:22:17.543 --> 00:22:19.367
She included all this information

00:22:19.367 --> 00:22:21.050
about maybe it's real, maybe it's not.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.899
This is a question.

00:22:21.899 --> 00:22:23.559
Is it real, right?

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:26.287
But the problem is other journalists

00:22:26.287 --> 00:22:28.333
at every different publication

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.935
who I did not speak to didn't bother

00:22:30.935 --> 00:22:33.397
to read the seven-page Time article,

00:22:33.397 --> 00:22:36.047
and then started running
their own stories about it.

00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:38.935
They used words like virus-infested
and disease-infected.

00:22:38.935 --> 00:22:39.831
It's crazy.

00:22:39.831 --> 00:22:43.126
Even the Time Magazine
hyperlink that they posted

00:22:43.126 --> 00:22:44.839
is way scarier than the real headline.

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:47.578
Vaev, The $80 Used Tissue
Designed to Make You Sick.

00:22:47.578 --> 00:22:49.054
That's terrifying!

00:22:49.054 --> 00:22:50.482
And I didn't say anything to Time

00:22:50.482 --> 00:22:51.740
that was verifiable at all.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.381
If any of these other publications

00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:54.981
had looked into it or read it,

00:22:54.981 --> 00:22:55.832
they would have thought something

00:22:55.832 --> 00:22:59.647
beyond we'll just run
this, but they did anyway.

00:22:59.647 --> 00:23:01.182
And the question is kind of why?

00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:04.239
And I think the answer is
it's exciting, you know?

00:23:04.239 --> 00:23:05.819
If you're trying to sell ads

00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:07.918
and get social engagement
and run commercials,

00:23:07.918 --> 00:23:09.326
your story doesn't have to be true.

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:11.290
It just has to be exciting.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.840
When Fox News posted this,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.516
their entire comment section explodes,

00:23:15.516 --> 00:23:17.219
like hundreds and then thousands

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:19.063
of comments about this
that say stuff like,

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.521
sounds like a liberal idea.

00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:24.688
And Obamacare would probably cover it.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.606
But it's not just people that hated it.

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:30.035
Every time another one of
these articles came out,

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:33.450
the product itself that has no evidence

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.398
of existing anywhere
online became more real.

00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:37.907
Every time something came out,

00:23:37.907 --> 00:23:39.205
I would get a ton of emails asking

00:23:39.205 --> 00:23:40.824
when we were gonna restock,

00:23:40.824 --> 00:23:43.269
or if I had a baby-strength version

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:45.607
that you could give to your toddler.

00:23:45.607 --> 00:23:47.449
But I think that's kinda the crazy thing.

00:23:47.449 --> 00:23:50.045
It's like you can manipulate
the international media

00:23:50.045 --> 00:23:53.587
if you have like 900 bucks
and take one Photoshop class.

00:23:53.587 --> 00:23:55.034
You can do this.

00:23:55.034 --> 00:23:57.733
But also, please don't do this.

00:23:58.714 --> 00:24:01.080
Don't lie to people.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.980
It's bad.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.691
That's the one thing I
learned in this entire process

00:24:03.691 --> 00:24:07.088
is that I suck for doing this, you know?

00:24:07.088 --> 00:24:09.841
Even the used tissue
idea itself was divisive.

00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:11.476
People didn't know if they hated it

00:24:11.476 --> 00:24:13.106
and wanted to leave mean comments,

00:24:13.106 --> 00:24:15.094
or if they loved it and wanted a restock.

00:24:15.094 --> 00:24:17.374
But the one thing that was perfectly clear

00:24:17.374 --> 00:24:20.019
that everyone unanimously agreed on

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:23.189
is that I am extremely unlikeable.

00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:19.313
- Thank you so much, everyone!
