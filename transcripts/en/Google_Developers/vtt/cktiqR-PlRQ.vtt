00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.630
JEREMY WALKER: Hi all.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.110
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.320
We have a great show today.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.660
We're going to talk to 9x9 TV.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.030
So let's get started.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.110
We have William Sheu,
VP of Engineering.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.310
I'm Jimmy Walker.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.010
We have special guests from
New York, Ikai Lan.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.270
IKAI LAN: I am a very
special guest.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.990
No, I'm visiting headquarters
this week.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.130
JEREMY WALKER: Visiting
headquarters.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.730
THOMAS DELL: He's
very special.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.710
JEREMY WALKER: And then
we have Thomas

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.770
Dell, who's a developer.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.580
So let's get started.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.830
We're going to go and talk
about the company first.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.920
And then we'll dive into
some demos, and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440
we'll talk tech stuff.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650
So what is 9x9 TV?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.320
WILLIAM SHEU: All
right, 9x9 TV.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.050
9x9 TV is a Silicon
Valley company.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.080
We are headquartered
in Santa Clara.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.620
And then we have international
office in Taipei and Beijing.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.860
We are funded by venture
capital, and also there are

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.800
some corporate investor.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.550
And so, we are doing
good so far.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.150
JEREMY WALKER: OK, so what is
the goal behind 9x9 TV?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.640
WILLIAM SHEU: Essentially, the
goal is that we try to create

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.260
a next-generation platform to
allow the user to enjoy the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.050
internet video on their
choice of screen.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.430
For example, the screen can
be a phone, a tablet,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.360
computer, or TV.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.420
But the thing is that the word
"enjoy" is a big word.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
You know people have different
level of the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140
fitting for the enjoy.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.510
So how exactly people enjoy
watching internet

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.720
video is big deal.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.340
So, we identify a true problem,
we try to solve.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.560
The first problem is what to
watch, since there are

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.500
millions and billions of
video in the internet.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.620
For example, I think YouTube
has maybe like one hour of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.145
video uploaded per second.

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.810
That's huge, all right?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.990
So then people simply will
get lost in this massive

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.040
amount of the video.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.250
So the first problem
is what to watch.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460
The second is how--
how to watch it.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.870
So people have this intention
to watch on tablet, on a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.700
phone, and on TV.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.190
And each device have its
own special feature.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.890
So 9x9 tried to come out
different user interface

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.020
design, and to provide different
user experience

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.030
which will allow the user to
enjoy watching internet video

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.020
on those devices to the most.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.630
JEREMY WALKER: So very much
video discovery, and finding

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.130
what you'd want to watch.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.520
WILLIAM SHEU: Exactly

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.661
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.300
So tell me about the name 9x9.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.710
Where did that come about?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.300
WILLIAM SHEU: OK.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.840
Yeah, this is interesting.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.060
It's actually not a
random pick name.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.670
There's actually an interesting
story behind this.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.150
So this actually will come
back to our initial

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.020
design of the UI.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.400
Because as you can understand,
that our idea is that to try

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.810
to provide a user what
to watch the best.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.010
So we have this philosophy
of less is more.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.960
Less complexity is simplicity.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.610
So if a less resource
[INAUDIBLE], people will

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.440
become more happy because
there's a small--

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.660
less hassle to deal with.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.935
So based on this philosophy,
our UI designs

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:30.590
are come out of design.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.400
And the design is a grip with
nine row by nine column.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.720
And so, and we look at the UI
design and say, oh, why don't

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.756
we call the company 9x9?

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.940
And so that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.900
Everybody is now happy.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.610
Oh, that's the name of
the company, 9x9.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.880
There, we have the name.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.320
Here we go.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.240
9x9 TV here in the
Google Campus.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.200
JEREMY WALKER: Awesome.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.610
WILLIAM SHEU: This--

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.990
I'm not making up this story.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.610
This is true.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.575
I think Thomas can--

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:56.980
JEREMY WALKER: Attest to it.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.060
WILLIAM SHEU: --certify
this is accurate.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.750
THOMAS DELL: It kind of locks us
into a user interface which

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.310
we're, you can see, that it's
not going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.790
IKAI LAN: So what was your code
before you officially

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.730
named the company?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.950
WILLIAM SHEU: Well, we have
a few code name before.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.540
But yeah, I don't want
to talk about that.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.420
JEREMY WALKER: So I was messing
around with your app,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.630
and I noticed something that was
called Day Parting which

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.310
you guys do.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.360
And I don't think a lot of
people know what that is.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.630
Actually, I didn't know what
it was till I looked it up.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.520
But can you tell us what Day
Parting is, because I think

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.637
that's kind of important
for your app.

00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:34.000
It's kind of a neat feature.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.930
WILLIAM SHEU: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.710
As you know that, we try to
provide the most relevant

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.200
video for people to watch, OK?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.760
And we try to think about, and
try to exam people's watching

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.570
behavior on the TV.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.040
And we notice that people
actually want to watch certain

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.320
video at a certain
time of the day.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.230
For example, when you wake up
in the morning, you have the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.280
expectation to watch
morning news.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.780
And then, after the day, you
may want to watch something

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.220
more relaxing, OK?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.000
And in the night, you want
to watch something--

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.850
you don't want people
to know about it.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.270
WILLIAM SHEU: So in the sense
that we try to understand

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.530
people's watching behavior, and
then we come out this idea

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.050
of Day Parting Essentially, we
tried to divide the video into

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.310
different categories, and assign
a category to different

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.620
time of the day.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.830
And we then allocate those video
into our user interface

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.220
design, so that when you visit
our website or use tablet, or,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.720
later on, use Google TV, then
you will watch certain video

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.740
at that time.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.630
Again, this is a fundamental
philosophy of less is more.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.750
We don't give you more video.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.450
We'll give you less video, and
you actually will enjoy more.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.190
That's the whole idea
behind this.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.030
And then, we also spent a lot of
time doing this, more than

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.960
just select video randomly.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.930
We have algorithms which try to
figure out a lot of video,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.100
a lot of channel.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.930
And then, the curator, which
is provides human touch.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.620
Then we'll select--

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.320
hand-pick from those
automatically filtered video

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.960
or channel, then compose
the best list of

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.840
video for you to watch.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.140
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.280
So you're kind of curating at
two levels-- an algorithm

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.170
level and a user level.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.820
WILLIAM SHEU: Absolutely.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.610
We believe that's the
best combination.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.560
Another company doing this
by algorithm only.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.650
And we believe that without
human touch, the video won't

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.780
have its own style, won't have
its taste that [INAUDIBLE] to

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.140
particular group of people.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.570
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.650
Well, let's stop talking and
let's start demoing, because I

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.810
think I always like to see what
we're talking about just

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.580
to get an idea of-- because I'm
a visual person-- just to

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.810
get an idea of what's going on.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.360
So let's--

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.630
I think we're starting with the
tablet, and then we'll go

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.380
to Google TV, so.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.040
THOMAS DELL: This is
our tablet app.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.890
Turn on the tablet.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.700
Is that visible on the screen?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.818
OK.

00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:20.740
Now we'll just start it.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.340
And this is actually accessing
a YouTube account.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.880
And so these subscriptions that
we see are actually kept

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.780
by YouTube.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.300
And we can either handle our own
subscriptions, or YouTube

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.840
can handle it.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.930
You can use your YouTube
subscriptions.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.944
Either way is.

00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:44.680
OK, so what we have here is
a Day Part at the top.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.170
And this is a channel selected
for this particular time of

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.400
day, and based on your other
usage behaviors.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.890
And on the right, the first
channel, when this opens up,

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.740
this is what we call
a virtual channel.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.360
And this is a mix of content
from all of these channels.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.430
But if we want to, we can enter
one of the channels

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.350
specifically.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.690
And I'm going to go to
our subscriptions.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.560
And so this on the right
are episodes

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.150
from all these channels.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.350
And we'll pick the Google Talks
since we're at Google.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.660
JEREMY WALKER: Nice.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.050
THOMAS DELL: Now that I've
selected this, these are all

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.220
episodes from one channel,
from Google Talks.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.720
And, let's play one.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.690
OK, so at the bottom
here are the other

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.940
episodes in this channel.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.049
We can subscribe to this channel
or unsubscribe to it.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.931
If we don't want to watch
this episode, we can--

00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:48.960
I'm doing this from a funny
angle-- we flip to the next

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.560
episode by going
left to right.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.990
We could also flip by going
up and down to different

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.860
channels, but we're not
going to do that.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.370
We can move around inside of an
episode by just adjusting

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.890
this or pausing.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.030
One of the features that I can't
show you because of the

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.790
set up in here is we can take
whatever's showing on this,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.280
and we can throw it onto a
television by clicking on

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.810
Watch on TV.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.130
So this shows us actually that
there is a Google TV available

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.260
in the room.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.660
Unfortunately, we don't
have enough cameras

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.580
to show it to you.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.050
But if I clicked on this button,
this video would start

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.280
playing on the television
over there.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.940
And this allows you in your
living room to pick what you

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.940
want to see on the tablet, and
then broadcast it on-- or,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.893
just throw it out to
the television.

00:09:41.893 --> 00:09:42.620
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.340
And this is available--

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.255
the tablet one is the available
now in Google Play?

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:50.630
THOMAS DELL: Yes, this is
currently in Google Play, yes.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.260
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.990
Well, let's have a look at
the Google TV version.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.090
This is pretty neat. too.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.300
And yeah, we apologize to
the users out there.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.190
We didn't have the setup to
let them fling it on.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.890
But anyway, you can fling
your video onto

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.800
this application here.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.320
And, do you want to walk
through, William?

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.860
WILLIAM SHEU: Sure.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.030
Jeremy allow me to
maybe reclick a

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.680
commercial message here.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.910
So 9x9 TV is now in the Google
Play, so you're welcome to

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.560
download it.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.590
And I'd like to use one quote
from a TechCrunch article

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.180
about 9x9 TV.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.300
This is cool.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.040
"If you are one of those people
with an Android device,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.330
and cannot figure out what type
of video to watch, please

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.850
download from Google Play store
and then try it out." So

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.210
this is some--

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.210
we consider as a compliment
from TechCrunch.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.730
So I think that's--

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.980
hopefully now you can download
it and give it a try.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.010
OK, now I'm going to do to show
you the Google TV version

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.230
of the same concept.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.470
This version is still under
developing, and should be

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.380
released in the next
few weeks.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:04.230
So this version has the same
idea in terms of Day Parting.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.790
So as you can see
on the screen,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.620
there's a morning show.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.850
And the first position
in the grid of the

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.090
3x3 grid is All Updates.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:21.160
So essentially, all the new apps
will be list in this All

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.210
Updates channel.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.880
We call this kind of channel
virtual channel.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.950
And the rest of the channel
is the real channel.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.610
So if we can flip through the
channel, and then you pick any

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.390
channel to watch.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.710
So this is the morning show.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:43.820
And similar to the tablet
version, we also have On

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.400
Previously.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.180
So the On Previously with
the morning news, OK?

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.920
So with a remote control, you
can simply use the left and

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.520
right, up and down to navigate,
to reposition, and

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.650
to choose any channel
to watch.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.540
So we can do that by simply
click right, and right.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.390
And then go to this,
Following page.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.520
Because I've assigned this
to this app previously.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.210
And so, we have this Following
page from my own subscription.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.700
So now we can play one video
from this All Updates.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.480
OK, we can play one
video here.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.930
JEREMY WALKER: This will go
into all your updates.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.140
So does the left and-- or, left
and right to the screen,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.860
those go to different
Day Parting things?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.240
WILLIAM SHEU: Yes, exactly.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:45.980
The Day Parting we use, the
channel we consider as a

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.010
default channel.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.220
So in addition to the default
channel for everybody, we

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:58.110
actually allow the user to
import the channel from your

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.500
own subscription form YouTube,
or subscription from 9x9 TV

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.360
JEREMY WALKER: So you have
Following, you have your own

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.630
subscriptions, and
you have the Day

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.760
Parting, so you can kind--

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.080
WILLIAM SHEU: Exactly,
exactly.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.720
JEREMY WALKER: --of go with
whichever one best fits.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.940
WILLIAM SHEU: In the future,
we actually will assign

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.330
different channels from
your subscriptions

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.630
into the Day Parting.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.710
For example, your subscription,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.270
you have CNN news.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.040
And then we will assign
CNN news to the

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.340
morning news section.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.550
Maybe you have some other, more
interesting channel you

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.610
like watch in the night,
or you are prone to

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.880
watch in the night.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.600
Then we were assign those
channel into the Primetime or

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.710
[INAUDIBLE] session of
the Day Parting.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.430
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.940
WILLIAM SHEU: So, yeah, this
is the Google TV demo.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.340
JEREMY WALKER: Great, well,
now Ikai, I know you're

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.260
waiting to get into
the details.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.870
So let's get into some
of those questions.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.740
IKAI LAN: Absolutely.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.620
So Tom, first off, I don't think
we fully introduced what

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.280
you do for 9x9.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.410
THOMAS DELL: I wrote this app.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.720
I wrote our web app, also, and
part of the back-end--

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.880
the part dealing with
the synchronization.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.360
IKAI LAN: So that's a web app,
that's an Android app, and a

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.480
Google TV app, which are same
thing, if I'm not mistaken--

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.810
THOMAS DELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.010
IKAI LAN: --as well
as well as a--

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.920
THOMAS DELL: Yeah, we actually
have one app that determines

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.250
what it's running on, and
then acts accordingly.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.180
IKAI LAN: So what technology
stacks did you use to build

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.070
this product on top of?

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.780
THOMAS DELL: Well, on the web,
we used jQuery But actually,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.710
on Android, we don't use
very many stacks.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.420
We use we use the
APIs directly.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.830
And I don't even use
fragments for this.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.110
So I'm kind of anti-platform
when it comes to dealing with

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.100
mobile apps.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.940
But it's just like if it's
not in the API, I--

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.720
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.970
Did you look into any using
jQuery for the web front-end?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.060
I mean, did you look into
using any front-end

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.320
frameworks?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.350
And if not, if didn't
choose any, why not?

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.830
THOMAS DELL: Well, we used
some libraries with the

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.430
front-- with the
web front-end.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.030
But, are you referring to mobile
front-end frameworks?

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.480
IKAI LAN: I'm referring to kind
of like the full stack

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.760
frameworks, like-- not
necessarily full stack, but

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.380
more MVP or MVC frameworks,
like Angler, JS or--

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.460
Backbone's not really a
framework, but some of these

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.240
are the options out there.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.450
THOMAS DELL: I think frameworks
lock you into

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.800
certain ways of thinking.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.590
And if I can't do with--

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.630
there better be a really
compelling advantage to using

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.150
a framework.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.900
And I think jQuery is an example
of a framework that

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.570
makes the development much, much
easier, like by an order

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.570
of magnitude, probably.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.450
But unless I get that kind of a
gain, or if I don't need to

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.530
use a specific framework,
I'm not going to.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.340
Because it just makes it harder
to back it out and

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.020
change something, or to do
something unanticipated.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.010
IKAI LAN: What did you enjoy
most about building this

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.950
application?

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.290
THOMAS DELL: For a mobile app,
it's actually very nice to be

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.460
able to hold what you're doing,
and have it show up on

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.430
the TV, as well.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.940
Making things that run
on television is

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.430
inherently neat, I think.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.240
IKAI LAN: So was there a moment
when it was on a Google

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.600
TV, and you were kind of blown
away that you were able to put

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.550
this up there?

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.590
THOMAS DELL: Well, I think
it moves a little

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.680
bit slower than that.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.600
You don't suddenly have
something that's on Google TV.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.210
So there's no blown
away moment.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.920
But it's very pleasing to have
what you're doing on your

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.270
television, and almost
far more than

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.550
almost any other platform.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.890
The mobile device
comes second.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.220
The web is not nearly
so exciting

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.890
when it comes to that.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.810
IKAI LAN: So did you have any
challenges when you were

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.290
building this application?

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.480
THOMAS DELL: Our biggest
challenge is actually with

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.590
user interfaces, because there
are some complex concepts here

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.600
with channels, groups of
channels, episodes.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.210
And it's very difficult to
convey to the user what

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.490
they're actually doing.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.180
And it's very hard for them to
realize, oh, I'm looking at

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.230
this, and this is the type of
data that I'm looking at, or

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.380
the type of content that
I'm looking at.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.359
And it's very easy
to get it wrong.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:15.770
And a lot of other applications
do get it wrong.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.960
And so it's--

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.099
IKAI LAN: Did you find that--

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.260
is there a process you guys
have in place for

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.579
validating a UI?

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.589
Like, you go through a couple of
iterations, maybe somebody

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.240
of these guys look at and say,
whoa, I have no idea

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.140
what's going on.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.490
THOMAS DELL: Yeah.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.480
And we try to bring in
outsiders, people who aren't

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.910
tainted by having used it
before, and have them try it,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.270
find out what they're confused
about, and then iterate

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.520
through that, as well.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.310
IKAI LAN: In building this
application, what's burning on

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.430
your backlog that you
just want to do?

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.300
At least from a technical
standpoint, not from a product

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.020
or future standpoint.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.700
THOMAS DELL: From a technical
standpoint, we still have some

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.950
issues with--

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.130
just some of APIs make it
difficult to do some of the

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.210
things we want to do.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:05.690
Because a lot of the Google APIs
our fine if you're doing

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.730
what they expect you to do.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.560
But if you go off the script,
if you want to do something

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.270
that the authors of the API
didn't expect you to do, often

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.970
it becomes quite difficult.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:21.040
And some of the other APIs, just
outside of this app, like

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.080
the new HTTP--

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.650
the web view API, for
instance, has

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.260
had some issues with--

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.110
there's many, many methods.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.870
And yet, there's no
method to view the

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.550
content of the web API.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.720
So it's like something
fundamentally basic is missing

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.200
because whoever designed the
API wouldn't necessarily be

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.350
thinking in that direction.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.850
And we run into this a little
bit here with us wanting to

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.290
display things on the screen
in certain ways.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.180
And that's difficult
with this API.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.950
But it's a little harder
to explain then.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.750
WILLIAM SHEU: There's one thing
that I'd like to add.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.720
You can see that we try to
provide the best user

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.090
experience possible.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.040
So if frequently we
push to the limit.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.760
We are on the cutting edge,
or a bleeding edge.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.610
So constantly, I push Tom to--

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.510
can you do this, can
you do that?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.810
If it doesn't work, or if this
API doesn't do what we want,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.370
can we work around with it?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.940
So we frequently in
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.600
kind of push into limit so that
user can get what they

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.690
wanted best.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.100
So that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.980
IKAI LAN: So, I have a more
general question for both you

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.560
guys, then, which is, if you
could go back to when you guys

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.980
first started building
this, what advice

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.230
would you give yourself?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.960
One thing.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.300
If you could take
one thing back.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.960
THOMAS DELL: I don't even know
how to answer that question.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.770
IKAI LAN: Probably should
have warned you

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.120
about that one, right?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.420
THOMAS DELL: We actually
originally started building

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.310
apps using something
called XBMC.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.890
I don't know if you've
heard of it.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.130
IKAI LAN: I'm familiar
with XBMC.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.690
THOMAS DELL: And so XBMC wasn't
really up to making

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.310
apps inside it, so I modified
the internals of XBMC to make

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.730
it so that we could
build apps.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:02.150
But still, XBMC is not a stable
enough platform to do

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.980
what we want.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.020
And actually, to Android's
credit, Android is plenty

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.770
stable for this kind of thing.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.580
And this is far more stable than
our XBMC app ever was.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.440
IKAI LAN: So I guess what you
would say to yourself is,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.720
don't even bother.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.190
Just start with Android.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.980
THOMAS DELL: I probably
would say, let's not

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.070
even look at the XBMC.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.240
I like XBMC a lot.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.950
And XBMC does what it's
designed to do.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.100
But we were trying to twist it
into something that it wasn't

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.495
designed to do.

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.350
WILLIAM SHEU: Yeah, I can try
to answer that question.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.560
The [INAUDIBLE] in that will
be typical answer.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.540
Because our [INAUDIBLE], the
audience keeps changing, and

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.440
we have a partner, they
have certain request.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.900
So the dilemma is always that
how much our visibility is.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.960
Frequently, our visibility may
be one month, three months,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.320
very short.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.660
But our schedule
is very tight.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.950
So we kind of juggle it around
between the delivery and then

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.310
compare it to good planning,
or even a good design.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.540
But the goal is that we
try to come out with

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.850
the best code possible.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.650
And then we can deliver the
product in time so that our

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.440
partner can use it for the pilot
for the demo, and our BD

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.980
guy can also use it to pursue
our audience outside.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.260
So that's kind of
typical answer.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.840
But it's very true here,
particularly while using

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.350
something also very new.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.980
So yeah, that's it--

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.700
something I'd like to
share with you.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.420
JEREMY WALKER: OK, great.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.710
IKAI LAN: That's all
interesting stuff.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.210
Is there anything else
you'd like to share

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.086
with us on the show?

00:21:31.086 --> 00:21:32.336
With the viewers, perhaps?

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.620
WILLIAM SHEU: Or you can
compliment or complain or--

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.760
THOMAS DELL: Yeah, the API--

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.050
actually, the YouTube bit.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.210
We used several APIs in this.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.850
We used the YouTube
Player API.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:55.750
And we use a OAuth API to login,
and get access to your

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.750
subscriptions.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.350
And we also use the
YouTube Data API.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.800
And actually, the combination
of those is pretty good.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:10.120
And the YouTube Player
API is new, but

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.270
actually, it's pretty solid.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.660
I still wish we could do certain
things, like we want

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.370
to have title cards which
take over the screen.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.160
And some of the aspects of this
API interfere with what

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.110
we want to try and do.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.540
And I hope that you guys
are willing to--

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.170
actually, the biggest problem
is with the YouTube--

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.180
I mean, with the OAuth API.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.330
And that is, someone with
YouTube subscriptions is

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.670
forced to actually create a
YouTube channel in order for

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.890
us to access those YouTube
subscriptions.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.520
And this doesn't make much
sense at all to the user.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.290
It's kind of absurd that
you have to do this.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:49.280
And that's something I really
wish would be fixed.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.060
JEREMY WALKER: We're
looking into that.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.740
But for the audience out there,
what he's saying is,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.830
basically, you can create a
Google account, but then you

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.520
have to go through an extra
accepting thing terms to

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.650
create a channel, and then so
you guys can do stuff with.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.340
THOMAS DELL: Because you can
subscribe to things, and it's

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.610
still not accessible.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.050
And it tells the user, I think
the message is, this is not

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.200
linked to YouTube.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.700
Which is, well, they're
using it on YouTube.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.120
Of course it's linked.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.190
JEREMY WALKER: We definitely
know about that, and we're

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.240
looking into it, so.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.650
THOMAS DELL: There's a lot
of confusion on the

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.560
web about this, so.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.750
IKAI LAN: But really confusing,
both to the users

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.750
and our developers.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.820
So it's one of these things
where we look at it and we

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.880
think, well, developers, we
definitely don't want to be

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.820
confusing developers.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.710
But users, for sure, and when
I started using the YouTube

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.320
API, that was the first
thing I ran into.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.090
Also, on not my main account.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.330
I didn't run into this
for a long time.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.490
And then I created a new test
account, and I was like, why

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.320
am I getting this error?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.390
THOMAS DELL: Yeah,
this is crazy.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.650
IKAI LAN: Again, for anyone
that's watching who's anyone

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.650
who's thinking about building
YouTube, the first thing you

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.530
want to do have your users
create a channel because then

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.050
you won't get this
error message.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.471
And we're looking at things we
can do to streamline this a

00:23:52.471 --> 00:23:52.930
little bit more.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.170
But thank you for that.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.670
That's very, very useful
information for developers.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.500
Jeremy?

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.770
JEREMY WALKER: Well, let's
go to the questions.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.560
We only have one, and I
think may be for you.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:02.890
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.780
JEREMY WALKER: Is developer
relations hiring?

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.650
IKAI LAN: Is this--

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.570
did you set this up?

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.170
I feel like this is something
Jeremy puts into--

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:11.580
who's it by?

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.200
JEREMY WALKER: It was
by Jeremy Walker.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.970
IKAI LAN: Jeremy Walker.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:13.870
Wow, what a coincidence.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.370
There's someone out there with
the same name as you.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.280
The answer is, yes,
we are hiring.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.330
We're hiring in multiple sites
across the world, mainly in

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:21.800
Mountain View.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.796
But we also have developer
relations positions open in

00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:25.310
New York City.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.240
I believe we have some
in our London office.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.810
Just definitely go to
developers.google.com/--

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.480
I think it's either "jobs" or
"careers." I think it's

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:31.830
"jobs."

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.360
JEREMY WALKER: "Jobs."

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.790
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.660
And you'll see a list
of our openings.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.810
And do join us.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.670
We get to do fun stuff.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.280
The most fun of all is
interacting with developers,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.420
which it's a must have if you
want to work for this group.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.850
And sometimes it's a little
tough, but for the most part,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.590
I love my job.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.390
And Jeremy, you do, too.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.420
JEREMY WALKER: Same here.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.450
Well, thanks to our guests for
coming on and talking a little

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.868
bit about your app here,
technical details.

00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:00.386
And I think that's
all we got today.

00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:01.080
WILLIAM SHEU: OK, thank you.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.670
Glad to be here.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.860
IKAI LAN: Thank you
guys very much.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.110
WILLIAM SHEU: Bye.
