00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.100
As any teacher will tell you, when you’re
dealing with certain elements that are being

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.410
feisty and fidgety and basically not cooperating,
there’s pretty much only one thing you can

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.220
do: you gotta keep ‘em separated.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.769
And there’s a whole system of biological
tissue that’s dedicated to doing just that

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.529
-- creating order where there would otherwise
be total mayhem.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.199
Because you and pretty much every other animal
is made up of incredibly complex, feisty, fidgety

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.679
systems that need to be kept apart to some
extent if they’re going to get anything done.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.329
Think of it this way: Say all the middle-schoolers
in your town wanted to have lunch together.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.820
At the same time. On Taco Tuesday.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.860
If you crammed everyone into one giant lunchroom,
you’d have a lot of interesting and talented

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
people in one place, yes, but you’d also
never get a handle on them with everyone shoved

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.519
and talking, and jostling, and flirting, and farting, and
and stepping on toes, and haggling over tater tots.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.260
It’d be like a John Hughes movie gone horribly
wrong.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.619
So what you need is a solid system of organization
-- like, separate lunch lines for separate

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.859
groups of kids, or tables that arrange students
in alphabetical order. Your body is like that

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.739
crowded lunchroom -- it needs order for it
to function. It can’t have your liver all

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.380
up in your brain, or squished between your
kidneys. Your organs and their systems need

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.549
their personal space.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.909
And that is where your unsung epithelial tissue
steps in, like a burly gym teacher with a

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.380
whistle and plan.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.250
This is the tissue that lines, and covers,
and generally organizes your body, creating

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.830
order from what would be chaos. Without
epithelial tissue, you’d essentially be

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.490
a mushy pile of unarticulated goo.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.479
When we talk about your epithelial tissue
we’re really talking about two things. There’s

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.789
the “proper” epithelium, which covers
and lines your outer and inner body. And then

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.380
there is the glandular epithelium, which forms
glands and secretes hormones and other substances.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.400
Your primary epithelium protects your whole
body, inside and out. It’s a great organizer,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.560
partitioning everything into separate but
connected units. It covers the surface of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.270
your body when it combines with connective
tissue to create skin, but it also lines your

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.390
body cavities, and coats the internal and
external walls of many of your organs.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.330
Because, your body doesn’t just interact
with the outside world through your skin.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.980
We -- and all animals from the simplest worms
on up the Tree of Life -- are really just

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.849
tubes, corridors of tissue running from a
mouth to an anus. Epithelial tissue covers

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.229
both the inside and the outside of that you-tube.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.960
To get a better sense of what I mean, take
a look at this balloon. The latex is like

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.010
the outer covering of your body, in part made
up of epithelial tissue. It separates what’s

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.860
inside the balloon from the rest of the world.
Now if I stick my hand in there, you can see

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.560
how, while the tissue still forms an outer
layer, it also folds in on itself, creating

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.840
a continuous barrier that lines all of the
cavities.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
In a very similar way, the membranes covering
your lungs for example, are actually invaginations

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.020
of your epithelium -- where the tissue that
makes up your you-tube folds to form a cavity

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.160
-- just like this balloon when I push my fingers
into it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.140
The epithelium does all this to protect your
deeper layers of tissue from injury or infection

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.500
-- like for example, by lining your stomach
with epithelial cells that produce mucus,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.450
so that you don’t digest yourself along
with your lunch.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.650
And all of your epithelial tissues are avascular
-- meaning they don't have a blood supply.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.620
Instead they rely on the blood supply in the
supporting connective tissues around them

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.120
for the materials they need.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.890
But these tissues come in different varieties
that serve different purposes.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.670
And a lot of what classifies the different
types of epithelium boils down to their shape

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.969
and layering -- that is, the shape of the individual
cells, and the number of layers that they form in.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.930
And there are three basic shapes -- squamous,
cuboidal, and columnar -- and they’re pretty

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.280
easy to tell apart because (unlike most terminology
you’ll be exposed to in this course) their

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.600
names actually describe what they look like!

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.720
Squamous cells are flat. Their name means
“scale,” and they look kind of squished,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.160
like fish scales. Even the cell’s nucleus, which gets
darkly stained and is usually easy to see, is flattened.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.799
Cuboidal cells are -- you guessed it -- cube-ish
shaped, about as tall as they are wide. They

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.579
absorb nutrients and produce secretions, like
sweat. Their nucleus is pretty circular.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.320
Columnar cells are tall and thick and look
like columns, and they cushion underlying tissues.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.600
And as if they were cuboidal cells that got stretched
tall, their nuclei also are stretched into an ellipse.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.580
And here’s yet another instance where the
form of a structure relates to it purpose.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.230
In this case, the shape of each kind of epithelial
cell correlates with its function.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.670
For example, squamous cells are flat, which
makes it easy for materials like oxygen to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.450
move across them to the other side. So we
see these kinds of cells where absorption

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.840
or transportation is most important, like in say,
the air sacs of your lungs, or in your blood vessels.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.660
But if the cells that make up a tissue need
to, say, brew up hormones or mucus, they’ll

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.210
need the internal machinery it takes to make
that stuff, and that takes up a lot of space.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.320
So those cells can’t be flat -- they’ve
got to be cuboidal or columnar to accommodate

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.340
more room for taking care of business.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.000
So that stomach lining that I mentioned, for
example, is made up of big columnar cells,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.380
because they have to make and secrete mucus.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.940
But when it comes to what kind of cells are
found where, an important thing to keep in

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.890
mind is the fact that cells are, biologically
speaking, expensive -- they take a lot of

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.500
time and energy and raw materials to make.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.970
So in places where you lose a lot of cells,
like your outer skin, or in your mouth, you

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.140
have more of squamous cells -- because they’re
smaller, and flatter, and therefore cheaper,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.080
practically disposable -- rather than big,
expensive cuboidal or columnar ones.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.680
Which brings me to the other trait that we use
to classify epithelial tissue -- its layering.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.480
A simple epithelium has only one layer of
cells.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.940
A stratified type has multiple layers set
on top of each other, like the bricks and

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.410
mortar of a wall.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
And pseudostratified epithelium is mostly
just one layer, but the cells can be different

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.950
shapes and sizes, and the nuclei can be at
lots of different levels, so it looks sort

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.660
of messy and multilayered, even though it
really isn’t.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.980
And when we describe a type of epithelial
tissue, like in a lab setting, we cite both

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.490
its shape and its layering. You can think
of a tissue’s first name as its number of

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.210
layers, and its last name as the shape of
its cells.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.130
For example, a simple squamous epithelium
refers to a single layer of flat, scale-like

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.000
cells, like the lining of the air sacs deep
in your lungs.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.400
A stratified cuboidal tissue, meanwhile, would
have layers of cube-shaped cells, like the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.160
linings of the ducts that leak sweat and spit.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.450
When you put the shape of a cell together
with its type of layering, you can begin to

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.270
see how both traits inform the function of
your epithelial tissue.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.590
Let’s go back to those squamous cells. Because
they’re thin, like scales, it takes many

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.690
layers of them to form a tissue that’s thick
enough to offer protection. So you end up

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.080
with a really dense stack of cells that, on an
individual basis, are small and cheap to make.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.080
That’s why when I, like, scratch my hand
or hit the inside of my mouth with a toothbrush,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.870
I can lose a couple of layers, no big deal.
Those squamous cells are a dime a dozen. There's

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.480
still lots of layers left. Plus, epithelial
tissue regenerates really quickly.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.110
But if you, say, get tossed off a moving motorcycle,
you’ll lose a lot more layers. And if your

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.960
road rash is really bad, you could scrape all
the way through all of those squamous

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.680
cells, down to the nerves and the blood and
all of the underlying connective tissue, plowing

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.500
through a lot more expensive cells, and wind
up with a real, like,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.720
can-you-please-get-me-to-the-hospital-I-need-to-get-to-the-hospital kind of problem.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.460
Of course, when we talk about epithelial tissue
protecting you, it’s not always protecting

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.810
you from the outside world. It also creates
order among all of those rambunctious seventh

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.160
graders that are your organs. And here it’s
important to note that all of your epithelial

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.720
cells are polar, meaning they have distinct
sides. The apical or upper side, is exposed

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.450
to either the outside of your body, or whatever
internal cavity it’s lining. The basal side,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.050
or inner surface, is tightly attached to the
basement membrane, a thin layer of mostly

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.250
collagen fibers that helps hold the epithelium
together, and anchors it to the next-deeper

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.010
layer -- your connective tissue.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.200
Many of these boundaries that the cells form
aren’t absolute -- instead, they’re selectively

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.040
permeable, allowing for some level of absorption,
filtration, and excretion of substances.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.970
The tissue lining your small intestines, for
instance, is what allows you to absorb nutrients

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.910
through diffusion and active transport, so
that's pretty important. And all of your urinary

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.120
waste gets filtered through a different epithelial
lining in your kidneys.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.400
So by now you’re probably starting to get
it: Every interaction that your body has with

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.210
the rest of the physical universe is made
possible somehow by your epithelium.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.610
But that is not all!

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.470
Remember: Your glands are also made up
largely of epithelial tissue, so it ALSO plays

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.060
a big role in facilitating all of your secretions
-- from sweat and mucus, to hormones and enzymes.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.580
This glandular epithelium forms two different
kinds of glands -- your endocrine glands,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.520
the ones that secrete hormones right into
your bloodstream or to nearby cells,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.560
and your exocrine glands, the type that secrete
their juices into tubes or ducts that lead

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.800
to the outside of the body, or the inside
of your tube, rather than right into the blood.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.699
The hormone thyroxin, for example, is secreted
by an endocrine gland -- your thyroid -- and it

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:50.679
needs to be distributed throughout the entire body so
that it can stimulate the metabolism in all of your cells.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.040
Some examples of exocrine secretions would
be sweat, saliva, mucus, stomach acid, and

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.199
milk, if you’re lactating.

00:08:56.199 --> 00:09:00.439
All those secretions go right into ducts where
they’re ferried to an epithelial surface

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.360
-- which could be your outer layer of skin,
in the case of your sweat, or the edge of

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.439
your stomach lining if it’s your stomach
acid.

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:11.500
So, hey the system works. And it’s due in
large part to the humorless gym teacher that

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.820
is your epithelial tissue.
It may not always be a ton of fun, but darn

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.279
it, it gets results.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:20.910
Today you learned how your unsung epithelial
tissue creates the inner and outer boundaries

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.020
that keep you alive. We looked at how proper
epithelial tissue is classified by both layering

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.600
-- simple or stratified -- and shape -- squamous,
cuboidal, or columnar -- and how the structure

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.019
of these tissue types match their function.
We also talked about how epithelial cells

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:41.180
are polar, having both apical and basal sides,
and are selectively permeable, and lastly

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.480
we took a brief look at how our glandular
epithelial tissue forms both out endocrine

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.920
and exocrine glands.
