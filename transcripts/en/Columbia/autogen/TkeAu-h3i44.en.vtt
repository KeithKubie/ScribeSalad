00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
various places of training how people
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.879
various places of training how people
were receiving a different quality of

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889
were receiving a different quality of
 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.140
were receiving a different quality of
care based on their race ethnicity

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
care based on their race ethnicity
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.210
care based on their race ethnicity
culture class and that's what we call

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
culture class and that's what we call
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.860
culture class and that's what we call
the status today that's had many names

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
the status today that's had many names
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.080
the status today that's had many names
and it's not a new issue and I'm going

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
and it's not a new issue and I'm going
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.610
and it's not a new issue and I'm going
to talk about some more recent work but

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
to talk about some more recent work but
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.890
to talk about some more recent work but
my work did not discover disparities I'm

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900
my work did not discover disparities I'm
 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.240
my work did not discover disparities I'm
just trying to shine different lights on

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250
just trying to shine different lights on
 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.069
just trying to shine different lights on

the day now what I hope to do today
briefly is really talk about the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970
briefly is really talk about the
 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.580
briefly is really talk about the
intersection between racial ethnic

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590
intersection between racial ethnic
 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.610
intersection between racial ethnic
disparities and cross-cultural care and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
disparities and cross-cultural care and
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.870
disparities and cross-cultural care and
what I want to do is I want to tell a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880
what I want to do is I want to tell a
 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.270
what I want to do is I want to tell a
bit of the story as I do that and I want

bit of the story as I do that and I want
 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520
bit of the story as I do that and I want
to just spend a tiny bit of time on some

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530
to just spend a tiny bit of time on some
 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.040
to just spend a tiny bit of time on some
data you know what are disparities kind

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050
data you know what are disparities kind
 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.570
data you know what are disparities kind
of how are we pitching this when I go on

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580
of how are we pitching this when I go on
 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.850
of how are we pitching this when I go on
speak to which is what I do the most try

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860
speak to which is what I do the most try
 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.379
speak to which is what I do the most try
to get speak to people who really don't

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389
to get speak to people who really don't
 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.520
to get speak to people who really don't
understand this issue and I'm trying to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530
understand this issue and I'm trying to
 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.719
understand this issue and I'm trying to
get them to care how do i frame it up

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729
get them to care how do i frame it up
 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.219
get them to care how do i frame it up
for them how do I try to let them

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229
for them how do I try to let them
 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.529
for them how do I try to let them
understand it and talk about disparities

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539
understand it and talk about disparities
 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.939
understand it and talk about disparities
in health and healthcare then what I

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949
in health and healthcare then what I
 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.110
in health and healthcare then what I
want to do and I think it's very

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120
want to do and I think it's very
 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.460
want to do and I think it's very
critical to do this is to bring the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470
critical to do this is to bring the
 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.860
critical to do this is to bring the
patient's voice into the room I want to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870
patient's voice into the room I want to
 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.140
patient's voice into the room I want to
take a minute a few minutes to to bring

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
take a minute a few minutes to to bring
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.430
take a minute a few minutes to to bring
the patient's voice and I'll explain how

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440
the patient's voice and I'll explain how
 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.570
the patient's voice and I'll explain how
we're going to do that but I think it

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580
we're going to do that but I think it
 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.040
we're going to do that but I think it
would be very powerful very moving and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050
would be very powerful very moving and
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.430
would be very powerful very moving and
it will give all this data and all this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440
it will give all this data and all this
 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.050
it will give all this data and all this
to work and all this commitment that we

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060
to work and all this commitment that we
 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.880
to work and all this commitment that we
are sharing here today and will give it

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890
are sharing here today and will give it
 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.240
are sharing here today and will give it
energy because we will see how people

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
energy because we will see how people
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.380
energy because we will see how people
are really struggling with this issue

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390
are really struggling with this issue
 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.870
are really struggling with this issue
how there are faces behind this this

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880
how there are faces behind this this
 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.480
how there are faces behind this this

in 1999 going into 2000 and here what we
see is when you look at the diabetes

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920
see is when you look at the diabetes
 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.590

to care maybe that's not their role and
 

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:11.369
to care maybe that's not their role and
so we've come pretty far away from I

00:27:11.369 --> 00:27:11.379
so we've come pretty far away from I
 

00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:12.959
so we've come pretty far away from I

if we have patients saying you know
doctors not they're listening maybe

00:27:16.649 --> 00:27:16.659
doctors not they're listening maybe
 

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:18.329
doctors not they're listening maybe
maybe you know maybe that's not their

maybe you know maybe that's not their
 

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:20.159
maybe you know maybe that's not their
role in the health care system and

here's this is played out a large survey

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:22.179
here's this is played out a large survey
 

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:24.299
here's this is played out a large survey
by the Commonwealth Fund you talk about

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:24.309
by the Commonwealth Fund you talk about
 

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.859
by the Commonwealth Fund you talk about
communication and understanding your

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:25.869
communication and understanding your
 

00:27:25.869 --> 00:27:27.719
communication and understanding your
doctor where they have several thousand

00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:27.729
doctor where they have several thousand
 

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.359
doctor where they have several thousand
patients in the last few years if you

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:30.369
patients in the last few years if you
 

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:31.289
patients in the last few years if you
had one or more of the following

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:31.299
had one or more of the following
 

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:32.759
had one or more of the following
communication problems when

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:32.769
communication problems when
 

00:27:32.769 --> 00:27:35.249
communication problems when
communicating with your doctor and here

00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:35.259
communicating with your doctor and here
 

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:36.899
communicating with your doctor and here
you see broken up by very sentencing

00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:36.909
you see broken up by very sentencing
 

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:38.309
you see broken up by very sentencing
these problem include understanding the

00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:38.319
these problem include understanding the
 

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:40.019
these problem include understanding the
doctor feeling like the doctor listened

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:40.029
doctor feeling like the doctor listened
 

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:41.669
doctor feeling like the doctor listened
and if you have questions that you

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679
and if you have questions that you
 

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.799
and if you have questions that you
didn't feel comfortable asked right and

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:43.809
didn't feel comfortable asked right and
 

00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:45.479
didn't feel comfortable asked right and
so you do see about twenty percent of

00:27:45.479 --> 00:27:45.489
so you do see about twenty percent of
 

00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:47.339
so you do see about twenty percent of
all patients about one in five that one

00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:47.349
all patients about one in five that one
 

00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:48.659

about one in three Hispanic Latinos and
 

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.460
about one in three Hispanic Latinos and
three asian-americans so when you talk

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:00.470
three asian-americans so when you talk
 

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.680
three asian-americans so when you talk
about communication problems there and

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:02.690
about communication problems there and
 

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.350
about communication problems there and
we understand clearly a lot of research

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360
we understand clearly a lot of research
 

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.490
we understand clearly a lot of research
has shown us the importance of

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:06.500
has shown us the importance of
 

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.620
has shown us the importance of
communication the patients who feel like

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:08.630
communication the patients who feel like
 

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.180
communication the patients who feel like
they communicate effectively with us

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.190
they communicate effectively with us
 

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.190
they communicate effectively with us
tend to follow our recommendations that

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200
tend to follow our recommendations that
 

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.290
tend to follow our recommendations that
greater rates tend to be more

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:14.300
greater rates tend to be more
 

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.000
greater rates tend to be more
cooperative and tend to have better

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.010
cooperative and tend to have better
 

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.070
cooperative and tend to have better
health outcomes so the communication is

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080
health outcomes so the communication is
 

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.660
health outcomes so the communication is
one very very important part of the

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:19.670
one very very important part of the
 

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.850
one very very important part of the
process and so here we have a whole

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:21.860
process and so here we have a whole
 

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.230
process and so here we have a whole
group of people people who are suffering

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240
group of people people who are suffering
 

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.640
group of people people who are suffering
from the status who are having trouble

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:24.650
from the status who are having trouble
 

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.410
from the status who are having trouble
communicating thus and Robert gives

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:26.420
communicating thus and Robert gives
 

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.020
communicating thus and Robert gives
voice to another thing that Robert

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.030
voice to another thing that Robert
 

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.210
voice to another thing that Robert
mentions is this assumptions right he

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:31.220
mentions is this assumptions right he
 

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.280
mentions is this assumptions right he
says you know I think doctors assumed

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:33.290
says you know I think doctors assumed
 

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.780
says you know I think doctors assumed
that if you just give a kidney to an

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:34.790
that if you just give a kidney to an
 

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.220
that if you just give a kidney to an
african-american patient this can go

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.230
african-american patient this can go
 

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.190
african-american patient this can go
ahead and ruin it anyway right he talks

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200
ahead and ruin it anyway right he talks
 

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.050
ahead and ruin it anyway right he talks
about these assumptions and this concept

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:41.060
about these assumptions and this concept
 

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.420
about these assumptions and this concept
the stereotypes right and what's

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.430
the stereotypes right and what's
 

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.160
the stereotypes right and what's
interesting is a lot of the static links

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.170
interesting is a lot of the static links
 

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.480
