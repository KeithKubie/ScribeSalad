00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.480
she's on the same military footing as
her husband but whether or not they rule

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490
her husband but whether or not they rule
 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.800
her husband but whether or not they rule
together both shared the same fate

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810
together both shared the same fate
 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.820
together both shared the same fate
disappearing into the sands of Amarna
