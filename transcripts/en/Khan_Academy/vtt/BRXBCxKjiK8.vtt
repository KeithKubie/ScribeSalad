00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:01.805
Voiceover: I want to do a quick follow-up

00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:03.556
to the last video because I did not give

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:06.999
a complete picture of all
of the fiscal policy tools

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.444
that a government has at its disposal.

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:11.806
What I focused on in the last video

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:14.361
is a government that holds taxes constant,

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.087
taxes constant,

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:19.026
and increases spending.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:22.610
Spending goes up.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.668
The only way that a
government could do that

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:27.072
is by taking on more debt,

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.109
or I guess if there are some governments

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.916
that are saving,

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:30.748
saving less,

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:31.430
but most of them,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.448
they're going to have
to take on more debt.

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:36.077
So they're going to take on more debt.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.395
Just to think about it in terms of the,

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:43.055
in terms of the GDP
expenditure components,

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:45.064
we know that GDP,

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.650
GDP is equal to consumption,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.469
which is mostly consumers, individuals,

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.408
investment, which is mostly firms,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:57.186
and some consumer spending on new houses.

00:00:57.186 --> 00:00:59.581
Then you have government expenditure,

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.825
and then you have net exports,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.414
which kind of completes the picture.

00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:04.073
But what we described in the last video

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:05.915
is these two things are held constant.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.227
Taxes don't change.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:07.908
People,

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:09.852
the government isn't
fueling its expenditures

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:11.921
with more taxes, so this
part stays constant,

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.464
but with the extra debt,

00:01:13.464 --> 00:01:16.184
the government spends
more, so this part goes up,

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:17.920
everything else holds roughly constant,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.745
and so GDP would go up.

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:24.235
The other tool that the government has,

00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:27.175
has at its disposal,

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:30.117
is to hold spending constant,

00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:34.587
so spending is held constant,

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.330
and lowering taxes,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.188
and lowering taxes,

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.079
which would essentially put more money

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.475
in the hands of consumers
of individuals, families,

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:44.783
and firms.

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:46.408
Once again, the only way they can do that,

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:47.849
if you hold spending constant,

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.259
and you're reducing your revenues,

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.265
the only way they can
do that is once again,

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:52.790
taking on more debt.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.327
This is a common theme here.

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:56.910
They would have to take on more debt,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.830
assuming they don't have any savings

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.190
to kind of eat up, to
finance this type of thing.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.915
Looking at this again, we have

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:08.784
GDP is equal to
consumption plus investment

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:11.915
plus government spending plus net exports,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.538
plus net exports,

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:14.783
in this situation,

00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:16.409
government spending is held constant

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.582
but because the consumers' and the firms'

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:19.659
taxes have gone down,

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.015
they have more to spend,

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.465
and they will spend some component of it,

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.790
and so these two pieces will go up,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580
and GDP will go up.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.743
I just wanted to make
sure we added this picture

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:30.584
right over here.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.790
Fiscal policy isn't just about increasing

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.332
or decreasing government spending.

00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:36.916
It can also be about tax policy,

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:39.531
increasing or decreasing taxes.
