00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.620
All right, we've covered quite
a bit of ground already.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.190
We've heard a lot about
what accessibility is and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.960
why it matters for everyone.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.650
We heard about some different
types of impairments and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.620
what we might need to think about.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.340
We saw what it's like to
use a screen reader and

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.900
we took a quick look at WCAG and
the WebAIM accessibility checklist.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.700
&gt;&gt; For the rest of the course we're
going to dive into the practicalities of

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.200
actually creating accessible websites.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.020
That's right we're not going
to just talk at you for

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.350
the whole course, you're going to
actually create some accessible code.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're going to organize
this around three main topics, focus and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.590
keyboard, looking at how to make sure
that we build things which can be

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080
operated with a keyboard.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.960
This is important for
users with motor impairments but also

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.660
ensures that your UI is in a good shape
for the next topic which is semantics.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.650
Semantics is where we make sure that
we're expressing our interface in

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.100
a robust way which works with
a variety of assistive technology.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.240
And finally styling and visual design.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.400
Look at some techniques for making
sure the visual UI is as flexible and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280
usable as possible.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.050
&gt;&gt; Now each of those
topics could probably fill

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.530
a whole course by themselves.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.150
So we're not going to be able to
cover every single aspect of creating

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910
accessible websites.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.900
However, we're going to give you
enough information to get started and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.300
point you at some good places
to learn more about each topic.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
I'm sure you're all eager to get started
so let's begin with a look at how and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.520
why you need to think about
focus in your web application.
