00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.530
Of all of the chemical
compounds-- and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.690
there are many millions--

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.420
I think water has to be one
of the most amazing.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.180
And it's one of my favourite.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.010
What we're going to do today is
see how just a tiny amount

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.930
of water can cause an
enormous fire ball.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.020
This is a giant safety screen.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.260
A giant cylindrical safety
screen, as it will be, to

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.770
protect Peter from the effects
of pouring a small amount of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.520
water into some burning, boiling
oil, which hopefully

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.940
will produce a giant
fire ball.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.590
Thanks to the screen it will
go up, rather than out.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.390
We're going to take you up to
the roof because no ordinary

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.543
room could contain the
fire ball that we

00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:06.793
are hoping to produce.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.420
As you may know, oil and
water just don't mix.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450
And I can show this.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.190
So we'll put some water in here
and put some oil in here.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.630
The oil molecules are really
actually quite large.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.650
They contain a lot of hydrogen,
a lot of carbon

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.420
atoms, a bit of oxygen, and
maybe a few other elements.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.080
But this is really quite
a large molecule.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.610
The water?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.870
Just three atoms--

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.220
which one's going to
come out on top?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.230
The amazing thing is the
water is actually more

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.190
dense than the oil.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.170
And this again is because of the
interactions between the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.425
water molecules really holding
them in closely together.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.480
The oil molecules are not
polarised in the same way.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.250
They don't have that same
separation of charge that the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310
water does, and that's
why we've got

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.430
these separate layers.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.990
But what would happen if
the oil was really hot?

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.670
Here we've got around 100
millilitres of oil.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.100
We're going to heat this
up, and eventually

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.000
it will catch fire.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.130
Then we're going to add some
water to the burning oil.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.880
Now we've seen that the water
sinks underneath the oil, and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.920
at this high temperature
it's going to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.230
instantly turn into steam.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.030
And then we'll see
what happens.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.070
One millilitre of water will
produce enough steam to fill

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.670
this entire flask, which takes
up around 2000 times the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.920
volume that the water did.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880
OK, I think we've got
ignition here.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.130
If we can have the gas off.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.040
Gas off?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.260
Gas off.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.510
Gas off.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.630
OK?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.300
Ready?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:27.139
[EXPLOSION SOUNDS]

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.750
Well, now you can see why you
should never add water to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.000
burning oil.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.050
How did it look?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.610
It was awesome.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.960
Did it come out the top, or--

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.510
Really good.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.740
Yes it did, for several feet,
a foot and a half--

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.870
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.300
Absolutely none.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.120
But I did feel this.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.370
It was good.
