1
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.340
And before we start discussing philosophy and the human soul.

2
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.290
Thous Vani has two words.

3
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.450
<v 1>Hi,
are you excited as I am?</v>

4
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.670
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.540
<v 1>it's wonderful to have a this forum here.</v>

6
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.730
I'm so excited to actually started with a dinner.

7
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.880
We had enough Atlanta and the idea of bringing a Dave and Jordan Peterson here,

8
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.970
uh,
came about and actually happen.
So I'm just going to introduce,

9
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:20.230
not take too much time of the people standing here.
Oh,
sitting here,
sorry.

10
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.300
I'll start with Jordan Peterson.

11

Dr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto,

12

13
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:34.600
professor at Harvard and he's regarded by his current University of Toronto

14
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:38.710
students and colleagues as one to three truly life changing teachers.

15
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.530
Dr. Peterson is prominent,

21
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.590
current events focusing on politics,
religion,
and the media.

22
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.520
Doctor,

23
00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:15.460
Brook is the chairman of the board of the Rhine Institute and uh,

24
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.110

34
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.360
generous board member over the Iron Rhine Institute.
And thank you too.
Hi grout.

35
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.710
Sorry.
High road productions for making this happen.
So here we go.

36
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.970
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

37
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.270
<v 3>So first off to begin,</v>

38
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:19.710
we are live streaming this on my channel and as I'm sure many of you guys saw,

39
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:23.250
I was on Joe Rogan's show a couple of weeks ago and we talked a little bit about

40
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.780
objectivism and he said that you guys are very serious people,

41
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.360
that you're,
you're very serious people.

42
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:34.680
So I need you guys to go absolutely bananas for the thousands and ultimately

43
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.440
hundreds of thousands of people that will be watching this at home.

44
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:38.370
Can you make some noise?

45
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.490
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

46
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.890
<v 3>they look at you guys.
You crazy.
Objectivists alright,</v>

47
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.200
you're searching when you're such a negative influence.
Dave ask.

48
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.080
I've never seen her like this last time.
Last time I did an event with you guys,

49
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:11.430
we had the whole audience screaming out George Carlin's seven dirty workout.

50
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.480
That's true.
I don't know if we're going to do that now.
Okay,

51
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.850
so we're going to do about an hour and a half with you guys and we're going to

52
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.530
throw in some Q.
And.
A.
It's obviously completely,
yeah,
sensory.

53
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.390
<v 4>Then in the free route,</v>

54
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.920
spirit of free speech and individuality that you guys are talking about here at

55
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.660
this conference.
Uh,
so Jordan,

56
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.130
we've been on tour now for almost two months and we have a little break right

57
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.341
now,

58
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.010
but I thought why don't we just dive right back into all the things we've been

59
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.050
talking about.
So much of your,

60
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.080
your tour for your 12 rules for life book has been about the role of the

61
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:44.404
individual.

62
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.280
So before we get to deepen into philosophy and some of the other things,

63
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:51.340
I thought that would be the right place to start cause that's sort of what

64
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:54.790
unifies all four of us up here.
Yeah.

65
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.160
Well I've been making case,
I suppose,

66
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960
<v 5>or,
or developing the argument,</v>

67
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.440
and this is an argument everybody knows to some degree,

68
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.920
although I don't think we've done a very good job of articulating it,
um,

69
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.850
over the last few decades that,
you know,
it's,

70
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.630
it's no secret that our free societies or the free societies of the world are

71
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:18.920
predicated on the idea of the sovereign individual.
Right.
And that's,
that's the,

72
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.770
that's the place where political power ultimately resides.

73
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.350
Or let's say political authority,
but,

74
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.860
and it's also in some sense the derivation source of the idea of rights.

75
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.240
The fact that the individual is sovereign,
the individual has inalienable rights.

76
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.060
And we talk a lot about rights in our society,

77
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.600
way too much as far as I'm concerned.
Not that they're not important,

78
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.380
but they're secondary because the fundamental,
uh,

79
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.950
issue of import with regards to individual sovereignty isn't rights.

80
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.050
It's responsibility.
I mean,
first of all,

81
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.000
you could make a case that your rights are my responsibility and vice versa.
So,

82
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:57.560
so there's a parallelism between rights and responsibility.

83
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.120
But even more importantly,

84
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.570
if the integrity of the state is dependent on the integrity of the individual,

85
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.890
and,
and,

86
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.110
and that's the argument that's implicit in the idea that the individual is

87
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.944
sovereign,

88
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.700
then it's obviously the case that the individual has a great responsibility.

89
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.640
It's a responsibility that's incorrect,

90
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.720
incredible importance because it's not just limited to you,
it's,
it's you,

91
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.940
you acting responsibly actually constitutes the bedrock of the state.

92
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.610
And so,
so that's an interesting issue.
It,

93
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.570
it means that you're required in some sense to take responsibility or the entire

94
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.830
state will shake.
And I think that's true for everyone,
but more interestingly,

95
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.190
I think this is a more interesting argument in some senses that you need meaning

96
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.800
to sustain you through life or you need meaning perhaps not app,

97
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.940
meaning you need meaning to sustain you through life because life is bitterly

98
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.250
difficult and um,
and,
and,

99
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.990
and ultimately challenging,
moderately challenging for that matter.

100
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.700
And you need a meeting to sustain you through that so that it doesn't embitter

101
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.520
you and turn you into a victim,
let's say.

102
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240
And it's pretty obvious to me and I think obvious to anyone when they think it

103
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:18.611
through that virtually everything that you derive genuine meaning from,

104
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.740
and I mean the kind of meaning that will sustain you when times are difficult.

105
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.790
I don't mean casual happiness,
even though there's nothing wrong with happiness.

106
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.400
What the,

107
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.390
the meaning that will sustain you through the tragedy of life is always to be

108
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.350
found in the adoption of responsibility and the people that you admire

109
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.610
spontaneously.

110
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.430
And I don't think there's an exception to this unless you're a little on the

111
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:45.290
psychopathic side.
And I mean that technically,
um,
you,
you feel,

112
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.680
I do.
I mean,
I mean it technically it's like a,
it's a hallmark of psychopathy.

113
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.990
I would say generally speaking,

114
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.290
you admire yourself to the degree that you do when you're at least taking care

115
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.310
of yourself

116
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 6>at least that and maybe when you have a little responsibility leftover for your</v>

117
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.380
family and maybe some does spill over for the broader community.

118
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.580
And certainly the people that you spontaneously admire in your,

119
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
in your fellow man are people who at minimum our accounting further for the

120
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.280
burden of themselves at minimum that,

121
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:21.270
but then who have excess capacity and devote that to the proper care of their

122
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:22.530
family and their community.

123
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.980
And so I don't think that we've done a good job of laying out the meaning equals

124
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:33.180
responsibility,
uh,
equation.
And it's vitally important.

125
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.120
And I think it's very helpful for people to learn that.

126
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.580
Lots of people have told me that,
that,
that you know,

127
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.210
that they've been getting their lives together and digging them out of a cells

128
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.400
out of a nihilistic and hopeless hole.

129
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.290
And doing that by understanding that the meaning they need to sustain them is to

130
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.250
be found through the adoption of the maximal responsibility they can sustain.

131
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.560
And so well,
that's,

132
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.210
that's become clearer to me over the course of these last,
let's say 50 lectures.

133
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.970
So Greg,
I saw you nodding along there a lot.

134
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.960
Can you put some of this within an objective as spring?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

135
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.221
not to plug,

136
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:11.490
but I gave a talk at actually the event that I met you at called taking

137
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:14.030
responsibility for your happiness.
Um,

138
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.710
I think I have a bit of a different view of happiness than you do.

139
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.190
And the and ran has different than you than you do.
Um,

140
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.410
what I mean by happiness isn't the transient joy,

141
00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:27.540
your emotion you could feel in a moment,
but the state of being,

142
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:31.830
the state of emotion that comes from accomplishing,
achieving your values,

143
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.060
having taken responsibility,

144
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.020
set yourself goals and leading a life where you're achieving those goals over

145
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:40.080
time.
And I think that's what ethics is about.

146
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.830
I think that's what gives meaning to life and really be part of that is taking

147
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:45.930
responsibility for yourself.
I would,

148
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.210
I a little bit bristled at the idea of saying that responsibility is more

149
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:52.980
important than rights or the reverse.

150
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.030
I think there are there issues that come up at a different tier.

151
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.570
So I think taking responsibility for yourself as a matter of ethics,

152
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:02.340
it's a matter of how you live your own life.

153
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.680
It's a matter of how you lead a life worth living and be happy and have meaning.

154
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.060
I think those go together.
Um,

155
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.300
but then right are the conditions that we need when we organize as a society to

156
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.180
make everybody able to do that and not to be in fight impinging on each other.

157
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.350
And if we don't all value our own lives.
And happiness.

158
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:25.920
If we're not all taking responsibility or at least many of us aren't,

159
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.130
we're not going to have a society that cares about rights and they're going to

160
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:31.650
go away.
And um,
so in that sense,
I agree.

161
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.670
We need to have this shift to talking about ethics and uh,

162
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.120
what we want to make of our lives.
Each of us you're on.

163
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.280
Yeah.
I mean,
uh,
when we talk about the individual,

164
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:48.580
I think one of the points that each that's important to make is the individual

165
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.600
support.
And partially because that's all we got,
right?
In a sense,

166
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:54.010
all you got is individuals.
We can talk about society,

167
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.910
<v 7>but society is just a collection of individuals that starting point,</v>

168
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
both in ethics and in politics has to be the unit of value.

169
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.820
The unit that actually exist in metaphysical value unit that exists,

170
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.640
not the abstraction that we call the state or society.

171
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.060
What's important is the ability of the individual to live a good life,

172
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.460
to take responsibility for his own life,

173
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:21.250
his own happiness for his own success,
for his own flourishing.

174
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.510
So the individual is,
is,
is everything.

175
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.050
When he comes in my view in morality and,
and,
and uh,

176
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:30.850
and then as an extension in politics.

177
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:34.900
And I think rights are the concept that recognize that is,
it's the bridge,
right?

178
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:39.901
So the bridge between a morality that says your moral responsibility is to make

179
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:44.470
the most of your life.
And then what kind of political systems should we live in?

180
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:47.830
Cat should we live in to make that possible?
And writes,

181
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:51.610
recognizes that the enemy of the good life,
the enemy of flourishing,

182
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:56.380
the enemy of success at living is corrosion.
Enforce.

183
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.150
It's,
it's the group,
the states,
the,
the community,
other people,

184
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.980
other individuals coursing pro,
uh,
being authoritarian over you,

185
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.260
telling you how you must live in how you must act and rights.

186
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:14.890
Recognize that as individuals we have freedom.

187
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:20.370
We must be free to use our own judgments to live our own lives as we see fit.

188
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.660
And that's the great revolution of,
of the enlightenment is,

189
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:29.020
is the recognition of the sanctity of the individual and creating a political

190
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:33.550
system that allows the individual to flourish and to thrive by protecting him

191
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.010
from coercion,
by protecting him for force.

192
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:39.010
And relegating the state to that duty.

193
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.630
The responsibility of the state is to protect rights to protect you from force.

194
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.790
<v 4>So it seems to me that the battle between the individual and the collective is a</v>

195
00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:52.320
battle that has been fought for virtually every society for all time.

196
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.570
However,
there does seem to me at least,

197
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:57.240
and maybe it's just because I'm alive right now and doing what I do,

198
00:13:57.241 --> 00:14:02.160
that there's something unique about the battle at the moment that the individual

199
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:07.161
has been slammed so relentlessly and that we have ideas out there now that for,

200
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:11.100
for young people that they think that socialism is cool.

201
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.160
I mean that seems to be coming back,
right?
I mean these are,

202
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.540
these are ideas that I think are,
are really crazy,
but I'm happy to indulge in,

203
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:22.080
in the discussion about them.
Do you think there's anything unique about the,

204
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.130
the battle between the individual and the collective right now?

205
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:29.240
Or is this just a repeating of what's gone on decades?

206
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.290
<v 5>I think,
I mean there's always something unique about each historical moment,</v>

207
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.130
but I think this is me.

208
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:40.310
This is being a continuous argument for the last hundred and 30 years.

209
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.950
Like as a technical philosophical argument.
And,

210
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.170
and of course it has roots that go back much farther than that.
I don't see,

211
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.130
I mean it is collectivism,
individualism,

212
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:56.180
I think the fundamental polarizing force that's,
that's it's,

213
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.220
that's at work at the moment.

214
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.520
And the issue with the collectivist types is whether or not they're

215
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.550
collectivists because they care about the dispossessed,

216
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:08.780
which is their fundamental claim or whether they're collectivists because they

217
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:12.050
don't want to bear any of the responsibility that would go along with being a

218
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:16.220
responsible individual.
And,
you know,
I'm always skeptical of the,

219
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.110
of the saint like moral claims that are put forth by people who are pushing and

220
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.970
given ideology.
And now I'm,
I'm skeptical about that on my part too.

221
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.820
And the people who criticize my perspective say,
look,
Dr. Peterson,
you're not,

222
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:33.040
or maybe they call me something a lot less flattering,
you know,

223
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.700
they say you're not,
you're not,
um,
you're,
you're,

224
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.940
you're underestimating the degree to which systemic barriers make it impossible

225
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.210
for people to move forward properly in the world.
There's,

226
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.420
there's barriers to the progress that people can make,

227
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:49.580
even if they barely individual responsibility.

228
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.040
And those barriers are distributed on equally.

229
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.150
And of course there's some truth in that because every system

230
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.650
tends towards rigidity and tyranny and no system does a perfect job of selecting

231
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.780
among its people for pure competence.

232
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.670
But there's a difference between saying that a system is somewhat corrupt,

233
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.800
which is certainly the case with western systems.

234
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.440
And the system is an absolutely corrupt,

235
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.650
tyrannical patriarchy with no hope of redemption whatsoever.

236
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:23.090
It needs to be burned to the ground and reformulated.
Those are really different.

237
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.650
And you know,
it's,
it's also possible to be sensible and say,
well look,

238
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:32.651
I mean obviously the manner in which people are selected for success in our

239
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:37.940
society is imperfect.
Um,

240
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.070
but also to note,

241
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.660
well imperfect compared to what exactly like to your hypothetical Utopian

242
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:48.530
perfection,
which you would self-generate if you were given ultimate power.

243
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.680
Cause that's really the comparison or to our societies in the past because we're

244
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.920
doing a lot better now than we were or compared to every other society that's

245
00:16:57.921 --> 00:17:00.260
ever existed since the dawn of time,

246
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.640
by which standard we are doing so insanely well that it's actually almost

247
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:08.660
unbelievable.
And,
and this is another thing that I've been trying to promote.

248
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:13.661
I mean there's been at least a dozen books written in the last six or seven

249
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:18.290
years by fairly serious scholars and I would say distributed across the,
the,

250
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.320
the political spectrum pointing out that like ever since the year 2000 things

251
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:28.910
are getting better so fast that it's actually a miracle.
You know,

252
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:30.650
and I can give you some quick facts.

253
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:35.651
So the rate of absolute poverty in the world fell by by 50% between the year

254
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.620
2000 and 2012 so that's a staggering achievement.

255
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:43.310
It was three years faster than the most optimistic projections of the UN.

256
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.000
So we actually beat in optimistic UN projection.

257
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.940
So there are more,
well that's,
it's absolutely beyond belief.

258
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.770
There are more forests in,
in,

259
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.930
in the northern hemisphere now than there were a hundred years ago.
Um,

260
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.960
the child mortality rate in Africa is now lower than it was in Europe in 1950,

261
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.850
which is just beyond belief.

262
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.000
The fastest growing economies in the world or in sub Saharan Africa,
um,

263
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.980
about 300,000 people.
I can't remember if it's a day or a week,

264
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:13.350
but it doesn't matter.
Although it would be better if it was a day,

265
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:16.320
obviously are being plugged into the electrical grid.

266
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.160
So increasingly people have universal access to fresh water.

267
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.380
There's almost no country in the world.

268
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.130
Now we're starvation is a problem that isn't just a political problem,

269
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.640
which is to say we have enough food for everyone and not only do we have enough

270
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:33.810
food,
we have the distribution systems that are actually getting that food to

271
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:37.470
everyone.
It's absolutely beyond belief.
And what's,

272
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
what's quite remarkable about that is it's quite obvious that individually,

273
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.190
like that free market system is predicated on the idea of the sovereignty of the

274
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:51.000
individual are the reason that that's happening.
So

275
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.150
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

276
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.260
So the question

277
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.700
<v 5>can is,
what the hell are the collectivists up to?
You know,</v>

278
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.500
why are they [inaudible] like what's the problem here?
And the problem,

279
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.710
the problem seems to be a certain amount of ignorance,

280
00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:14.850
a certain amount of willful blindness and a certain amount of discomfort with

281
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:19.500
the fact that a fair bit of that wealth has been purchased at the price of a

282
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:21.000
continuing inequality.

283
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.220
We don't know how to generate wealth without also generating inequality,

284
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.180
and I actually don't think that you can generate wealth without generating

285
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:33.050
inequality and that's well,
that's something that's worth it,
right?

286
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.260
<v 2>Let's say discussion.
I think</v>

287
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.390
<v 5>a little something to say about inequality.
We wrote a book about that.
Yeah.</v>

288
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.260
<v 7>Yeah.
I mean,
I like to say it in brief,
right?</v>

289
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.000
Inequality is a feature of freedom,
not a buck.
It just

290
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:56.260
<v 2>comes with freedom.
You have totally right.
You</v>

291
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.300
<v 7>cannot create wealth without any quality,</v>

292
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.780
and there's nothing wrong with any quality.
There's nothing bad about inequality.

293
00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:06.781
There's nothing a model the offensive about inequality and in particular,

294
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.240
given that what happens is that everybody's getting richer.

295
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.000
Everybody gets Richard,

296
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:14.650
they just get Richard at different patient who reason they get Richard at

297
00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:18.100
different pace is because they're producing different quantities of value.

298
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.650
The people who actually get very rich in a free market.

299
00:20:20.651 --> 00:20:23.710
Now we don't have a pure free market and all kinds of problems with the system

300
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:28.350
we have.
But in a free market,
you only gain those values that you produce.

301
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.130
A Jeff Bezos is the re is the richest person in the world because how many of

302
00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:36.200
you shop on Amazon?
Everybody,
right?

303
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.720
So there's a reason he's produced values that have affected almost every human

304
00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:45.610
being on the planet.
And that's that.
That is why he,
you know,
he's so wealthy.

305
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.040
So the whole debate is,

306
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.490
is to try to drive people towards envy.

307
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.050
The whole inequality debate is to try to undercut the,
uh,

308
00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.190
the idea of freedom because what they're really after is not reducing
inequality.

309
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.960
What they're really after is eliminating freedom.
Uh,

310
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.070
it's the same people who used to advocate for an ideology of communism or

311
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:11.200
socialism.
Now that's been discredited.
So they have to call it something else.

312
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:14.110
Joe Stiglitz that Nobel Prize winner in economics,

313
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:15.490
it's not going to come out for communism,

314
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.240
but in a sense he used that as the mall ideal.

315
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.380
You can't get there.
It's rough.
There's a little too violence.

316
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:26.320
Too much blood for his tastes.
He's an economist after.
All right,

317
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.240
so so inequalities on nice disguise or we want to reduce inequality might

318
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.020
debates with people.
We talk about.
Any quality to say by how much,
well,

319
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.760
we'll know when we get there.
Who will know,
who gets to decide,

320
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.180
how are we going to vote,
how much are we going to take and why?

321
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.290
Why just monitoring inequality.
I mean,
Dave's a good looking guy.

322
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.510
<v 2>It's not fan.
Can I?</v>

323
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.250
Can I have some of that?
And it's a lot.
It's a lot of hairspray,
man.

324
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.570
I mean how do,
how do we,
how do we do that?
How do you,
we,

325
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:06.050
<v 7>you know,
there'd be an experiments and trying to equalize in the book,</v>

326
00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:08.590
we give the example of course,
if the tragedy of,
of,

327
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.080
of the horrific tragedy of Cambodia and the camera moves with the attempt is to

328
00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:15.950
equalize not just,
not just on,
on monitoring issues,

329
00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:20.750
but on smarts or the only way to do that is to kill the educated and smart on,

330
00:22:20.751 --> 00:22:23.600
on every other fact on who's a good farmer and who's a good,

331
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.920
good father Jeff for food,
they killed them all.
40% of the population.

332
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.080
It's so I,
yeah,
so the whole,
I mean I get,

333
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.680
I get really upset with people even make an issue of inequality because it

334
00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:38.270
shouldn't be an issue with equality.

335
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.600
And I think it's changed I think in America 50 years ago and I'm not trying to

336
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:47.010
be nostalgic because I know the dangers in that.
It just,
it,

337
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.490
there wasn't this idea nobody cared,
right.

338
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.700
Because there was this feeling that you earned it,
you worked hard,
you made it.

339
00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.700
There was also a feeling that,
see,

340
00:22:55.701 --> 00:23:00.170
I'm not so sure people care as much about inequality as they care about

341
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.050
inequalities of hypothetical trajectory.

342
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.310
So meaning that it isn't so bad if you're rich and I'm poor,

343
00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:11.300
if I believe that if I put my best foot forward,
I might also,

344
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.420
my life will improve across time.
Or even if mine doesn't mind,

345
00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:18.140
children's life will because I think people are more interested.

346
00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:21.650
I think people vote their dreams rather than the reality and the dream has to be

347
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:26.390
intact.
And I do have a couple of just one thing.
I think that's true,

348
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.970
but it's also true that people,

349
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:32.710
people resent wealth when they think it's unearned.
Yeah.

350
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.190
And I think the more,

351
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.060
the more we move towards a centrally planned economy,

352
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.470
the more we have cronyism,

353
00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:42.830
the more the real problems in the kind of the mixed economy that we have.

354
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.040
We don't have pure capitalism.
Then the

355
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.360
<v 5>more they're suspicious of the people at the top because indeed they see the</v>

356
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.130
people at the top schmoozing with the politicians,
and that's what scares them.

357
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:58.730
So I think America has shifted partially because they're not sure that people

358
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:02.270
have earned it and partially because they've been bombarded with this message,

359
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:06.220
you should envied them.
It's,
it's immoral inequality.
So,

360
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.170
so I think it's a combination.
The combination of the dream,

361
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.490
the justice of it is that just for somebody to have to have that wealth because

362
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:15.770
they've earned it.
And this issue of,

363
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.640
of Dave just there's been a shift in the morality in the mall perception.

364
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.780
I think we have a,
we have a structural problem that's going to emerge to that.

365
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.310
And this is where I would take some issue I suppose with the,

366
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.330
with the idea that there's nothing intrinsically bad about inequality.

367
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.100
I mean because it presumes something approximating a level playing field and I'm

368
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.600
not thinking so much about systemic barriers.
Well,
let,

369
00:24:39.601 --> 00:24:41.280
let me just make the argument very briefly as you're,

370
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.230
tell me what you think because one of the things that I spend a lot of time

371
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.080
looking at what predicts success in,
in,

372
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.790
in western and functional Western hierarchies and the two intrinsic

373
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.860
psychological factors that predict success.

374
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:58.430
Our intelligence as you assess it with Iq tests,

375
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.920
which is the best way to assess intelligence by,
by,

376
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.480
by an overwhelming margin and trait conscientiousness,

377
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:09.650
which is industriousness and orderliness,
sometimes known as grit.

378
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.550
Um,
and those are quite good predictors of longterm success.

379
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:16.490
They account for about 40% of the variability across time,

380
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.070
which leaves a lot of other factors still at play.

381
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.670
But there's something quite terrifying about the intelligence and of that

382
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.300
equation because Iq is,

383
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.680
is normally distributed in the population and there's incredible differences

384
00:25:30.681 --> 00:25:33.530
between people who are at the top of the,

385
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:36.350
I could distribution and people who are at the bottom like it,

386
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.270
you can't believe how variable people are in their intelligence.

387
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.000
It's quite staggering.
Well,
I can give you an example.

388
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.230
So it's actually illegal in the United States to induct someone into the armed

389
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:50.600
forces if they have an Iq of less than 83.

390
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.340
And the reason for that is that they aren't forced as determined after a hundred

391
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.060
and some years of,
of extraordinarily rigorous testing,
um,

392
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.230
motivated by the hope that everyone would be fodder for the armed forces.

393
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:09.560
Cause that's their hope,
right?
Because they have a chronic manpower shortage,

394
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.160
peacetime and wartime.
So they want people in the armed forces,

395
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:16.310
they're not going to exclude them unless they have to.

396
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.260
And the consequence of the analysis was that if you have an Iq of 83 or less,

397
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.670
there isn't anything you can be trained to do in the armed forces that isn't

398
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.020
positively counterproductive.
It's like,
yes,
yes.

399
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:34.100
And this is a way bigger fact than you think because that's about 10% of the

400
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:37.900
population.
And so,
so we have a problem and,

401
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.750
and I would say it's a problem that is,

402
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.190
is going to manifest itself in something that approximates a and inequality that

403
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:49.191
looks unfair because there are the cognitively dispossessed are going to have a

404
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:52.560
very rough time competing.
They already do.
I mean there's,

405
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.820
there's absolutely no doubt about that.
And so it,
it see,

406
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:57.660
the problem with,

407
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.680
with producing hierarchies and even allowing people to climb up the hierarchies

408
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.120
responsibly is that the hierarchy is still produced dispossession at the bottom.

409
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.060
And we need to figure out how to deal with that.

410
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.380
Even if the only consequence of that disposition is the generation of envy.

411
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.160
Because envy can bring down the state and you might tell people while you have a

412
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:21.060
moral responsibility not to be envious and fair enough.
Perhaps you do,

413
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:25.710
but it isn't clear that that's going to be sufficient solution to solve the

414
00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:26.220
problem.

415
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.760
And we also have the cognitive problem that no one will talk about and that we

416
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:33.850
should talk about because it's a real,
it's real.
So,

417
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.940
so it sounds like we're talking about the same thing,

418
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:39.150
whether we're talking about it from a cognitive perspective or a financial

419
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:43.470
perspective that in terms of inequality,
it's not really the,

420
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.600
all the people sort of at the bottom,
but it's the,

421
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:50.580
it's the bottom of the bottom that can't help themselves.
That seems like maybe,

422
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.660
what do you do about that one point that rent made about this?

423
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:59.490
And I think making this point is part of the solution to,
um,

424
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.320
to people being envious,
uh,
letting people internalize this point

425
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.500
<v 6>is that other people's goodness,
other people's accomplishments,</v>

426
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.920
other people's intelligence,
other people's wealth if they've earned it.

427
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.010
And a society that enables the most productive,

428
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:18.780
smartest people to achieve what they can achieve is good for everyone and

429
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:22.860
especially good for the people at the bottom of whatever hierarchy we might be

430
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:26.190
talking about of whatever level of ability,
whatever level of money.

431
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:29.070
And we can see that in giving a little bit more freedom,

432
00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:33.030
a little bit more capitalism in countries like China and India has helped while

433
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:33.601
everyone there,

434
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.480
but disproportionately the Boris people who were starving to death,

435
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.370
<v 5>who had incredible infant mortality rates than what you were talking about this</v>

436
00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:41.840
before.
And we've seen them go down.
Uh,

437
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.840
so I think envy it part of the cause of envy is a

438
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.270
<v 6>wrong moral views that people have moral views that hold that the purpose of</v>

439
00:28:53.271 --> 00:28:56.510
someone's life isn't to achieve things in their own life,

440
00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.010
isn't to reach their own happiness,

441
00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.780
isn't to form a company like Microsoft and get a computer on every desk in the

442
00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:07.010
world running Microsoft software.
Uh,
if someone does that,
we think he's selfish,

443
00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.120
we think it's bad,

444
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.740
or at least it's neutral and we envy him and resent him if we're brought up to

445
00:29:12.741 --> 00:29:13.340
think that way.

446
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.390
Whereas if we're brought up to appreciate the people who created this tremendous

447
00:29:17.391 --> 00:29:18.890
prosperity that those of you were talking about,

448
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.270
and to see that as morally good and there's right and as benefiting all of us

449
00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:25.580
but benefiting us,
not because they did it for us,

450
00:29:25.581 --> 00:29:29.300
but because I'm taking responsibility for your life,
having gold,

451
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:30.740
having something you want out of life,

452
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.650
leading a life of your own on a grand scale,
uh,

453
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.710
for your own sake is what benefits not only you,

454
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.460
but makes you evaluate everybody else.
If we had a society that understood that,

455
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.680
I think that combat the MV and one of the things that rand wrote,

456
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:48.730
she had a really interesting article called the age of envy that talked about,

457
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.100
um,
and also another article called the untitled letter,

458
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:55.420
which was a comment on role and she was very concerned about this kind of

459
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:59.440
egalitarianism and just kind of growing Neil Ism and the envy and the culture.

460
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.580
Um,
it was,
she thought a bit of an American if even the kind of thing.

461
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.010
It is more characteristic of Europe in the 14th.

462
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:08.710
And this wasn't an American way of thinking,
but it was catching on here.

463
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.400
And I think she was prophetic in that.
I think we're seeing a lot of that today.

464
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.080
So let's shift a little bit because I know we can talk about inequality and the

465
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:20.320
individual and all that.
We can,
we can do that all night long.
But the,

466
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:24.700
the title of this talk is philosophy and the human soul.

467
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.080
So we only talked for literally about 20 seconds.
The four of us before,
you know,

468
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:32.020
we didn't plan anything about what we were going to do here.
Um,

469
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.460
so I thought that the best way to start that would be how would you even define

470
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.760
the soul you're on?
I'll start with you.
Really.

471
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

472
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.600
You got a psychologist or a philosopher and a finance guy and [inaudible] my

473
00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:53.380
job,
man.
We are,
and you know the movie

474
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.120
<v 6>Brisbin finance guys have no,</v>

475
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.620
<v 2>I mean I was actually going to start</v>

476
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.070
<v 6>with Jordan,
but you look down for a second.
Yeah,</v>

477
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.600
<v 2>yeah.
The cue that I should go,
right?
Yeah.</v>

478
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.180
<v 7>I mean,
I don't have,
I don't have a succinct,
clear definition of it,</v>

479
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:17.590
but it has to do with,
with consciousness and values.
It has to do with,
with,

480
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.760
with our conscious experiences as some of our conscious experiences I'll,
I'll,

481
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:26.761
I'll be in and the values that we have as individuals or things that are most

482
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:32.011
important to us and that I think experience is what I would refer to as our soul

483
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.300
or spirit.
You know,
I think these are somewhat interchangeable.

484
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.390
When I talk about spiritual experiences,
it's just,

485
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:42.830
it's an experience of consciousness.
It's a,
you know,

486
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.640
if you listened to a piece of music and,

487
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:47.940
and the combination of emotion values and,

488
00:31:47.941 --> 00:31:51.580
and your conscious listening and absorbing,

489
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.690
that to me is what spirit soul would mean.

490
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.900
<v 6>That's great.
Yeah.
I would say,
um,</v>

491
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.030
speaking of the philosopher in the first death of ran scholar here,
she had the,

492
00:32:02.031 --> 00:32:04.740
the freeze that man at the being of self need salt.

493
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.900
So the idea here is your soul is your consciousness,
um,

494
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.200
at the faculty.
Your ability to know when to think,
uh,

495
00:32:13.201 --> 00:32:18.030
but also you have to build who you are,
build your character,

496
00:32:18.031 --> 00:32:21.840
build your personality,
build your values,
come to value things,

497
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.440
set your life around them.
By doing that over time and pursuing them,

498
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.890
you develop a character.
You develop into a certain type of person.

499
00:32:28.891 --> 00:32:32.760
You develop into a distinct individual.
Knew that a beautiful line in the,

500
00:32:32.761 --> 00:32:37.030
in the fountain head,
um,
which this is the theme of this conference.
Uh,

501
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.490
someone talks about how most people long for immortality,

502
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.960
but when you meet them the next time,

503
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:44.480
they weren't the same as they were the last.
They're beautiful.

504
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:46.940
They're constantly changing what they're after.
It's constantly changing,

505
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.310
but the hero of the novel,
Dear Friend says,

506
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.350
you could imagine him existing distinct forever.

507
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.790
He's achieved in mortality in his day to day life because there's a constancy to

508
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:59.420
them and that kind of constancy that having a soul,
having an eye,

509
00:32:59.421 --> 00:33:01.940
being a particular person,
it's an achievement.

510
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.070
It's the achievement of having formed values,

511
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.030
having formed something you want out of your life and then having built for

512
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:12.170
yourself through living this way.
A character that's adapted to that,

513
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:14.490
a character that focused on that.
You know,

514
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.130
this reminds me of groundhog day in a way because in the Q and A's that we've

515
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:21.290
been doing for the last couple of months,
a couple of times it's come up.

516
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:22.730
What's your favorite comedy?

517
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:25.070
And you've mentioned groundhog day where he has to go.

518
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:27.970
Maria has to consistently come back and do it better and do it

519
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.700
<v 5>better and do it better and do it better.
Now I've set you up,</v>

520
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.750
what is your definition of the soul?
Well,

521
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:40.130
I was thinking that the words that hand that writes and then moves on came into

522
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:43.040
my mind and then I was thinking,
well,

523
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.750
this is the way I conceptualize how consciousness works.

524
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:50.810
And so maybe this is in some sense the locale of the soul.

525
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:55.811
So I don't believe that we're driven deterministically like obviously we are to

526
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:56.541
some degree,

527
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.410
but I don't think that that's the right way of conceptualizing how con human

528
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.400
consciousness works.

529
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.850
I think it's putting the cart before the horse in some sense.

530
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:09.851
So the way it looks to me is that what we have arrayed in front of us is a

531
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:12.350
landscape of possibility.

532
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.690
And I think that that's phenomenologically uh,
accurate.

533
00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:19.220
You know,
when you wake up in the morning,

534
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.840
especially when you wake up at three in the morning and you're,

535
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.950
you're concerned about how your life is going,

536
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:30.140
you see an array of possible futures manifest themselves in front of you.

537
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.590
And you know,
there are more possible futures.
Of course,
then you can imagine,

538
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:37.220
but there's plenty that make themselves manifest.
I could do this,

539
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:40.970
I could do that.
This could happen.
What about this?
Maybe I should do this.

540
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.530
And it's like there's a branching landscape in front of you and some of the

541
00:34:45.531 --> 00:34:48.380
places that you're headed to are more likely than others.

542
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:51.260
And some of them take a lot more effort to attain than others,

543
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:55.280
but it's a distribution of possible landscapes.
And that's actually your reality.

544
00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:58.400
It's not like you're driven deterministically by the present.

545
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.030
You see a branching landscape of possibility in front of you.

546
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:04.040
And I think of that as potential.

547
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:09.110
And we all know about potential because we upgrade ourselves and each other for

548
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:10.730
not living up to our potential,

549
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:14.240
which is a very interesting thing that we do because potential isn't something

550
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:17.000
concrete.
And in fact,
it's the opposite of concrete.

551
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:19.580
And yet we act as if it's the most real thing.

552
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.330
You should live up to your potential,
you know,
and,

553
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:25.550
and your conscience will bother you if you don't live up to your potential.

554
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.090
So you have a potential and there's a potential that manifests itself.

555
00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:34.091
And then what you seem to do is that you make choices between those alternative

556
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.990
realities.
And you do that in part imposing a value structure on them and,
and,

557
00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:42.000
and,
and deriving a pathway as a consequence of that.

558
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:45.690
But you decide which of those potentials are going to manifest themselves in

559
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:49.500
actuality.
And so you are the hand that writes that and then move so on.

560
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.150
And this is a very deep idea.
I mean,
I,
I've traced it back to two.

561
00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:58.200
I think our most profound religious intuitions,
um,
the idea that,

562
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.210
that it was the word of God,
for example,

563
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:03.600
that gave rise to habitable order out of chaos at the beginning of time,

564
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:05.190
I think is a reflection of the same idea.

565
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.870
I think the soul is the thing that mediates between potential and actuality.

566
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.380
And I mean that literally and metaphorically at the same time,

567
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.980
that's what you're doing is you're confronting potential,

568
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.950
which is that which could be,

569
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.990
and you're deciding which of that is going to be.

570
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.880
And the thing that's doing that is the soul and that's its divine task.

571
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.440
And I think the fact that you do that is actually why it's necessary for

572
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:39.150
societies to grant you the idea of intrinsic,
right?
Sorry.
Nope.

573
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.100
That's why it's necessary for functional society or societies to be predicated

574
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:49.101
on the idea that you have intrinsic value is because you actually are the locale

575
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.390
where potential transforms itself into actuality.
And so we determine the actual,

576
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.350
the action of our soul determines the actuality of the world.

577
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.950
I think that's genuinely the case.
So this is really interesting to me

578
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.370
<v 6>because I'm watching you guys and I can see a lot of agreement,</v>

579
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.660
but obviously Jordan made at least two references to God and religion there.

580
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:15.520
Now obviously this is where an objectivist and Jordan would have a point of

581
00:37:15.521 --> 00:37:18.700
disagreement.
This is why you're doing these public events with Sam Harris.

582
00:37:18.701 --> 00:37:22.780
And one of the things that I been thinking about it as we've been on tour is at

583
00:37:22.781 --> 00:37:27.310
the end of the day,
if we all ultimately agree and if everyone in this room,

584
00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:30.280
if we could ultimately agree on a morality and,

585
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.670
and the definition of the soul,
that all made sense.

586
00:37:33.671 --> 00:37:38.320
And Jordan's perhaps was had a more religious connotation and yours didn't.

587
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.830
And we all could live functioning good lives within that.

588
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.030
Then does it really matter beyond the,

589
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:49.450
the interest in the intellectual discussion because there was a lot of
agreement.

590
00:37:49.451 --> 00:37:52.300
I could see it in your body language and both of you guys.
Greg,

591
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:54.010
I'll start with you.
Well,

592
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.690
let me start with some of the things I agree with a lot and including some of

593
00:37:58.691 --> 00:38:00.000
the use of religious language with it.

594
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.190
There's a good reason for even for those of us who aren't religious or don't

595
00:38:03.191 --> 00:38:06.310
think of herself that,
and I think I think of myself with an atheist family,

596
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:11.680
but um,
though I know you,
uh,
interpret that word differently.
Um,
but

597
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.140
<v 5>he'll tell you [inaudible] occupant.
But um,</v>

598
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.490
<v 6>so first of all,</v>

599
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:22.491
I think what we see in what you're describing about the many manifold potentials

600
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.500
in the soul actualizes it is a conviction,

601
00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:28.200
which I very much agree with and I think we can know is true.

602
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:29.340
And I think I agree.

603
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:32.220
We presuppose and all of our thinking and all of our judging of people,

604
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.290
which is that we have free will if there's not a future that's written in.

605
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:37.810
We're just on a path traveling down at.

606
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.250
But rather in every moment we're able to make choices and our choices change the

607
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:46.480
future.
And that is a really profound fact.
Uh,

608
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.490
it's a profound factor about our consciousness.

609
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.840
It's connected to everything else that's a value about us.
And I agree.

610
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:56.500
If that wasn't true of us,
we'd be a very different kind of creature.

611
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.870
We wouldn't interact with each others in the same way.

612
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.780
We wouldn't need the same kind of political structure.
And it's,

613
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.840
it's such a profound fact about us that we don't really have language for it,

614
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.970
are very good language for it.
Um,

615
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.600
religion has been the form in which people have thought about the most profound

616
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:18.310
facts,
about their most profound experiences,

617
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.160
about their understandings of them from well,
from,

618
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:24.310
as long as there's been people are,
as long as there's been any way for a very,

619
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:25.880
very long time.
Um,

620
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.080
and the Z as we've lost religion,

621
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.350
um,

622
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.350
we haven't found ways or haven't always found ways to conceptualize

623
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:42.640
independently of religion.
Um,
those kinds of profound values,

624
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.050
the profound role of freedom and human life,
the,
um,

625
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.800
what our highest potential is.
And so if you're going to talk about those things,

626
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.100
it's very hard to do it without really reaching for at least religious metaphor.

627
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.200
<v 5>That's a really crucial issue.
You know,
I think,</v>

628
00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:03.180
I think it's a fundamentally crucial issue.

629
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.280
<v 6>But I want to say though,
just to finish the disagree in part what's true,</v>

630
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.870
what's true matters,
right?
And something can be a beautiful metaphor,

631
00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:14.700
but if understood,
literally is false.

632
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.240
And one of the things I think we need to do to lead our lives well to achieve

633
00:40:22.351 --> 00:40:26.700
these kinds of values is to really value our minds and value or reason and value

634
00:40:26.701 --> 00:40:30.150
getting at the truth.
So if it turns out that something's false,

635
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:36.120
then believing that it's true is not going to make our lives better.
And,
um,

636
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.600
so I don't think it could turn out that we're going to have a very deep

637
00:40:39.601 --> 00:40:43.710
disagreement about what's true about the basic facts of reality and yet we're

638
00:40:43.711 --> 00:40:45.210
all going to be hunky Dory on everything else.

639
00:40:45.211 --> 00:40:47.340
I think those disagreements will make a difference,

640
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.200
but we have to acknowledge the role of consciousness and freedom in life.

641
00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:54.450
And I think there is an agreement between us on that.

642
00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.520
<v 5>Well,
what I've observed is for example,
in my clinical practice when,</v>

643
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.180
when I'm talking about life and death,

644
00:41:03.181 --> 00:41:08.181
moral issues and these are in situations where extreme things are happening in

645
00:41:08.611 --> 00:41:10.770
families and in individuals lives,

646
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.850
talking about events that might've produced post traumatic stress disorder or

647
00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:18.810
that set people up for murder it at times or suicide like um,

648
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.930
or terrible suffering,
some of which is induced voluntarily.

649
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:27.000
The probability that I can have a discussion with my clients about that at a

650
00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:31.590
level that will be salutary without using met religious slash metaphorical

651
00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:34.190
language is zero.
I can't,
if I can't,

652
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.760
if the discussion can take place in the domain of good versus evil,

653
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:42.620
something like that.
And this is especially true,

654
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:44.450
I would say for post traumatic stress disorder,

655
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.220
you just don't get anywhere with it.
And W I've been thinking about the,
the,
the,

656
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.200
the narrative issue a lot constantly.
And I think that,

657
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.600
I know we need to use this,

658
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:01.490
this is one of the weaknesses of the rationalist argument I think is that we

659
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:03.800
have to use heuristics to operate in the world.

660
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:08.480
So heuristics are simply are simplifying maneuvers and we,
there's no option.

661
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.250
You have to use heuristics.

662
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:14.420
And the reason for that is because there is a lot more world than there is a

663
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:15.254
view.

664
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.320
And so you take this incredibly complex reality and you simplify it and now the

665
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:24.260
simplifications have to have merit.
And what makes them have merit is,

666
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.980
is grounds for,
is a topic for a very long,
lengthy discussion.

667
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.810
But to produce those simplifications you have to use here eristics you have to

668
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:34.280
use cognitive shortcuts.

669
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.680
And it looks to me like narrative is a heuristic.

670
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.540
And that the reason that we need to tell stories and that we probably need to

671
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:48.260
have our ethic grounded in stories is because you can make a list of rules that

672
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.260
will tell you how to live.
Rules don't suffice,

673
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.080
but you can tell stories that are,

674
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.310
that lay out broad principles and those are heuristic principles now.

675
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.630
But the thing is is that the most fundamental stories seem to have a religious

676
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:05.270
core.
Now,
I'm not exactly sure why that is,

677
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.930
although I think it probably has to do with something I referred to earlier,

678
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:12.590
which is the idea that you know you are as a soul,

679
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:15.530
you're the thing that transforms potential into actuality.

680
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.410
That seems to be the grounding concept in some sense.

681
00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:21.620
So that's the grounding concept.
There's something divine about that.

682
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.300
Out of that arise as a sequence of stories that are shaped across perhaps

683
00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:31.301
evolutionary history and inside that are more articulated ethic exists.

684
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:36.380
And I don't see a way out of that because you cannot make an exhaustive list of

685
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:41.090
rules that enable ethical movement forward.
And you need to do that.

686
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:45.890
If you had a purely rational view of the way that human cognition functions.

687
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.410
It's something like that.
So let's,
let's pause right there.

688
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.670
Can either one of you figure out a way out of that?
I mean that,
right?

689
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.370
That would be the answer that in,

690
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.230
<v 6>and this would want to want to have right here we are.</v>

691
00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:59.420
We got a whole budget right?
Ready yet?

692
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.780
I don't think you could have a list of rules.
If the rules,

693
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.020
your meetings look like an algorithm that you guys,
your life.

694
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.400
I think that's just not something we can do.

695
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:14.030
That's not the way the human mind works in the world is complicated and you're

696
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:17.660
not gonna get a bunch of,
if then statements that take you,
uh,

697
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.480
take you to do them.

698
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.680
You can't even do that for a lot of physical systems do with when.
Right?
Um,

699
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.970
but I think we can understand them rationally.

700
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.940
I know this might be similar to what we were talking about in the green room

701
00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.970
about Sam through of reason and yours in,

702
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.660
we might got to figure out where they all a lie,

703
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.070
but I don't think reason is just about coming up with algorithms.

704
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.080
I think we come up with concepts,

705
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:45.081
concepts enable us to assimilate vast quantities of similar things to one

706
00:44:45.181 --> 00:44:50.181
another and learn from future about future instances from past ones.

707
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.450
We can get quite subtle,
um,
principals,

708
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:57.990
but I think moral principles are not things that take the form of simple rules.

709
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.360
Don't lie there.
Um,

710
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.790
to take Rand's version of the virtue of honesty,
which isn't,
don't lie,
it's um,

711
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.210
it's your recognition of the fact that what's unreal is unreal and it can't be a

712
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:13.110
value.
So faking things won't work.
It won't make them real.

713
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:15.510
Somehow the thing you fake,
it's going to come back to haunt you.

714
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.710
That's not a simple rule of what to do in each situation.

715
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:24.711
It's a kind of broad fact that you can use to steer your life by and in order to

716
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:29.790
use it this year,
life by into fully understand it.

717
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.600
You need to think about how it plays out in a lot of different contexts,
right?

718
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:38.780
You need to think about what it really means in practice and art of stories,

719
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:39.780
but you know,
literature.

720
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:43.680
But also other forms of art I think are an indispensable means to doing this

721
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:48.180
both with ethical truths like this and also with other metaphysical trues views

722
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.740
about what kind of wherein,
sure.

723
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.360
I guess part of the part of the discussion and as it progresses we'll,

724
00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.900
I don't necessarily mean this discussion in particular,
but you know,

725
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.690
obviously I'm not an enemy of reason by any stretch of the imagination,

726
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:05.990
but I do see that it's hard for people who promote reason as the fundamental

727
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:10.830
mechanism to distinguish between reason and the generation of algorithms.

728
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.030
Like,
and you can say,

729
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:16.170
well my concept of reason extends beyond the generation of Algorithms and fine,

730
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:18.120
but then my question would be,
well,

731
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:23.121
exactly what are the mechanisms by which reason functions when what it's doing

732
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:26.820
isn't generating algorithms because algorithms aren't enough.
And we know that,

733
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.970
right?
Which is why we don't have expert diagnostic systems,
for example.

734
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:34.320
So then the,
the reason starts to look something like metaphor.

735
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:37.290
It starts to look something like narrative and then I start thinking,
yeah,

736
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:40.230
but that's not exactly the enlightenment concept of reasons.

737
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:43.140
So we're starting to move into,
uh,
a different domain.

738
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.490
And so more than just algorithm than metaphor and narrative.

739
00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:50.020
I think first of all,
one thing reason can do,

740
00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:52.080
we've come up with metaphors and narrative,

741
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.630
but there's more than just those three things.

742
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:57.840
They'd also think there's the formation of abstract principles.

743
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:01.230
I don't think what Newton did in writing the print Skipio was coming up with

744
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:02.760
algorithms.
There are algorithms in it,

745
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.820
but or things you can algorithmize about how to prove certain things.

746
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:10.200
But the act of forming the concept inertia,
that's not exactly,
you know,

747
00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:13.500
that's something else.
And I think it's an inertia might be an algorithm,

748
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.300
but the act of coming up with it sampling.
Yes.
And I think there's a whole,

749
00:47:18.301 --> 00:47:22.740
an underexplored area of philosophy and they'd be cognitive psychology thinking

750
00:47:22.741 --> 00:47:25.860
about what are the,
that have reason?
How did the reason function,

751
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:30.070
how is it that we can go from the kind of information we have in to a more and

752
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:34.090
more sophisticated understanding of the world?
And um,

753
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.530
I mean I've written some on this.
Other people have,
uh,
I don't know.

754
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.480
I don't know how much I should try to explain here,
but I can plug a,

755
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.860
I have a chapter called conceptualization and justification in a book called

756
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.300
concepts and their role in knowledge.

757
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:48.700
That gives my sense of what reason does here

758
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.640
<v 5>see.
Cause here,</v>

759
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.510
the other thing that's come up among the cognitive scientists in particular and

760
00:47:53.511 --> 00:47:57.440
also the robotics types is,
is,
is as,
as people,

761
00:47:57.441 --> 00:48:00.710
and this is Rodney Brooks in particular,
who invented the room by,
by the way,

762
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.480
but who's,
who's an absolute,
well,

763
00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:05.090
it's a major accomplishment because the room that doesn't have a brain,

764
00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:08.270
but it operates intelligently,
like it's a major accomplishment,
that thing.

765
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:13.430
And it took Brooks Brooks actually reconstructed how artificial intelligence,

766
00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:16.670
robotics engineers who are conceptualizing intelligence.

767
00:48:16.671 --> 00:48:19.640
And he thought of it as something much more embodied rather than conceptual.

768
00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:22.250
So it was the room was actually the consequence of very,

769
00:48:22.251 --> 00:48:27.251
very high level thinking about the relationship between reason and action in the

770
00:48:27.561 --> 00:48:31.130
world.
Like one of the things that caught in the more sophisticated cognitive

771
00:48:31.131 --> 00:48:35.240
psychologists have been wrestling with is the fact that a lot of what we thought

772
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:39.380
of as abstract reason is actually something that's more dependent on embodiment

773
00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:43.160
than we'd ever,
ever possibly conceived.
Right.

774
00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.590
And so the idea of disembark need reason,

775
00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.920
which is also I would say an enlightenment concept seems to be lacking.

776
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.580
It's lacking in functionality.
You have to be embodied.

777
00:48:52.581 --> 00:48:57.581
And the thing to me is that an embodied reason looks to me a lot more like the

778
00:48:57.951 --> 00:49:02.460
hero of a story than it looks like disembodied reasons,

779
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.400
I think.
I think that's a better metaphor.

780
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:06.860
And so partly why I like the idea of the logos,

781
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:09.500
for example rather than the idea of reason is because,

782
00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:15.140
and this is partly reflected in its in its conceptual Christian origins because

783
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.320
the logo's in Christianity is something that's actually embodied,
right?

784
00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:21.440
It's the word made flesh.
There's a,
there's a,

785
00:49:21.441 --> 00:49:26.441
there's a link between the rational logos logic and the thing that's embodied

786
00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.160
and it's the interaction between those two that producers I think produces that

787
00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:35.720
phenomenon that you described as what drove,
um,
Newton for example,

788
00:49:35.721 --> 00:49:38.510
when he was producing his algorithms.
That's not an algorithm.

789
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:42.690
It's something else,
but it's not this certainly not disembodied reasons,

790
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.543
but even that

791
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.430
<v 6>before of the word made flesh,
right.</v>

792
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.670
It sounds as though something that could have been different bodied was

793
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:51.490
disembodied once and now it got embodied.

794
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.790
And so it still sounds to me a little bit too much like this,

795
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.950
a disembodied conception of you want to call it reason or mind.
Um,

796
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:04.690
whereas I think we want to conception of what reason is and what it does that

797
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:08.470
involves the fact from the start that it's a fee of a feature of certain living

798
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:12.100
organisms.
Uh,
these organisms have perceptual systems,

799
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.640
those are bodily at anything is,
and it's,
um,

800
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.740
a faculty of integrating the data that's coming in through those,
uh,

801
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:24.550
those organs helping us direct ourselves through the world.
Uh,

802
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:28.700
and then on a grander and grander scale.
So I think in the enlightenment,

803
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:33.200
what we're getting is a lot of reflection for the first time or for one of the

804
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:37.640
first time they're renewed reflection on reason,
what it is,
how it works.

805
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.440
And there are several different views,
right?

806
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:42.960
Some more materialistic views like in the whole block and so forth and then sees

807
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.740
more,
um,
the Cartesian type views.

808
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.930
And I think most of the views that came out of that are wrong.
And I think it's,

809
00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.440
it's sad because it's a period when people were really valuing the mind or their

810
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.660
predominant,
trying to understand it wrong.
Well,

811
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.530
<v 5>you know,
because they go on to somewhere else.</v>

812
00:50:58.531 --> 00:51:02.430
But it certainly does seem the case that,
and this is again,

813
00:51:02.431 --> 00:51:06.870
I think the problem with the idea of reason per say is that it's not a

814
00:51:06.871 --> 00:51:11.460
sufficiently differentiated idea to account for how it is that we actually

815
00:51:11.461 --> 00:51:15.130
operate in the world.
And so,
and,
and,
and,
and,

816
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.900
and the AI types and the psychologists are really trying to sort that out.

817
00:51:18.901 --> 00:51:20.430
But see,

818
00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:25.200
one of the things that happen to me when I was arguing with Sam Harris about

819
00:51:25.201 --> 00:51:25.381
this,

820
00:51:25.381 --> 00:51:29.940
cause Sam believes that you can drive values from facts and more or less in an

821
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.880
unmediated way.
Although he,
he,
he,

822
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.140
he has some differences of opinion with himself about how unmediated that is.

823
00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:38.790
It's like,
it's,
well,

824
00:51:38.791 --> 00:51:42.120
I mean it's very difficult to be entirely coherent when you think something

825
00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.150
through something that's complicated,
there's,

826
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:48.180
there's likely to be in consistencies in your argument because it's so

827
00:51:48.181 --> 00:51:48.750
complicated.

828
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:53.160
But it looks to me like it's actually formerly impossible to derive value from

829
00:51:53.161 --> 00:51:55.530
facts in an unmediated sense.

830
00:51:55.531 --> 00:51:59.310
You need something to mediate between the facts and the values.
And,

831
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.870
and then I would also say it looks like it's impossible for you to derive that

832
00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:06.480
structure merely over the course of your life.
You don't,

833
00:52:06.481 --> 00:52:07.380
you don't have enough time.

834
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.420
You're not smart enough and you don't have enough time.

835
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.460
And so you have an embodied biological platform or you are that embodied

836
00:52:14.461 --> 00:52:18.090
biological platform.
And it's actually the consequence of let's say,

837
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:22.260
at least in part evolutionary presser pressures operating over about a 3.5

838
00:52:22.261 --> 00:52:26.160
billion year period.
And so it's possible that you can derive facts from values,

839
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:30.450
but it takes you three and a half billion years to do it properly.
And,
and,
and,

840
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.870
and what you have that allows you to do that in your life,

841
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:38.400
to look at a set of facts and to decide how to proceed is the intermediation,

842
00:52:38.401 --> 00:52:42.060
the unconscious intermediation of that unbelievably deep structure.

843
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.940
And when I've said to Sam something that really annoys him,
I said,
well,

844
00:52:44.941 --> 00:52:46.890
you think you're an atheist but you're actually not.

845
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.660
What I'm actually saying is your conscious apprehension of yourself is a very

846
00:52:51.661 --> 00:52:56.310
thin layer that's laid on top of what you are because you don't know who you

847
00:52:56.311 --> 00:53:00.040
are.
And most of what you do is unconscious.
And that's actually a nun.

848
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.320
There isn't a serious cognitive psychologists in the world who doesn't think

849
00:53:04.321 --> 00:53:06.720
that most of what you do is unconscious by the way.

850
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.440
And I would say that unconscious has a structure and that's a narrative

851
00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:12.450
structure.
And that narrative structure is deep.

852
00:53:12.451 --> 00:53:16.440
And so that even if you describe yourself as atheistic,
because in the,

853
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:19.110
in the explicit content of your thinking,

854
00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:23.340
you see no room for the grounding of your conceptions in divinity.
I would say,

855
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:25.830
well that isn't how your unconscious is structured all

856
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.100
<v 7>and now.
Yeah,</v>

857
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.580
<v 3>and you,
you might object,
but then then the objection,
well,</v>

858
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.740
how are you structured?
Structured since it's 99% of you,

859
00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:39.010
I think I've got a guy over there with a slight objection.

860
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.390
He almost jumped out of this chair.
How was your unconscious structures,

861
00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:44.051
which by the way,

862
00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:47.230
I think this is particularly interesting because I think you have a lot of

863
00:53:47.231 --> 00:53:49.180
agreements with Jordan on plenty of stuff.

864
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.460
And I think you have a lot of agreements with Sam on plenty of stuff.

865
00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:54.400
But this is where this argument has gotten down to.
It's a really,

866
00:53:54.401 --> 00:53:55.750
really rich place,
I think.

867
00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.200
<v 7>Well,
I mean it's,
this is,
this is the,
the,
the,
the big issue,
right?</v>

868
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.930
So I have agreements with Sam on stuff for different,

869
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:07.400
but we have different reasons for having that agreement.
Uh,
and so for example,

870
00:54:07.401 --> 00:54:08.600
I agree with him.
I,
it was odd,

871
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:12.320
but his conception of his art is very different than our conception of his art.

872
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.770
And he has no freewill in that concept one.

873
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.460
So that blows my mind how you can even talk about in his odd values without

874
00:54:19.461 --> 00:54:23.600
having free will.
And,
and,
and he talks about choices without freewill,
which,

875
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:27.000
which,
uh,
which is challenging.
Um,

876
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:29.880
um,

877
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.970
<v 3>well we [inaudible] we'll do that on and then we might come.
Well,</v>

878
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.890
<v 7>we might come to some agreement about,
about,</v>

879
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.700
I don't know who writes or something,
uh,
with children,
although I think even now,

880
00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.210
even our conception of rights is going to be a little different because I don't

881
00:54:43.211 --> 00:54:45.820
see how you can get through rights without understanding of what was the reason

882
00:54:45.821 --> 00:54:49.570
and,
and how recent functions and what the enemy of reason ultimately is,

883
00:54:49.571 --> 00:54:54.130
which is,
which is what I mentioned earlier,
which is,
which is force.
Um,

884
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.660
so,
so I think to go back to your original question way back,
um,

885
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:03.840
I think there's no way for us to have different foundations and not come up with

886
00:55:03.881 --> 00:55:06.820
different conclusions.
We're going to have to come up with different conclusions.

887
00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:10.300
Now we might agree on certain issues in politics was,
for example,

888
00:55:10.301 --> 00:55:14.560
I think we're going to disagree quite profoundly on ethics,
right?
I think,

889
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:17.750
you know,
just watching someone Jordan things and on sacrifice and so on,

890
00:55:17.751 --> 00:55:21.040
on the role of Jesus,
Oh,
oh,
off you have Jesus is going to be very,

891
00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:23.890
very profoundly different.
And that affects human behavior.

892
00:55:23.891 --> 00:55:26.680
That affects individual human behavior.
So they're going to be,

893
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:30.960
you can't start with different premises and develop them and come up with

894
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:35.830
exactly the same way and say,
okay,
we agree on this stuff,
but no,
these,

895
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:38.470
these things have profound consequences.

896
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:43.450
The disagreements have a profound,
profound consequences.
Now,

897
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:48.340
when I think of my subconscious,
I don't think of it as this as this.
And again,

898
00:55:48.341 --> 00:55:50.110
I'm not,
not a philosopher,
not a psychologist.

899
00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:52.840
So this is the way a layman in these terms,
we think,

900
00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.630
I think of my side of my psychologist,

901
00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.490
my subconscious not as a 99% darkness out down there,
right?

902
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.890
I think of it as,
as,
as something that accumulated information,
conclusions,

903
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.600
uh,
values,
uh,

904
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.970
decisions that I've made over since childhood since before he was completely

905
00:56:12.971 --> 00:56:17.620
conscious of them,
that they,
I have access to some of them,
uh,

906
00:56:17.621 --> 00:56:18.041
you know,

907
00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:21.220
hopefully cognitive psychology and how psychology can help me get access to more

908
00:56:21.221 --> 00:56:25.090
of them,
but they're accessible to,
they're not some mystery there,

909
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.060
accessible to me.
And that when I am making a decision in life,
uh,

910
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.410
I try to make it based on what I know,

911
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.790
not based on what I don't know that's back there.
Right?

912
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:37.420
So I try to accumulate facts.

913
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:40.000
This is the finance guy in me right over the reality guy in me.

914
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.770
I tried to accumulate facts and,
and,

915
00:56:42.771 --> 00:56:46.870
and integrate them and try to distinguish between what f which facts are

916
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.890
legitimate and which facts are illegitimate and try to integrate them and try to

917
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:55.810
make a decision based on logic,
based on,
based on reality.
And you know,

918
00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:59.470
sometimes my emotion will say,
and this is my subconscious,
maybe speaking,
uh,

919
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.510
don't do that.
Or that's a bad thing.
But so what?
Right.
If,
if,
if reality.

920
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:07.630
And the fact,
uh,
with me,
then I'll ignore that subconscious.

921
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:11.560
So I don't see us as,
we've got some choice over here,

922
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.720
but we're really driven by the subconscious.

923
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.860
The subconscious is there for me to explore and I become a better person as I

924
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:19.180
know my subconscious better.

925
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.750
I had to stand where my emotions are coming from and I understand that better.

926
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:25.480
But at the end of the day,
when I make a choice out there,

927
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:30.330
it's based on reality and fact and C,
c,

928
00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.770
C and I,
and I see reality of facts.

929
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:36.880
I don't see anything coming between me and this and this plastic bottle that

930
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.390
again,
uh,
my simplistic view right there.
Here's the,
here's the plastic bottle.

931
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:45.130
I can see it.
It's a plastic bottle.
And,
and uh,
it's not something else.
Not as,

932
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:47.830
there's a lot that goes into what is plastic,
what is bottle,
what does that,

933
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:50.860
but that's what it is.
I can describe it.
I can actually,

934
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:52.360
if I had the scientific knowledge,

935
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.920
get down into the molecular structure and it's real.
It's actually here.

936
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.850
It's not created by,
by consciousness or interpreted by my consciousness.

937
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:04.350
It really is what it is.
So I,

938
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.120
I think what evolution has done has given us those tools.
[inaudible] question.

939
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:12.910
Sure.
Why is this,
why is this stump in a beanbag?
Both a chair?

940
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:20.860
Well,
because you're talking about is a stump and a bean bag.
Both a che.

941
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.770
Because if you have a proper definition of a chair,

942
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.030
then a stomping and big bag both fit the definition.
Well,

943
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:31.370
I haven't thought about it,
but you know something to sit in.
That's it.
Yeah.

944
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:35.740
So it's something to sit on.
Yeah.
Right.
That isn't inherent to the object.

945
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:39.070
Sure,
no to.
But my,

946
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:42.500
my definition definitions are not habits in the object.
The,
the,

947
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:47.530
the objective of the created by,
by,
you know,
my consciousness and that object,

948
00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.230
that object is an object,
right?
It is,
it is.

949
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.430
It's both of them are chairs in both of them have a particular nature that is,

950
00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:55.840
I can describe both.

951
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:59.710
I can both say the stump and the bean bag or the same there were chair,

952
00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:03.260
but I can also say the different,
the stump is made of wood and it has this one.

953
00:59:03.261 --> 00:59:06.370
Let's say the drawback is that the problem with the idea that the object

954
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:11.410
presents itself is that two things are the same and different in the near

955
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:15.100
infinite number of ways and that that's also a technical problem.

956
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:16.570
So I can give you an example.

957
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:21.440
So imagine that you're going to classify a set of six books.

958
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.140
<v 5>You're going to figure out how to arrange them in your shelf.
You think,</v>

959
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:26.870
well that's an easy thing to do.
That's a conceptual problem by the way,

960
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.550
it's actually not an easy thing to do because there is an indefinite number of

961
00:59:31.551 --> 00:59:34.670
ways that you can classify a finite number of objects.

962
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:39.530
So you could classify the books by color,
by age,
by thickness,

963
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:42.380
by weight,
by number of ease,
by number of A's,

964
00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.190
by number of ease on the first page,
by number of words,
by number of phrases.

965
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.590
[inaudible] question is,
why am I classifying them?

966
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:55.850
So that is the question.
There's no intrinsic value to classifying books.

967
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.930
The question is why do I want to classify them and the answer to the why I want

968
00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:04.640
to classify them.
We'll then determine how I clashed.
Absolutely.

969
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.170
That's exactly it,
but that's the rub.
The rub is you see that's the rub.

970
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:14.120
Your classification system is dependent on why you apply it and that's exactly

971
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:15.680
the argument I've been using with Harris,

972
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:19.370
which means the set of facts that reveal themselves to you in the world are

973
01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:21.590
dependent on your values.

974
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.750
Cause sounds argument is that the values are derived from the fact.
It's like,
no,

975
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.643
wait a minute.

976
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:32.210
There's an infinite number of facts and they present themselves in accordance

977
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.350
with your values,
with your,

978
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:38.410
with your purpose and so that that demolishes the values from facts argument.

979
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.860
Now it makes it complicated because there's an interrelationship between like a

980
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:44.180
causal interrelationship,

981
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.290
but it is the case that your purpose determines the facts that are themselves

982
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.960
before you and that's actually not disputable.

983
01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:55.961
I would say there's a fact saw the actual fact on actual factors that have six

984
01:00:57.081 --> 01:01:00.800
books and actual fact is that there's a infinite,
if you will,

985
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:04.520
way in which the order them,
and if I were to divide this would be in a photo.

986
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:09.670
So the fact all they were my values introduced is how I'm gonna order them.

987
01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.050
But what the call or even if their book,
but no,

988
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:19.440
the bullfighter what they might be firewood.
They might be a weapon.
Yeah.

989
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.780
There's lots of things they can be other than books

990
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.240
<v 6>for the physical.
So amusing to me because the first,</v>

991
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:30.050
no,
seriously though,
the first,
uh,

992
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.040
I study and I've written quite a bit on content formation and classification,

993
01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.590
but whenever I'm writing,
but I don't think I've ever said this before.
Um,

994
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:42.850
I remember back to when I was a little kid and I had this bookshelf and I was

995
01:01:42.851 --> 01:01:44.800
ordering the books on the bookshelf and I was thinking,
well,

996
01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.780
what's the right way to do it?
Uh,

997
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.530
and of course the answer is there isn't one right way built into nature.

998
01:01:50.531 --> 01:01:52.810
Here's how everyone's got to put into the Dewey decimal system.

999
01:01:52.811 --> 01:01:56.490
And if not for Dewey,
no one would've figured it out.
Right.
There are,
um,

1000
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.530
a lot of examples,
a lot of different ways you can order books,

1001
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.360
but there are all and anything else,
right.

1002
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.300
But there are all sorts of problems about the things that,
um,

1003
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:11.350
make it necessary to order them in certain ways to achieve different purposes.

1004
01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:15.100
Right.
Uh,
and to understand that as long as you add that last part,

1005
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:20.910
there's very broad types of we have to have in order to be able to think and

1006
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:25.740
function at all.
Yeah.
Um,
and those purposes,

1007
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:30.180
the purpose of getting to know as much of reality as we can of holding that

1008
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:33.890
reality in a way that won't Flomex us.
And therefore with unity,

1009
01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:36.750
economical is the word.
Um,
ran sometimes you just for this,

1010
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:40.020
so a way that allows you to hold a lot of information in a compact number of

1011
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:43.020
units.
Um,
and then there are certain facts that you need to know.

1012
01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:44.830
And other facts we don't because of our natures,
you know,

1013
01:02:44.831 --> 01:02:49.010
to navigate ourselves through the world provides standards for how we are

1014
01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:49.911
conceptualizing.
Yeah.

1015
01:02:49.911 --> 01:02:53.160
So although our purposes and our needs as human beings matter,

1016
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:58.200
it's not as though any purpose is just as good as any other.
And there's a,
well,

1017
01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.400
you can come up with standards for objectivity of what,
um,

1018
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.510
what is an objective way to form concepts and declassify in the same way that

1019
01:03:06.511 --> 01:03:08.510
you can come up with standards for what?
Waiting.

1020
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.730
<v 5>I agree with everything you said,</v>

1021
01:03:10.731 --> 01:03:13.040
except I don't think you can come up with it objectively.

1022
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.680
I even think there is a hierarchy of values though.

1023
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.100
<v 6>Hey,</v>

1024
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.490
listen to the objective though that's involved in objective grading or objective

1025
01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:20.780
reporting,
right?

1026
01:03:20.781 --> 01:03:23.840
It's not that the grades are already out there in the paper and you just got to

1027
01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:27.500
find it in there or the newspaper stories already written in a good reporter

1028
01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:31.640
will find it.
It's rather there's a way,
maybe not just one,

1029
01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.650
but a small range of them right away,

1030
01:03:33.651 --> 01:03:37.520
that this has to be done in order to accomplish legitimate purposes for doing
it.

1031
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.050
<v 5>Yes.</v>

1032
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:42.210
There's a finite range of organizing things that will enable you to use them in

1033
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:43.330
a in a reasonable way.

1034
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.950
<v 6>We mean,
when we talk about an article being written,
objective Lee,</v>

1035
01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:48.910
a paper being graded objectively,
and I think in the same sense,

1036
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.460
you can talk about a concept being formed subjectively or values being formed

1037
01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:53.810
objective,
but okay.

1038
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:56.120
<v 2>Right?</v>

1039
01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.120
[inaudible] there's a lot in that

1040
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.890
<v 5>that I think is,
is,
is dead on.
Like I do believe,
for example,</v>

1041
01:04:05.891 --> 01:04:10.891
that one of the ways we deal with the fact that there's a plethora of facts is

1042
01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:15.070
that we impose interpretive structures on those facts that are common to all of

1043
01:04:15.071 --> 01:04:18.220
us because we have common goals,
like we don't want to suffer and die.

1044
01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.180
Generally speaking,

1045
01:04:19.181 --> 01:04:24.100
we want to stay alive and our biological systems predispose us to act in ways

1046
01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:26.050
that are commensurate with that.
And,

1047
01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:29.890
and so I don't think there's an infinite number of solutions to the fact that

1048
01:04:29.891 --> 01:04:32.540
there's an infinite number of problems.
That's where I think the postmodern,

1049
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:33.640
this have gone wrong.

1050
01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.680
But I think that when you say that what you've produced by by constraining the

1051
01:04:38.681 --> 01:04:43.681
solution set is somehow akin to objectivity that that's where I have a

1052
01:04:43.841 --> 01:04:44.770
conceptual problem.

1053
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.190
Even though I don't disagree with the reason that you would make that case.

1054
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:52.360
Then I guess what would happen is we'd have to define what constitutes objective

1055
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.100
because when I think of objective,

1056
01:04:54.101 --> 01:04:57.880
I think about the strict application of the scientific method and what that's

1057
01:04:57.881 --> 01:05:01.720
done for us is lay out a world,
not a values,
but of objective fats.

1058
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:04.540
If you're objective,
you can lay out the objective facts,

1059
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:07.360
but I can't see how you can derive the damn values.

1060
01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.600
Even though I do believe that there's a hierarchy of values and that there's a

1061
01:05:10.601 --> 01:05:11.560
finite hierarchy.

1062
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:16.000
I don't think putting that into the category of objective truth is reasonable

1063
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.520
because I don't think that those truths are objective.

1064
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.300
<v 6>There's some,
there's,
there's some other form of truth.
Well,</v>

1065
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.410
and I think that that's generally captured in something like metaphor and

1066
01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:28.480
narrative,
which I think Dave's going to push us to move on in a minute,

1067
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:31.510
but I want to think one thing.
If I can before I actually wasn't,

1068
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.300
I was thinking that maybe we dumped the Q and a and just keep going.

1069
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:37.933
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1070
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.490
<v 6>You wanted to say about,
I mean,</v>

1071
01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:47.100
so first I totally agree up one of these fully dump it.
We'll,

1072
01:05:47.101 --> 01:05:49.160
we'll do about 10 more here.
One of the that you did,

1073
01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:52.310
how do we define objectivity and is another one of these classifying questions,

1074
01:05:52.311 --> 01:05:55.880
right?
Uh,
and that's an interesting question.
Where did this concept come from?

1075
01:05:55.881 --> 01:05:56.930
There's a whole history to it.

1076
01:05:56.931 --> 01:05:59.970
There've been books written about the history of the concept of creativity and

1077
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.880
that's something maybe for another occasion,

1078
01:06:01.881 --> 01:06:04.310
but let's flag that as a really interesting question.

1079
01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:08.660
As for just want to say something about his art before we,

1080
01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.350
and also something about whether we can get to the same conclusion starting from

1081
01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:14.150
different places.
Um,

1082
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:19.640
I see what Harris is doing is he's in the tradition of a lot of impurities to

1083
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.441
goes back to epic.

1084
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:24.500
Heareth it's definitely present in mill and then a different kind of way in
Hume.

1085
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.360
Um,
they'll very different in Hume and Adam Smith.
Um,
if you're an empiricist,

1086
01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:32.930
do you think everything comes from perception and you usually have a kind of

1087
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.870
fairly atomized view of perception.

1088
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.290
Think that collections of confessions and what these types of impurities

1089
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:44.350
generally do when they get to ethics is they pick some sensation to identify

1090
01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:48.050
their value terms with.
So either pain,

1091
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.520
maybe the sensation of pain is indicative suffering if the one sandy right is

1092
01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:55.370
the bad,
and then whatever the opposite to that pleasure with the good.

1093
01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.980
Some of them you the sensation of desire,
fulfillment or,

1094
01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.000
but they picked some sensation from simple psychological state that can be

1095
01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:05.090
experienced in a moment and identify that with the good.

1096
01:07:05.091 --> 01:07:07.240
And then they come up with some theory about,
you know,

1097
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.800
how do we get as many of those moments through as much of them as possible.

1098
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:12.890
That famously with John Stuart mill does epicure with in a very different way.

1099
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:17.960
Um,
and if you think you can derive value from facts like that,

1100
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.520
I don't,
I think that's the mistake.

1101
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:22.490
I don't even think that's really deriving value from that.

1102
01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:26.930
All that's doing is identifying value with certain very,
very simple fat.

1103
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.950
So what I think the real question about deriving value from fact is,

1104
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:33.620
is we have the value concepts,

1105
01:07:33.621 --> 01:07:36.950
concepts like good and bad that we use to direct ourselves,

1106
01:07:36.951 --> 01:07:38.000
directors hell through life.

1107
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240
How do we form vive concepts and these concepts be formed based on fat in an

1108
01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:48.341
objective manner as opposed to just being found out there already or um,

1109
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.970
or just being made up and you can make up your worth and I can make up mine.

1110
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.520
And there's no way to tell if the Nazis or the Klu Klux Klan or the communists

1111
01:07:55.521 --> 01:07:58.640
to where we are right about what the value.
So,
um,

1112
01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:03.380
so I think we have to take this question back to the broader question of how do

1113
01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:06.230
you form concepts and what kind of ways,

1114
01:08:06.231 --> 01:08:08.370
just perceptual evidence play in the forming of feather.

1115
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.920
And in the case of value concept,
and here I'm drawing on rand if I usually do.

1116
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.480
Um,
what I think we do is at the deepest level,

1117
01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:19.250
it comes from the needs of living organisms.

1118
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:23.000
There were certain ways they need to function in order to survive and prosper

1119
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.230
and values or the way that we conceptualize that there'd be conceptually.

1120
01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.330
So a human values in health and conceptual form is an identification of

1121
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:33.920
something a human being needs to live.

1122
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.410
And he values that in so far as he chooses to live.

1123
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:40.130
And in some foreign recognizes that it will contribute to his life.

1124
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.640
But what I think ethics is a branch of philosophy as a science and in fact has

1125
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:49.910
to do,
is really articulate the foundations of the values,
where they come from,

1126
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:53.430
what the fundamental values are,
what the fundamental ways of achieving them is.

1127
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.970
So how would you ask

1128
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.730
<v 5>perspective from the perspective of our Darwinian pragmatist?</v>

1129
01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:01.340
<v 6>So let me just say one more thing before I get to that.
So,</v>

1130
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:05.150
but that doing that as a philosopher is a pretty sophisticated thing.

1131
01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.990
People don't start doing philosophy until thousands of years more than that into

1132
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:09.860
living as human being.

1133
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.580
This particular theory of the origin of values didn't come about until the
1950s.

1134
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.480
So in some sense,
prior to that,
human beings,

1135
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:20.150
we're identifying things as values in conceptual terms.

1136
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.400
We learn it as we were kids.

1137
01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:24.350
We learned that some things are good and some things are bad.

1138
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.730
And what a philosophical theory of values has meant to do is to articulate why

1139
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.310
that works,
what it is that we're doing that or when we do that.

1140
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:34.250
But other people who don't have the same theory than us,

1141
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:39.140
we'll have some of the same values.
And so we might come to the same conclusions,

1142
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:42.590
but without being able to fully defend and articulate them in the same as,

1143
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:45.080
I don't think it's coincidence that both of us sync,

1144
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.760
the Nazis were bad and the communists were bad.
Uh,

1145
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.910
even though we start in some sense from different places,

1146
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:54.010
but I think to fully develop and understand what's bad about them,
uh,

1147
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.560
and to come out consistently on the more difficult cases,
uh,

1148
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:58.760
of what's good and bad.

1149
01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.000
Although the Nazis was a really difficult case for a lot of people we should

1150
01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:03.200
remember in the communist still is.

1151
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.080
That's where we need I think to get down to the donors know you're asking me

1152
01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:07.150
about the Darwinian.
Yep.

1153
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.750
<v 5>Well,
because you know,
if,
if you're,
if you're making the claim,
which I think is,</v>

1154
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:16.370
it's a,
it's a justifiable claim,
whether or not it's accurate,
um,

1155
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:21.260
is that our ethics are grounded in something like the necessary,

1156
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.930
we could say the necessity for survival and reproduction,

1157
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:27.410
which are variants of survival.
Obviously it's a Darwinian claim.

1158
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.880
It's the claim that the American pragmatists advanced as well because this is,

1159
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:36.630
this is,
um,
person and um,
William Jameson primarily,

1160
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:41.630
you know,
they believe that you're,
your knowledge was a tool.

1161
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:44.960
Knowledge was a tool to advance being in the world,

1162
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:47.960
let's say survival in the world and that you justified your knowledge not

1163
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:51.380
because you had finite final knowledge of anything,

1164
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:56.381
but because your tools were good enough to obtain the end that you were aiming

1165
01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:58.610
at.
That was the validation process.

1166
01:10:58.611 --> 01:11:01.670
If your theory was good enough to get you to where you are aiming,
that it's,

1167
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:04.850
it was true enough and the pragmatists believed that that was the best that you

1168
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:08.420
could do with truth.
And then when Darwin advanced his theory,

1169
01:11:08.421 --> 01:11:10.160
the American pragmatist said,
Oh look,

1170
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:12.920
Darwin's theory is actually an extension of pragmatism.

1171
01:11:12.921 --> 01:11:16.950
And pragmatism is the notion that your truths are good enough to facilitate your

1172
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:21.190
survival.
But this is the rub is that star wars,

1173
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:22.111
there's a,

1174
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.800
there's a truth that's embedded in the Darwin you'd worldview that is not the

1175
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:28.410
same truth that is embedded in the Newtonian worldview.

1176
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.790
There's a conflict between those two.
And the Newtonian worldview is basic,

1177
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:37.650
basically the world of fat,
right?
Roughly speaking.
And there's a,

1178
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:42.710
there's a set of claims about truth that are based in a Newtonian worldview and

1179
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:45.900
they're not the same as the ones that are based in the Darwinian point of view.

1180
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.430
It's a big problem.

1181
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:51.510
And part of the reason that I've been arguing with Sam for like three years is

1182
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:55.980
because he's an evolutionary psychologist in principle and a by a biological

1183
01:11:55.981 --> 01:11:56.610
thinker.

1184
01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:00.960
And yet he essentially has a Newtonian worldview that is the world of facts.

1185
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:02.640
That's real.
It's like,
no,
no.

1186
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:06.000
There's a world of values and the world of values is devoted not towards

1187
01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:10.320
determining what's objectively true but towards facilitating survival.

1188
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.380
And those are not the same thing.

1189
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.940
Now there's obviously a relationship between them because the world of values

1190
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.160
and the world of facts coexists,

1191
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.220
but the relationship doesn't seem to be one to one.

1192
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.193
<v 2>Got It.</v>

1193
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.580
<v 7>I mean the will,
the will the values just use a valuer that is the wall.</v>

1194
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:35.600
The fact they are facts out there.
The that's the Newtonian physics.

1195
01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:40.520
They really is a world out there.
The all of it values exist here,

1196
01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:44.510
exist in the mind of individuals.
We value something.
It's,

1197
01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.140
there are no values out there independent out of value work.

1198
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:52.400
So these are two different dimensions and any,
any,

1199
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:57.110
any work,
you know,
they,
part of valuing is identifying the fact,

1200
01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.920
yes,
this is the rub.
That's funny.
Probably even used your hand motions.

1201
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:03.830
[inaudible] we did.

1202
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.770
<v 6>I mean the,
the American pragmatists are interesting philosophically and,</v>

1203
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:13.740
and there were some things I like about them and one is the really stressed the

1204
01:13:13.741 --> 01:13:17.130
importance of activity and thought,
you know,
thought you don't just,

1205
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.750
the world doesn't just come to,
you have to do something,
uh,
to think right.

1206
01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:24.120
If physically the they really stressed the activity of the mind and they really

1207
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:27.510
stress the role of ideas in action.

1208
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.510
And I think that's something that's left out in a lot of philosophy.

1209
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:34.620
But I think they lose the reality in doing that.

1210
01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:37.740
So they treat it as though,
um,

1211
01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:41.690
consciousness is just something that uh,

1212
01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.490
running your life and all your ideas or just what your mind busy doing.

1213
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But I think what we know and can tell to be the case when we just introspect on

1214
01:13:54.311 --> 01:13:57.580
our own conscious and think about what it is to be conscious is that to be

1215
01:13:57.581 --> 01:13:59.140
conscious,
to be conscious of something,

1216
01:13:59.141 --> 01:14:01.150
to be conscious of something independent of yourself.

1217
01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:06.100
There's a world out there and what we mean by consciousness is the graph above

1218
01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:07.420
and awareness of that world.

1219
01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:11.230
We wouldn't even be able to get the idea of our own consciousness except

1220
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:13.630
contrast to a world that we're distinguishing it from.

1221
01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.630
You close your eyes and you open them and you think the things still there.

1222
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:17.050
You know,

1223
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:20.110
you have the idea that of a world that's there and then your consciousness is of

1224
01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:20.944
that world.

1225
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:24.550
And I think you have to have that idea of knowledge and knowledge being about

1226
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:29.290
something that's independent of you.
Um,
and I think the pragmatists lose that.

1227
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.680
I think there's this kind of dichotomy we find in thought between everything's

1228
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:36.740
in your head and your,

1229
01:14:36.741 --> 01:14:39.970
your mind is very active in your knowing the world and you're deciding things

1230
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:42.790
and therefore you don't actually get out the world the way it actually is.

1231
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.370
And then on the other side,
you do get out the world the way it actually is.

1232
01:14:45.371 --> 01:14:47.890
But because you don't do anything,
it just comes to you passive.

1233
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:49.480
And I think both of those are wrong.

1234
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:51.700
There's activity you have to do to get at the world,

1235
01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:53.920
but it's activity to get at the way the world is.

1236
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:57.370
And of course you get it in a certain form.
Just like if I kicked something up,

1237
01:14:57.371 --> 01:15:00.370
I'm holding it in one form and I could hold it in a different form,
you know?

1238
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.860
But I'm still holding it.
It's not like I'm getting any.
And likewise for values.

1239
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.500
<v 5>Dogmatists do retain the world,
but they look at it slightly different.</v>

1240
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:12.610
They say the world is what objects to your stupid theory.

1241
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:17.020
So let's say you,
you,
so it's not that the world is made of objects.

1242
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:19.630
The world is made of what objects to your stupid theory.

1243
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.560
That's a whole different idea.
And it's a way more sophisticated idea.

1244
01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.310
And so for the pragmatists,

1245
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:27.880
if you lay out a theory in the world in action and the action obtains its,

1246
01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:30.520
and then the theory is sufficiently true,
but you know,

1247
01:15:30.521 --> 01:15:32.620
lots of times when you lay out your theory in the world,

1248
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:36.400
you don't get what you expected.
And then the question is what you get.

1249
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:39.400
And you might say,
well,
you get an array of new facts.
It's like,
no,
no,

1250
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.170
that's not what happens.
What you do,

1251
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:45.580
what you get is an array of new incomprehensible possibilities and that's not

1252
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:48.010
the same thing as a set of facts.
So let me give you an example.

1253
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:49.720
You'll all understand this very rapidly.

1254
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:54.190
Imagine you're married to someone and you trust them and they betray you and you

1255
01:15:54.191 --> 01:15:58.660
discover that one day.
So that's the world objecting to your stupid theory,

1256
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.703
that's for sure.

1257
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.860
Because you had a theory about who you were and the theory about who your

1258
01:16:02.861 --> 01:16:06.400
partner was in the theory about what your life was and that theory was seriously

1259
01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:11.260
wrong.
Past,
present,
and future are all something radically new.
You might say,

1260
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:15.310
well,
a new set of facts confronts you really?
Is that right?
Okay,

1261
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.930
just what are those facts?

1262
01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.740
It's like you'll be in a pit for two or three years trying to just get the bare

1263
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:22.240
facts out of that situation.

1264
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.800
The only thing you'll know for sure when the world objects to your stupid theory

1265
01:16:25.801 --> 01:16:28.750
is that you were wrong.
It's not like the world is going to array.

1266
01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.080
It sets like who is this person that I was married to?

1267
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:35.050
That's what's going to be the question.
And the question is,

1268
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:38.590
what kind of fool was I for making these presuppositions to begin with?

1269
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.860
And it's not like that new knowledge will manifest itself in a set of instantly

1270
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:46.930
apprehensible facts about the true nature of the world.

1271
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.620
You're going to be suffering like mad for a very good long time before you can

1272
01:16:50.621 --> 01:16:53.620
take what you have,
which isn't facts,

1273
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:58.270
but just confusion and transform that into something that's even vaguely

1274
01:16:58.271 --> 01:17:00.670
resembling a set of apprehensible facts.

1275
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:05.560
You'll be in serious psychological trouble until the world reveals itself as a

1276
01:17:05.561 --> 01:17:08.470
set of apprehensible facts.
And if you're traumatized badly enough,

1277
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:09.304
it'll never happen.

1278
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.950
And so that's another part of the problem with the idea that the world just

1279
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.220
represents itself as facts from which you can derive values.

1280
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.140
It's like not when you're bloody confused and you're confused a lot and you're,

1281
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:26.030
you're confused when the range of potential that's manifested exceeds your,
your,

1282
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:30.790
your grasp exceeds your capabilities and then the way you respond to that isn't

1283
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.700
even cognitively the way you respond to that.
This is part of embodied cognition.

1284
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:40.190
What do you do when something in comprehensible objects to you?
Well,

1285
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.020
it depends on how incomprehensible it is,

1286
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:46.820
but let's say what did you do when the twin towers fell was at this set of
facts?

1287
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:49.610
It's like you didn't know what the hell was going on and neither did anyone
else.

1288
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.760
What you did was go into a state of crisis and that state of crisis is actually

1289
01:17:54.981 --> 01:17:59.981
an embodied pre-cognitive response and what happens biologically is that you get

1290
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:02.510
flooded with cortisol,
which is a stress hormone,

1291
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.860
and what it does is prepare you to take a very large array of potential actions.

1292
01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:08.660
That's your response.

1293
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:12.830
So it's not like the world has raid itself as a set of facts from which you can

1294
01:18:12.831 --> 01:18:13.664
derive value.

1295
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:18.050
What happens is the world is the rate itself as an incomprehensible mystery and

1296
01:18:18.051 --> 01:18:21.680
you have to do something about that and what you do is ratchet up your

1297
01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:25.540
physiology so that you're burning yourself up because you age faster with this

1298
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:28.760
sort of thing happens,
which is why you age faster.
If you're in crisis,

1299
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:32.360
you burn yourself up in the attempt to do everything at once,

1300
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:33.950
to prepare to do everything at once.

1301
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:39.310
And that's really the world manifesting itself as an object and objecting to

1302
01:18:40.311 --> 01:18:42.710
your theory.
It doesn't come out as an array of facts.

1303
01:18:42.711 --> 01:18:45.260
It would be so lovely if every time you were wrong,

1304
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.140
what happened was a new array of facts.
Yeah.

1305
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.590
<v 7>The point is,
the point is that the reality doesn't just show up.</v>

1306
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.010
It's not just an array of fact,
but when that cortisol happens,

1307
01:18:54.011 --> 01:18:55.000
when that if it happens,

1308
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.620
what you do is consciously make an effort to go find the facts.
If

1309
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.470
the facts are still in reality.

1310
01:19:05.471 --> 01:19:09.610
So something happened and I and 11 so the first thing you do is what actually

1311
01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:10.031
happened.

1312
01:19:10.031 --> 01:19:13.390
You have to figure out what actually happened is real work and real cognitive

1313
01:19:13.391 --> 01:19:17.230
effort.
Who are these people?
Well,
what is the ideology driving them?

1314
01:19:17.231 --> 01:19:17.891
Why did they do?

1315
01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:22.891
It's all of these things off facts that exist in reality at your responsibility,

1316
01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:23.801
your mom's responsibility,

1317
01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:28.240
I think to yourself is to go find and discover the facts that are relevant for

1318
01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:31.780
the decisions.
And the actions you need to take given the event that's happened.

1319
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:36.180
So yes,
psychologically if you discover your wife from a train,
you,
you,

1320
01:19:36.181 --> 01:19:40.000
you're confused.
But I think your job as a human being is,
okay,

1321
01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.280
what actually happened and where did I make my mistakes?
So it's hot,

1322
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.680
but this is what you want to,

1323
01:19:47.681 --> 01:19:51.430
what free will is free will is that engaging reason,

1324
01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.930
engaging our consciousness to discover the facts out there and,

1325
01:19:56.050 --> 01:20:00.910
and apply them to making a new conclusion.
Right?
Okay,

1326
01:20:00.911 --> 01:20:05.020
so so something's wrong in my values and my wife,
what was it?

1327
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:09.330
Did you really betray me?
Or the facts is it is what's going on here real.

1328
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.620
So all of it is again of tune to reason or return to,

1329
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:19.170
to return to the discovery of facts,
which is what,
what reason does.
Okay,

1330
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:20.010
so two things.

1331
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:24.400
<v 5>First,
you mentioned relevant,
the relevant facts and that's the rub.</v>

1332
01:20:24.401 --> 01:20:28.410
But I would also say interestingly enough in relationship to your argument that

1333
01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:31.930
developmental psychologists,
Sean Piaget made a very similar claim.

1334
01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:37.260
He said that because the domain of established facts was mutable and that's the,

1335
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:40.930
that's the issue.
Say with the fact that your partner could be Trey,
you,

1336
01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.590
even what you know can be,
can be mutable,
right?

1337
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:49.240
Then what is relevant in the search for truth isn't the search for a set of

1338
01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:50.051
immutable facts,

1339
01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:55.051
but a search for the process by which by which factor generated from the chaotic

1340
01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:59.600
potential to begin with.
It's not exactly how Piaget worded it,
but,
but,
but,

1341
01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:02.740
<v 7>but the fact so that your wife is either between you,
if she's not betraying you,</v>

1342
01:21:02.741 --> 01:21:07.590
it's not.
It's not.
There's this always a potential is also potentiality.

1343
01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:08.770
But she's either between you,

1344
01:21:08.771 --> 01:21:13.060
she's not betraying you and your job is to discover whether she is or she isn't,

1345
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:17.410
right?
If that's the job you've assigned yourself.
Right?
So,
so it,
the fat,

1346
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.500
the reality is what it is.
Uh,

1347
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.480
it's not dependent on you'll discovering it or not.

1348
01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.140
Your responsibility if you're married is,

1349
01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:28.450
is to know whether your wife is between you and not.
Uh,
hopefully,

1350
01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.580
hopefully you don't need to do the exercise cause,
uh,
cause she's not in,
in,
in,

1351
01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:34.700
and,
and you have trust in that.
But,

1352
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.260
but your consciousness is identifying the truth of what's out there.

1353
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:43.480
It's not,
some are way of infinite possibility.
She could be betraying,

1354
01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:44.410
she'd be half betrayed you.

1355
01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.510
She can be happy to train you just like she can't be half pregnant.

1356
01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:50.110
So the two possibilities,
she says the a you she's not.

1357
01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:53.860
And your job is to apply reason,

1358
01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.710
which I take as identifying what is true and what is not,

1359
01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.920
what is factual and what is not,
what is the evidence weighing the evidence.

1360
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.810
And then there's a whole,

1361
01:22:01.811 --> 01:22:04.680
a psychological assessment of the why did this happen to me?
What did I see?

1362
01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.180
Did I screw up that she screw up?
Why he was my assessment before?

1363
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.410
But that's a separate question.
First,
did she,
had she,
so,

1364
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:15.190
so it strikes me as just this is relatively simple,
right?

1365
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:18.070
If the facts are what they are,

1366
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.640
our job is to discover them and let me know.
Let me

1367
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.880
<v 6>say about this,
the world objecting to your theory.
Uh,</v>

1368
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:26.940
it's certainly true that the world of jets to stupid theory if you've got them

1369
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:27.774
to try it out.

1370
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:32.460
But I don't take that as a definition of the world if one fact about the world,

1371
01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.090
uh,
and more importantly the fact about our theories that they better match the

1372
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:37.860
world.
Otherwise we are going to have trouble with them.

1373
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.300
And when you get into this situation,
and this is what I,

1374
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.340
the pragmatists take it too often as though the theory is just there were not

1375
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:51.540
too interested in how it got there except by repeated episodes of what's about

1376
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:53.820
to happen,
which is that the world objects to it.

1377
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:57.570
And then you go scrambling to try to get out of this state of cognitive

1378
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:01.640
dissonance that you're in because of the objection.
So,
you know,
um,
do,

1379
01:23:01.641 --> 01:23:03.450
he says at one point thought thoughts of disease,
right?

1380
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.160
Everything's easy and nice.
You don't have to think,

1381
01:23:06.161 --> 01:23:08.930
you just go by in some stupid,
he wouldn't put it that way.
But,
uh,

1382
01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.550
and then some fact objects and now you've where the world objects and now you've

1383
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:16.520
in dissonance and you've got to figure out how to reconfigure your mental life

1384
01:23:16.521 --> 01:23:17.470
so that you can get on with it.

1385
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:21.160
And that is what a lot of people did after nine 11 right?
A lot of people,

1386
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:25.150
something unexpected and horrible happened and what they were motivated to do

1387
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.410
was figure out what are the fewest moves I can make to get things to go back to

1388
01:23:29.411 --> 01:23:31.870
normal and be all right.
I don't care what's true.

1389
01:23:31.871 --> 01:23:35.020
I don't care who really did this.
I don't care what would really solve it.

1390
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:39.220
I just care what I can tell myself to make this confusion and disruption and

1391
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:42.460
agitation go away and that's dishonesty and that's wrong.

1392
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.030
And to really value honesty and wanting to get the right answer and being

1393
01:23:46.031 --> 01:23:49.600
rational in these situations and caring about what happens to your damn life.

1394
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:51.550
You can't say,
you know,
Oh,

1395
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:55.030
I just want to be back into blissful oblivion by coming up with some new theory.

1396
01:23:55.190 --> 01:23:58.630
Why do y'all know what went wrong in the first place?

1397
01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:03.400
I got to this theory somehow.
Yup.
Uh,
now I see that the theory is wrong.

1398
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.410
What mistake did I make along the way?

1399
01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:08.320
What was the process by which I generated this Siri?

1400
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.660
And what was the misstep in that process?

1401
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.960
How can I fix it to generate a new theory,
one that'll be true.

1402
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.520
And that that process by which you generate your theories,

1403
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:20.860
it's a process of forming concepts.
It's a process of collecting evidence.

1404
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:23.390
It's a complicated process.
It's a lot to say about it,
right?

1405
01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:25.840
Sounds like repentance and atonement to me.

1406
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.560
Uh,
it can be,

1407
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:33.040
but it's in that you're acknowledging an error and you're trying to fix it,

1408
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:38.020
but you're trying to see how you made this theory and how you can make it

1409
01:24:38.021 --> 01:24:40.960
better.
And if you,
this idea that,
you know,
this idea,

1410
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:44.500
that philosophy and really thinking starts when you come to contradictions,

1411
01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:48.280
you get this back in the Greek was the dialectical tradition and people debating

1412
01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:52.620
each other.
And I think there's something really profound in Aristotle,
uh,

1413
01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.620
as opposed to Plato and the other Greeks,
the other Greeks,
they seem to,

1414
01:24:56.621 --> 01:25:00.070
and then later Hago they come up with contradictions and they think what can we

1415
01:25:00.071 --> 01:25:01.570
do to get past this contradiction?

1416
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.690
But what Aristotle always does and all of his books have this structure.

1417
01:25:04.691 --> 01:25:09.100
I think it's brilliant.
He,
he gets into a field by discussing the debates in it.

1418
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.640
He shows all the contradictions and all the puzzles and it can't be this and

1419
01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:17.620
this,
and then he says,
let's start fresh.
Let's go back to the drawing board.

1420
01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:18.970
Let's think about how we got here.

1421
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.830
And then he crafts a new theory starting from the pint of fact that motivated

1422
01:25:23.831 --> 01:25:25.900
the old series from the kind of observations,

1423
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.160
let's say that motivated the old theory,

1424
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:29.110
but that avoids the difficulties in the new one.

1425
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.980
Rather than just trying to reconfigure the go forward,

1426
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:36.130
you go back and if there's a hierarchy,

1427
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.460
not just the hierarchy of values but also a hierarchy of our understanding of

1428
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:39.940
the world,

1429
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.940
certain ways of understanding it or more basic and others that are built up on

1430
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:43.774
top of that.

1431
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.930
When you find that one of your theories and the theories are really complex way

1432
01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:50.470
of knowing,
right?
When you find that one of your theories is mistaken,
you think,

1433
01:25:50.471 --> 01:25:54.610
how can I go back to the more basic,
more primitive types of knowledge?
Uh,

1434
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.320
more basic types of observations,

1435
01:25:56.321 --> 01:26:01.300
whatever it might be from which I generated this Siri and then and now add to it

1436
01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:04.100
the new observations and the new knowledge that I have based on what went

1437
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.920
<v 5>wrong and generate a new theory that will be better than it.
Yeah.</v>

1438
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:12.130
Let's give Jordan the last word on that as well.
Yes,
but

1439
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.750
the problem is,
you know,
that works.

1440
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.460
There's,
there's two problems with it though.
One is that it's really,
really,

1441
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:22.731
really,

1442
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:27.680
really difficult cognitively because the more of your theory you have to unpack,

1443
01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:32.681
like imagine that your theory is composed of presumptions and the more basic

1444
01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:33.860
that presumption,

1445
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:38.300
the more your world is organized as a consequence of that presumption.

1446
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.740
And so like the presumption of your partner's fidelity is a very fundamental

1447
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:46.940
presumption because the entire interpretation of your relationship is predicated

1448
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:49.550
on that assumption.
And so if you let that assumption go,

1449
01:26:49.551 --> 01:26:53.300
then you let everything that you know about your relationship go and that casts

1450
01:26:53.301 --> 01:26:55.340
you into chaos more and more thoroughly.

1451
01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:59.330
So the more you go back to first principles to revise your theory,

1452
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.290
the more cognitive,
I don't like this distance idea,

1453
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:08.060
but the more you throw your state yourself into a state of existential crisis

1454
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:13.450
and the more you end up cycle physiologically preparing for catastrophe as a

1455
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:16.550
consequence and the faster you die.

1456
01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.780
So the problem with ungluing things back down to first principles,

1457
01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.500
which is actually what happens to people by the way when they develop post

1458
01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:27.080
traumatic stress disorder,
is that you undo yourself in doing that.

1459
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:29.930
And when you undo yourself,
there's a physiological price to pay.

1460
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:33.020
So even though that is the root out make a fundamental error,

1461
01:27:33.021 --> 01:27:35.150
you should make fundamental reparations.

1462
01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:38.120
The cost of doing that is unbelievably high.

1463
01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.080
And so people are loath to do it even though they might have to do it because of

1464
01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:46.100
course,
you know,
you were saying it was wrong to paper over an error.

1465
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:50.240
And I asked what?
Why is it wrong?
If it makes you feel better,
why is it wrong?

1466
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:54.740
Which is a perfectly good question.
But the answer to why it's wrong is what?

1467
01:27:54.741 --> 01:27:56.930
What do you want to make the same stupid error again?

1468
01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:02.300
What if the air was caused I fatal?
You make it two more times your dad.

1469
01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.950
And so the cost of repeating,

1470
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:09.010
that's the thing about cognitive errors insofar as they are enacted.

1471
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:11.630
If there are errors and you make them in the world,

1472
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:15.080
the world objects and it takes you apart,
and if there is profound enough,

1473
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:18.530
then you suffer a lot and die.
And maybe not just you.

1474
01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.240
Like the errors can be really profound.

1475
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:25.040
So it might be that you have to fix the damn hole in your map because otherwise

1476
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:27.410
you'll fall through.
But that nonetheless,

1477
01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:30.350
that the cost of doing that is so high that you're going to shy away from it.

1478
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:33.400
And people do that all the time.
That's partly why they take the easy route.

1479
01:28:33.401 --> 01:28:36.350
It's like they take the easy route because the difficult route is,

1480
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.900
it's difficult.
It's really difficult.
Well,

1481
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:44.240
think about what you'd have to figure out if you were subject to a betrayal like

1482
01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:47.450
that.
It's like,
well,
maybe you married the wrong person.
That's possible.

1483
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:51.890
Maybe you created the wrong person in your marriage,
in your interactions,

1484
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:53.690
interactions with your partner.

1485
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:58.010
Or maybe you're so damn naive that it's just absolutely beyond comprehension.

1486
01:28:58.011 --> 01:29:02.130
Like there's all sorts of terrible things lurking under the revelation

1487
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.950
<v 7>of that objection.
And digging down there to,
to,</v>

1488
01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:08.070
to pull them out is it's a hell of a job,
right?

1489
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:11.910
That's the confrontation with the terrible dragon of chaos.

1490
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:16.370
And in that confrontation,
you can easily be burnt to a crisp.
Oh,
so,

1491
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.170
but this is partially why it's so,

1492
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.200
it's so crucial to know yourself and to build a solid foundation of self,

1493
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.090
uh,
in any relationship.
Right?
So that,

1494
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:31.980
so that it's not somebody else's betrayal does not unwind everything you think

1495
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:32.843
about yourself.

1496
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:38.270
So you can't go that every time reality doesn't match your theory,

1497
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:43.560
you completely unlined.
Right?
Right.
So,
so knowing oneself,

1498
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.300
having a solid foundation as sense of you know,
sense of self esteem,

1499
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:51.900
a sense of self worth or self sense of confidence and,

1500
01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:55.590
and having a philosophical foundation and this is why as you said,

1501
01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:57.630
it's hard work.
And that week we completely,

1502
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:01.790
that is morality is hardwork living is hard work.
Uh,

1503
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:05.550
you went back to,
to the idea of,
of the pragmatism and survival.

1504
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:09.210
One of the things that,
that we,
you know,
that I hold it,
you know,

1505
01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:14.040
we hold I think is that survival call human being as a human being with their

1506
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.440
unique features as human being is a lot of work.

1507
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:18.600
And they were quite particular type of work,

1508
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.200
particularly reasoning and thinking and figuring stuff out.

1509
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:26.430
And the more work we do,
the more we build our character,

1510
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.110
the easier it is to deal with the shocks to the system.

1511
01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:34.890
The easier it is to deal with the nine 11 or more betrayal because we know where

1512
01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:38.700
we are and now we just need to figure out what the facts on we can deal with

1513
01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:41.010
whatever the facts of whatever we already throws at you.

1514
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.280
If you've done the Malo work to create a moral character you should be able to

1515
01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:48.390
deal with while you have your been

1516
01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.570
<v 2>up.</v>

1517
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:54.670
[inaudible]

1518
01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:01.810
<v 4>I got a seriously stiff neck from looking that way the whole time.
Sorry guys.</v>

1519
01:31:01.811 --> 01:31:05.000
How you doing over there?
What happens up left?
Yeah.
Whoo.

1520
01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.053
Um,

1521
01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:12.450
well this was such a perfect example of why I love the reality that I like to

1522
01:31:13.151 --> 01:31:15.760
think I created and maybe some of it came from before me

1523
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:16.900
<v 2>would be good.
This is it.</v>

1524
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:21.930
[inaudible]

1525
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.260
<v 4>I mean,
what do you think was more worthwhile?</v>

1526
01:31:25.261 --> 01:31:30.130
What we just did here for an hour or what was on CNN for the last hour?
You know,

1527
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.510
this really is it.
And you know,
these are,
these are huge differences and in,

1528
01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:35.370
and in some ways they're small differences.

1529
01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:39.960
And that's what I want to end for our final five minutes here is why is it that

1530
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.540
so seemingly these days,

1531
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:46.590
so few people are willing to do this.

1532
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:51.591
So few people are willing to tour the country to talk all to all sorts of people

1533
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.760
about all sorts of different things and put their ideas on the line and,

1534
01:31:55.790 --> 01:32:00.040
and do all the philosophical work that you do and you're on,
you travel the world

1535
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.810
<v 6>and it seems there's an absolute starvation for it.
And yet,</v>

1536
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:06.340
so few people are doing it.
You're on,

1537
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:07.510
I'll start with you and then we'll go this way.

1538
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.521
<v 7>Well,
I mean,</v>

1539
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:14.521
I think because those people who don't want to have the debate have no ideas

1540
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:19.360
[inaudible] really empty.
Uh,
then he lists in some cases.

1541
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:22.910
And in that case,
what does kneelers them,
Neil Isms,
they absence.
It's zero away.

1542
01:32:22.911 --> 01:32:27.010
I mean,
I think called it the worship of zero,
right?
It's a nothingness.
It's,
it's,

1543
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.840
it's the,
they don't stand for anything.

1544
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.560
Whether you're going to go and do debates when they don't really represent

1545
01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:37.270
anything other than destruction.
There's nothing to talk.
Reason doesn't matter.

1546
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.440
Ideas don't matter.
The speech doesn't matter.

1547
01:32:40.441 --> 01:32:42.490
If as a consequence of what matter is action,

1548
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:46.800
this is why on Tifo storms into your room and you know,
they,
they,

1549
01:32:46.801 --> 01:32:49.300
they use their fists.
They,
there's nothing for them to say.

1550
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:54.250
There's no value that they have to present.
And I think it's true on if you will,

1551
01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:58.090
on,
on,
on the,
on the,
uh,
on the rights,
on the,
on the,

1552
01:32:58.091 --> 01:33:01.480
on the non speech,
right?
It's the same thing.

1553
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:04.020
It's my revelation,
my verbal,
you know,

1554
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.330
Islam or Christianity or whatever the religion is.
It's my revelation.

1555
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:11.350
It's not heated debates.
The truth was revealed to me.
You know,

1556
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:13.360
there's no logic,
there's no reason.

1557
01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:17.110
There's no rationality that can challenge the fact that God spoke to me through

1558
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:19.000
a book or whatever.
The way he spoke to me,

1559
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:21.850
and this is the truth and there's nothing else that can be discussed.

1560
01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:26.530
So you've got two sides.
All they have is emotion and action.

1561
01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:30.490
Reason,
ideas,
debate,
discussion.

1562
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:33.370
As soon as you abandoned reason.
As soon as you abandoned the idea,

1563
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:37.090
that conversation,
that logic is the way in which we debate,

1564
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:41.530
discuss and discover the truth,
then now you've abandoned speech,
right?

1565
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:46.180
So they are against free speech because they're against reason because they're

1566
01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:49.150
against reality.
They're there.

1567
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.250
<v 6>So that really the beauty of this,</v>

1568
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:54.480
it's not that there has to be a knockout here that somebody has to be,
you know,

1569
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:58.660
dragged off stage is that everyone,
although wait for the closer

1570
01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:01.213
<v 7>we're going to be,</v>

1571
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.650
<v 6>but what that really that everyone here,</v>

1572
01:34:04.651 --> 01:34:08.790
the 600 some odd people here can take what they've heard here and then start

1573
01:34:08.791 --> 01:34:11.700
applying their own logic and reason and figure out what what they believe.

1574
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:17.070
Totally think and say to my students in that connection is that it'll minds the

1575
01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:19.470
rarely changed in the course of an argument.

1576
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:22.680
That doesn't mean they're not changed by an argument.
But you know,

1577
01:34:22.681 --> 01:34:26.880
if you and I are having an argument now,
it's about something important in deep.

1578
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:29.730
It's very unlikely that one of us at the end of the 15 minutes,

1579
01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:32.130
we're arguing he's going to come away with a changed world view.

1580
01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:35.760
It happens occasionally,
but pretty rare.
But often,
you know,
you go home,

1581
01:34:35.761 --> 01:34:36.421
you think about it.

1582
01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:39.630
I think about it in both of us improve our thinking as a result of that.

1583
01:34:39.631 --> 01:34:41.880
And maybe sometimes you see profound changes over time.

1584
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:46.050
The other thing I want it to say to your comment about why don't we see more of

1585
01:34:46.051 --> 01:34:46.650
this,

1586
01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:50.460
a wire and people willing to go around the country and do these kinds of talks

1587
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.930
and um,
and it does seem like there's a hunger for it.
People are turning out.

1588
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:59.940
Um,
yeah.
One
important thing with products and,

1589
01:34:59.941 --> 01:35:02.580
and uh,
you know,
this is a product that we're creating here,
right?

1590
01:35:02.581 --> 01:35:07.581
For people to consume is there's a lot of times in the world when there is a

1591
01:35:07.951 --> 01:35:12.240
potential demand for a product and people who could create that product and

1592
01:35:12.241 --> 01:35:15.160
nobody notices it and it goes a long time with nobody knows at the end.
What's,

1593
01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:18.510
what's great about entrepreneurs is they're the kinds of people who noticed that

1594
01:35:18.511 --> 01:35:19.560
there's an opportunity for them.

1595
01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.960
They figure it out and they create something new.

1596
01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:23.940
And I think that's what you're doing here,
right?

1597
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:27.690
You probably would have been willing to go on a tour a couple of years ago.
Um,

1598
01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.510
and you know,
you're onboard.
We,
um,

1599
01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.340
but before it was proven that there were these people who want to hear this and

1600
01:35:35.341 --> 01:35:38.220
there are ways to connect them together.
Nobody would have known to do it.

1601
01:35:38.221 --> 01:35:41.790
And so what all of you guys are doing in this connection,
and particularly Dave,

1602
01:35:41.791 --> 01:35:44.590
what you're doing and bringing all these people together on these long form talk

1603
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.790
shows,
I think is fantastic.
And it's creating this kind of value.

1604
01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:51.870
And I see it as one of the things that one of the hopeful signs in the culture

1605
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:55.340
that combating the fines that you were on talked about on both political sides.

1606
01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.880
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1607
01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:07.400
<v 5>can either take us out softer,
go for the kill,
because</v>

1608
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:12.200
they're a very friendly group of people.
Look,
I mean,

1609
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:14.370
if you're gonna talk about,

1610
01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.390
if you're going to dare to think publicly about difficult things to think and

1611
01:36:18.391 --> 01:36:20.400
speak publicly about difficult things,

1612
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:25.320
then you're going to cause trouble because you can't talk about something

1613
01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:28.530
difficult without causing trouble.
If it was easy,

1614
01:36:28.531 --> 01:36:31.170
then everyone would agree and then you could talk about it.

1615
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.500
No one would care because everyone already knew.
But it would be easy.

1616
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.820
But if it's difficult and you talk about it,
then you're going to upset people.

1617
01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.410
And then when you upset people,

1618
01:36:40.411 --> 01:36:44.490
they're gonna yell at you a lot and then well that's what's going to happen.

1619
01:36:44.491 --> 01:36:45.510
And then you know,

1620
01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:49.590
if you're not sure that there's any support for your position or even if you're

1621
01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:53.580
sort of vaguely human ended,
upsets you to be yelled at by many,
many people,

1622
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.760
you know,
you tend to shut up if a whole bunch of people that are yelling at you,

1623
01:36:57.030 --> 01:37:00.720
because you might be wrong.
And also you might be in danger.
But,

1624
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:04.980
but what happens right now is that,
well two things.

1625
01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.400
One thing to know is that just because some people yell at you right now,

1626
01:37:08.401 --> 01:37:12.240
it doesn't mean that all people will yell at you over the next month.
Right?

1627
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.960
So the people who are being thoughtful about it are going to be quieter and they

1628
01:37:15.961 --> 01:37:19.500
might be sort of hiding in the woodwork.
And so you have to learn that.

1629
01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:20.830
But then the other thing is,

1630
01:37:20.831 --> 01:37:22.890
and we've talked about this quite a bit in this tour,

1631
01:37:22.891 --> 01:37:26.700
is that there's a technological revolution that's occurring that's enabling

1632
01:37:26.701 --> 01:37:29.970
these long form conversations.
And it wasn't possible before.

1633
01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.300
Like we can live stream this right for no cost.

1634
01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:36.990
And so a whole bunch of people can watch this and the technology's there,

1635
01:37:37.170 --> 01:37:42.170
and it turns out that the technology has revealed to us the fact that there's a

1636
01:37:42.211 --> 01:37:46.050
collective starvation for deep,
long form discussion.

1637
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:50.880
And so hurray for that.
And so maybe that niche will be increasingly filled.
It's,

1638
01:37:50.881 --> 01:37:54.990
it seems to be happening.
And so,
um,
and that would be a good,

1639
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:58.710
because it seems to me that the way out of our current state of idiot political

1640
01:37:58.711 --> 01:37:59.700
polarization is,

1641
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:04.620
isn't the final establishment that one side is right and the other is wrong,

1642
01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:09.621
but to engage in sophisticated long form discussions to deal with the actual

1643
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:13.950
problems that are producing the polarization.
And maybe we can do that.

1644
01:38:13.951 --> 01:38:17.070
And maybe this is part of the process by which we do that successfully.

1645
01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:20.850
That would be a testament to the utility of the reason that you were describing,

1646
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.020
which is the only alternative to subjugation or violence,
right.

1647
01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.520
We either talk it through,

1648
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:31.170
we can pitch your late or we tyrannized those are the options.
So

1649
01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.260
<v 2>[inaudible] on that note,</v>

1650
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:48.910
<v 5>going for talking it through and for these three guys who presented there,
right?</v>

1651
01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.270
<v 2>Yes.
Thank you guys for coming out.</v>

1652
01:38:52.271 --> 01:38:57.271
Thank you for watching on the Youtube [inaudible].
