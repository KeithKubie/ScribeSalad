00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.470
girls that fall victim to sexual
violence this is also being addressed

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480
violence this is also being addressed
 

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.900
violence this is also being addressed
now in the under the children and armed

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:55.910
now in the under the children and armed
 

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.410
now in the under the children and armed
conflict agenda so basically the council

00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.420
conflict agenda so basically the council
 

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.410
conflict agenda so basically the council
has a very good normative framework what

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:02.420
has a very good normative framework what
 

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.180
has a very good normative framework what
is the problem that we are so facing

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:04.190
is the problem that we are so facing
 

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.190
is the problem that we are so facing
that's the implementation and there are

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:06.200
that's the implementation and there are
 

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.540
that's the implementation and there are
still some serious gaps in the

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:07.550
still some serious gaps in the
 

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.720
still some serious gaps in the
implementation I think one of the most

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:10.730
implementation I think one of the most
 

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.850
implementation I think one of the most
important is and I think it has been

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:12.860
important is and I think it has been
 

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.610
important is and I think it has been
mentioned already we just heard the news

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:15.620
mentioned already we just heard the news
 

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.880
mentioned already we just heard the news
about this appalling wave of rapes and

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:18.890
about this appalling wave of rapes and
 

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.160
about this appalling wave of rapes and
sexual violence in the DRC and one of

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.170
sexual violence in the DRC and one of
 

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.540
sexual violence in the DRC and one of
the major problems is the the lack of

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:24.550
the major problems is the the lack of
 

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.130
the major problems is the the lack of
accountability and they're still

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:27.140
accountability and they're still
 

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.740
accountability and they're still
prevailing impunity for the perpetrators

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.750
prevailing impunity for the perpetrators
 

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:35.230
prevailing impunity for the perpetrators
and the the council has taken some steps

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240
and the the council has taken some steps
 

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.540
and the the council has taken some steps
on that for example in the in the

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:37.550
on that for example in the in the
 

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.190
on that for example in the in the
context of the Democratic Republic of

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.200
context of the Democratic Republic of
 

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.280
context of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo sexual violence has been made

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.290
the Congo sexual violence has been made
 

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.390
the Congo sexual violence has been made
part of the criteria to revert to

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:46.400
part of the criteria to revert to
 

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.520
part of the criteria to revert to
sanctions and targeted measures so

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.530
sanctions and targeted measures so
 

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:52.210
sanctions and targeted measures so
parties or specific commanders of those

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:52.220
parties or specific commanders of those
 

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.520
parties or specific commanders of those
parties in armed conflict that do use

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:54.530
parties in armed conflict that do use
 

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.250
parties in armed conflict that do use
sexual violence there they will face

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.260
sexual violence there they will face
 

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.230
sexual violence there they will face
targeted measures so I think that was

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240
targeted measures so I think that was
 

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.710
targeted measures so I think that was
already an important step and also the

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720
already an important step and also the
 

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.480
already an important step and also the
the new SRSG has been briefing those

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.490
the new SRSG has been briefing those
 

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.400
the new SRSG has been briefing those
sanctions committee so I think we are

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.410
sanctions committee so I think we are
 

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.250
sanctions committee so I think we are
moving ahead but then of course there's

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.260
moving ahead but then of course there's
 

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:14.050
moving ahead but then of course there's
this so much more to be done the other

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.060
this so much more to be done the other
 

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.960
this so much more to be done the other
big gap that we have is when it comes to

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:16.970
big gap that we have is when it comes to
 

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.390
big gap that we have is when it comes to
monitoring and accountability in the

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:19.400
monitoring and accountability in the
 

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.140
monitoring and accountability in the
implementation of the resolution

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.150
implementation of the resolution
 

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.210
implementation of the resolution
for example on children and armed

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.220
for example on children and armed
 

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.710
for example on children and armed
conflict there is a working group that

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720
conflict there is a working group that
 

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.460
conflict there is a working group that
regularly meets and that can adopt

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:28.470
regularly meets and that can adopt
 

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.830
regularly meets and that can adopt
conclusions and recommendations for

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:31.840
conclusions and recommendations for
 

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.340
conclusions and recommendations for
those states that commitment violations

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.350
those states that commitment violations
 

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.280
those states that commitment violations
against children we've been continuously

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.290
against children we've been continuously
 

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.280
against children we've been continuously
arguing for a similar working group in

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.290
arguing for a similar working group in
 

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.390
arguing for a similar working group in
the field of women peace and security

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.400
the field of women peace and security
 

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.740
the field of women peace and security
but so far we the council could not find

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:46.750
but so far we the council could not find
 

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.210
but so far we the council could not find
agreement on this but it would be

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.220
agreement on this but it would be
 

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.220
agreement on this but it would be
important because you would really have

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.230
important because you would really have
 

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.430
important because you would really have
a dedicated capacity on the council that

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440
a dedicated capacity on the council that
 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.960
a dedicated capacity on the council that
would regularly meet and regularly

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:54.970
would regularly meet and regularly
 

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.390
would regularly meet and regularly
review those issues and make sure that

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:57.400
review those issues and make sure that
 

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.220
review those issues and make sure that
they really make their way into all the

00:14:59.220 --> 00:14:59.230
they really make their way into all the
 

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.410
they really make their way into all the
country specific considerations on the

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.420
country specific considerations on the
 

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.750
country specific considerations on the
council because I think mainstreaming is

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760
council because I think mainstreaming is
 

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.700
council because I think mainstreaming is
really is the way how we have to take

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:05.710
really is the way how we have to take
 

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.020
really is the way how we have to take
that agenda forward then another gap is

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.030
that agenda forward then another gap is
 

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.570
that agenda forward then another gap is
and we hopefully will get more and some

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:12.580
and we hopefully will get more and some
 

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.420
and we hopefully will get more and some
improvements here is that we need more

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:15.430
improvements here is that we need more
 

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.380
improvements here is that we need more
consistent a comprehensive reporting on

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:18.390
consistent a comprehensive reporting on
 

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.740

the whole situation of women in
situations of armed conflict data on

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:25.840
situations of armed conflict data on
 

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.750
situations of armed conflict data on
sexual violence patterns of sexual

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760
sexual violence patterns of sexual
 

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.720
sexual violence patterns of sexual
violence we need to know more about the

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:30.730
violence we need to know more about the
 

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.570
violence we need to know more about the
number of women participating in

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:33.580
number of women participating in
 

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.910
number of women participating in
negotiations we need more to know more

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920
negotiations we need more to know more
 

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.860
negotiations we need more to know more
information about what the quality of

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:37.870
information about what the quality of
 

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.140
information about what the quality of
their participation is there they really

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.150
their participation is there they really
 

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.580
their participation is there they really
just sitting there or are they people

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.590
just sitting there or are they people
 

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.970
just sitting there or are they people
that can influence the negotiations so

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:44.980
that can influence the negotiations so
 

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.240
that can influence the negotiations so
all this still needs to be added to the

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.250
all this still needs to be added to the
 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.950
all this still needs to be added to the
overall reporting to the council in a

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:49.960
overall reporting to the council in a
 

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.610
overall reporting to the council in a
more consistent manner then the last one

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:53.620
more consistent manner then the last one
 

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.680
more consistent manner then the last one
of the last gap but but another very

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:55.690
of the last gap but but another very
 

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.750
of the last gap but but another very
significant gap is prevention and early

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:57.760
significant gap is prevention and early
 

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.820
significant gap is prevention and early
warning unfortunately the council has

00:15:59.820 --> 00:15:59.830
warning unfortunately the council has
 

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.740
warning unfortunately the council has
always been fairly weak on this because

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:01.750
always been fairly weak on this because
 

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.550
always been fairly weak on this because
there's many member states that have

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560
there's many member states that have
 

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.020
there's many member states that have
always argued that the council can only

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.030
always argued that the council can only
 

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.270
always argued that the council can only
review situations that are on officially

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.280
review situations that are on officially
 

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.250
review situations that are on officially
on the agenda of the council but once

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.260
on the agenda of the council but once
 

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.660
on the agenda of the council but once
there are on the agenda it's usually too

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:12.670
there are on the agenda it's usually too
 

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.940
there are on the agenda it's usually too
late we have to be able to consider

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:14.950
late we have to be able to consider
 

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.610
late we have to be able to consider
those situations beforehand so what we

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:17.620
those situations beforehand so what we
 

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.710
those situations beforehand so what we
need is information as early as possible

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720
need is information as early as possible
 

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.900
need is information as early as possible
that situation is deteriorating for

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:21.910
that situation is deteriorating for
 

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.390
that situation is deteriorating for
women there is there are serious crimes

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.400
women there is there are serious crimes
 

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.070
women there is there are serious crimes
or even patterns of sexual violence

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:26.080
or even patterns of sexual violence
 

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.900
or even patterns of sexual violence
happening so that the council can take

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:27.910
happening so that the council can take
 

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.460
happening so that the council can take
that up before it's actually really on

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.470
that up before it's actually really on
 

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.079
that up before it's actually really on
the agenda

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:30.089
the agenda
 

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.199
the agenda
and so it's it's an information gap plus

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:33.209
and so it's it's an information gap plus
 

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:37.989
and so it's it's an information gap plus
it's the willingness on the council and

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:37.999
 

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:40.309
what and for all that as I said before

00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319
what and for all that as I said before
 

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:44.660
what and for all that as I said before
we we need something that allows us to

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:44.670
we we need something that allows us to
 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.460
we we need something that allows us to
measure progress to really know where we

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:46.470
measure progress to really know where we
 

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.809
measure progress to really know where we
stand and this is something that we have

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:50.819
stand and this is something that we have
 

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:54.439
stand and this is something that we have
been aiming for and actually and we did

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:54.449
been aiming for and actually and we did
 

00:16:54.449 --> 00:16:56.360
been aiming for and actually and we did
get it and this will be adopted by the

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:56.370

00:17:02.999 --> 00:17:05.480
measure progress in the implementation
of resolution 1325 how can you imagine

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.490
of resolution 1325 how can you imagine
 

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.760
of resolution 1325 how can you imagine
those indicators basically the

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:07.770
those indicators basically the
 

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.529
those indicators basically the
indicators are trying to take up all the

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:09.539
indicators are trying to take up all the
 

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:12.110

early reconstruction so some of those
indicators are for example taking the

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.130
indicators are for example taking the
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.950
indicators are for example taking the
just the number of cases reported cases

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960
just the number of cases reported cases
 

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.560

cases of those have been investigated
and prosecuted it will also be there

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120
and prosecuted it will also be there
 

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.930
and prosecuted it will also be there
will be indicators on the number of

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940
will be indicators on the number of
 

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.560
will be indicators on the number of
women in peacekeeping operations money

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:45.570
women in peacekeeping operations money
 

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.000
women in peacekeeping operations money
that is really specifically been

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.010
that is really specifically been
 

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.730
that is really specifically been
dedicated to projects benefiting women

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740

and girls in the post-conflict setting
 

00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:55.909
and girls in the post-conflict setting
this whole set of indicators will be

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919
this whole set of indicators will be
 

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:59.060
this whole set of indicators will be
endorsed by the council tomorrow and we

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.070
endorsed by the council tomorrow and we
 

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.350
endorsed by the council tomorrow and we
hope that the information that we will

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360
hope that the information that we will
 

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.180
hope that the information that we will
get out of those indicators will then be

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.190
get out of those indicators will then be
 

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.330
get out of those indicators will then be
part of those reports and will give the

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340
part of those reports and will give the
 

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.399
part of those reports and will give the
council a better understanding of where

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:07.409
council a better understanding of where
 

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:10.760
council a better understanding of where
we stand and also member states will be

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:10.770
we stand and also member states will be
 

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.289
we stand and also member states will be
invited to use them in the national

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299
invited to use them in the national
 

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.720
invited to use them in the national
implementation meaning that member

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:14.730
implementation meaning that member
 

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.919
implementation meaning that member
states that have a national action plan

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:15.929
states that have a national action plan
 

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.049
states that have a national action plan
for example should also measure their

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059
for example should also measure their
 

00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:20.870
for example should also measure their
own progress when implementing or

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880
own progress when implementing or
 

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.250
own progress when implementing or
supporting the implementation of

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260
supporting the implementation of
 

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.889
supporting the implementation of
resolution 1325 so it will not be linked

00:18:24.889 --> 00:18:24.899
resolution 1325 so it will not be linked
 

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:27.820
resolution 1325 so it will not be linked
to just countries in armed conflict and

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:27.830
to just countries in armed conflict and
 

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.519
to just countries in armed conflict and
I think I mean we have with this video

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:31.529
I think I mean we have with this video
 

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:34.810
I think I mean we have with this video
achieved a major step that will really

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:34.820
achieved a major step that will really
 

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.610
achieved a major step that will really
also assess and evaluate everything that

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620
also assess and evaluate everything that
 

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.450
also assess and evaluate everything that
we've done before in a more

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:39.460
we've done before in a more
 

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.639
we've done before in a more
a better way because we will see what

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:41.649
a better way because we will see what
 

00:18:41.649 --> 00:18:43.350
a better way because we will see what
actions have worked what has not worked

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360
actions have worked what has not worked
 

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.450
actions have worked what has not worked
what approaches we have to adapt what is

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.460
what approaches we have to adapt what is
 

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.830
what approaches we have to adapt what is
really being the impact on the ground

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840
really being the impact on the ground
 

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.899
really being the impact on the ground
and I think this is very a very

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:48.909
and I think this is very a very
 

00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:50.940
and I think this is very a very
important step to link the work of the

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:50.950
important step to link the work of the
 

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.710
important step to link the work of the
council to what's actually happening on

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720
council to what's actually happening on
 

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.320
council to what's actually happening on
the ground maybe 11 just 23 at a remarks

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:58.330
the ground maybe 11 just 23 at a remarks
 

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.190
the ground maybe 11 just 23 at a remarks
on the and the dynamics I think the the

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200
on the and the dynamics I think the the
 

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.570
on the and the dynamics I think the the
difficulties that we are facing with

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:03.580
difficulties that we are facing with
 

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.070
difficulties that we are facing with
women peace and security in the everyday

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080
women peace and security in the everyday
 

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.899
women peace and security in the everyday
work of the council as I said before is

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:06.909
work of the council as I said before is
 

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:08.909
work of the council as I said before is
to really make sure that everybody who

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919
to really make sure that everybody who
 

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.310
to really make sure that everybody who
is sitting there takes up those issues

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320
is sitting there takes up those issues
 

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.399
is sitting there takes up those issues
every day in every context where it's

00:19:14.399 --> 00:19:14.409
every day in every context where it's
 

00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:16.500
every day in every context where it's
relevant this is also very much a

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:16.510
relevant this is also very much a
 

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.480
relevant this is also very much a
coordination issue amongst ourselves

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:18.490
coordination issue amongst ourselves
 

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.789
coordination issue amongst ourselves
within emissions but you can imagine

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799
within emissions but you can imagine
 

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.649
within emissions but you can imagine
with the mainstreaming approach on every

00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:22.659
with the mainstreaming approach on every
 

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:25.409
with the mainstreaming approach on every
country that somebody else sitting so we

00:19:25.409 --> 00:19:25.419
country that somebody else sitting so we
 

00:19:25.419 --> 00:19:27.810
country that somebody else sitting so we
really have to make an effort there to

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:27.820
really have to make an effort there to
 

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.230
really have to make an effort there to
be more consistent ourselves then of

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240
be more consistent ourselves then of
 

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.990
be more consistent ourselves then of
course it's it's a bit it's difficult to

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000
course it's it's a bit it's difficult to
 

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.490
course it's it's a bit it's difficult to
take this whole agenda forward because

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:35.500
take this whole agenda forward because
 

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.560
take this whole agenda forward because
yes it is a security issue but it's got

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:39.570
yes it is a security issue but it's got
 

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.730
yes it is a security issue but it's got
underlying causes that have to be

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:41.740
underlying causes that have to be
 

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.710
underlying causes that have to be
addressed as well and I think it's fair

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720
addressed as well and I think it's fair
 

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.940
addressed as well and I think it's fair
to say that both the lack of

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:44.950
to say that both the lack of
 

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.090
to say that both the lack of
participation as well as the fact that

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.100
participation as well as the fact that
 

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.820
participation as well as the fact that
women are being targeted to for sexual

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:50.830
women are being targeted to for sexual
 

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.470
women are being targeted to for sexual
violence is still also an equality issue

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480
violence is still also an equality issue
 

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.570
violence is still also an equality issue
it's often the lack of empowerment so

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:54.580
it's often the lack of empowerment so
 

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.039
it's often the lack of empowerment so
it's difficult to really separate this

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:56.049
it's difficult to really separate this
 

00:19:56.049 --> 00:19:58.139
it's difficult to really separate this
and in you enter MIT means that the

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:58.149
and in you enter MIT means that the
 

00:19:58.149 --> 00:19:59.960
and in you enter MIT means that the
whole advancement and equality issues

00:19:59.960 --> 00:19:59.970
whole advancement and equality issues
 

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.549
whole advancement and equality issues
are part of the General Assembly where a

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559
are part of the General Assembly where a
 

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.620
are part of the General Assembly where a
security is what the security council is

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:04.630
security is what the security council is
 

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.289
security is what the security council is
responsible for and that is something

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:07.299
responsible for and that is something
 

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:10.019
responsible for and that is something
that where we still face difficulties to

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:10.029
that where we still face difficulties to
 

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:12.600
that where we still face difficulties to
to bridge that gap and and make sure

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.610
to bridge that gap and and make sure
 

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.100
to bridge that gap and and make sure
that also the council looks into those

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.110
that also the council looks into those
 

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.269
that also the council looks into those
issues but I think it will stop here

00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:18.279
issues but I think it will stop here
 

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:20.789
issues but I think it will stop here

where I will refer to in a little bit I
think in all these places there are some

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:30.990
think in all these places there are some
 

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.660
think in all these places there are some
approaches which have been taken for

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:32.670
approaches which have been taken for
 

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.010
approaches which have been taken for
example as take the example of Haiti

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020
example as take the example of Haiti
 

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:39.260
example as take the example of Haiti
first after the earthquake we realized

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:39.270
first after the earthquake we realized
 

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.030
first after the earthquake we realized
that the challenge would be essentially

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040
that the challenge would be essentially
 

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.800
that the challenge would be essentially
with IDP camps because people are

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:42.810
with IDP camps because people are
 

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.599
with IDP camps because people are
divorced from their natural environment

00:45:44.599 --> 00:45:44.609

they are living in very small cluster

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:46.890
they are living in very small cluster
 

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.770
they are living in very small cluster
clustered spaces and therefore the

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780
clustered spaces and therefore the
 

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.570
clustered spaces and therefore the
chances of rape or sexual violence are

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:50.580
chances of rape or sexual violence are
 

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.460
chances of rape or sexual violence are
very high and therefore there was a

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.470
very high and therefore there was a
 

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.349
very high and therefore there was a
strategic policing plan which was

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359
strategic policing plan which was
 

00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:57.320
strategic policing plan which was
prepared this included deployment of

police peacekeepers in DRC actually
 

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.859

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060
 

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.370
one other question and you mentioned

01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:53.380
one other question and you mentioned
 

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.020
one other question and you mentioned
that one of the issues were often a lack

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:55.030
that one of the issues were often a lack
 

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.660
that one of the issues were often a lack
of information or a lack of numbers that

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:57.670
of information or a lack of numbers that
 

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.400
of information or a lack of numbers that
you the Security Council couldn't know

01:10:59.400 --> 01:10:59.410
you the Security Council couldn't know
 

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.189
you the Security Council couldn't know
and that hence putting in new indicators

01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199
and that hence putting in new indicators
 

01:11:02.199 --> 01:11:04.459
and that hence putting in new indicators
also help strengthen the reporting

01:11:04.459 --> 01:11:04.469
also help strengthen the reporting
 

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.780
also help strengthen the reporting
having worked in eastern Congo and

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:06.790
having worked in eastern Congo and
 

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:09.090
having worked in eastern Congo and
having spent a lot of time trying to get

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:09.100
having spent a lot of time trying to get
 

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.669
having spent a lot of time trying to get
information trying to get numbers I'm a

01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679
information trying to get numbers I'm a
 

01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:13.350
information trying to get numbers I'm a
bit curious to hear or a bit surprised

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360
bit curious to hear or a bit surprised
 

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.300
bit curious to hear or a bit surprised
to hear that there's a lack of knowledge

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:15.310
to hear that there's a lack of knowledge
 

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:16.950
to hear that there's a lack of knowledge
and reporting and numbers because

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960
and reporting and numbers because
 

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.689
and reporting and numbers because
there's a lot of data being collected so

01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:18.699
there's a lot of data being collected so
 

01:11:18.699 --> 01:11:22.380
there's a lot of data being collected so
where where does it get lost perhaps you

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:22.390
where where does it get lost perhaps you
 

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.850
where where does it get lost perhaps you
want to start with your last question

01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860
 

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.260
okay well thank you for those questions

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:28.270
okay well thank you for those questions
 

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.850
okay well thank you for those questions
I think they're there all I had you

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:29.860
I think they're there all I had you
 

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.260
I think they're there all I had you
relevant and I will really start with

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:31.270
relevant and I will really start with
 

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:34.410
relevant and I will really start with
the last one and first I don't think

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:34.420
the last one and first I don't think
 

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:37.380
the last one and first I don't think
that we do not always have a lack of

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:37.390
that we do not always have a lack of
 

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:40.200
that we do not always have a lack of
information but it's sometimes difficult

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:40.210
information but it's sometimes difficult
 

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:42.270
information but it's sometimes difficult
to build the case and we need

01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280
to build the case and we need
 

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.060
to build the case and we need
information to build the case because

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:45.070
information to build the case because
 

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:47.160
information to build the case because
you you have to take into account the

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:47.170
you you have to take into account the
 

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.140
you you have to take into account the
Security Council does not only consists

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.150
Security Council does not only consists
 

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:50.580
Security Council does not only consists
of a few like-minded countries the

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:50.590
of a few like-minded countries the
 

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:52.890
of a few like-minded countries the
Security Council has 15 members so

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:52.900
Security Council has 15 members so
 

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.300
Security Council has 15 members so
basically everything that the security

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:54.310
basically everything that the security
 

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.970
basically everything that the security
council decides at the end of the day

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980
council decides at the end of the day
 

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.770
council decides at the end of the day
has to be support has to find the

01:11:58.770 --> 01:11:58.780
has to be support has to find the
 

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.020
has to be support has to find the
support of the whole council and the

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.030
support of the whole council and the
 

01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:03.180
support of the whole council and the
problem that we sometimes have and

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:03.190
problem that we sometimes have and
 

01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:05.459
problem that we sometimes have and
that's also may be linked to the first

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:05.469
that's also may be linked to the first
 

01:12:05.469 --> 01:12:07.169
that's also may be linked to the first
question on how we make the case for

01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:07.179
question on how we make the case for
 

01:12:07.179 --> 01:12:10.439
question on how we make the case for
having more women participation is that

01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:10.449
having more women participation is that
 

01:12:10.449 --> 01:12:12.959
having more women participation is that
we really have to sometimes demonstrate

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:12.969
we really have to sometimes demonstrate
 

01:12:12.969 --> 01:12:14.430
we really have to sometimes demonstrate
that it doesn't make a difference to

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440
that it doesn't make a difference to
 

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.669
that it doesn't make a difference to
have women at the table that we have to

01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679
have women at the table that we have to
 

01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:21.030
have women at the table that we have to
make that we have to demonstrate the the

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040
make that we have to demonstrate the the
 

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.880
make that we have to demonstrate the the
scope and the specificities of the

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:23.890
scope and the specificities of the
 

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:26.840
scope and the specificities of the
sexual violence I'm in a certain area

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:26.850
sexual violence I'm in a certain area
 

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.419
sexual violence I'm in a certain area
because not everybody will always be

01:12:30.419 --> 01:12:30.429
because not everybody will always be
 

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.860
because not everybody will always be
convinced that this is really the case

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:31.870
convinced that this is really the case
 

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.290
convinced that this is really the case
so this is why we need this information

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:34.300
so this is why we need this information
 

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.330
so this is why we need this information
and this is why it can really help help

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:36.340
and this is why it can really help help
 

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.840
and this is why it can really help help

or I think I mean we had a long
 

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.390
or I think I mean we had a long
discussion about that today actually

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400
discussion about that today actually
 

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.680

it comes to our development corporation
to make sure that our development

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.170
to make sure that our development
 

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.110

corporation is consistent with what we

01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120
corporation is consistent with what we
 

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.229
corporation is consistent with what we
advocate foreign in resolution 1325 so I

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239
advocate foreign in resolution 1325 so I
 

01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:37.050
advocate foreign in resolution 1325 so I
think they're there are various contexts

01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:37.060
think they're there are various contexts
 

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.590
think they're there are various contexts
in which 1325 will be relevant for for

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600
in which 1325 will be relevant for for
 

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.720
in which 1325 will be relevant for for
various member states and then of course

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:42.730
various member states and then of course
 

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:44.430
various member states and then of course
I mean we had this big discussion on

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440
I mean we had this big discussion on
 

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.320
I mean we had this big discussion on
whether the application of the

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:46.330
whether the application of the
 

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:48.180
whether the application of the
indicators today should be linked or

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:48.190
indicators today should be linked or
 

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.010
indicators today should be linked or
should be limited to situations on the

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:50.020
should be limited to situations on the
 

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.229
should be limited to situations on the
council's agenda but also here very

01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239
council's agenda but also here very
 

01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:55.470
council's agenda but also here very
often you can if you look at this

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480
often you can if you look at this
 

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.290
often you can if you look at this
information over time and you suddenly

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300
information over time and you suddenly
 

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.169
information over time and you suddenly
you see that the situation or women

01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:01.179
you see that the situation or women
 

01:14:01.179 --> 01:14:03.030
you see that the situation or women
deteriorates levels of violence raise

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040
deteriorates levels of violence raise
 

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.240
deteriorates levels of violence raise
and you have significant changes there

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:06.250
and you have significant changes there
 

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.760
and you have significant changes there
it this can be the sign that we are

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:08.770
it this can be the sign that we are
 

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:11.189
it this can be the sign that we are
heading for for serious trouble in a

01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199
heading for for serious trouble in a
 

01:14:11.199 --> 01:14:13.110
heading for for serious trouble in a
certain region and that's why the

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120
certain region and that's why the
 

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.990
certain region and that's why the
council should become active and I I do

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000
council should become active and I I do
 

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.890
council should become active and I I do
agree with Betty very much that the just

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:19.900
agree with Betty very much that the just
 

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.060
agree with Betty very much that the just
information is not going to change

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.070
information is not going to change
 

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.669
information is not going to change
anything because what is really going to

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679
anything because what is really going to
 

01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:25.320
anything because what is really going to
change something in the end this is the

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:25.330
change something in the end this is the
 

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.570
change something in the end this is the
political will that has to be there but

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:27.580
political will that has to be there but
 

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.120
political will that has to be there but
i think thats that applies to everything

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:30.130
i think thats that applies to everything
 

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.340
i think thats that applies to everything
that the council does and you can

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:32.350
that the council does and you can
 

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.200
that the council does and you can
imagine that there are various interests

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:34.210
imagine that there are various interests
 

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:36.030
imagine that there are various interests
with various member states that

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040
with various member states that
 

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.439
with various member states that
unfortunately sometimes make it

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:37.449
unfortunately sometimes make it
 

01:14:37.449 --> 01:14:40.800
unfortunately sometimes make it
difficult to really come to that will

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:40.810
difficult to really come to that will
 

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.240
difficult to really come to that will
but i think when we're talking about

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:44.250
but i think when we're talking about
 

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:47.310
but i think when we're talking about
participation i think it's very very

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320
participation i think it's very very
 

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.959
participation i think it's very very
important that that women sit at the

01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:48.969
important that that women sit at the
 

01:14:48.969 --> 01:14:51.750
important that that women sit at the
table and I think it's equally important

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760
table and I think it's equally important
 

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.430
table and I think it's equally important
and that's why I'm happy to see a few

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440
and that's why I'm happy to see a few
 

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.410

more man in this room that also we take
 

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.500
more man in this room that also we take
that up because that is really something

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:58.510
that up because that is really something
 

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:00.750
that up because that is really something
where we can all make a difference when

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.810
as well and I think that also this is
not an agenda for women only it's an

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:09.820

the problem is a lot of times they're
 

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.690
the problem is a lot of times they're
not well designed not implemented as you

01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:40.700
not well designed not implemented as you
 

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:45.070

subscribe to this kind of recruitment
and that's why we have this very fragile

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:56.570
and that's why we have this very fragile
 

01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:58.720
and that's why we have this very fragile
situation of recruitment of these young

that's why I says speed is very

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:03.350
that's why I says speed is very
 

01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:04.810
that's why I says speed is very
important because once you feel that

01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:04.820

obviously there's usually a cash for the

01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:25.340
obviously there's usually a cash for the
 

01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:29.170
obviously there's usually a cash for the
weapons that they produce and then and

01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:29.180
weapons that they produce and then and
 

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:32.170
weapons that they produce and then and
then you must can't on them you must put

01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:32.180
then you must can't on them you must put
 

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:35.680
then you must can't on them you must put
them in that in this closed area and and

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:35.690
them in that in this closed area and and
 

01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:37.570
them in that in this closed area and and
then the next steps and next steps are

01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:37.580
then the next steps and next steps are
 

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:40.150
then the next steps and next steps are
usually doing some very basic training

01:52:40.150 --> 01:52:40.160
usually doing some very basic training

and when for instance in Burundi when I

01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:42.470
and when for instance in Burundi when I
 

01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:44.020
and when for instance in Burundi when I
was there they were already doing the

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:44.030

road repair so so you train them in road
 

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:49.390
road repair so so you train them in road
repair canal repair all these things you

01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:52.990
know but just to get kyrgyzstan for
instance that's what we're doing just to

01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000
instance that's what we're doing just to
 

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.450
instance that's what we're doing just to
get all these angry young men off the

streets idle angry young men off the
 

01:52:58.070 --> 01:53:00.760
streets idle angry young men off the
streets and then of course it doesn't

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:00.770
streets and then of course it doesn't
 

01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:02.680
streets and then of course it doesn't
end there then of course there you know

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:02.690
end there then of course there you know
 

01:53:02.690 --> 01:53:04.780
end there then of course there you know
that is just like a pier 23 months way

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:04.790
that is just like a pier 23 months way
 

01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:07.030
that is just like a pier 23 months way
where you where you train them to these

01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040
where you where you train them to these
 

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.700

to these public works then must come the

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:09.710
to these public works then must come the
 

01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:12.700
to these public works then must come the
next step of during that period as I

01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:12.710
next step of during that period as I
 

01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:14.770
next step of during that period as I
said that's the sophistication in how

01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:14.780
said that's the sophistication in how
 

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:16.840

you implement these programs the good

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:16.850
you implement these programs the good
 

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:18.910

implementer would then look at the skill

01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920
implementer would then look at the skill
 

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.350

then provide the training and the

01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:31.310
then provide the training and the
 

01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:34.270
then provide the training and the
microcredit and then hope for the best

01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280
microcredit and then hope for the best
 

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.300
microcredit and then hope for the best
but that's about it I think this is such

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:37.310
but that's about it I think this is such
 

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.700
but that's about it I think this is such
an important role because if you look at
