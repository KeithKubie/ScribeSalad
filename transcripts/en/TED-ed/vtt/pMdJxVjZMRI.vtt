00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.055
Curiosity:

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.863
a blessing, or a curse?

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.603
The paradoxical nature of this trait

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:13.553
was personified for the ancient Greeks

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:15.913
in the mythical figure of Pandora.

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:17.033
According to legend,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.743
she was the first mortal woman,

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:23.413
whose blazing curiosity set a chain 
of earth-shattering events in motion.

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.076
Pandora was breathed into being 
by Hephaestus, God of fire,

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:31.266
who enlisted the help of his divine 
companions to make her extraordinary.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.626
From Aphrodite she received the capacity 
for deep emotion;

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:37.386
from Hermes she gained 
mastery over language.

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:41.826
Athena gave the gift of fine craftsmanship
and attention to detail,

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:44.506
and Hermes gave her her name.

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:48.006
Finally, Zeus bestowed 
two gifts on Pandora.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.376
The first was the trait of curiosity,

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:54.546
which settled in her spirit and sent 
her eagerly out into the world.

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.926
The second was a heavy box, ornately 
curved, heavy to hold –

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.792
and screwed tightly shut.

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:04.802
But the contents, Zeus told her, 
were not for mortal eyes.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:08.592
She was not to open the box 
under any circumstance.

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.313
On earth, Pandora met and fell in love 
with Epimetheus, a talented titan

00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:17.093
who had been given the task 
of designing the natural world by Zeus.

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:19.763
He had worked alongside 
his brother Prometheus,

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.503
who created the first humans

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.603
but was eternally punished 
for giving them fire.

00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:27.103
Epimetheus missed his brother desperately,

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:31.773
but in Pandora he found another 
fiery-hearted soul for companionship.

00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:34.403
Pandora brimmed with excitement 
at life on earth.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:37.743
She was also easily distracted 
and could be impatient,

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:42.073
given her thirst for knowledge and desire
to question her surroundings.

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:45.568
Often, her mind wandered to the contents 
of the sealed box.

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:49.784
What treasure was so great it could never 
be seen by human eyes,

00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:51.864
and why was it in her care?

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:54.244
Her fingers itched to pry it open.

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.234
Sometimes she was convinced 
she heard voices whispering

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.334
and the contents rattling around inside,

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:00.944
as if straining to be free.

00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:04.674
Its enigma became maddening.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:08.736
Over time, Pandora became more and more 
obsessed with the box.

00:02:08.736 --> 00:02:12.396
It seemed there was a force beyond her 
control that drew her to the contents,

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:15.516
which echoed her name louder and louder.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:17.817
One day she could bear it no longer.

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:19.437
Stealing away from Epimetheus,

00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:21.697
she stared at the mystifying box.

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:23.830
She’d take one glance inside,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.091
then be able to rid 
her mind of it forever...

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.339
But at the first crack of the lid, 
the box burst open.

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.309
Monstrous creatures and horrendous sounds

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.639
rushed out in a cloud of smoke and swirled
around her, screeching and cackling.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.629
Filled with terror,

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.309
Pandora clawed desperately at the air 
to direct them back into their prison.

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.222
But the creatures surged out 
in a gruesome cloud.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:49.806
She felt a wave of foreboding 
as they billowed away.

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:51.826
Zeus had used the box as a vessel

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:55.176
for all the forces of evil 
and suffering he’d created –

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.276
and once released,

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.196
they were uncontainable.

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.296
As she wept,

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:03.266
Pandora became aware of a sound echoing 
from within the box.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.954
This was not the eerie 
whispering of demons,

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:09.264
but a light tinkling that seemed 
to ease her anguish.

00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:11.914
When she once again lifted 
the lid and peered in,

00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:15.914
a warm beam of light rose out 
and fluttered away.

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:19.624
As she watched it flickering in the wake 
of the evil she’d unleashed,

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.934
Pandora’s pain was eased.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.594
She knew that opening the box 
was irreversible –

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:29.464
but alongside the strife, she’d set hope
forth to temper its effects.

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:32.894
Today, Pandora’s Box suggests 
the extreme consequences

00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:34.992
of tampering with the unknown –

00:03:34.992 --> 00:03:38.822
but Pandora’s burning curiosity also 
suggests the duality that lies

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.752
at the heart of human inquiry.

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:43.492
Are we bound to investigate everything 
we don’t know,

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:45.542
to mine the earth for more –

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.082
or are there some mysteries

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:48.852
that are better left unsolved?
