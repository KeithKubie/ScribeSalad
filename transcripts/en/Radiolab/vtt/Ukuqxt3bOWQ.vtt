00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.080
Hey, I'm Jad and I'm Robert Doone duty and your topic remains.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.270
Oops. Due to final loops coming up soon.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.330
It's sort of a double hoops. I would say we start with an oops.

4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.540
That leads to another oops. That then self negates.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.160
It comes to us from a fellow who within the confines of the show we will call

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.270
oopsie wheeler,

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.020
so maybe we could just start with the both of you kind of introducing yourself

8
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.610
and saying who you are and what you do. I mean,

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:33.140
just something basically I'm Andrea sterly. Oh, me. I'm Donald Sterling.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.090
This is dawn and Andrew Sterling. They're chemists.

11
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.260
They're actually a research team here at a University of Montana and they met

12
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:44.261
back in the 70s 1979 at the University of California in San Diego.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.740
We met and almost fell in love at first sight.

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.240
<v 1>We dated for a week. He proposed, I accepted.</v>

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
They got married and not long after don got offered a job,

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.840
so they left their home in Sunny California. And mind you,

17
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.460
we lived about half a mile away

18
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.840
<v 0>from the ocean. Nonetheless, they packed up a truck with all of our stuff,</v>

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.140
including about 200 plants and they moved to a

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.850
Butte, Montana, which is a different thing altogether.

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.490
An old mining town that barely had a tree in the the city limits.

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.440
I don't know if you want to know Andrea's first impressions of Butte or not.

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.740
Sure. I actually burst into tears and then started laughing.

24
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:28.910
I think we call that history.

25
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.910
Yeah. The beauty standard used to be up on the hill over here when this was an

26
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.930
operating. Yeah,

27
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.730
so I actually grew up in the town over from Butte in Montana.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.030
It's kind of that town that you were afraid to go to when you were a kid.

29
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.970
Filled with abandoned buildings, depressed,

30
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.040
and actually if you walk through town right there,

31
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:57.490
right next to the middle of town, remember exactly where it was.

32
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.330
I remember being this enormous open wound on the hill like, oh no,

33
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.420
this, this deep pit. This is where the pit is,

34
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.490
the Berkeley pit, and the guy saying, wow is Barrett Golding. I actually,

35
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.200
I couldn't get back to Butte myself,

36
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.300
so I asked Barrett to go over there and visit with a couple of engineers.

37
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.440
So tell me who you are. Okay, well I'm Joe Griffin,

38
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.650
Montana Department of Environmental Quality and I'm Nick Tucci.

39
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm with the Montana Bureau of Mines and geology and I'm,

40
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.630
the three of them are standing at the edge of the pit,

41
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.960
which is kind of hard to imagine, especially the size of this thing.

42
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:34.870
But when you're at the edge of the pit and you look down in what you actually

43
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.440
see is how can you convey what we're seeing,

44
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.340
this enormous lake kind of, well,

45
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:46.060
it's 40 billion gallons of water, which is a lot of water.

46
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:50.740
It's one of the larger lakes in the United States is carved into this hill.

47
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.730
Yeah.

48
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.430
The main difference though between this lake in one that you might decide to

49
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:59.140
take an afternoon dip in, is that this lake is a bizarre color.

50
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.983
The water is red.

51
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.010
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

52
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.010
<v 3>is this kind of sickly red and also rains and gray and black.</v>

53
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.640
<v 0>Oh, it's technical.</v>

54
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.050
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

55
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.980
<v 0>it shimmers in this way that like words can't describe.</v>

56
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.400
And when you're standing there, you can't help but wonder

57
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.831
<v 3>question.</v>

58
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.310
I really have and I'll rephrase it after they ask it cause it's not quite,

59
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.570
is like what the,

60
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.060
I mean what happened? Well it's just a, you know, the price of copper

61
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.560
<v 0>in the 1920s when we were stringing up telephone wires and electrical wires and</v>

62
00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:43.670
going through world wars,

63
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.980
a third of the copper in the u s came out of [inaudible]

64
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.540
<v 3>this hill, you know, the long and the short of it is, um,</v>

65
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.160
you wouldn't be standing here broadcasting this or recording this without copper

66
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:54.350
in your wire right there.

67
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.300
<v 0>And in his heyday, you know,</v>

68
00:03:56.301 --> 00:04:00.140
before the pit was even around Butte was this mining boom town.

69
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.800
But by the 1940s, the price of copper drop,

70
00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:08.690
a company that owned all the mines and BW wasn't doing so well and so they

71
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.470
figured it'd be cheaper and easier to just blow the top off the hill.

72
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.510
Things just kept getting worse.

73
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.950
And by 1982 right around the time when don and Andrea were coming to town,

74
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.010
taking over the mines completely shut down when they shut the pit in early 1980s

75
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.220
right? Here's the things, while they're actually mining,

76
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.260
they keep all the groundwater pumped out of there,

77
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:37.110
so that's dry and they can work and when they shut the mines down,

78
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.220
they shut off the pumps. The company turned off the pumps,

79
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.020
I think it was Earth Day 1982 yeah. On Earth Day after that,

80
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:51.021
the a p it started filling up with ground water and it took a good 10 years to

81
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:57.111
actually see a kind of a rust colored puddling in the bottom of the pit itself.

82
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.510
But it was a puddle that was growing and growing road and growing and growing,

83
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.030
growing. Now here's the thing about that water. The Rock around the pit.

84
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.740
It's filled with pyrite and when the water hits the Pyrite and the air three

85
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.100
react to create sulfuric acid.

86
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.670
<v 5>Oh, in turn, that's Edwin Dob.</v>

87
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.940
Freelance writer had been for about 20 years. I actually grew up in Butte.

88
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.770
The sulfuric acid hastens the removal of the metals from the,

89
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.070
or itself like gold and silver and copper, copper,

90
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.890
cadmium and growl sink,

91
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.550
<v 0>iron sulfate syndrome.</v>

92
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.300
And what you end up with is this toxic acidic disaster and it's still rising.

93
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.970
In fact, that, you know, since we started working on this piece,

94
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.370
Jad is arisen like about a foot.

95
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.310
<v 5>Um, there was an incident, infamous incident in the mid 1990s.</v>

96
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.200
<v 0>Anybody who grew up anywhere near Butte knows this story. One stormy night,</v>

97
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.100
some 340 snow geese landed.

98
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.910
They landed on the water looking for shelter and they of course drink some of

99
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.090
it.

100
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.090
The next day there were 342 goose carcasses floating on the water.

101
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.480
They were all dead.

102
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.290
And the autopsy showed lesions in the esophagus throughout the digestive system.

103
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.840
Oh, so it's like the water ate their insights. Yeah.

104
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.420
Were you struck at all like upon arriving there,

105
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:26.850
did you actually kind of go visit the mine?

106
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.880
The old mine site avoided it like the plague.

107
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.010
We were to staunch

108
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.650
environmentalist in the idea of living in a mining town was so completely

109
00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:41.220
foreign. And when they first showed up in Butte, Don and Andrew,

110
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.880
they were kind of struggling to fit in at the university because they're trying

111
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:47.790
to study this, a little micro organisms sponge in Bermuda,

112
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.330
but they're in Butte and locked Butte, Montana.

113
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.270
To make matters worse when they took off for a year on Sabbatical,

114
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.060
our college accidentally unplugged our refrigerator,

115
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.500
destroying all of our samples on desperation.

116
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.120
Definitely had no funding. We decided we just needed to start over,

117
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.400
but one day a scientist named Bill Chatham came into their lab with a piece of

118
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:15.780
wood and on this wood there was some green, slimy stuff and he says,

119
00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:19.890
you won't believe this, but I found this stick with the slime on it in the pit

120
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.270
floating about a foot below the surface of the water. Here's the thing,

121
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:27.190
I mean that lake is, this is like,

122
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.300
this is the most deadly place you can imagine. I mean,

123
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.230
nothing grows here. Nothing should grow here. Nothing. Absolutely not.

124
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.410
Not even anything but nothing. Yeah, less than nothing.

125
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.610
Maybe absolute nothing like negative numbers of nothingness.

126
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.970
It's more than nothing is an active getting rid of thing.

127
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's an a gating nothingness. You know how there's love and hate.

128
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.430
This is not a lack of love. This is hate. Okay.

129
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.250
But they got together with some colleagues.

130
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:57.850
They looked at the slime and they realized against all odds

131
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.180
the stuff was alive. Life, an acid mine,

132
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:06.330
waste life that no one had ever studied before.

133
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.010
It really is what started everything we've been doing now. Gosh,

134
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:15.870
for the last 15 years. [inaudible]

135
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.480
so far we found virtually hundreds of compounds, organisms that were growing,

136
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.250
organisms that make molecules that can fight viruses.

137
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:30.330
Several turn out to be good in our andi cancer screening by cancer. Really?

138
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.473
Yeah.

139
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.340
Burke lik acid in Berkeley amyloids and the Berkeley asked the towel is now

140
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:39.150
published. Tons of papers. I mean their work has just taken off,

141
00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.100
so it's been pretty exciting research.

142
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.340
But then they told me this story that totally took them by surprise.

143
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.980
It was about a year after they'd first started looking at the Pittwater.

144
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.960
We found this sort of a sticky, opaque, thick,

145
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.910
gooey black organism. Then they noticed that weirdly,

146
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.600
if you put this little guy into a thing of the water from the pit,

147
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.860
it actually absorbs the metals in Pittwater. What does that mean?

148
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.720
Like they're taking the metals out of the water.

149
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.490
They become a little metal sponge. Yes.

150
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:16.770
But so they're cleaning the water is what you're saying? Yeah.

151
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.950
And there's lots of people that work with micro organisms to try to clean up

152
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.810
metal late in water. But usually these things taken maybe like, I don't know,

153
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.380
10, 15% of the metals,

154
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.860
this little guy will actually absorb between 85 and 95%.

155
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.100
Whoa. So they got really curious about it and they started, uh,

156
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.970
trying to figure out where it had ever been seen before we had it identified.

157
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.750
And they eventually discovered that the only place this yeast had ever been

158
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:44.370
found was

159
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.663
<v 6>where?</v>

160
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.160
<v 0>Well, in the rectal swabs of geese.</v>

161
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.983
<v 6>Oh,</v>

162
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.820
<v 0>you mean like the snuggies that landed on the water? Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.050
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

164
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.580
<v 0>the geese left</v>

165
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.360
<v 7>a little, uh, a little something behind</v>

166
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.080
present.
