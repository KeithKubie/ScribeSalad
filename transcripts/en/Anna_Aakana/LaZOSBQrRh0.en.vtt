00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
So last week Brad noticed that Congress was kind of acting weird

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.260
and asked me to take a look at him

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.500
and once I saw him it was really clear that he was having trouble breathing

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.040
and that he needed to go to the emergency clinic right away.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.140
And I don't want to brag, but I'm

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.460
very calm and collected in a time of crisis

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.460
*screaming*

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.640
He's gonna die!

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm so sorry buddy!

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.980
Don't die!

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.160
Where is the closest vet clinic?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.840
Why didn't i look this up a month ago?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.820
What's wrong with me?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.020
so once we got there Congress was put into an oxygen incubator

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.600
and had x-rays done

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.380
which revealed that not only does he have fluid in his lungs,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.320
but he has an enlarged heart

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.780
he had an "insane amount" of gas in his stomach and intestines

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.260
and he has a leg that doesn't even have a socket to connect to his hips.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.080
So he's just lived his entire lie with a leg floating in his body.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
And I felt so horrible, you know

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.600
because Congress is like a "pure-bred cat."

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.220
Humans did this to him

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.040
we literally did this to him, he should not exist

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.200
but luckily the doctor came in and reassured me that congress wasn't in any pain

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.220
but he also said:

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.680
Unfortunately this just happens with Persian breeds.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.820
Due to his heart enlargement he's going to have to take

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.800
3 medications every day for the rest of his life

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.520
and sometimes the meds work,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.900
and sometimes they don't.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.140
But we don't know how long he's going to live

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
and that hit me, you know, in a weird way

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.060
that sentence:

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.220
"We don't know how long he's going to live."

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.560
Because on one hand, I mean it does, I mean it's terrifying

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.000
but it also makes me wanna spend every day cuddling Congress

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.820
because I don't know how long I'll have him.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.260
But on the other hand:

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.160
"We don't know how long he's going to live"

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.600
Can't this be said of everyone?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.580
I mean, we have no idea how long any of us are going to live.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.040
But should I be treating everyone in my life like a doctor told me:

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820
"We don't know how long he's going to live."

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.940
I mean, I'm the kind of person who reminds myself of death all the time.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.860
Especially in the happier moments of my life.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.660
I could be like taking shots with my friends

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.120
and I'll just randomly cheers

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.140
Cheers!  Cheers!  (Unison)

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.700
Everyone!

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.780
We're all gonna die!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100
But no matter how real death is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.520
and like its inevitability a guarantee,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.860
I feel like life is so long

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.600
that you just

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.400
forget.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.740
It convinces you that nothing bad is ever going to happen to you.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.260
So when something bad eventually does happen to you,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.660
I still feel so thrown.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.040
and its such a weird balance you have to have

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.380
with accepting your mortality

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.500
because it's like, you also can't live every day like it's  gonna be your last.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.540
That would lead to horrible decisions.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.480
We're all gonna die...

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.920
Congress is okay right now.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.740
He has a follow up appointment this week to see how the meds are working out.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.460
But he seems as happy and as hungry as ever.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.240
But I don't know man--

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.160
this whole experience made me think like

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.800
of course, like I wanna take more moments out of my days

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.240
to really enjoy and be in the moment

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.660
when I'm in the company of like

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.960
not only my cats of course

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.560
but also like my family and friends

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.860
because I know this isn't forever

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.440
but I'm not necessarily grateful

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700
for the time I get to spend with them

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.600
and I'd like to be more mindful of that.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.580
But what about you?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.420
Have you had any brushes with death recently?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.260
Any existential crises, brought on by the inevitability of our demise?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.440
and when you do think about these, these horrible things

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.020
do you feel more at peace?

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.240
or do you have like the opposite reaction?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.260
I'm Anna Akana

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.840
Stay awesome Gotham.
