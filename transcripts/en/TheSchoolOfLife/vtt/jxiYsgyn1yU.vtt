00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.240
One of the things that separates confident from diffident people is their approach to history.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.040
Broadly-speaking, the unconfident believe that history is over;

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.140
the confident trust that it's still in the process of being made – one day possibly by themselves.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.380
The way we enter the world carries with it an inherent bias towards an impression that change has finished,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380
and history has been settled.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.540
Everything around us conspires to give off a sense that the status quo is is entrenched.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.760
We're surrounded by big people who follow traditions that have been in place for decades, perhaps centuries.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.500
The house we live in appears as immutable as an ancient temple;

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700
the school we go to looks as though it has been performing the same rituals since the earth began.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.900
We're constantly told why things are the way they are

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.000
and encouraged to accept that reality is not made according to our wishes.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.900
We come to trust that human beings have fully mapped the range of the possible.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.800
If something hasn’t happened, it’s either because it can’t happen – or it shouldn’t.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.900
The result can be a deep wariness around imagining changing the world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.200
There's no point starting a new business

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080
(the market must be full already)

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.500
pioneering a new approach to the arts

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
(everything is already set in a fixed pattern)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480
or giving loyalty to a new idea

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
(it either exists or is mad).

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.200
When we study history in a certain way, however, the picture changes sharply.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.900
Once time is speeded up and we climb up a mountain of minutes, and survey the centuries, change appears constant.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.600
New continents are discovered, alternative ways of governing nations are pioneered,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.120
ideas of how to dress and whom to worship are transformed.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.600
Once people wore strange cloaks and tilled the land with clumsy instruments.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320
A long time ago, they chopped the king’s head off.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.100
Way back, people got around in fragile ships,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.400
ate the eyeballs of sheep, used chamber pots and didn’t know how to fix teeth.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.400
We come away from all this, knowing at least in theory, that things do change,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.780
but in practice – almost without noticing – we tend to distance ourselves

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.400
and our own societies from a day-to-day belief that we belong to the same ongoing turbulent narrative

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.500
and are, at present, its central actors.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.700
History, we feel, is what used to happen;

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.160
it can’t really be what is happening around us in the here and now.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.960
Things have – in our vicinity at least – settled down.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.300
To make us braver about the idea of changing things today,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.420
we might turn to some striking lines in T. S. Eliot’s cycle of poems, the Four Quartets:

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.700
 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.900
Winter afternoons, around 4pm, have a habit of feeling particularly resolved and established,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.440
especially in quiet English country chapels, many of which date back to the middle ages.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.380
The air in such chapels is still and musty.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.460
The heavy stone floors have been slowly worn away by the feet of the faithful.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.160
These are not places and times to think about changing the world,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.200
everything hints that we would be wiser to accept the way things are,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.360
walk back home across the fields, light a fire and settle down for quiet evening.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.100
Hence the surprise of Eliot’s third line, his resonant:

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.360
‘History is now and England.’

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.380
In other words, everything that we associate with history –

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
the impetuous daring of great people, the dramatic alterations in values,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.500
the revolutionary questioning of long-held beliefs, the upturning of the old order –

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.220
all this is still going on,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.920
even at this very moment, in outwardly peaceful, apparently unchanging places

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.460
like the countryside near Shamley Green, in Surrey, where Eliot wrote his poem.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.360
We don’t see it only because we are standing far too close.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.700
The world is being made and remade at every instant.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.640
And therefore any one of us has a theoretical chance of being an agent in history,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.500
on a big or small scale.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.500
It is open to our own times to build a new city every bit as beautiful as Venice,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.340
to change ideas as radically as the Renaissance,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.640
to start an intellectual movement as resounding as Buddhism.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.240
The present has all the contingency of the past – and is every bit as malleable.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.000
It shouldn't intimidate us.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.700
How we love, travel, approach the arts, govern, educate ourselves, run businesses, age and die

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.040
are all up for further development.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.080
Current views may appear firm, but only because we exaggerate their fixity.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.680
The majority of what exists is arbitrary, neither inevitable nor right, simply the result of muddle and happenstance.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.700
We should be confident, even at sunset on winter afternoons, of our power to join the stream of history

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.800
– and, however modestly, change its course.
