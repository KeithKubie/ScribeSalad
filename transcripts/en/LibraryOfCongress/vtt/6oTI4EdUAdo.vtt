00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.810
From the Library of Congress in
Washington DC

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.660 position:97%
We've done two so far one on the Mapa Quetzalecatzin and one on the Oztoticpac


00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.910
Lands Map and today we are going to
do the Huexotzinco Codex which as

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.330 position:58%
Naomi said in the intro is one of the
top treasures here at the Library.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.870 position:59%
Today we're going to take a little bit
different tact on this the other two

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.160 position:98%
codices that we looked at the Quetzalecatzin and the Oztoticpac Lands Map are


00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.080 position:98%
all one single sheet whereas the Huexotzinco Codex is eight sheets of amate


00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.710 position:61%
which is a mulberry fig bark paper a
typical indigenous paper from the Nahua

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.100
and it also has 79 pages of text
associated with it which basically

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.470 position:61%
narrate a lawsuit and so we're going to
be looking both at the text and at the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.910 position:59%
actual codex themselves eight pages of
the Codex that are on amate are also

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.450 position:58%
written in Nahuatl hieroglyphic
writing and we'll take a sort of deep

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530 position:66%
dive into that the Nahuatl hieroglyphs and
the sort of symbolism we see on those

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.360 position:63%
pages but we have to first start out
kind of talking a little bit about about

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.150 position:59%
the court case itself and we'll kind
of go into some details and it's going

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.240 position:63%
to be like I said a little bit different
in format because I'm actually going to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.950 position:63%
read a little bit of the translations of
the some of the testimony and some of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.620 position:59%
the material from the the actual book
that the the eight pages were found in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.190 position:63%
just so we get a kind of flavor of what
what these types of Spanish lawsuits and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.140 position:58%
what these sort of Spanish law was as
they affected both the indigenous

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.040 position:59%
peoples and and the early settlers the
Huexotcinzo Codex dates from 1531 1532

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.910 position:64%
so it's a very very early post-colonial
codex. First though we're going to look a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.210 position:61%
little bit about what the paper is that
the these eight pages are on the other

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.460 position:98%
two codices the Oztoticpac Lands Map is on amate, also the Quetzalecatzin


00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.910 position:58%
is on European paper and we
haven't really talked very much about

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.420 position:59%
the paper at all and I thought I would
just take a couple minutes to talk a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.490 position:63%
little bit about about what the paper is
and and and how it's made and kind of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.190 position:61%
what it looks like. There are really a
couple of different kinds one made from

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.180 position:59%
the ficus genus and there's several
different ficus species that are found

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.720 position:59%
in Mexico and Central America and
this is a basically a fig tree. You'll

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.580 position:63%
see here I've got just a botanical
specimen from the national herbarium and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.690 position:63%
then a picture of the actually the ficus
padifolia on the right and just really

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.560 position:58%
what the kind of the paper looks like
when it's made on the left that's a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.600 position:59%
sample of a modern sample of the paper
made from the inner bark of the the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.820 position:63%
ficus tree and you can see it's very
dark very much like the Oztoticpac Lands

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.270 position:56%
Map was that we looked at last time.
Today's codex, however, is on a much

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.980 position:63%
lighter paper and this really probably
comes from the Morris genus which is the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.920 position:56%
mulberry and it gives a much lighter
paper again it's made from the inner

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.040 position:61%
bark of the tree and it's still made in
Mexico today. The inner bark is pulled

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.130 position:61%
off and then and then soaked it becomes
very very soft several things are added

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.070 position:58%
to the the bath in order to soften it
and then it's basically smeared and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.650 position:63%
beaten and you can see here is an
indigenous paper maker making a sheet of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.600 position:61%
paper very much like we are going to be
looking at today when we're looking at

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.300 position:61%
the Huexotzinco Codex. The Huexotzinco
Codex is on a paper that's almost white

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.220
and it's fairly thin but but a very
durable paper and this is a typical

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.480 position:63%
paper making operation down in Mexico
today and here are some of the pieces of

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.250 position:61%
paper and some of the various patterns
put in the paper that are out drying in

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.700 position:58%
the sun after there they're put down
there they're laid out in the Sun and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.030 position:61%
then once they dry you can you can then
pick them up and there is

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.890 position:88%
roughest paper and so the codices that we're going to be


00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.330 position:63%
looking at today are really this kind of
this kind of paper and so without

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.940 position:63%
further ado we'll start talking a little
bit about the Codex so this is the first

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.580 position:59%
page that the Codex actually what we
have here is we have a lawsuit and the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.210 position:61%
lawsuit is actually brought by Hernando
Cortes the the conqueror of Mexico one

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.610 position:61%
of the first conquistadors to to arrive
there and a man named Marquis De Valle

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.760 position:63%
and they're bringing up a suit against
several people a man named Nuno Guzman a

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.280 position:67%
man named Juan Ortiz del Maritzio and a man
named Diego Delgadillo and basically

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.500 position:63%
what is important about the codex's and
and what happens in this codex is you've

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.580 position:61%
got 79 pages of Spanish text and in the
79 pages in Spanish text you have an or

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.500 position:58%
narration of this court case and
basically you have some of the native

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.900 position:61%
testimony, the indigenous testimony the
Nahua testimony in many cases refers

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.290 position:63%
to the actual Nahuatl hieroglyphic texts
that we see here almost all of which

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.050 position:56%
have to do with tribute and and and
price is paid for various species of

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.270 position:59%
tribute slaves traded and things like
that and we'll get into that in just a

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.340 position:63%
bit. The codex itself has an interesting


00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:16.260 position:72%
history. It was housed in the [inaudible] town
of the Immaculate Conception and Jesus

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.100 position:61%
of Nazareth's in Mexico City for a very
long time and at some point it passed

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.800 position:66%
directly to Cortes's descendants and those
are the Italian Dukes of Monteleone

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.770 position:63%
and those Italian Dukes held the Codex
for a very long time along with a lot of

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.790 position:63%
other Cortes materials and it remains in
this private archive until 1925 and it

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.150 position:63%
was purchased by a man named Harkness in


00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.780 position:64%
through a really well-known dealer named
ASW Rosenbach. Rosenbach was an extremely

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.540 position:61%
important rare book dealer and
manuscript dealer during the 1920s. The

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.290 position:59%
Rosenwald collection--those of you who
are familiar with a large rare book

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.460 position:63%
collection here at the Library--a lot of
those materials were also purchased

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:14.640 position:63%
through Rosenbach. So the subject of
the of the lawsuit is really the sort of

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.700 position:61%
misappropriation of funds and the way a
law case would work in a in a Spanish

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.860 position:59%
court of this period is much different
than a law case would work in a law

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.300 position:61%
court today really what would happen is
charges would be brought by some

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.940 position:61%
plaintiff and the plaintiff would would
make up a questionnaire and really this

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.590 position:61%
is actually a questionnaire which has a
series of questions which he would then

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.010 position:58%
they would devise and then they would
give to their witnesses and their

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:51.310 position:63%
witnesses would answer the questionnaire
for a scribe and the scribe would write

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:58.540 position:61%
down the the the answers and so what we
have in this codex is actually Cortes's

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.900 position:80%
side of this story. We have the information and the


00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:12.190 position:61%
questions that Cortes and his side is
putting to the Guzman side and so after

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.890
those questionnaires were done they
would be sent to the defendants the

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.290 position:59%
answers be sent to the defendants the
defendants would be given a particular

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.510 position:63%
span of time and they would produce
their own questionnaire which they would

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.340 position:63%
then send to their witnesses. There'd be
another exchange of these back and forth

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.660 position:64%
between the defendants and the
plaintiffs and those would go to a judge.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.200 position:61%
If the judge thought that the testimony
was complete enough he would render a

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.000 position:63%
decision and if the the court case was
big enough, if there was enough money at

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.920 position:64%
stake, it may have to go back to Spain as
opposed to being decided in Mexico City

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.980 position:63%
but most of these local cases in the new
world were were decided in Mexico City.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.910 position:58%
But in this case we only have the one


00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:08.500 position:64%
side, we only have Cortes's documents in
the Codex here. Now what the codex begins

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.260 position:61%
with it begins with a group of charges
and I'm just going to read a little bit

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.770 position:59%
because I think it's important to kind
of get an idea of what the language is

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.000 position:61%
and how the language sounds and
obviously this is a translation but but

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.490 position:61%
I think it's an interesting way to kind
of take a look at about the way these

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.740 position:58%
things were put forward and it begins
basically saying that this is a court

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:41.050 position:58%
case against Nuno Guzman and several
other people who are in charge of the

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:48.550 position:63%
area around Huexotzinco and it
begins saying, "I say that while my said

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.990 position:59%
party held and possessed by just and
write titles and grant of your majesty

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.520 position:58%
which justify and have justified the
possession use and utilization of the

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.080
Indians of the town of Huexotzinco
which is in the province," and then

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.070 position:64%
there's a lacuna in the manuscript,
"taking the fruits in the profits of said

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:12.040 position:63%
town the said Nuno de Guzman did in
fact and against alright and without any

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.510 position:61%
cause or reason take from my said party
the said town and the utilization

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:22.480 position:63%
thereof." So basically this has been
appropriated this town and the fruits of

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.970 position:56%
the labors and the the the important
cash crops have been appropriated by

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.430 position:61%
Nuno Guzman and it says continues, "and
they took in appropriated the said town

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.320 position:58%
for themselves taking the fruits and
incomes of it as they have taken them

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.770 position:59%
from the year 29 past to the present
making use of the said town in all the

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.940 position:61%
enterprises they could as well as
services and other necessary things and

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.740 position:59%
what is worse is that at the time when
they took the said town from my said

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.850 position:61%
party they published and said that they
were placing it under tribute to your

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:04.330 position:61%
majesty." And basically the
manuscript here literally says "placing

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.580 position:63%
it in the head of your majesty" in order
to that they might make use of the

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.120 position:63%
incomes and profits of the said town and
in truth your

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.810 position:58%
Majesty has enjoyed the name and they
have taken for themselves and enjoyed

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.250 position:63%
the profit and I think that's an
interesting little little thing there so

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.840 position:61%
basically we have a group of people who
are now been accused of taking account

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.440 position:63%
over which was basically given to the
indigenous people for tribute. They have

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.610 position:61%
said that they were taking it,
placing the tribute under the crown and

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.180 position:61%
giving it to the crown but in fact they
were keeping it to themselves and only

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.120 position:63%
using the name of the crown to name name
only some things never change obviously.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.020 position:61%
And then it says "and since the laws of
your realm that is prohibited that

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.130 position:63%
judges should make such users and carry
on such dealings and enterprises because

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.750 position:58%
they must keep their hands clean in
everything the said Nuno de Guzman in

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.550 position:59%
doing what they did committed violence
crime spoilation and notorious fraud

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:09.490 position:61%
which in law is considered as a capital
case." And so that is really the

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:15.610 position:61%
execution of the charges that begin the
codex and begin the Huexotzinco

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.880 position:56%
Codex and so as I said according to
Spanish law the next part of the the

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.330 position:63%
case here would be for the plaintiffs to
draw up some sort of questionnaire which

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.030 position:63%
they did and in the case of the way of
single codex it's a multi-point question

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.060
here it actually has fourteen
independent questions and we're not

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.940 position:63%
going to go into all of the questions
but there's one that's kind of important

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.350 position:56%
for what we're going to see as we
actually go through the pages of the

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:53.650
codex themselves and it's actually
number four and what the number

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:59.380 position:66%
four says it basically begins, "also
whether they know and have seen," and this

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.150 position:64%
is put in the form of a question so this
is being asked to the witnesses, "whether

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.730 position:63%
they know and have seen that as soon as
and then it names for defendants arrived

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.780 position:63%
in the city they summon the Lords from
the leading men of the town and ask that

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.280 position:58%
they give and bring a certain quality
more than six thousand pesos of gold

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.380 position:59%
ingots and jewels and also stones and
feathers and clothing and slaves in an

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.630 position:61%
amount worth more than another thousand
gold pesos

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.880 position:67%
and let the witnesses say what
gold, stones, feathers, clothing slaves and

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.320 position:63%
other things they gave to the said
president immediately upon their arrival

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.180 position:59%
and on the road before they arrived in
the city." And so this is basically a

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:47.660 position:63%
question asking witnesses that what kind
of tributes what sort of things were

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.300 position:58%
given to Nuno de Guzman and the other
people by the leading men of the city

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.700 position:56%
and whether these were these demands
made of gold and and other kinds of

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.050 position:63%
tribute and what we're going to see
actually is when we begin looking at the

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:08.060 position:63%
Codex pages here we're just going to be
seeing lists of tributes and lists of of

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:15.740 position:63%
these kinds of items and we're going to
see that basically a lot of what we have

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:22.490 position:61%
in the Codex itself is native testimony
is indigenous testimony and we're going

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.710 position:63%
to look at one in particular because
right after that we'll get actually into

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.960 position:58%
the Codex pages and one of the things
that the Huexotzinco Codex is famous

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.840 position:63%
for is a small portrait of the Virgin
Mary considered to be the first portrait

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:45.490 position:63%
of the Virgin Mary in the new world that
was actually rendered by an indigenous

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.600 position:63%
person. What's interesting about that is
people believe that from how it was

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:58.160 position:61%
rendered for a reason of being pious or
something like that or making the codex

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.810 position:61%
somehow seem religious but in fact it's
a little bit different than that and

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.010 position:61%
we'll see that in just a minute.
So I'm going to just read a couple more

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.390 position:58%
little things and then we'll get into
the Codex themselves and I'm going to

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:19.330 position:56%
read the testimony an answer to that
number four by an indigenous person

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:26.720 position:61%
and that particular testimony begins it
says, "after the aforesaid

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.390 position:56%
in the said City of Mexico on
Monday the third day of the month of

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:39.850 position:56%
April in the year 1531 through an
interpreter Juan de [inaudible] this

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.800 position:63%
citizen of the city a statement and
disposition was received from Esteban an

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.890
indigenous who was previously named
Toshell

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:52.450 position:64%
which in the Christian language means
rabbit. From the said witness through the

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.370 position:58%
said interpreter an oath was received
in do legal form under the obligation

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.660 position:61%
which he promised to tell the truth and
what he said and deposed is the

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.440 position:59%
following," and so that's the way his
testimony begins and I'm going to read

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.090 position:63%
his answer to the fourth question and
then we're going to begin looking at the

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:18.820 position:59%
Codex itself and so he says to the
fourth question he said that when Nino

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.470 position:63%
Nuno de Guzman arrived in the city
the Indians of the said town Huexotzinco

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.540 position:61%
and its province did not come to it nor
did they go out to receive them except

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.740 position:61%
that the Lord and leading men of the
head Indians and this witness with them

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.480 position:61%
came to the city to see and know them
and they did not bring them any gold or

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.300
cloth or anything else except they
brought food,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.160 position:59%
hens, quail--possibly as many as forty
hens and twenty quail--and a little

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.370 position:61%
basket of eggs. And about a year after
Nuno de Guzman had come to the city the

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.290 position:64%
overseer of the said town who is named de
Bahia who has reportedly gone to

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.270 position:63%
Guatemala told them that they should
give something to Nuno de Guzman when he

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:06.370 position:61%
wanted to go to the war. And they asked
what they should give and he told them

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:10.990 position:63%
whatever they wished and they determined
to make cloth with a sheet of gold and

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.580 position:58%
the whole sheet of gold would be an
image of Saint Mary this they gave to

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.740 position:61%
the said Nuno de Guzman, they and said
overseer, and they brought it to him in

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:26.140 position:63%
this city and for the workmanship and
expense of what the said image cost they

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.600 position:64%
sold twenty slaves--eight men and
twelve women. And they also but for three

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.940 position:63%
ingots of gold which went into the said
image on the top of a cloth on which the

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.200 position:97%
image was placed there were nine plumages, each plumage consisting of twenty


00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.910 position:58%
feathers and these cost nine loads of
little awnings with twenty awnings in

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.590
each load and this witness saw that
Union to Guzman said to the Lord of

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.550 position:81%
Huexotzinco that she he should give him men to go to


00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.500 position:67%
war with. Six hundred men outfitted for war
after the manner in which they were

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:04.140 position:61%
accustomed to and they gave them and
with them also certain clothing in gear

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.100 position:66%
which they have painted on certain
papers." Now we're beginning to talk about

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.620 position:64%
the manuscript itself. "And he asked that
the said papers be shown to him and he

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.810 position:63%
was shown one paper of certain paintings
which is signed with the sign of me the

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:26.160 position:66%
undersigned notary and secretary. And when
he had looked at the pictures the said

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.020 position:61%
interpreter said that in gear for the
said warriors they had spent thirty two

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.380
thousand and four hundred pieces of
cloth and small awnings

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.790 position:58%
and then he corrected himself to say
that there were twenty seven thousand

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:45.510 position:64%
and six hundred little awnings." And this
goes on basically talking about a whole

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:51.660 position:61%
list of things that were given and cost
that were cost that were brought all to

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:58.770 position:61%
go to war and all to make this image it
actually ends, "all this has been state

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:04.020 position:63%
all this has been stated is painted on
the said paper on which the depicted the

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.420 position:63%
said image of Our Lady and which is
signed with my sign." And so really what

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.760 position:61%
we have here is we have this court case
where we have a whole slew of pages

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.090 position:63%
which are going to talk about what we're
actually given to Guzman or

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:29.850 position:63%
appropriated by him in order to go to
war or spent by the indigenous rulers of

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:35.670 position:61%
Huexotzinco in order to make this gold
image of the Virgin Mary. And so really

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:41.150 position:59%
that's what this codex is. So let's
let's get to the codex itself here and

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:47.910 position:59%
we'll the codex the eight pages are
actually numbered and they're actually

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:54.840 position:59%
numbered by the scribe who is actually
writing a little bit in in this book

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:02.250 position:56%
name is Alonzo Valverde and he talks
about the testimony and he actually

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:09.480
signs the the images themselves and
so what we have here is we have the

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.440 position:59%
beginnings of this testimony and we're
just going to go over some of the

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.820 position:63%
symbolism here just because I think it's
kind of fascinating the way that these

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:24.420 position:63%
things are put and you will begin to get
a sense of the huge number, the vast

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.530 position:56%
array of tribute that was spent and
collected by this group of people in

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:37.320 position:59%
order to make this image and and for
this going to war and so we'll look at

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.430 position:56%
the manuscript here and we'll
begin and hopefully this won't drive

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.840 position:58%
people too crazy I'm going to use the
little pointer to actually point out

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.340 position:63%
some of the things on the manuscript
when we when we look at this one here we

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.600 position:58%
see these two rings and these are
actually loads of lime and so we have

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:01.080 position:63%
here two loads of lime that have
been put on on this sheet. B here is two

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.960 position:63%
piles of adobe bricks for construction
this is people have called the chocolate

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.930 position:63%
chip the chocolate chip tribute but this
is actually what we have here is we have

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:20.280 position:63%
six and those little flags are twenty so
six times 20 loads or beams. Some things

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.790 position:63%
we don't know exactly what they are over
the side this is kind of an unknown

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:33.260 position:58%
group of things. This here is another
way of of doing 400 you've got seven

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:38.850 position:61%
these things in this is actually
four hundred and so we have seven times

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:45.110 position:59%
four hundred loads of cloths, so two
thousand eight hundred loads of cloth.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:51.720 position:63%
And then of course we know this is again
lime we have some stones here this part

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:58.710 position:61%
here is again we've got the same number
so four hundred is this bundle and

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.950 position:59%
this maize up here, so we've got two
thousand eight hundred loads of maize.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:09.540 position:61%
Down here with the little heads what
kind of bird does it remind you of well

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:17.490 position:59%
of course it's a turkey and so we have
lots of lots of turkeys and so one

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.430 position:72%
hundred and forty turkeys, seven times twenty.


00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:25.560 position:58%
This number down here in these little
boxes is a huge number and this is

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.380 position:63%
actually eight thousand so we have two
times eight thousand or sixteen thousand

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.410 position:64%
chili peppers that are also listed on
here. And really the codex continues this

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:44.780
way, again
more amounts of turkeys and maize.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:51.840 position:63%
We've got the chili peppers and so
this continues very much in this way and

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.360 position:63%
this is talked about in the Spanish text
exactly where this is coming from and

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.660 position:64%
what it's being used for. One of the most
striking pages in the entire codex is

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.210 position:61%
this and what we have here is of course
you can see that the numbers in the

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:14.430 position:59%
middle, those flags which you now know
are 20 and these are 20 cloths with

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:19.740 position:58%
designs and there's basically several
different patterns there's a flower

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.660 position:56%
design there's a rabbit design and
there's the design that looks like a

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.030 position:61%
reed so we've got three different
different kinds of designs here and the

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:40.020 position:61%
entire cost is we've got 37 times 20
which equals these cloths down here and

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:48.570 position:59%
all total we've got about four hundred
and sixty flower patterns, 160 rabbit

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:55.280 position:63%
patterns, and 120 reeds if one adds this
all up and so these are cloths that

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:05.820 position:63%
are given in tribute that are
talked about the third page...the fourth

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:12.750
page I should say is this and this
is the most abstract of the

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:19.530 position:63%
pieces and really what these are is
five cloths of rove woven red rabbit fur

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:28.740 position:63%
and the total is 400 mantles. Four
times 20 equals 80 and then when you add

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.140
them all up you actually have 400
mantles

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:40.450 position:59%
of woven red rabbit fur. Now we get to
the Virgin Mary page, the page which

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:46.180 position:58%
the codex is probably most famous for
and that Esteban talks about in his

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:53.320 position:63%
testimony and this is basically
listing what it cost in order to put the

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.640 position:63%
the actual solid gold image of the
Virgin which is portrayed here together.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.220 position:56%
And up here we have this symbol here
this is four hundred pots of liquid

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:13.780 position:61%
amber and so that's quite a thing, then
we've got this here is mantles of food,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:22.210 position:64%
four hundred mantles of food that one
purchases in route. See here, you can see

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.330 position:59%
the feet this group right here there's
four and we now know of course this is

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:34.810 position:58%
400 so for sixteen hundred pairs of
sandals are here and we can go on and

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.340 position:63%
talking about this and then for instance
for this which is a banner for Don Tomei

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.360 position:59%
to carry, it costs ten loads ten loads
with mantles there then we have three

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:54.130 position:61%
gold plaques right here that are listed
used in the in the standard of the

00:25:54.130 --> 00:26:01.120 position:63%
Madonna in other words used to make the
Madonna itself. Here we've got plumages,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:09.370 position:59%
so twenty large green feathers and
we talked about the cost of that. This

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:17.710 position:61%
here of course is the famous Madonna in
the middle for Nino Guzman and it is 16

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.660
by 16 inches of gold leaf and it's
supposed to be one of the earliest

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:29.700 position:61%
productions related to Catholicism in
the New World by the indigenous peoples

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:37.450 position:61%
and then here we've got 21 gold plaques
the thickness of three fingernails to

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:43.060
purchase a horse for Don Tomei the
principal and brother of Lord of

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.630 position:77%
Huexotzinco. Here we have metal tip darts and the


00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:55.590 position:63%
group of metal tip darts here and then
loincloth along the bottom here and then

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:05.790 position:64%
we have slaves, groups of slaves in order
to...who are sold to buy the Madonna and

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.780 position:64%
this is an interesting little thing here,
we've got this group of slaves along the

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:15.360 position:63%
bottom here and these slaves at least
according to the testimony were actually

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:24.450 position:63%
sold to indigenous merchants to buy the
gold in order to make the Madonna and so

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:30.320
it's quite an interesting quite an
interesting page this figure which

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:37.920 position:63%
people talk about so much. The next page
here these are two Aztec war leaders

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.940 position:64%
with different shield designs. There's 11
houses basically who contributed to the

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:50.220 position:58%
work so basically 11 different family
lineages who contributed warriors to

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.600 position:58%
this supposed war effort that we were
talking about in the in the testimony

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:02.010 position:59%
itself and then we we have the numbers
of warriors along here this basically

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.180 position:63%
gives us four numbers of warriors and
then we have woven bags and then we have

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:13.760 position:61%
blankets so again more about the same
same stuff, same source type of issues.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:20.190 position:61%
Again here we have another page this
time talking more about grain this is a

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:28.080 position:63%
granary up here that we see so it's a an
indigenous granary holding maize which

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:35.820 position:63%
was paid in 1529 and 1530 so just before
the the actual codex is made so the

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.740 position:59%
events the codex is actually narrating
are between 1529 which is the date

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.290 position:61%
that's given in the what I read the
initial charges that begins in 1529 and

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:54.120 position:61%
we are in 1531 so this exploitation and
this taking out of money and

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.080 position:58%
tribute in order to go to war by this
group of people

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:05.950 position:63%
against Cortes or or stealing from
Cortes basically happens over a two-year

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:12.700 position:56%
period. And so it gets more and more
complicated as the text goes

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:18.430 position:63%
on there are about twenty to twenty-five
different testimonies from the

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:24.280 position:58%
indigenous peoples within the thing
itself within the actual Codex itself

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:32.980 position:58%
and that really does give us a real
sense of how these cases are narrated

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.870 position:58%
and and really how important this was
when we start looking at some of the

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:43.030 position:58%
numbers and adding up some of the
numbers, for instance when we look at

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.960 position:59%
this number right here when we look at
this right here we basically have a

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.380 position:61%
total of about eight thousand turkeys
here so it's a substantial, substantial

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.530 position:61%
amount when we go down to this row down
here and we see the corn here we're

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:05.170 position:63%
talking 32,000 ears of corn and here
we're talking about 48,000 chili peppers

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:13.660 position:67%
so a lot of a lot of money that has been
exploited or misappropriated in Huexotzinco

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:20.370
by Nuno Guzman and the
others who are named in the case.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:25.480 position:63%
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you how the
case turned out and as I said we only

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.390 position:64%
know really the one side of it. There are
some documents which give us hints to

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.950 position:58%
the to the other side but they don't
give us much in the way of conclusive

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.810 position:63%
evidence. It seems as if that this
particular codex survived mostly because

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:48.990 position:58%
it went into the hands of Cortes's
descendants, the Dukes of Monteleone,

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:55.570 position:56%
and that really is how it survived
and so I would be more than happy to

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:02.290
take any questions.
