00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.939
Comment sections online should be the beautiful
public squares of our democracies: places

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.330
we navigate to for frank and thoughtful exchanges
of ideas; places where we learn to understand

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.400
each other’s point of view and where serious
discussions evolve over time. But, of course,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.010
they are havens of the grossest abuse, verbal
violence and cruelty. It’s understandable

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.320
if we sometimes conclude, after time reading
comments, that humanity has lost its way.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.710
But there’s another explanation: The source
of dismissive and rude remarks and frustrating

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.280
discussions isn’t bad people: it’s that
commenting isn’t something we’re naturally

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.370
or automatically very good at. It is, however,
a learnable skill. In fact, everyone online

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.670
is almost always trying to do something important,
but just going about it in a hugely unfortunate

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.100
way. So for example: We want to communicate
an urgent, and sometimes well-founded belief

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.560
that another person is mistaken So what we
too quickly say is: You are a fucking idiot

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.270
who can jerk off with my shit. But what we
could learn to say, given that no one ever

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.540
learns anything under conditions of humiliation,
is a more effective: I wonder if you might

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.010
have missed something that feels important
from where I am positioned… We want to stand

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
up for clarity and common sense by admitting
that we didn’t understand something another

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.070
person said And so we say: Wtf motherfucker
But it could be a revolutionary move, with

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.180
huge influence on the way other people start
to think one could and should behave online,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.030
to say: I found it at points a little hard
to follow your train of thought, yet deeply

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.250
respect your underlying intentions… We want
to convey immense disappointment So we say:

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.890
I used to like what you do; but now I think
you’re a phoney and a total fraud. Unsubbed,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.950
wanker. But we could say: I’m puzzled because
I generally very much admire you and I don’t

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.590
entirely see the point of what you seem to
be doing. It would be lovely if you could

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.780
perhaps explain things from your no doubt
very legitimate perspective. Sometimes we

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780
simply want to exorcise the humiliation that
a cold and indifferent world has doled out

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.760
to us So, at our keyboard in the middle of
the night, with the odd freight train whistling

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.140
in the darkness outside, we say: Suck it up
bitches; bunch of fucking wankers spewing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.170
bullshit from your own anuses… When what
we could learn to say, from our isolated bedrooms,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.540
is: I sometimes feel so sad and alone… Let’s
remember that no one is ever brutal or cruel

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.500
online by their ultimate free choice. They
are so because they are hurt, damaged, alone

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.890
and afraid – and because no one has been
kind or good to them for a long time. Behind

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.560
every online outburst, there’s always a
complex, painful backstory (which we will

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.880
mostly never know but which we can be sure
is there) which has made it impossible for

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.950
the commenter to feel they can be realistic,
reasonable or civil. People get rude too,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.040
because – in their very isolation and powerlessness
– it is impossible for them to believe that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.770
others out there could be vulnerable to their
insults. Their rudeness is grounded on a disbelief

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.030
that strangers could take them seriously and
might be tipped over into inner collapse,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.440
despair and self-hatred because of them. Such
is their background feeling of impotence,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.050
the troll has forgotten their own power. After
spending a while in the comments sections,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.600
it can be easy to to form the belief that
humans have grown into monsters. The good

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.319
news is that even though comments claim to
reflect how the world is, they in fact represent

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.730
only the fringe views of a tiny percentage.
They induct us to forget the vast invisible

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.260
army of moderate, reasonable, kind not terribly
opinionated individuals who are just standing

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.890
by in silence, as appalled as we are. The
world is much saner than it appears. The real

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.480
achievement would be to build an online world
every bit as kind, patient and good as most

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.960
of us are in our real lives at every moment
of every day.
