&gt;&gt; CHRIS: We are StudyBlue, Inc. We're based
in Madison, Wisconsin, and we're an academic

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.849
network for both college and high school students.
We provide study tools for students to organize

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.840
their academic life by organizing their college
material and high school material online such

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.440
as notes and flash cards collaborating with
others and sharing that material as well as

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.580
using some of our unique tools to help them
study more efficiently.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.519
&gt;&gt; What tools did you use?
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: We have used extensively the Google

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.829
Web Toolkit. We've been using that since we
started and since it started several years

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.780
ago.
&gt;&gt; And as a developer can you give us a worth

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.289
story and lessons learned?
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Sure. Ernie [PH] are going to touch

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.030
on some development issues. It's been a unique
battle of integrating programming and design

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.700
together with GWT.
&gt;&gt; ERNIE [PH]: Yeah. We've been at some challenges

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.409
in that. Chris is doing most of the development
and I'm doing most of front end and some of

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.390
those challenges just involve--while he's
working in GWT and I'm working on some of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.549
the text that are on the CSS and how we're
working with hosted mode but we're excited

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.060
to see at the conference here today that GWT
is kind of implementing some new things of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.490
hosted mode to really help us out there and
allow us to work more efficiently and allow

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.270
me to kind of proof and browse some of the
new things they're doing, I’m pretty exciting.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah. We were originally sitting
right next to each other and to share computer

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.970
screens, but it's moving to that kind of thing
that we can interact into much more efficient

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.430
ways with the use in some of the new features.
&gt;&gt; So, speaking of new features what are the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.549
top three features?
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Well, some of the features we're

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.100
looking at that we're excited about certainly
out of process hosted mode, the ability to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.549
debug and test using any browser anywhere.
Some other features that you were excited

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.630
about?
&gt;&gt; SEAN: Well, one thing we really love in

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.240
studying Google is that GD [PH], the incorporate
inauguration of GD [PH] with hosted mode,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.949
you know, it will make it easier for us to
restart the server code without even, you

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.690
know, have into like shutdown and redeploy
the code.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.390
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah. And out of process hosted
mode will allow debug everything in the browsers

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.020
that we're most comfortable with, you know,
including Firefox, and certainly the new event

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.299
handling structure or something we're pretty
excited about being able to fire an event

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.320
from anywhere and handle that event and only
add events to widgets that are necessary.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.880
So, we're excited about that.
&gt;&gt; You're upgrading from 1.5 to 1.6. Can you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.510
tell us a little bit about that?
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: It's actually a funniest story.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.820
We did that on the way to the conference,
Sean was in-charge there.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.880
&gt;&gt; SEAN: Yeah. So, pretty much all I did is
I go into the apps tone using my iPhone, downloaded

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.280
the SSH client and was able to connect to
our server upgrades the GWT library and we

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.620
deploy it and it was ready in less than two
minutes and we were on the plane waiting to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.060
take off.
&gt;&gt; So, you've mentioned you have about things

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.339
you like to see at Google products. Can you
tell us different things about that?

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.010
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah. Some improvements, you know,
search engine optimization is certainly a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.340
big one, Ernie [PH] could talk to that a little
while.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.980
&gt;&gt; ERNIE [PH]: Yeah. It's a big one for us
for trying to open up more of our content

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.640
to be more indexed, more publicly accessible
but [INDISTINCT] a lot of content. Yeah, we

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.460
definitely [INDISTINCT] in the search engine
optimization. We need to get off our content

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.040
index and it's definitely one of the challenges
that they acknowledged with the software right

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.630
now, but we're encourage to hear what they're
talking about at the conference here, and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.750
how they tackling in the near future. So that
will be indexed and we'll get off our content

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.430
out there.
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: And, you know, C [PH] as our entire

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.560
application is belt with GWT, we really don’t
have any HTML pages. It's all in one page,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.570
all JavaScript, you know, tons of thousands
aligns at the JavaScript and having AdSense

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.690
or the search engine bots being able to crawl
and integrate our webapp with those existing

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.120
Google services is something we definitely
looking forward to, so.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.169
&gt;&gt; Okay. We want to thank you for joining
us today. We hope you have a great Google

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.169
I/O.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:19.173
&gt;&gt; Thanks. We appreciate it.
