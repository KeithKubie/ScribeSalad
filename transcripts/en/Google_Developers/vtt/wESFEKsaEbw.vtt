00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.790
BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.890
interesting developer community.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.980
has asked this question.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.080
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.475
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:12.940
answer show.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.252
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:22.990
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.540
We are on?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.700
We are on.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Is
it on me again?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.500
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.640
All right, we got a thumb's up.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.897
We are on.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.120
We apologize for being late.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.930
We are in our brand-new newly
configured studio.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.790
So let's just do quick
introductions.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.710
To my right, your left,
probably, we have the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.130
irrepressible Colt McAnis.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.540
COLT MCANIS: Irrepressible.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.650
TODD KERPELMAN: Irrepressible.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.130
COLT MCANIS: That's
what they used to

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.550
call me in high school.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.210
TODD KERPELMAN: To my immediate
left, we have the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.240
irresponsible Wolff Dobson.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.790
WOLFF DOBSON: That's me.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.470
TODD KERPELMAN: And then over
more, we've got the iridescent

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.720
John McCutchan.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.105
COLT MCANIS: I like that.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:01.775
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, thanks.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:02.160
COLT MCANIS: I like that.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Now we've
started a trend.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.550
We've got to do this
next week.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.510
TODD KERPELMAN: So we are
going to jump right into

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760
things because I know
we're a little late.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.570
We've got a lot on our agenda.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.180
COLT MCANIS: We do.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.900
TODD KERPELMAN: I want to follow
up with basically three

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530
answers to questions or comments
that were on our

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.860
YouTube stream from last time.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.780
Let's see, the first was someone
said, "Hey, you guys

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.870
should do this as a regular
thing." And that is our plan.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.270
Our plan is every second
Thursday, unless we're sick or

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.410
something, we're going
to be here.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.600
So put it on your calendar,
and we'll start scheduling

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.310
these out more.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340
And this can sort
of be a thing.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.120
COLT MCANIS: And also,
tell you friends.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Until
we get canceled.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.210
Yeah, and tell your friends.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.450
COLT MCANIS: Can we
get canceled?

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.210
TODD KERPELMAN: Probably.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.890
COLT MCANIS: I mean, we don't
have any corporate sponsorship

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.330
or anything.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We're getting
a nod, "yes."

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.030
WOLFF DOBSON: There's no
corporation involved in this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.660
at all, is there?

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.480
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We're
getting a big,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.320
"yes." We can be canceled.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.436
WOLFF DOBSON: We can, in
fact, be canceled.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:50.932
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
already happened.

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:51.260
TODD KERPELMAN: We can
get canceled in the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.430
middle of this program.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.460
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like,
I'm just going to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.375
take my mike off.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:53.750
It's over now.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Right now.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.290
Let's see, the second question
was about my laptop cover.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.000
And so for those of you who
were wondering, it is from

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.170
Okami, which was a fantastic
game that came out.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.520
It was by Capcom.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.500
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
it was Capcom, yeah.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.020
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess, was
it Clover Studio was the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.190
developer, Capcom publisher?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That
sounds about right.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.280
It was a PS2 game?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.340
TODD KERPELMAN: It came
out for the PS2.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.610
It was a beautiful game.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.130
The game play was really
interesting, really

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.590
innovative, and it
was darn fun.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.000
And they're actually
re-releasing it this year for

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.045
the PlayStation 3.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:25.910
COLT MCANIS: Oh, cool.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.510
TODD KERPELMAN: So if you have
never had a chance to play

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.270
Okami, and I consider
that a travesty--

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They also
released it for the Wii.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.510
TODD KERPELMAN: They did.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: A couple
years ago, yeah.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.810
WOLFF DOBSON: And it is
Zelda-esque in its play, but

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.150
with just a fantastic
art style.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.270
TODD KERPELMAN: The
art is fantastic.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.590
The drawing on the screen with
your magical pen is fantastic.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.830
It sounds hokey, but it's
really well done.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
it's awesome.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.860
WOLFF DOBSON: Todd's a
romantic at heart.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think it made
a lot of Best Game of the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.750
Year lists.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.040
TODD KERPELMAN: I
think it did.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's a
really great game.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.870
TODD KERPELMAN: It was a great
game but just wasn't as

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.280
commercially successful as
it should have been.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.110
And I consider that, still,
an injustice.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.950
And I'm on a--

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.870
I don't know--

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.350
single-handed crusade
to fix it.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.890
So go buy Okami.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.600
WOLFF DOBSON: For the
PlayStation 3,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.540
which is not out yet.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.180
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.400
Well, PlayStation 3's out.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.930
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
that's true.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.875
PlayStation 3 is out.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:22.210
TODD KERPELMAN: I
don't have one.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.560
That was not a hint, Sony.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.460
I can't accept gifts.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.010
WOLFF DOBSON: He's
not hardcore.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.460
COLT MCANIS: Maybe you might
not want to mention that

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.640
during the Games Chat.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.350
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.507
COLT MCANIS: That kind of
eliminates a little bit of

00:03:29.507 --> 00:03:29.950
your street cred.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.336
WOLFF DOBSON: I don't really
play games, as such.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.730
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I've never
played a game.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.070
TODD KERPELMAN: Our
third issue--

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.790
I kind of got called out on
Google+ for basically dodging

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.910
the like, "hey, how am I going
to be able to have my single

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.540
login everywhere" question.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.250
And so I thought about.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.120
It's like, you know,
he's right.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.230
I skipped the question.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.170
And so I put together a little
demo that is hopefully not

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.180
going to crash, that I'm going
to try and show right now.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.840
So hey, Lewis, can we
switch to my laptop?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.020
Let's see if we can show this.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.130
COLT MCANIS: Aren't we supposed
to call him "Jimmy"?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Jimmy?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.150
COLT MCANIS: Isn't that what
we're supposed to do?

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.400
Jimmy, can I get that
on a live feed?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.420
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, are we on?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.760
Whoo-hoo!

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.040
All right.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.220
So if everything's working,
you should see

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.660
two browsers here.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.990
And so basically, the answer
to, "hey, what do I do if I

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.839
want to login in multiple
places?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.620
How do I know that this is the
same user" is to use Google+,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.360
use the Google+ identity.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.080
It's available right
now on the web.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.160
And it's in developer preview
right now for iOS, and I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.540
believe it's coming
soon for Android.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.690
I just wanted to show you really
quickly how this kind

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.855
of thing might work.

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:40.780
Let's say you're a game
developer and you've got a web

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.470
version of your game, your
iOS version of the game.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.390
Maybe they're not exactly the
same, but you want to reward

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.520
players a reward in one game
for completing tasks in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.480
another or something
like that.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.160
Basically, we would use login.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.460
I'm going to say, yes.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.020
And after I've logged in,
basically we have this giant

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.770
number that is my user ID
and that is unique.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.830
And you can use that basically
as a key in your database to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.080
track any user properties
you want.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.400
So here I'm going to have my
little Saved Game as "Hello

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.260
World" or "Hello Word." All
right, let's Save that.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.860
And now I'm going to go
over to the iPhone

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.780
and let's sign in.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.780
And hopefully, let's
say Allow Access.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.170
Wait for it, and there it is.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.090
So basically, all I'm doing
here is, again, I'm just

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.910
querying the same database using
my Google+ identity as

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.030
the key, the thing that
identifies me.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.200
And I can go back and forth.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.530
I can now say I am Level 1.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.180
And I will save that
to the server.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.500
And then at some point later,
I come back to whatever

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.440
version of the game is on the
web, and I can refresh that,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.820
and I can go back and forth.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.230
COLT MCANIS: So now, a quick
question for you, Todd.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.580
TODD KERPELMAN: Sure.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.720
COLT MCANIS: So what is the
authentication protocol that

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.970
Google+ is using?

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.850
TODD KERPELMAN: OAuth 2.0.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.320
COLT MCANIS: Fantastic.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360
So this means that, effectively,
anyone developing

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.360
with this protocol won't
actually have to write login

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.990
code or anything like
that, right?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.040
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is correct.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.390
COLT MCANIS: Excellent.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.340
TODD KERPELMAN: And yeah, that
is good because it saves you

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.330
from having to deal with all
the security issues of, oh,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.420
I've got to secure the user's
password on my server, and I

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.870
got to do it in a way that
makes sure it doesn't get

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.880
hacked, and blah, blah.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.995
We deal with most
of that for you.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:35.350
COLT MCANIS: Interesting.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.375
Well, which is a good point,
too, is that you guys saw on

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.950
the live feed that token
which identified Todd.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.850
It's worth pointing out, for
security purposes, you

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.260
shouldn't store the user's
password and username around.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.670
Let OAuth take care of that.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.190
But you definitely will need
to make sure that that user

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.150
token is cached somewhere on
your server to connect them

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.040
from whatever instance
they are to whatever

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.610
login they're using.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.250
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.340
In a real situation,
I would probably--

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.730
I think for the purposes of this
demo, which is totally

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.230
insecure and don't actually do
it, I'm just sending down my

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.300
user ID and saying,
hey, this is me.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.570
Really what you want to be
sending down is a token that

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.110
you can then use on the server
side to say let's find out who

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.440
this person really is, and then
use the session ID or

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.100
something to help you
keep track of that.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.860
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly, you
should use your own session

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.110
rather than [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.100
TODD KERPELMAN: After
you've logged in.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.640
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, once you've
logged in, generate

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.230
your own session key,
and then use that to

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.770
identify the player.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.450
And then you'll also be able to
tell the difference between

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.640
the player on the phone and
the player on the browser

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.440
because they'll have different
session keys.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.360
COLT MCANIS: Now, are those
session key-- like is that an

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.200
easy thing to grab through
the + API?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.730
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no, no.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.800
This is-- you should generate
your own session key.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.920
COLT MCANIS: So when
the user logs in--

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.280
WOLFF DOBSON: Once they've
logged in, you've gone through

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.350
the OAuth flow, you've got
their access token.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.120
And depending on which flow you
use, you might also be a

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.080
refresh token.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.120
Then at that point, you should
probably generate your own

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.360
session ID.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So if you have
to generate a session ID, do

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.610
you have to do that
in a secure way

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.610
or can it be anything?

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Honestly,
it can really--

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.460
I mean, session IDs are
session IDs, right?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.940
I mean, MD5 hash your favorite
random number, and

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.170
send that on down.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.170
It just has to be something
that every time you make a

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.870
connection, you say, by
the way, this is me.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.155
This is the guy I authenticated
to do this.

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:13.010
TODD KERPELMAN: And as a general
rule, we say pass

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.260
everything down as securely
as possible.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.040
All of Google is--

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.550
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, right.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.020
I mean, you--

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.060
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So if
it's on me, it's a

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.535
generated session ID.

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:20.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, yeah,
your session ID

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.410
shouldn't be like, 1.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: How about
the MD5 sum of 0?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.410
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, exactly.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.200
And then the other thing about
that is that the access token

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.300
will eventually expire.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.150
But you can get a new one
with a refresh token.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.070
Or if you're operating inside
a gadget or some other

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.530
mechanism like that, it'll
actually auto refresh for you

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.620
if you use our client libraries,
which we strongly

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.289
recommend you do.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.870
We spent a long time hassling
with this so that

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.100
you don't have to.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.390
So we have client libraries
in Ruby,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.250
Python, Go, Java, Android--

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.870
TODD KERPELMAN: Lots.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.620
WOLFF DOBSON: Lots.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.480
Whatever you need, we probably
have one of those.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.050
If you don't, you should
suggest it.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.610
We'll look into it.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.780
TODD KERPELMAN: So while I'm
sure our audience who is

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.800
logged in to find out all about
games is thrilled with

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.400
this OAuth 2.0 talk, I'm going
to move on to another subject.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.640
WOLFF DOBSON: [SIGH].

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.280
COLT MCANIS: Real
quick, though.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.780
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.060
COLT MCANIS: Is this
demonstration here, can the

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.600
people at home grab this?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.940
Can they play with this?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.560
TODD KERPELMAN: I would not
give this to the people at

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.090
home just because, like I
said, we're essentially

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.920
trusting the client to tell
me who their user ID is.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.720
Really, I should be doing a
secure version that only

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.490
trusts the client to send in
OAuth token and then verify

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.260
that on the server.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.640
COLT MCANIS: Got it.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.400
TODD KERPELMAN: But then
that involves--

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.630
COLT MCANIS: Fair enough.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.670
Fair enough.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.790
TODD KERPELMAN: --cleaning up
some server code that I didn't

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.020
feel like doing.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.240
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.190
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, so we
are going to actually try a

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.940
little structure this
time around.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.810
COLT MCANIS: [LOW WHISTLE].

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.400
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, I think
we also got called out for

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.320
babbling quite a bit last time,
which is kind of the

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.785
whole agenda, anyway.

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:56.185
But we thought--

00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:56.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:56.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.500
COLT MCANIS: It actually says
right here, "babble."

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.840
TODD KERPELMAN: Babble.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.170
TODD KERPELMAN: But we thought
we'd try something different.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.730
We're going to have--

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.040
we need a catchier name for
this, but like the "five for

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.710
five" section where
we are going to--

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
pretty catchy.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Is it?

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.950
All right.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Five for five.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.200
WOLFF DOBSON: Or five by five.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.070
TODD KERPELMAN: Five by five?

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.660
COLT MCANIS: Can we do
like an F cubed?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.250
Five for five.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Ooh,
I don't know.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.970
I think I just feel like I'm
in Aliens at that point.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.850
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
five by five.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.570
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, it's
like five by five.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There you go.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.810
COLT MCANIS: There you go.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.820
Cool.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.990
We'll let you do your thing.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.210
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, thanks.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.205
So here's the idea.

00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:29.520
We've got five topics.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.730
We're going to talk about each
one of them for five minutes.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.660
I'm going to start the timer.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh man.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.950
There's a timer?

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.600
TODD KERPELMAN: There's
a timer.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.870
WOLFF DOBSON: How can
we get off-topic?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.439
COLT MCANIS: The people asked
for structure and this is how

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:39.660
we're giving it to them.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.860
TODD KERPELMAN: This is what
we're going to do.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.950
And they might say it's--

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.380
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You've
gone too far, though.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.140
TODD KERPELMAN: I might have.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.600
I'll tell you what.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.150
We'll start it and
see what happens.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.430
And we'll probably change
it all next time.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Is this like one
of those five minutes in

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.420
movies where it's actually like
15 minutes, and they just

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.290
keep cutting back to the red
digital readout that's gone

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.316
back up a little bit?

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.320
COLT MCANIS: The timer's going
to explode in five minutes!

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.060
20 minutes later.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.510
The timer's going to explode
in five minutes.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Still
one minute left.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.770
Let's do this.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:03.980
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.320
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Sorry.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.910
TODD KERPELMAN: Here we
go, topic number one.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Topic
number one.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.390
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.340
Colt, you have kids.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.140
COLT MCANIS: I do
have children.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.030
TODD KERPELMAN: I
have children.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.840
WOLFF DOBSON: I have a kid.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.645
TODD KERPELMAN: You
have children.

00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:12.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I am a kid.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.410
TODD KERPELMAN: You are a kid.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:13.840
At heart.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.660
WOLFF DOBSON: You
remain a child.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.920
Both emotionally--

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.690
Stunted in growth.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.110
TODD KERPELMAN: So yeah.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.760
I mean, basically, I've come to
the realization that this

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.920
is starting to become a trend
where people that are parents

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.740
have been or are hardcore
gamers.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.000
And so I'm curious as to whether
you think the fact

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.460
that gamers are growing up and
having children is going to

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.570
somehow affect the games
industry, either the games

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.830
that are made or how it affects
us as consumers?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.370
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I know one
of the things that happened,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.560
my daughter's old enough now
that we can actually play

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.450
games with a fair amount
of complexity in them.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.710
And so I sat her down with my
Dreamcast and was like, OK,

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.650
let's play some games.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.150
And we started playing.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.680
We played weird games like Pen
Pen Triicelon and strange

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.750
Japanese things.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.970
And we also played fighting
games, which she loves.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.050
And that was the first time I
really got proper back talk

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.600
from my daughter.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.210
It was smack talk about--

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.500
it's like every time she beat
me, especially if she pushed

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.360
me off the ledge, she
would go, ha ha.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.090
It's like, where did
you learn this?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.586
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Your
daughter is Nelson?

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:25.580
WOLFF DOBSON: She is.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.830
A little shorter.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.330
But one of the things that came
to mind, though, is that

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.840
actually how difficult that
control system is.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.500
When you're an analog joystick
and a bunch of buttons, it's

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.500
not a natural thing.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.830
It's absolutely a
learned skill.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.020
And it's something that I spend
way too much of my life

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.640
learning how to be good at.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.980
So when we were playing things
like Sonic Adventure and

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.890
Rayman 2 and things like that,
she just had a terrible time

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.540
lining up the camera and jumps,
and getting her guy to

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.830
run straight, and figuring out
that you move the camera and

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.020
then move your guy.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.730
You run forward and
move the camera.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That generation
of 3D games, the

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.390
cameras were difficult,
just in general.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.750
They've gotten a lot smarter
and smoother and--

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.300
WOLFF DOBSON: But she has the
same problem when we sit down

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.132
and play Dragon Age.

00:13:12.132 --> 00:13:14.240
She can figure it out, and she's
getting better at it,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.760
but it's one of those things
where it's a learned thing.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.740
When you hand her something
that's on touch, when she has

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.900
a Nexus 7 and she's playing
Plants vs. Zombies, the

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.810
distance between action and what
I want to do and what I

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.140
can do, there's no learned
skill in there.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.570
It's like, I want to put
that there, click.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.870
So I think it's certainly
driving me to reevaluate what

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.240
kinds of interfaces are
good, what kinds of

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.510
interfaces are natural.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.820
It's interesting to me how
clunky and old some of those

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.080
UI conventions are
at this point.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.640
COLT MCANIS: For me, I think
the big thing has been--

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.960
I know when we were all growing
up, video games were

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.800
sort of taboo.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.980
It was the geeky thing, right?

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.340
I mean, we spent a lot of time
locked in our room staring at

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.225
some glowing TV that probably
gave us some sort of radiation

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:03.010
in our brain.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.540
WOLFF DOBSON: And being told
by our parents that video

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.390
games would never--

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:05.540
COLT MCANIS: Would
never get us on--

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.970
WOLFF DOBSON: We need
any real jobs.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We'd never
get a YouTube TV

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.930
show discussing games.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.400
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.450
COLT MCANIS: So what I've
noticed is this.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.830
I mean, games are
mainstream now.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.720
I mean, I remember the first
time that I actually saw an

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.220
advertisement for
a video game on

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.060
television, it blew my mind.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.440
And today, and this is what my
wife and I constantly go back

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.050
and forth to.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.930
I go out of my way to
indoctrinate my children to

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.530
video games because it's the
social norm now, right?

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.290
If your child is not playing
video games, they're actually

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.500
in some cases left out of what
society is doing, right?

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.300
It was like growing up, if you
didn't watch The Simpsons,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.780
there was a dialogue that you
could not have at school with

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.390
the rest of the kids.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.150
You weren't part of that
social environment.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.620
And games are that social
environment today.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.880
And so for me, it's been
something I've had to force

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.970
myself to do because children,
you want them outside, you

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.780
want them running and eating
Play-Doh and stuff like that.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.930
WOLFF DOBSON: You're going
to sit down, and

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.740
you're going to play--

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.790
COLT MCANIS: And you're going
to play your games today.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.405
This is history 101.

00:14:56.405 --> 00:14:57.120
Beat Bowser.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.730
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and
I find that I have an

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.750
attitude that I'm much--

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.350
and this is totally a
connoisseur thing.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.790
I'm less concerned about
content level and

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.060
appropriateness as in
terms of quality.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.700
TODD KERPELMAN: That's what
I was wondering is like my

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.390
daughter is still a little
young for games, but I've

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.870
started looking at what games
are out there for kids.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.570
WOLFF DOBSON: It hurts
sometimes.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.010
TODD KERPELMAN: There's a lot
that just aren't very good.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, you just sit
there and go like, this is

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.140
not a game.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.600
You can't play this because
it annoys me.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.730
It's like, let's bring
on something decent.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.520
And actually, the new Super
Mario Brothers with the four

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.210
people playing at
the same time?

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.820
My wife and I and my daughter
will all sit around

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.470
and play this game.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.230
And since it's got the catch-up
feature where she

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.360
can, when it gets hard, she
just bubbles and follows

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.230
wherever we're going, it's
really good, and it's

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.240
appropriate.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.800
But I also have her playing
Dragon Age, which is probably

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.910
not appropriate.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.340
I'm a bad parent.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The
SRB disapproves.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.500
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, exactly.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.090
TODD KERPELMAN: I was actually
saying I think you will see

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.140
more games like what Nintendo is
doing where multiple people

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.350
of varying skill levels can
play together in the same

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.970
environment.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:07.150
Like Mario Galaxy 2, I believe,
just has that feature

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.000
where it's like one person who
can deal with manipulating the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.090
camera and jumping over these
crazy 3D jumps, and one person

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.260
just goes around and
collects the stuff.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.190
I think a lot of that
is perfect for--

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:17.840
COLT MCANIS: Besides
the fact that--

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.200
[BEEPING]

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200
[GROANING]

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.650
COLT MCANIS: Besides the fact
that being a crazy game, they

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.200
actually got that design
mechanic right.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.460
The rest of the game was--

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We
didn't get to my

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.270
opinion as a gaming parent.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:26.960
WOLFF DOBSON: You tell us.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.310
What should your parents
have done for you?

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.320
COLT MCANIS: I thought we were
over the five minute line.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.640
TODD KERPELMAN: We are,
but real quick.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.860
WOLFF DOBSON: You get
two sentences.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.328
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Uhhhhhh.

00:16:33.328 --> 00:16:35.946
COLT MCANIS: Haiku it.

00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:36.760
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
not a sentence.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.500
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, let's
go to the next one.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.260
TODD KERPELMAN: I am
so glad that we

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.721
extended time for that.

00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:43.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.990
WOLFF DOBSON: When it comes time
to edit, I think I know

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.460
where we're going.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.830
TODD KERPELMAN: Here's
my next question.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.830
So the mobile space, all we've
been hearing is free to play,

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.520
free to play, free to play.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.680
That's the big trend.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.200
Everything's going
free to play.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.790
And then last month, two
months ago, Square Enix

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.599
releases Final Fantasy III
for like $16, $17,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.740
something like that.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.250
And it is A, very well received
by the community.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.940
People say, well,
it's expensive,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.950
but it's a good game.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.829
It's worth it, and has
been doing fairly

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:16.650
well for them, I think.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.980
And in fact, they just announced
The World Ends with

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.319
You is coming to mobile for like
$20, something like that.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.050
So my question is, do we think
this is the start of a trend

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.660
where we're going to start
seeing the free to play games,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.290
but the games where you're going
to pay for them upfront

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.870
are actually going to
be more expensive.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:39.800
They're going to be in the $15
to $20 range and that $1 to $3

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.770
range is now no-man's land?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.210
WOLFF DOBSON: You get to answer
this first since you're

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.570
not a parent.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:45.470
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I hope so.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.070
I've been playing Final Fantasy
III on my Nexus phone,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.500
and it's awesome.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.660
It is a great--

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Wow.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.820
Those guys back in the day, they
knew how to write a game.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.140
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
no kidding.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.060
It's a great game.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.690
It's a great port, and
the experience works.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.480
I mean, a lot of the more
expensive premium games

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.060
require very intricate controls,
like Wolff was

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.190
talking about.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.660
But Final Fantasy
is a turn-based

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.640
game for all battles.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.180
So it works really
well on a phone.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.240
And I hope to see
more of them.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.740
COLT MCANIS: Yeah, I think
that we're going

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.590
to see more of this.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.020
I think this is not
just a fad.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.400
I think that Square Enix is the
right company to come out

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.810
and do this.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.070
They have a great catalog
of amazing content.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.950
I mean, we all grew up idolizing
the game, wasting

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.720
our lives playing these.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.880
Not wasting our lives, but
having lots of fun playing

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.250
these games.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.420
And I think we're going to see
a lot more of these companies

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.940
that have back catalog of
content bringing it over to

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.720
this new medium and creating
new content.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.980
Because right now, let's admit
it, the $0.99 thing is fun and

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.940
awesome, but sometimes you
just want something more.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.970
And I think they're finding
this new ecosystem.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.750
Because we've seen it happen
on Steam, right?

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.630
Steam, the price cap was
actually pretty high, and then

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.600
we started seeing that $12 to
$18 range of titles start

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.570
coming through the door and
actually doing very well and

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.930
monetizing very well there.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.940
And I think it's about time
to come over to mobile.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.790
I'm encouraged by this.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.540
I want to see more of it.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.420
WOLFF DOBSON: There's
a repertory theater

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.520
aspect to it, too.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.730
Where we're taking the games
that do work, unlike--

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.220
I love Pen Pen Triicelon.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.860
I do.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.270
It's a very strange game.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.650
COLT MCANIS: From the name, I
would not have expected that.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.830
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We're getting
the greatest hits, right?

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.890
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.710
We're going back and we're
sorting through these things.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.270
And what are the things that--
where the UI isn't crazy and

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.490
the cameras work and things
like that, and

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.590
bringing them forward.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.610
And in cases like Nintendo,
they're actually re-imagining

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.190
some of these things
a little bit.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.980
Like when you sit down and play
New Super Mario Bros.,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.320
you're like, oh, this world is
shaped like that other world,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.620
but is not quite the same.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.560
It's a little easier.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The thing is,
even though we are getting the

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.710
greatest hits, Final Fantasy III
is showing that that genre

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.080
and structure of game can work
in the mobile space.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.255
COLT MCANIS: Which we've
been missing, right?

00:19:51.255 --> 00:19:53.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So maybe we're
going to get new content, new

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.830
games, that are of that same
structure, but they're modern.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.580
WOLFF DOBSON: There's an aspect
where Square Enix has

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.520
spent millions upon millions
of dollars marketing these

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.640
games when they originally
launch, so they have this

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.350
incredible warm feeling
when they come out.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:14.950
If I were a custom developer,
a new developer who also had

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.730
ambitions to build the next
great Final Fantasy, marketing

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.210
becomes a real important
question there.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.590
Like where are you going to
get the money to build the

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.260
brand awareness so that when
people come there, they're

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.630
like, damn, I'm spending
$15 on that.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.050
One of the reasons why we all
went out and dropped $60 on

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.550
Final Fantasy, or $50, or $70
or whatever you paid.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:34.920
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: $15.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.140
WOLFF DOBSON: At the moment
in which it came out.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.540
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, oh, you
mean way back in the day.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.160
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.960
Whatever day.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.790
Whenever you bought it.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.070
COLT MCANIS: $54.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.350
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know
where you bought yours, but

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.670
mine was $16.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.040
WOLFF DOBSON: That's what
she said it cost,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.660
so I just paid it.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.053
No.

00:20:46.053 --> 00:20:46.840
COLT MCANIS: You're going
to the wrong sites.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.860
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.180
But we wanted to pay it
because we'd seen the

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.470
trailers, and we'd seen the
things, and gotten the hype.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.180
And we were like, yeah, $15.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.680
I'm there, I'm going to do it.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.170
And I think that's part of the
emotional play you have to

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.215
make as a developer.

00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:02.280
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think for
when I first played Final

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.700
Fantasy II or IV in--

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Depending
on which numbering

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.540
system you're using.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:07.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.610
The hype was the playground
hype.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.970
It was, holy crap, I rented this
game over the weekend.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:14.680
It was amazing.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.100
COLT MCANIS: Renting.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.230
You remember back when
kids rented games?

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.715
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, yes.

00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:18.950
COLT MCANIS: Wow.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.060
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Get on your
bicycle, bike over to--

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.370
COLT MCANIS: I'm so old.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.666
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --Jumbo Video,
and get yourself a game.

00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:25.530
Yes, yes.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.190
TODD KERPELMAN: You'd have the
instruction manual that was

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.530
typewritten because that was
the one thing that they

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.600
couldn't actually--

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.020
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I actually
remember

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.690
going with my friends--

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.410
maybe this doesn't translate
to America-- but Canadian

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.180
Tire, where they actually have
their own currency, Canadian

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.060
Tire Dollars.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.810
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh yeah, they have
their own credit cards

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.120
and stuff, too.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.540
It's like the most popular
credit card in Canada.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well, Canadian
Tire currency, it's like you

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.490
get maybe 1% back on
all your purchases.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.350
And my friend somehow saved up
$70 worth of Canadian Tire

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.950
money and bought Final
Fantasy II.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.240
I remember going on that trip.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.840
COLT MCANIS: That should somehow
become a T-shirt.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.950
I don't know how, where.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.820
If you make T-shirts and you're
watching this stream,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.150
make that into a T-shirt.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:04.820
I will buy it.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.000
Also, if you're out there and
you make T-shirts and you make

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.335
any Metriod T-shirts, I
will also buy those

00:22:09.335 --> 00:22:10.260
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.665
COLT MCANIS: Got to represent
the Metroid.

00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:13.450
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.990
We have 10 seconds left.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.410
COLT MCANIS: Even in 10 seconds,
I want to say this,

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.430
is that I really do want to come
back to the concept of

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.940
how do indie developers market
in this new economy because

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.450
there's a lot of stuff
there that we don't--

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.430
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
a great topic.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.440
We could do a whole
show on that.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:25.860
COLT MCANIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.340
[BEEPING]

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.446
COLT MCANIS: Write that down.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.280
TODD KERPELMAN: Wait.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.620
Sorry, my thing--

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:29.986
all right.

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:30.720
Well, that was sort of
one of our topics.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.180
WOLFF DOBSON: I don't
know how to stop it.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.590
COLT MCANIS: This modern
technology.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.020
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, less
business-y talk, more

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.730
game-y talk.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.080
COLT MCANIS: Ooh.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.960
TODD KERPELMAN: Favorite
boss fight.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.430
Start with you, John.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.350
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.030
TODD KERPELMAN: Or
most memorable.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.830
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Actually,
Final Fantasy IV.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.860
The end boss, Zeromus.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.790
The very same friends who went
to Canadian Tire and bought

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.550
this game, we spent an
entire summer trying

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.820
to beat this boss.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.390
We made it all the way through
the game and then got stuck.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.060
And we just had to-- we
started-- it was my first

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.510
experience grinding in a
game, just leveling up

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.160
and leveling up.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.010
And it was this huge trek
just to get to the boss.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.640
There was no save spot right
next to the boss, so it was

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.530
maybe half an hour of game play
to get from the closest

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.960
save spot to the boss,
only to lose again,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.220
and again, and again.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.090
But the music and the graphics,
it was amazing.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.140
TODD KERPELMAN: I was going to
say, that doesn't sound like a

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.240
positive experience.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.425
That sounds like--

00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:32.820
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It
was, though.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.560
WOLFF DOBSON: But you felt
good when you were done.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.165
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, when
we finally succeeded.

00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:36.100
WOLFF DOBSON: If you keep
slamming your hand in the car

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.410
door, eventually it feels
great to stop.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.435
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well, this was,
I guess, a different era

00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:43.970
of gaming when we're all sitting
together in front of a

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.210
television, five of us playing
and sharing the controllers

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.440
and passing it around and
trying and trying again.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.770
So maybe it's more the time
I had with my friends.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.260
But I will always remember the
music and the graphics.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.340
And when you think you've beaten
him, he does his death

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.070
animation and then re-spawns
in an even tougher mode.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.810
COLT MCANIS: Multi-stage boss.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.090
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, final,
final, final form.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Just the
strategy in that was so

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.280
difficult because you needed a
white mage to constantly be

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.040
healing and reviving people, and
then hoping that your turn

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.110
to get an attack
comes before--

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.660
because he had a
one-hit attack.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.240
If he attacked one of
your characters,

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:20.920
they were just dead.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.620
It didn't matter how many
hit points you had.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.730
So you constantly had to be
reviving them and getting the

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.080
timing right so you get in one
hit before you're killed.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.260
It was awesome.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.400
COLT MCANIS: I like
your strategy.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.260
For me, so many to pick from.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.520
One of the most memorable, I
have to say, I ever had was

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.150
actually Super Mario RPG.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.590
This was actually-- so I had
missed the RPG genre until

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.410
Super Mario RPG and loved
it, absolutely fell

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.440
in love with it.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.350
There was one boss fight, and
it wasn't really a boss.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.720
It was actually just one
of the monsters--

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.930
the NPCs in the game--

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:52.420
Jinx.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.300
I don't know if you remember
this, but in Monster Town,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.030
there was a specific door that
you could open that would

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.260
actually go, and you could fight
a little dude that was

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.690
only like 8 pixels tall.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.380
His name was Jinx, and he
was a martial arts dojo.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.390
And I remember this fight more
than anything else because I

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.280
could beat everyone
else in the game.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.510
I actually beat the game, beat
the end boss-- the sword

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.140
dude-- came back, and still
couldn't beat this guy.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.880
I actually spent more time
trying to beat him, leveling

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.640
up and trying to figure him out,
then I did the rest of

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.120
the game entirely.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.380
That stuck out to me because
it was an entire summer.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.440
Like you said, it was just an
entire summer of trying to

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.760
figure out this guy's
patterns.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.510
And I learned more about how to
play the game fighting that

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.240
one guy than the rest
of the game.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.435
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
I'm going to give my--

00:25:33.435 --> 00:25:33.750
WOLFF DOBSON: What about you?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.210
Yeah.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.330
TODD KERPELMAN: --two quick
ones, which are the giant fish

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.750
in the lake in Resident
Evil 4.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh yes.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.470
That was a good fight.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.480
TODD KERPELMAN: That
was a good fight.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.260
It was just--

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.960
WOLFF DOBSON: That whole game
is really interesting.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That
game is so good.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.550
TODD KERPELMAN: That
was a good game.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.990
Yeah, I mean, there were a lot
of good boss fights in that.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.230
WOLFF DOBSON: With the Wii
controls, too, it was

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.990
something else.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.225
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I played it on
the GameCube, and then I got

00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:56.330
it again on the Wii.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, on the
Wii, it's just amazing.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I wasn't a
huge fan of Resident Evil

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.800
until Resident Evil 4, and
that just completely--

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, I
spend quality time

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.540
with Resident Evil.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.840
TODD KERPELMAN: And that was
like the very first boss fight

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.800
that you really had in that
game, and it just--

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.970
yeah.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.740
It was a thrill ride.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Actually, I
think the first one is the mob

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.400
in that city.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.380
That took me--

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.750
like in that rural town,
that was really hard.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.500
TODD KERPELMAN: That
felt like a movie.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.350
That felt like movie pacing,
where it's like--

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.200
I don't know if you remember the
remake of Dawn of the Dead

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.880
where you've got that crazy
sequence at the beginning

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.120
where Sarah Polley is trying to
get away from her household

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.920
and finally ends up crashing
in a ditch.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.860
And you realize you've been
tense the whole time, and then

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.300
the opening credits come up.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.960
It was kind of that feeling
with Resident Evil 4.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, it was.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.440
WOLFF DOBSON: All
right, so two.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.740
Second boss.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.490
Oh, was that your--

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.730
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.220
The second boss.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.070
I'll just-- real quick.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.910
This is this somewhat obscure
game called Warning Forever.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:00.310
It was a Windows freeware
game that was released

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.350
several years ago.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.000
I really want somebody out
there to do a remake.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.530
I will buy it.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.360
So you got one customer.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.590
COLT MCANIS: Kickstarter
project there.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.535
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be fantastic.

00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:09.430
WOLFF DOBSON: Warning Forever?

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.720
TODD KERPELMAN: The entire
game was just fighting.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.070
It was--

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.810
WOLFF DOBSON: Holy cow.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.990
TODD KERPELMAN: --a little
spaceship battle.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Freeware
2D fixed.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.710
TODD KERPELMAN: The entire game
was fighting just these

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.260
giant, giant boss spaceships.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.590
And every time you defeated
one, the game would

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.290
algorithmically determine, oh,
OK, you spent your time

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.700
attacking this way, and you
got hit more often by this

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.710
weapon, and would evolve and
dynamically create another

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.020
boss monster for you.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.550
WOLFF DOBSON: It's a game that
hates you even more.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.070
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So the
game looks a lot like

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.580
Life Force or Gradius.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.260
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, it's
that kind of Life Force,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.990
Gradius kind of theme.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.680
WOLFF DOBSON: It's
a bullet hell.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.730
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
great games.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:41.960
[BEEPING]

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.440
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, but I'm
going to go anyway.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.430
TODD KERPELMAN: Go anyway.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.950
WOLFF DOBSON: My favorite boss
battle is from Pathways into

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.290
Darkness, the giant blue worm
that comes after you.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.220
You walk through this maze
and it takes forever.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.410
And you go and you go and you
go, and then the guy is there.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.910
And all the way through, you're
picking up M16 ammo.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.250
And it's a survival
horror thing.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.970
So he's like, I have
so much ammo.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:05.830
Oh, this is so good.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.050
It was like the first survival
horror game I'd ever played

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.270
because it's back on the Mac.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.700
Bungie, it's one of their
very first games.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.840
Get up there, and you're
like, woo, [GASP]

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.400
monster.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.300
And so you start loading your
M16 and you're stepping

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.790
backwards because it's going at
the same rate that you can

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:20.510
walk backwards.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.290
And you end up walking backwards
for what felt like

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.000
an hour, but probably is more
like about 2 minutes, backing

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.803
up through the maze, unloading
everything, and then running

00:28:28.803 --> 00:28:29.560
out of M16.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.870
And now you're back into your
regular ammo, which you were

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.180
saving for this thing.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.140
And you're doing all that, and
then you're eventually

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.890
stabbing with your knife.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.000
And it dies like right as
you get out of the maze.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.190
UH!

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.170
It's beautiful.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.950
And it actually goes to what the
role of AI in games is in

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:46.590
the first place.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.670
And to me, it's always to lose,
but at the last minute.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.230
And this was our organizing
principle when

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.080
we were doing AI.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.560
It's like it wants to push
you, but then, aargh.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So was it
actually set up so that--

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.160
WOLFF DOBSON: Absolutely.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.560
They knew exactly how many
bullets that you had, and they

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.940
knew how strong to make it.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.570
They knew what to
make the thing.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.100
And then actually, when I was
playing a Resident Evil game,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.910
there was a--

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.350
it was Resident Evil
maybe Code--

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.890
Vernoica?

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.770
I can't remember.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.775
And at one point, you switch
characters and you have to go

00:29:14.775 --> 00:29:15.250
through this thing.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.930
And Resident Evil has those
boxes that you put stuff in,

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.320
and then it appears
someplace else.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.970
It's like the uniform box.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.560
And so I was like, oh, this
other guy's got this really

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.210
tough thing.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.990
So I took my regular character
and filled the box with

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.560
everything.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.070
All she had was a pistol
and three bullets.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.410
And then that character went
off, and then I went to the

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.870
character, and he had this
difficult quest,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.830
and he comes back.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.680
And then he meets up with her
and gives her the antidote.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.140
And then all of a sudden,
a boss battle starts.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.060
And he is separated.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.610
And I was like, oh god, I
only have three bullets.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.740
But the guys at Capcom
had predicted that.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.590
And sure enough, I went bang,
bang, bang, and the guy died.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.920
And I was like, oh, I see.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.880
It has as many hit points
as I have bullets.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.540
I win!

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.410
And I had all this
extra shotgun--

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.200
COLT MCANIS: I want some of
those bullets in every game.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, exactly.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:58.490
All right.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.580
So anyway, let's keep going.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.950
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, we're
going to keep going.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.080
Next question.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.560
Favorite setting, as in like
fantasy world, not like oh,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.050
I'm going to configure
the anti-alias thing.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:08.910
That you feel like is--

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.740
WOLFF DOBSON: My favorite
setting is

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.900
the anti-alias thing.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.310
TODD KERPELMAN: The land
of anti-alias.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.650
COLT MCANIS: DLAA.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.410
WOLFF DOBSON: Is it favorite
setting, or is it favorite

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.750
least used setting?

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.250
TODD KERPELMAN: Favorite setting
that you feel is

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.690
underutilized, that you'd
like to see more of.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.200
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes?

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.830
TODD KERPELMAN: Are you--

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.540
WOLFF DOBSON: Are we
looking at me?

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.390
JIMMY: Your mike needs
to be adjusted.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.240
Fix your mike.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.680
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.640
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.030
TODD KERPELMAN: Hold on.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.860
We're taking a break for
technical difficulties.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.500
WOLFF DOBSON: No, it's OK.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:32.740
You guys--

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.760
COLT MCANIS: Are we paused
or are we live?

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.800
TODD KERPELMAN: Why don't
you go while we're--

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.650
COLT MCANIS: Yeah.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.610
So I really think that
fantasy is overdone.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.650
I know it's probably the
most popular genre

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:40.790
that's out there today.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.340
I think like 70% of all games
are actually fantasy.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.060
People get it.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.610
People understand it.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.440
But to me, it's just
way overdone.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.220
I know what a paladin is, I know
what a cleric is, give me

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.630
something cooler.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.540
To be honest, I love the
slapstick style of things like

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.020
Super Mario Bros.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.760
I know that's not a specific
genre like an art style, but

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.180
that sort of slapstick
environment where the

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.180
developer is not even
taking themselves

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.440
seriously in a lot of cases.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.340
Like I'm an Italian plumber, I'm
hopping on evil mushrooms,

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.130
and then I'm going inside of
pipes to collect coins.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.550
Like what is that?

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.500
Who even--

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.770
so I really love those crazy
slapstick games.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.680
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's Italy.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.710
COLT MCANIS: Yeah, I've
never been to Italy.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.830
WOLFF DOBSON: I apologize to
our abroad Italian viewers.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.620
Did you--

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.880
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, I forgot
to set the timer.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.140
WOLFF DOBSON: Did you ever play
the Grasshopper games

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.770
like No More Heroes and
No More Heroes 2?

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.390
COLT MCANIS: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Those are
very slapstick.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.050
COLT MCANIS: Exactly.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.860
WOLFF DOBSON: I find them very
loose technically, and so I

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.530
get frustrated.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.330
This is the quality
over everything.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.070
I get frustrated by the game
play when it's like--

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.810
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, the
aesthetic of those games is so

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.790
interesting.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.700
No More Heroes was so weird,
like so much of that game was

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.050
mowing lawns.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.010
WOLFF DOBSON: It was a strange,
strange game.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.380
COLT MCANIS: Well, you
can't be a hero while

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.240
you're mowing a lawn.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.140
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You got
to earn some money.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.220
COLT MCANIS: Yeah, but
I really like that.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.150
I feel that we're missing
that in the modern area.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.410
We've got like the Plants vs.
Zombies styles, which kind of

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.520
takes itself seriously,
but doesn't.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.190
And I feel that's a great
setting that we need more of.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.140
TODD KERPELMAN: More sort
of humor, not like

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.480
maybe explicit humor?

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.610
COLT MCANIS: I'm sorry, game
developers take themselves way

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.800
too seriously.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, you don't
think every game should be

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.700
brown and with light blue.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Don't
forget the crates.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.200
COLT MCANIS: Crates,
post-processing effects.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.620
COLT MCANIS: It makes
it look real.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Time to crate.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.670
You know about that measure.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.800
It was every game is rated on
the number of seconds until

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.600
the first crate appears.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.090
COLT MCANIS: Yes.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.311
WOLFF DOBSON: I've even seen
slapstick games put a crate

00:32:31.311 --> 00:32:31.420
just in the middle of nowhere.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Doesn't Quake
II start with crate?

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:35.640
COLT MCANIS: Doom.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.320
Doom starts with crates.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.730
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, Doom,
the very first thing--

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.740
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Every hit
game starts with crates.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.150
COLT MCANIS: There's a website
that ranks all

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:40.555
these, isn't there?

00:32:40.555 --> 00:32:40.810
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:41.810
This is number of seconds
to crate.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.370
TODD KERPELMAN: That's what
we're talking about, number of

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.180
seconds until you see
a crate in the game.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.745
COLT MCANIS: I talked too
long, who's next?

00:32:46.745 --> 00:32:48.900
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: What's
the question?

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.820
COLT MCANIS: We're talking
about crates.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.180
TODD KERPELMAN: Underutilized
settings.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.210
WOLFF DOBSON: I think
underutilized settings,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.460
warehouses.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:56.820
COLT MCANIS: We need more

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.270
warehouses and parking garages.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.350
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Spooky
mansions, warehouses.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.290
Castles.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.200
TODD KERPELMAN: That's good.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.035
I was going to say I didn't
think I liked Westerns until I

00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.276
played Red Dead Redemption.

00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:09.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
a great game.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.880
TODD KERPELMAN: The
setting is good.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.600
I was thinking about it on the
way over, that probably you

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.030
couldn't have a good Western
game until this generation of

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.040
hardware, just because the
worlds are so open and you

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.650
don't have to worry about
cutting off the viewer's view

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.210
every 20 feet.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
and like foliage.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:30.080
Let's be honest, getting plants
looking good is a very

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.140
recent phenomenon.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.660
COLT MCANIS: Wait, isn't--

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.860
It's a Western.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.630
It's supposed to be
in the desert.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, no, but--

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.150
WOLFF DOBSON: But there
are plants.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.060
COLT MCANIS: There
are some plants.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.260
I will allow that.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Westerns don't
take place in the Sahara.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.720
TODD KERPELMAN: I probably
spent 10 hours collecting

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.850
flowers in Red Dead
Redemption.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.290
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, that
was the thing.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.400
I mean, the design goal of that
is to have you look at

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.350
all the plants, right?

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.360
I mean, every game has these
quests where it's like, look

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.680
at the terrain very carefully
because we paid hundreds of

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.000
thousands of dollars to mark
up all these things.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.660
COLT MCANIS: Some graphics
programmer's like, no, no, no.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.410
This is a quest.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.560
WOLFF DOBSON: You're going to
look at my frickin' fountain.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.510
That's what I'm saying.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.199
Do you know how long
that took?

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.760
TODD KERPELMAN: But the problem
with that is I end up

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.280
looking at the mini-map
the whole time.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.230
Because I think when those
icons started showing up.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.880
WOLFF DOBSON: See, that's a
whole gamer rant there.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.610
It's like, mini-map,
not mini-map.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.679
Did you see The Getaway, where
they were going to get rid of

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.909
the mini-map?

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:26.780
SCEE did The Getaway,
which is this game.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.130
One of the design goals of the
game was there was going to be

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:29.770
no mini-map.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:30.780
COLT MCANIS: Oh wow.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Because it
was an open world game.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:32.639
[BEEPING]

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.980
WOLFF DOBSON: They had
rigged all of London.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.080
All right, underused--

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.420
London.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.550
No, it's very overused.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.989
And actually, my favorite
setting ever for a video game

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.800
was the inside of the Arc de
Triomphe in Onimusha 3.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.570
COLT MCANIS: Oh wow, yeah.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.790
WOLFF DOBSON: That
was awesome.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:54.730
But anyway, yeah, they
have no mini-map.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.710
But they still had to tell
you where to drive.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.990
And so what happens is in the
middle of these crazy car

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.600
chases, your guy will signal.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.670
And he'll be, oh, I
should turn right.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.560
COLT MCANIS: Brilliant.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.220
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is pretty smart.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.860
WOLFF DOBSON: It was cool at
the beginning because you

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.150
really have this intense kind
of movie-like experience.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.010
But after a while,
it got ludicrous.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.970
You're like, why
am I signaling?

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.120
I'm being chased by
like 70 cops.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.590
And I'm like, you know what I
need to do, I need to signal.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.320
COLT MCANIS: Well, you
have to obey the law.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.490
You don't want to
get pulled over.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.110
TODD KERPELMAN: You should
signal one way and then turn

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:26.840
the other direction.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.275
WOLFF DOBSON: Ohh.

00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:28.430
TODD KERPELMAN: And that'll
throw them off.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.790
WOLFF DOBSON: You know, if we
had better AI, we'd be able to

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.590
do stuff like this.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.010
What's our next topic?

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.130
COLT MCANIS: Did John go?

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.196
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, I was
going to say, why don't we

00:35:35.196 --> 00:35:35.750
have John go.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.460
And we are running
low on time.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.550
I'm going to save this next one
because it's a big topic,

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.820
probably for next time.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.090
That'll be like a teaser.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.790
Two weeks from now.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.940
COLT MCANIS: Tune in.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Something
suburban North America.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.260
It's a very underutilized
setting for a game.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Have you
been to the suburbs?

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.060
TODD KERPELMAN: Suburban
North America.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.420
WOLFF DOBSON: Nothing happens.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.730
COLT MCANIS: You mean like
Mars Attacks! style?

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.760
Paperboy type stuff?

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:53.970
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.360
TODD KERPELMAN: The Simpsons.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:54.970
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.180
WOLFF DOBSON: Martians Ate
My Neighbors or whatever.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:56.490
What was it?

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.220
Zombies Ate My Neighbors?

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.940
COLT MCANIS: Zombies
Ate My Neighbors.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.010
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, Zombies
Ate My Neighbors,

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.040
that kind of setting.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.780
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I actually
think realistic settings are

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.500
not-- or modern time settings,
they're difficult, because you

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.540
end up with uncanny valley
problems and the "why is there

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.230
a crate in my wife's bedroom?"
kind of questions.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.630
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Time
to crates.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.340
COLT MCANIS: That
is a question.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:14.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Definitely
a little

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.540
weird there or something.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.660
COLT MCANIS: I thought Modern
Warfare 2 did it well.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.830
They had an urban map, which was
effectively just a shooter

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.330
on rails that I really wish they
could've explored more of

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.170
the ecosystem there.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.210
But I thought they did
it really well.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:25.880
They had an urban environment.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, when people
do it, and I mean,

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.430
Grand Theft Auto IV, obviously,
you feel when

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.210
you're driving through parts of
it, you're like, my friend

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.100
lives right here.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:40.580
But, in general, I think it's a
way to bring in players who

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.990
aren't science fiction and
fantasy fans and be like, this

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.790
is something you know, and now
I'm going to do something

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.010
weird to it to make it
interesting for you.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: But like Zombies
Ate My Neighbors, or

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.090
whatever that game was called,
it could be in that suburban

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.630
setting, and then
sci-fi happens.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Mm-hm.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.092
COLT MCANIS: Can you mix
a sci-fi and a zombie?

00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:01.320
WOLFF DOBSON: Sci-fi zombies?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:01.710
Sure.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.275
Haven't you watched any of
the Resident Evil movies?

00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:04.560
COLT MCANIS: Well--

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.030
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
sci-zombies.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.890
COLT MCANIS: That's
zombieized.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:10.690
TODD KERPELMAN: Serenity?

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:10.910
COLT MCANIS: Serenity?

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.940
Really Fair enough.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.590
Fair enough.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:13.940
Reapers?

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.910
That's one.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.010
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
I guess they were.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.950
They were pretty much zombies.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:17.280
WOLFF DOBSON: Sci-fi zombies.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.480
TODD KERPELMAN: There you go.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.635
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There's
rules, though, and you

00:37:19.635 --> 00:37:20.290
just don't do it.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:20.380
COLT MCANIS: Well, yeah.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.220
Like vampires shouldn't
sparkle.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.180
Let's just get that out
of the way right now.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.940
Make sure everyone knows where
I stand on this issue.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.220
WOLFF DOBSON: If you are a
viewer and you do believe

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.240
vampires should sparkle,
I think you need

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.910
to comment on that.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.130
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Let us know.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.480
I had some follow-up questions
for next episode.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.290
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
that sounds good.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.560
We didn't have really any
questions this time.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, that's OK.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.940
TODD KERPELMAN: Maybe because we
didn't answer most of them

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.390
from last time.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:43.080
Next time--

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.440
WOLFF DOBSON: Learn
helplessness.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.170
TODD KERPELMAN: I'd like you to
fill out some questions--

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Wait, wait.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.410
COLT MCANIS: Jimmy?

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.420
Jimmy, we have a question?

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.260
Jimmy, can we go to the live
feed of the question?

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.055
What do we got?

00:37:53.055 --> 00:37:53.410
TODD KERPELMAN: Hold on.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:54.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Hold on.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:55.240
He's got to type faster.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.670
COLT MCANIS: Jimmy?

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.920
Jimmy, we need that
on this monitor.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.130
Jimmy?

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We
got a question.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.030
TODD KERPELMAN: Ooh.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.620
WOLFF DOBSON: We have
a question!

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.280
COLT MCANIS: Fantastic.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.630
TODD KERPELMAN: "Where do you
see gaming going with

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.080
technology like Hangouts?" I
don't know if there's anyone

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:05.950
here that really
knows Hangouts.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.210
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, who
works on Hangouts?

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.226
Oh, oh.

00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:08.570
TODD KERPELMAN: Wolff.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.440
COLT MCANIS: That guy.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.840
WOLFF DOBSON: I think the--

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.630
TODD KERPELMAN: Good question.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.710
Thank you, by the way.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.030
WOLFF DOBSON: There are a lot
of interesting things to do

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.580
with Hangouts.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.490
I think Hangouts are--

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.140
one of the things I say a lot
when we talk about Hangouts is

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.790
that Hangouts are a
room where you've

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:25.910
gathered a bunch of people.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.380
And then Hangout apps are the
kitchen table that they're all

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:28.980
sitting around.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.680
It's the thing that they're all
looking at and sharing.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.750
And you were talking
about the couch

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.760
experience with your friends.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.130
I think having a strict "watch
me play" kind of thing might

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.961
not be as much fun if it's a
little screen and you're going

00:38:41.961 --> 00:38:42.890
to look away kind of thing.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.520
But I think a situation in
which we're sharing an

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.440
experience together and we
can talk to each other.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.710
And I actually think
that games--

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.460
I would love it if somebody--

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.780
actually, we had that
at a hackathon.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:00.530
Somebody had the OpenGL Quake
running in a Hangout.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.040
They demoed it at the University
of Washington, a

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.200
hackathon we had in January.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.560
They had that.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.220
It was really neat.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.560
I did find my attention tended
to focus on the shooting part

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.330
and not nearly as
much on the--

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.050
COLT MCANIS: Other
people part.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.650
WOLFF DOBSON: On the people,
people's heads.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.890
So I think you're going
to have to bring

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.895
the faces into the--

00:39:19.895 --> 00:39:21.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Just put
them on the crates.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.420
So every crate you pass
by will just have--

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.290
TODD KERPELMAN: Have someone's
face on it.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.350
COLT MCANIS: So was this--

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.230
this was that each person had
their own instance of Quake--

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.440
WOLFF DOBSON: They were all
playing Quake together.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:32.720
COLT MCANIS: Got it.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.250
WOLFF DOBSON: But they
had the lineup of--

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.680
COLT MCANIS: And this is--

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.220
I just want to make sure because
this is different than

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.590
what you would standardly see,
which is like, hey, we're all

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.420
in a Hangout, and we all
see the same thing.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.290
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah that's
the YouTube watching

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.170
somebody else play.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.410
COLT MCANIS: Got it.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Like there's the
guy who plays all the modern

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.820
games and people shout
stuff at him.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Now what
about tabletop games?

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, well, there's
Tabletop Forge, which

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.110
we've talked about before
on the show.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Because I'm
pretty sure some Facebook

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.030
friends of mine play D&amp;D--

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh god, yeah.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.343
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --over
Hangouts.

00:40:02.343 --> 00:40:03.550
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.870
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and see,
that's a situation in which

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.575
the people matter a lot
in that situation.

00:40:06.575 --> 00:40:10.150
And I think that's what makes
Hangout games fun.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, because
that was really about like--

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.600
COLT MCANIS: And shouldn't they
be your Google+ friends?

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.140
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.940
They are, yeah.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.640
COLT MCANIS: OK.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.550
I was just trying
to figure out--

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: What'd I say?

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.340
Did I have to list some
other social network?

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.690
TODD KERPELMAN: I would like
to see parlor games.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.510
I'd like to see more
like charades.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.700
I feel like you can't do
charades in any other

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.020
environment--

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.520
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Pictionary.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.780
TODD KERPELMAN: --beyond,
yeah.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.250
Or even a game like Balderdash,
which in theory--

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.130
so it's the game where you have
this word that no one

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.720
really knows.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.670
Everyone writes definitions for
it and try and guess which

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.400
one's real.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.870
I feel like if I were just doing
that in a chat room,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.840
everyone would be going off to
Google and looking up the

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.980
word, and then it wouldn't
be any fun.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.110
I feel like in a Hangout, the
fact that you can see other

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.840
people's faces, and you know who
they are, and you're all

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.460
playing together, somehow I
think would add that extra

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:06.560
peer pressure to actually play
by the rules and play well.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.600
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I mean,
that's why RPGs work, that

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.630
we're all in a shared experience
together and we're

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.490
going to enforce the rules on
each other, although it's

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.240
harder to cheat on dice rolls
using Tabletop Forge because

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.100
actually everyone
sees the roll.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.020
COLT MCANIS: So quick
question here.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.990
So there's two separate discrete
versions right now

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.850
that we're talking about, which
is the YouTube style

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:27.950
"watch me play," and
then everyone

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:28.870
has their own version.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.940
Can you do both with the
current Hangout APIs?

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.810
Like it would be fantastic.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.760
I see a scenario here where
we're playing poker or

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.250
something, and we have this
shared environment

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.710
that we can all see.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.160
But then we each have our own
little view that we can

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.290
manipulate before it
goes in, right?

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.920
Like I've got my view
of the ecosystem.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.670
I've got my cards in my
hand that I can see.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.880
But yet you can see on this
larger screen what everyone

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.520
else has written.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh no,
we do that already.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:50.590
COLT MCANIS: Oh cool.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.480
So you can actually get
two separate feeds.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.170
TODD KERPELMAN: It's really
just one feed.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.020
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
it's one feed.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.290
But you're--

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.440
well, OK.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:06.180
You can share your screen, which
is going to give you

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.040
some view of what it is that
you're seeing on your desktop

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.820
right then.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.110
But games like--

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:16.710
well, games like WarLight
there's a shared map.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:19.110
But you see what you see through
fog of war, and other

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.650
people see what they see
through fog of war.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.060
So we have that.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.960
And if someone decided to haul
out and make a bridge game,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.900
then that would be a great
thing where you have your

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.340
cards yourself.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: My grandmother
would love it.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.250
COLT MCANIS: But would your
grandma haul out and make it?

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.220
WOLFF DOBSON: Is she
going to sit down?

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:34.720
Hack that out?

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.370
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, it's hard
enough to get her to turn on

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.690
the computer.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.640
WOLFF DOBSON: And actually,
interestingly, you can run two

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.680
Hangout apps at once if you
really wanted to have side

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.400
chat like that.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.790
Because you can run the
extension on the side--

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.040
COLT MCANIS: That would
be great for Catan.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.945
WOLFF DOBSON: But
anyway, yeah.

00:42:53.945 --> 00:42:56.640
Like I said, games where people
are important I think

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.570
are games where Hangouts are
going to be exciting.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:02.000
And I mean, I think
lots of games

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.910
are exciting in Hangouts.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.550
Those are the games I'm
most excited about.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.076
COLT MCANIS: Very cool.

00:43:06.076 --> 00:43:06.790
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.690
COLT MCANIS: Jimmy, do we have
any more on the live feed?

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:09.243
TODD KERPELMAN: That's it.

00:43:09.243 --> 00:43:09.666
COLT MCANIS: No?

00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:10.090
OK.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.590
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Any questions
from Jimmy?

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.652
COLT MCANIS: Jimmy?

00:43:12.652 --> 00:43:13.070
No.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.810
Jimmy's just an intern.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.260
It's OK.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.940
TODD KERPELMAN: So we are
just about out of time.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.000
Like I said, we'll save this
topic for next time.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.860
COLT MCANIS: Do you want
to announce it?

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.620
TODD KERPELMAN: No, no, we'll
keep it a secret.

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well, that
might lead to questions.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.787
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh,
that's true.

00:43:26.787 --> 00:43:27.274
All right, yeah.

00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:29.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Why don't you
announce the topic?

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:29.810
TODD KERPELMAN: We
are going to be

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.620
talking about app discovery.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.760
WOLFF DOBSON: App discovery?

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.170
TODD KERPELMAN: App discovery.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.030
WOLFF DOBSON: What kinds of
apps are we discovering?

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.320
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, so this
kind of started with a article

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.470
that you had sent me about the
game 10000000, spelled one,

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.730
zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, with no
commas, which meant I had no

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.570
idea how many zeroes
were on it.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.480
WOLFF DOBSON: Which makes it
very difficult to find on

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.860
search, which--

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.850
TODD KERPELMAN: Which
sort of--

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.370
WOLFF DOBSON: Although, not
actually that hard because you

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.620
type "100," or a random number
of zeroes, and then type

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.870
"game," and then it will say,
"do you mean "10000000"?

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.990
COLT MCANIS: I love
Google sometimes.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.150
TODD KERPELMAN: We're
smart like that.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.140
WOLFF DOBSON: I misspelled
"ermahgern." Because I was

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.001
looking for the meme, and it
said "do you mean "ermahgern"?

00:44:10.001 --> 00:44:11.460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So a picture
of the meme?

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.540
No, no.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.050
It just said, "do you
mean "ermahgern"?

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.830
And I was like, yes,
yes, I do.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.240
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
we're out of time.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.700
Next week, app discovery.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.470
We'll give you more background
next time.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.780
WOLFF DOBSON: Keep those cards
and letters coming in.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.890
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, keep the
questions coming and--

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.395
COLT MCANIS: Jimmy, get that
out of your mouth.

00:44:30.395 --> 00:44:31.020
TODD KERPELMAN: Jimmy's so--

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:31.790
COLT MCANIS: Interns.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:32.935
TODD KERPELMAN: Jimmy
is irrepressible.

00:44:32.935 --> 00:44:33.775
That's what he is.

00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:34.240
COLT MCANIS: He's
chewing on our--

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.401
OK.

00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:37.485
If you get shocked again,
it's on you.

00:44:37.485 --> 00:44:38.580
All right, that's all for us?

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.370
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
all for us.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:40.890
Hopefully, they're
fading us out.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.386
And we can continue to do that
thing where we chat while

00:44:43.386 --> 00:44:43.860
they're fading out.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.472
COLT MCANIS: Well, that's
an actual valid thing.

00:44:47.472 --> 00:45:15.200
