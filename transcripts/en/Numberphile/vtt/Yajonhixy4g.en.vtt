00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.820
I, Carlo SÃ©quin, will prove to you that any triangle that you draw is equilateral.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.600
That means it has the same length of the sides all around.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.300
So I'm starting with three intersecting lines,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.240
and a second one here,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.200
and a third one here,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.500
and I mark the intersection vertices as the vertices of a triangle:

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.020
A, B, and C.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.100
That does not look, you know, equilateral (not too far off), but it is certainly arbitrarily drawn.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:38.160
Now, I'm taking the middle point of the side BC (I call this M), and I draw the perpendicular bisector.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.400
So I'm drawing a line that's perpendicular, coming out of M, going off in that particular direction.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.320
And, of course, we have a right angle here.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.200
Now you know that this line is the locus of all the points

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
that are equidistant from point B and from point C.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.300
I'm going to draw another extra line, and that is the angle bisector coming out of A here,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.040
So that should look something like that, I guess.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.100
and this line, of course, let's call it angle divider "d",

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.840
is the locus of all the points that are equidistant from lines AB and from line AC.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.860
So,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.140
If I'm going to the intersection point between these two lines, which is about here, which I'm calling X,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.920
then I know that this point is equidistant

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.920
from B and from C,  because it lies on the perpendicular bisector.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.880
So, let's draw these two lines.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.680
And we know that these are equal because they are on the perpendicular bisector.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.220
Okay,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.860
But also,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.720
If I draw the shortest distance from X to line AB,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.720
Which might look something like that,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.140
And comes in, of course, at a right angle here.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.800
and I draw the shortest distance from X on to line AC, and has a right angle here.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.640
Let's call this point B*,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.320
and let's call this point C*,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.300
then I know that XB* is equal to XC*

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
because they're on the angle bisector,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.740
and these are all the points that are equidistant from those two lines.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.400
Okay.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.280
Now, we focus on these two small triangles.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.960
And here, we have a triangle with a right angle;

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.800
adjacent to the right angle we have this double-marked line, XB*.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.220
And here we have a right angle;

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
and adjacent to the right angle we have this double-marked line, XC*;

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.580
And we know these two lines are the same length.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.900
We also have the third side of a triangle which is opposite of the right angle,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.440
marked with this one slash, and it is the same as this slash over here,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.160
(that's the hypotenuse in this case)

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.140
And so, because two triangles have two equal sides,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.680
and they have the longer side being opposite to an angle that also happens to be equal,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.000
then these two triangles are congruent.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.640
As a matter of fact, in this case, we can see they're basically mirror images of one another.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.080
Now, this of course tells us that,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.840
we also now know that,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.740
BB*

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.300
BB* must be equal to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.820
BB* must be equal to CC*.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.900
BB*

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.280
(I'll mark it with three slashes)

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
BB* is equal to CC*.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
Now, we have more congruent triangles.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.240
We also have the triangle

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.640
We also have the triangle A

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.940
We also have the triangle AX

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.340
We also have the triangle AXB*

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.300
We also have the triangle AXB*, being a mirror image of

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.940
We also have the triangle AXB*, being a mirror image of AXC*

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.600
And so those two triangles are congruent.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.100
And this, of course, tells us that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.500
AB* equals to AC*

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.180
Okay! Now, what can we conclude from all that?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.060
Well, we can say that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.560
AB* minus BB* is really just the side AB.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.940
And we can say that

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.020
AC* minus CC* is just the side AC.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.040
Now we're almost there.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.380
We have proven up here that AB* is equal to AC*,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.600
we have proven that BB* is equal to CC*,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.240
and so these two sides being equal,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.420
it essentially then follows that AB equals AC.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.780
So, we have done nothing special about the triangle

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.940
and we have now proven that these two sides are of equal length.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.260
(From the background) So we've got an isosceles triangle?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.260
That's right.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.000
And now or course, I can go around and do exactly the same construction

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.840
on two other sides, making this what was A before,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.600
and proving that these two sides are the same

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.700
with the same construction hanging off to this side.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.420
I don't have to do it a third time, because

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.880
once I've proven that, I can really show that all sides of this triangle are of equal length.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.160
I can just start from another vertex,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.740
draw my angle bisector,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.840
do my perpendicular bisector over there and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.360
do exactly the same construction.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.480
So, you of course know that this cannot possibly be true,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.940
and so I encourage you to go very carefully,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.300
step-by-step, through here.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.860
and try to find out, you know,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.800
where is that one bogus step?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.420
So, be vigilant! Go for it!
