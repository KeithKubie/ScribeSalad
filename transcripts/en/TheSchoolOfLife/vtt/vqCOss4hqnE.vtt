00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.800
The term "higher consciousness" is often used by spiritually minded people

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.360
to describe important but hard to reach mental states.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.340
Hindu sages, Christian monks, and Buddhist ascetics

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.620
all speak of reaching moments of  higher consciousness through meditation, or chanting, fasting, or pilgrimages.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.880
Unfortunately the way in which these spiritual people discuss their states of higher consciousness

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.080
has a tendency to put a lot of secular types on edge.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
It can all sound maddeningly vague, wishy-washy, touchy-feely,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.740
and for want of a better word, annoying.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.860
What on Earth do these gurus really mean?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.140
We deeply sympathize with such frustrations,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.620
not being by nature particularly attracted to the ineffable or the mysterious,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.660
however it seems that the idea of higher consciousness is in fact a very interesting one

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.740
which has nothing inherently to do with spirituality

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.800
and can be defined simply enough in strictly rational and secular terms.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.280
This is how we see it:

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.960
as human beings we spend most of our lives functioning in states of lower consciouness

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.460
where what we're principally concerned with is ourselves, our survival,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.100
and our own success narrowly defined.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.860
Ordinary life rewards practical unintrospective self-justifying outlooks,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.680
sort of the hallmarks of lower consciousness.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.780
Neuroscientists speak of a lower part of the brain they call "The Reptilian Mind"

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.080
and tell us that under its sway we strike back when we're hit, blame others,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.540
quell any stray questions that lack immediate relevance,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.480
fail to free associate and stick closely to a flattering image of who we are and where we're headed.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.600
However, rare moments when there are no threats of demands upon us,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.480
perhaps late at night or early in the morning when our bodies and passions are comfortable and quiescent,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.480
we have the privilege of being able to access the higher mind, what neuroscientists call our neocortex,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.340
the seat of imagination, empathy, and impartial judgement.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.800
We loosen our hold on our own egos and ascend to a less biased and more universal perspective

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.360
casting off a little of the customary
anxious self-justification and brutal pride.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.660
In such states the mind moves beyond its particular self interests and cravings.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.080
We start to think of other people in a more imaginative way

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880
rather than criticize and attack, we're free to imagine their behavior being driven by

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.240
pressures derived from their own primitive minds which they're generally in no position to tell us about.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.240
Their temper or viciousness are, we now see, symptoms of hurt rather than of evil.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.860
It's an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to explain others actions by their distress

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.180
rather than simply in terms of how it affects us.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.860
We perceive that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism, or aggression,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.260
but always, when we can manage it: Love.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.200
At such moments the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.860
Full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.060
but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty and touching vulnerability.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.220
A fitting response is universal sympathy
and kindness.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.320
One's own life feels less precious.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.260
One can contemplate being no longer present with tranquility.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.440
One's interests are put aside and one may imaginatively fuse with transient or natural things:

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.900
trees, the wind, a moth, clouds, or waves breaking on the shore.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.900
From this point of view status is nothing, possessions don't matter, grievances lose their urgency.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.480
If certain people could encounter us at this point

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.920
they might be amazed at our transformation and in our newfound generosity and empathy.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.220
States of higher consciousness are, of course, desperately short lived.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.360
We shouldn't, in any case, aspire to make them permanent,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.040
because they don't sit so well with the many important, practical tasks we all need to attend to.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.300
But we should make he most of them when they do arise and harvest their insights for when we require them most.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.160
Higher consciousness is a huge triumph over the primitive mind which cannot envisage any such possibilities.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.380
Ideally, we'd be a little more alive to the advantages of this higher mind

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:19.960
and strive to make our oceanic experiences somewhat less random, and less clothed in unnecessary mystery.
