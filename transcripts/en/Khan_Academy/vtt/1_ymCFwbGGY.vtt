00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:03.261
- [Voiceover] Given the
cost of a hardcover book,

00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:07.721
the price of it typically
hovers around $25,

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.641
many consumers ask their book dealers,

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.901
"When will the paperback be out?"

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.755
So let's just think about this.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.976
Given the cost of a hardcover book.

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.045
So this is what we're talking about.

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.681
We're talking about the
cost of a hardcover book.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.774
The price of it typically
hovers around $25.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:26.081
So they're trying to give us
a little bit more information

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.021
on the cost of a hardcover book.

00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:31.022
But this clause here that they give us,

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:34.741
the price of it typically
hovers around $25,

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.248
is very wordy, and it's very clumsy.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:38.621
What they're really saying,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.427
given the cost of a hardcover book,

00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:43.737
which typically hovers around $25.

00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:45.914
So I'm going to look for
a phrase that's closer to

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.287
which typically hovers around $25.

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:50.780
So let's look at our choices.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.220
So the first choice is always

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.980
exactly as they wrote it here.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.083
So I'm going to rule that one out,

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:58.830
because it really does feel
very wordy and very clumsy.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.580
Given the cost of a hardcover book,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.580
and typically it hovers
at a price around $25.

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:10.627
Well once again, this is a
little bit strangely worded.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.376
And typically it hovers.

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:17.640
We really want to have a
relative pronoun, which, here.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240
We're talking about the
cost, which does something.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.730
Which hovers around $25.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.876
So choice C actually seems
to do the trick for us.

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.023
Given the cost of a hardcover book, which,

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:32.002
and what is the relative
pronoun which referring to?

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.242
It's referring to the
cost of a hardcover book,

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:38.182
which typically hovers around $25,

00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:40.282
many consumers ask their book dealers,

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.049
"When will the paperback be out?"

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.482
Well, this one feels really good.

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:45.677
It conveys the exact meaning that we want.

00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:46.901
It's much shorter.

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.621
Which typically hovers
is much shorter than

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.021
the price of it typically hovers,

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.661
and it's a lot less convoluted.

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:54.536
So C is definitely where I'd like to go.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:56.601
Now let's just look at the other choices.

00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:58.681
In that it typically hovers.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.981
Given the cost of a hardcover book,

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:04.204
in that it typically hovers.

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:05.943
Well once again, you're
just really meaning to say

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:07.299
which typically hovers.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.723
In that, you're doing
this prepositional phrase.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:12.803
It's a very strange thing.

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:14.355
Just to kind of give a little bit

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:18.015
of an extra context of the cost.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:20.622
So I'm going to rule that one out.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:22.422
They typically hover.

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:23.971
So this one, they, you're talking about

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:27.582
something in the plural,
and the cost is singular.

00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:28.849
The cost of a hardcover book,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.370
at least the way it's being referred to.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.802
So we're not saying they.

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:36.802
This is plural, while
the relative pronoun,

00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:40.342
or in this case, just the pronoun,

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:43.714
is referring to is singular, the cost.

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:44.960
Singular.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.549
So that's why this one right over here

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.519
doesn't make any sense.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.204
So, yeah.

00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:50.196
Given the cost of a hardcover book,

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:53.964
which typically hovers around $25,

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.204
many consumers ask their book dealers,

00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:58.285
"When will the paperback be out?"

00:02:58.285 --> 00:02:59.804
That feels very good.
