00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.920
[Captions by Mary V. at Y Translator]
Super glue is really common stuff

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.240
and we wannna see what happens

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.640
if you mix this super glue with
a couple of different substances.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.100
[Music]

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.260
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.760
We'll try mixing some super glue
with some baking soda.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.320
We'll try mixing some
super glue with the water,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.880
and then we'll try mixing it with
the water and baking soda combined.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.560
First off, we're gonna start
with some small-scale tests

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019
using just a little bit of
superglue and a little bit of water,

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.669
and we wanted to try water
because it's so unbelievably common

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.260
it's everywhere,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.900
and I've never really seen
any sort of large quantity

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.890
of superglue mixing with water.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.580
For our small-scale tests,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.260
we'll just drip out
a little bit of water

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.900
and a little bit of our
glue onto this piece of foil.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.360
As it stands, the water
and the superglue look

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.800
pretty much identical.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.580
So I'm going to add just a couple
of drops of blue food coloring

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.260
to our water

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.760
so we can tell what's the water
and what's the superglue.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.200
[Music]

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.640
The reason we're doing
this outside is because superglue

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400
has some pretty powerful fumes,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.900
and doing this inside,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.350
I think I would become
overwhelmed by them

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.159
just by opening the lid of the bottle.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950
I got a really strong whiff of it.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.280
I'm very glad that I'm outside
where there's a nice breeze.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.620
Alright.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.800
Just try just putting down a
few drops of our super glue here.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320
Little puddle.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.560
Now, let's see what happens
if we drip a drop of water

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.040
into the middle of that super glue.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.820
Some reaction definitely took place.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.000
We have this sort of stringy,
gooey plastic that's formed.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
It's, it's glued itself quite
well to the foil below it.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.260
Let's just add more water just
over that whole spill of superglue.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.960
To me, it looks like wherever
the water and the superglue

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.780
actually come in contact,
they cure in a thin sheet.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.980
But of course as soon as there's
a thin sheet of cured super glue,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.120
it can't touch any more of the water.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.600
It kind of makes a bag
or a balloon around it.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
Now we've seen what happens
if we drip water into super glue.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.700
Let's see what happens
if we drip super glue into water.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.900
We've got a little puddle of water
that has some food coloring in it.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.480
See what happens if
we add a drip of super glue.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.440
Interesting.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.720
It kind of like looks like
it splashed outwards

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.860
but then there's like
a center drop in the middle.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.560
With our little bamboo skewer here,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.420
I can lift up underneath
that very thin sheet.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.940
You can see that it's cured.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560
Sort of string where the glue
that's still in the water

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.480
keeps reacting with the water.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.340
This is actually fairly
similar to how nylon is made.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.600
Oh hey, it's made of super glue.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240
So it sticks to things like my gloves.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.940
Okay, same as before we did a small test.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.080
Let's try a little bit more.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
Just cover that whole area
of water in superglue at once.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:03.980
[Music]

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.880
I might have just discovered how
Spider Man makes his web fluid.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.480
Well, there we go.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.280
There's a beautiful view right there.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.520
Just a blob of cured super glue,
and that happened by pouring

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.120
the super glue onto
a large blob of water.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.620
I really want to take
this up one more level.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.240
So, I've got my whole dropper
full of super glue here,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.590
and I'm just gonna see
what happens if I squirt all of it

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.360
into this cup of
bluefied water at once.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.780
[Music]

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.980
We've got something crazy going
on at the bottom of this cup.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.160
Oooh it's squishy.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.620
That is gonna be hard
like the other plastic

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.360
but this is very very gooey...

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.340
Ah! And sticky.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.280
It's sticky!

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.580
Well I can get new gloves.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.340
Here's our sticky gooey plastic.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.350
This is what happens
when you just pour aww!

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.700
Ow, ow! It's hot!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.620
Ugh!

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.080
Exothermic reaction when
superglue catalyzes against warm.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.680
Whoo! That started burning
my fingers a little bit.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.800
Yeah. That's that's really very warm.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.300
Very toasty gonna grab some more gloves.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
The next thing we're going
to try is some of our baking soda.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.130
And we're gonna be using baking soda
because in a lot of hobby circles,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.850
it's well-known that baking soda
causes superglue to catalyze

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.180
almost immediately.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.560
It's a popular way to fill
some gaps or do small repairs

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.440
on model building and things like that.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.260
You take baking soda, fill in the gap,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.740
add some super glue on top of it,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.500
and it'll catalyze and
harden almost immediately.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.360
You can then sand it down
and paint over it.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.480
It's a pretty cool trick.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.460
Like with the water, we'll start
with a small pile of the baking soda,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.080
and we'll drip some super glue
onto it and watch what happens.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.400
[Music]

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.220
That is solid. That is solid. That is solid.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.880
Let's see how quickly it turns solid.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.420
I'm gonna poke it right
after it drips down on.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.480
[Music]

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.500
Already solid.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.060
Not even sticky anymore.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.940
Let's see if we can make
a taller pile and drip it on there,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.540
and see if we can lift
it off without sticking to the foil.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.940
[Music]

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.440
Our super glue down onto
the baking soda.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.980
Cured immediately.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.940
Now we can just lift it right off.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.100
[Music]

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.500
We just have this little piece of
hardened plastic like substance.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.680
I know I don't have very good
leverage on it but it's really durable too.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.460
There we go.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.700
Finally got it to snap.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.500
Sort of a translucent colored plastic.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.680
We're bringing the scale up a little bit.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.920
I have a slightly larger pile of baking soda,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.260
and this time I'm just gonna squirt all this
dripper of super glue right down into it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.680
Here it goes.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.920
[Music]

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.460
Those fumes coming off a bitt.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.460
Remember how I said
it's an exothermic reaction,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.480
that means it's getting hot.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.680
There was enough of it that it made it all
the way down through the baking soda pile

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.260
and that is fused onto the foil.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.780
Well we did the super glue
into baking soda.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.360
Same as the water,
let's try reversing it.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.960
Let's have a little puddle of the super glue,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.980
and drop some baking soda down into it,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.780
and watch what happens.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.120
[Music]

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.200
Everywhere that had both
baking soda and super glue

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.840
has hardened into plastic.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.780
And it does not want
to peel off the foil this time.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.614
That is pretty good and glued on there.

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.250
It starts tearing as soon as I try.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.900
Our superglue combined
with water cures pretty quickly.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.380
Our super glue combined with baking soda

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.040
cures almost instantly.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.840
I feel like I really need to see what happens

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.860
if I combine baking soda in
the water and then add the super glue.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.260
Will the dissolved baking soda
make it react even faster?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.660
Will make it slower?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.080
Will it put off a lot of heat?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.200
We saw some good exothermic reactions.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.740
Will that keep happening even
if it's in the water?

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.540
Let's find out.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.560
[Music]

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.260
Once again, I am going to
add just a little bit of blue.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.030
Cause I think that will make it
easier to see what goes on.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.380
All right let's start with
one drip of super glue

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.480
into our heavily saturated
baking soda water.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.280
That cured quick,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.240
and then like crystallized afterward.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.120
[Music]

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.760
Kinda look like little jellyfish.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.840
Oooh bigger jellyfish oooh wow.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.000
And that started putting off smoke 
or fumes or something without

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.780
a whole lot going on.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.100
This isn't as blue as when we
mix it with just the water.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.100
So something about the baking soda
is making it so it doesn't mix as much.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.240
[Music]

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.820
So the baking soda water really
makes the super glue react quickly,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.120
and I even tried scaling it up a little
bit by dripping in more drops at once.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.860
But what I wanna do is take the
rest of this bottle of super glue,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.580
which you can see is still mostly full

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.880
and this whole cup of slightly
blue baking soda saturated water,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.139
and pour both of them into
this jar at the same time.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:56.860
I wanna see what kind
of reaction we get

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.420
when that much super glue reacts
with that much baking soda water.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.800
Okay here we go.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.080
Baking soda water.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.640
Huge amounts of super glue going
in at the same time.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.340
Three two one.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:16.140
[Music]

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.820
Oh I don't know what we just made there.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.520
[Music]

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.040
Jar's a little bit warm.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.840
Nothing crazy.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.460
Well getting hotter.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.889
The top of it's quite hot actually.

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:29.140
The bottom, less down here.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.440
More up here.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.240
There we go.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.100
That's about 6 ounces of superglue,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.220
and probably 10 ounces of water

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.500
and that, that was crazy.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.940
It looks like I took several plastic bags,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.720
and shoved them down
into a jar full of water.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.220
I am kind of curious about
the inside of this.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.340
So I think I want to try
breaking the jar open

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.000
and seeing if I can get any of 
that plastic out.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.760
It might just be glued to the walls.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.480
All right let's find out
what is inside this jar here.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.260

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.320
So that's water.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.000
Not sticky.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.400
[Music]

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.200
That  clearly was super glue.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.940
Very sticky.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:28.040

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.380
Here's our blob.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.200
Our blob of super glue,
baking soda and water.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.440
This stuff has kind of an
interesting texture.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.120
It's not too heavy,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.399
and parts of it are quite soft and squishy.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.350
I can just drive my fingers right into them.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.900
It's like it's sheets and
compressed plastic.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.000
which I guess is just how it cast.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It's not actually compressed,
it started it this way.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.860
[Music]

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.860
Now, I did this experiment because
I had never seen a large quantity

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.140
of superglue get mixed
with water or baking soda,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.720
or especially baking
soda saturated water.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.699
So this is really just a discovery.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.100
I wanted to know what's gonna happen.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.960
So I tried it out.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.120
And fortunately,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.880
I didn't have to go out and buy
300 tiny little bottles of super glue.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.980
You can buy the large bottles online.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.820
That's really nice.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.339
It's fun to learn what will happen.

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:24.280
This is just some
extremely basic chemistry

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.240
watching what happens when you pour
super glue in the baking soda water.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.060
And now I know.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.700
Now, I know what will happen.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.280
Turns into compressed
plastic bag jellyfishes.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.500
Or something.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.940
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.620
The little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.750
and you should go check it out.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.620
The box at the bottom shows
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.920
you need to be watching now,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.860
and if you hit this bomb,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.440
you'll be subscribed to our channel
so you never miss a video.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.559
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:51.290
Talk to you then.
