00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.600
Hi I'm Jocelyn and today we're
going to go over fall 2009

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.450
exam 1, problem 1.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.920
So to begin with, we
always want to

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.110
read the whole problem.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.020
So in this one it says uranium
metal can be produced by the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410
reaction of uranium
tetrafluoride with magnesium

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.526
in a sealed reactor heated
to 700 degrees C.

00:00:44.526 --> 00:00:47.790
So we know that we're dealing
with a chemical reaction here.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.350
The byproduct is magnesium
fluoride.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.170
To ensure that all the magnesium
is consumed in the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.320
reaction, the reactor is charged
with excess uranium

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.070
fluoride, specifically 10% more
than the stoichiometric

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.380
requirement of the reactor.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.270
To produce 222 kilograms of
uranium, how much uranium

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.490
tetrafluoride must be introduced
into the reactor?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.020
So that's what the question
is asking us.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.320
Then it says we assume complete
conversion of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.150
magnesium, express your
answer in kilograms.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.470
So we know that the question is
asking us for the uranium

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:36.065
tetrafluoride needed to make
222 kilograms of uranium.

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:37.570
Right?

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.240
That's the last sentence.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.630
The sentence that's before that,
however, also gives us

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.410
very important information.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.400
It tells us that we need
the stoichiometric

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.130
equivalent plus 10%.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.390
And that's very important to
keep in mind because, as

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.260
you'll see later, that's where a
lot of people got tripped up

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.850
on this problem.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.930
So then let's go to the first
two sentences in this problem

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.890
and extract the information
given there.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070
We know that we're dealing
with a chemical reaction.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.870
So when we are dealing with one
of those we always want to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.090
put down the chemical
equation.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.530
So we have uranium tetrafluoride
reacting with

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.330
magnesium to give uranium
with a byproduct

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.150
of magnesium fluoride.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.220
And it tells us that it that
it's at 700 degrees C.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.610
That's superfluous information
but you can always put

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.600
reaction conditions above the
arrow just to keep track.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.940
So now that we have this
equation are we

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.420
ready to move on?

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.585
No.

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:53.410
Right?

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.970
We need to have a mass
conservation.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.110
We need to balance
this equation.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.990
So to determine if this is
balanced or not, we want to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.130
keep track of the amount of
uranium, fluoride and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.420
magnesium on each side
of the equation.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.840
So we have uranium, fluoride
and magnesium.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.350
And then we have on
the product side--

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.620
and that's not right.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.451
This is the reactant
side, right?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.494
And over here is the
product side.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.270
So on the reactant side we have
1 uranium, 4 fluoride and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.340
1 magnesium.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.100
On the product side we
have 1 uranium, 2

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.750
fluoride and 1 magnesium.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.030
So we see that we have an
imbalance in fluoride.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.420
To fix that we can put a
stoichiometric coefficient in

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.370
front of the magnesium fluoride
on the product side

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.910
in order to have 4 fluorides.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.800
We put a 2 there.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.260
And we change that to 2.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.990
But we also have to change
the magnesium.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.240
Right?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.870
Now, although we fixed the
problem in the fluoride, we

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.400
have an imbalance in
the magnesium.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.310
So to fix that, we put a
stoichiometric coefficient in

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.210
front of the magnesium, switch
our accounting down here, and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.810
we see that we now have
conservation of mass.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.060
The two sides are balanced.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.460
So with our balanced equation we
can now move on to what the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.450
question is actually
asking us.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:02.180
And we know that we have,
we want to make 222

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.850
kilograms of uranium.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.380
We then need to figure
out how much uranium

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.470
tetrafluoride is needed.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.990
This chemical reaction
gives us mole ratios.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.310
But we are, right now, have
kilograms. So the first thing

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.180
we need to do is convert
kilograms to moles.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.490
And we do that using
stoichiometry or unit

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.390
conversion.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.900
So the other thing we
need to know is the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.325
molar mas of uranium.

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.480
So this is something you can
look up on your periodic

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.410
table, online, whatever
resources you have available.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:57.160
So the molar mass of uranium
is 238 grams per mole.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.220
Now we just do a simple unit
conversion to get the moles

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.490
uranium that we want.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:14.330
So first we need to convert to
grams. That's 1,000 grams. And

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.560
then using the molar mass,
we convert to moles.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.820
And because I have grams up
top here I need to put the

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.444
molar grams down here in order
to cancel everything out.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:50.200
And that gives us 933
moles uranium.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.050
OK so we have the number of
moles uranium we want to make.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.260
Now we can use the chemical
equation over here to

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.690
determine how much uranium
tetrafluoride we need.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.610
So the chemical equation tells
us that we need a 1:1 ratio of

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.210
uranium tetrafluoride.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.580
However this is where we need to
go back to what the problem

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.510
was actually asking us.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.470
And remember that we need the
stoichiometric equivalent,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.760
which is given by this
mole ratio, plus 10%.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:29.850
So the amount of uranium
tetrafluoride we need is the

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:38.560
stoichiometric equivalent plus
10% times that stoichiometric

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.810
equivalent.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:53.830
And that equals 1,026 moles
of uranium tetrafluoride.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.590
So we found the amount of
uranium tetrafluoride we need.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.680
Are we done?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:01.845
No.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:02.690
Right?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.000
If we go back to the question
we see that it asks for our

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.360
answer expressed in kilograms.
So that's why it's always

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.370
important to keep track of what
the question is actually

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.440
asking you and to make sure
you've answered that.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.510
So we have uranium tetrafluoride
in moles.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.450
Now we need to convert it to
kilograms. Again we need the

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.520
molar mass.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.970
This time of uranium
tetrafluoride.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.700
And it equals--

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:36.200
so we have 1 uranium per
molecule and 4 fluoride.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.590
And again we just look up that
molar mass of fluoride on the

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.840
periodic table.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:51.126
And that equals 314
grams per mole.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.930
So we do our unit conversion
again.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:03.310
And this is my favorite way of
doing stoichiometry unit

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.380
conversions.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.470
You may have another way that
you learned in high

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.170
school or later on.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.570
But this way I know that I'm
keeping track of my units and

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.160
everything's canceling
out correctly.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.420
So we have 1,026 moles uranium
tetrafluoride.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.403
We use the molar mass
we just determined.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.960
And remember that this is an
industrial scale process, so

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:45.460
we actually care about the
amounts in kilograms. And we

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:56.420
get 322 kilograms uranium
tetrafluoride.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.350
Going back to what the question
was asking us, we

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.310
know that we now have
the correct answer.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.300
And we can put a
box around it.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.860
So that on the exam whoever's
grading you knows that that is

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.220
your answer.
