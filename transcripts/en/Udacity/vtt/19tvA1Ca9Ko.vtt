00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we've calculated a sequence of numbers.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a pattern in this sequence, and your job is to find

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the next entry in the sequence.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As with the challenge problem in Unit 1,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if you get the answer, please don't share it so that other people

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
can have the chance to find it for themselves.
