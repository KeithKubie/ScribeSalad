00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.719
The change in amino acid 415 from a glycine

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.140
to a cystein, significantly affects the way the collagen

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.640
protein forms a triple helix, which significantly reduces the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.020
structural integrity of bones. Now without a fully functioning collagen

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.430
protein, you're at a much higher risk for bone

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.030
fractures. For example, there was an individual, a real person

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.250
that had the mutation, the very mutation we just

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.040
got done talking about. That person suffered more than 270

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.550
bone fractures over a period of 16 years that resulted in severe skeletal

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.750
deformity. Now, remember though, not everyone with

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.220
Osteogenesis Imperfecta has a mutation that severe.
