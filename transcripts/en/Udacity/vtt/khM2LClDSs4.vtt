Hi Michael, so that covers Decision Trees

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.390
&gt;&gt; So, since you are the one who is listening,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.900
you get to tell me what we have learned today?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt; Well, we learned about the Decision Tree representation,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.330
we learned the top down algorithm for inducing

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.630
a Decision Tree. And we call that ID3

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.110
&gt;&gt; All right. So we got a representation,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.150
we got a top down learning algorithm ID3.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.790
&gt;&gt; We learned about the, the expressiveness and the bias.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.370
&gt;&gt; Right. So those are 2 separate things, we learned about

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.220
the sort of expressiveness. And we learned about the bias of ID3.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.510
&gt;&gt; And we gave one, so is this specific to ID3? We, we looked at one specific

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.205
way of deciding on splits, which was to do this maximum information game.

00:00:54.205 --> 00:01:00.440
&gt;&gt; Right. So we talked about in general,um, what are good attributes or what

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
are best attributes. So, information gain is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.830
one way of doing it. As one example.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.610
And, by the way, this notion of best attribute is something we'll end

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.410
up returning to sometimes explicitly, and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.650
sometimes implicitly, throughout the entire course. And

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.680
lastly, I feel like we talked about the problems with over-fitting and how

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.570
in the Decision Tree context, you can prune back the tree to avoid over-fitting.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.720
&gt;&gt; Over-fitting is an issue. Over-fitting is always an issue and

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.970
we came up with a couple of strategies for dealing with over-fitting

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.030
in the context of Decision Trees. Okay! So we've learned everything

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.160
there is to know about Decision Trees, there's nothing else to know.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.440
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Somehow I find that hard to believe.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot there and the students will get

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170
a chance to learn even more as they do the assignments.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.610
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.160
&gt;&gt; Excellent. All right Michael, thank you.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.250
&gt;&gt; Sure, look forward to the next chat.
