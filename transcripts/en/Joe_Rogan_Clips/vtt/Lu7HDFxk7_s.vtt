WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.080
Yeah,
that's a good thing.
It's mostly bullshit it,
well,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.940
you had Tyson on.
Yeah,

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.250
and it was interesting that he didn't want to go back to it.

4
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.950
Do you know Marvin Hagler has the same problem?
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.980
Well he was the only guy that ever just quit at the top,
but he won't,

6
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:18.350
he won't punch a bag or anything because that thing comes up in him where he

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.220
wants to do it again.
It's like an addiction and he's gotta be 60 now.
It's still,

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
yeah,
still welling up inside of him.
I respect him so much.
You know,

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.060
I always looked up to him when I was fighting cause a,

10
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.740
I remember the discipline that doc I had,
like I remember watching videos of him,

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.930
but he was a living on the cape.

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.960
He would treat you as Trump and he would run and the boots with combat boots on.

13
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.600
Yeah,
he was,
he was yelling war.

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.840
He was like getting ready to fight my staff at Hampshire and he's running and

15
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.300
shadow boxing is Yellen war.
And I'm like,
I'm just thinking,

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.630
could you imagine if you had a fight?
That fucking guy,

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.180
when he was the middle weight champion of the world,
first of all,

18
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.590
he was chiseled like it was sculpted out of bronze.
They didn't even look like,

19
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.430
I mean,
he was,
he was so jacked for a boxer.

20
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.750
When you think about like most boxers,
they didn't have that kind of physique.

21
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.060
His physique was like almost like a gymnast,
you know,

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.000
when he was in his prime and he just was so disciplined in Sofa and then beat

23
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.520
the fuck out of everybody and then lost that one.

24
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.110
Very controversial fight to sugar in matter.
I was at the point.
Yeah.

25
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.200
And then he was like,
that's it.
See Ya.
I've had enough.
Went to Italy.

26
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.160
He became a fucking movie star,
which is crazy.
He said,
apparently,
I mean,

27
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.430
I've never seen an Italian movie with Ma Marvelous Marvin Hagler in it.

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.080
Nobody has.
I think they,
I think Natalie,
I think it's a myth,

29
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.000
if he might be a myth.
[inaudible]

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.320
Ross was the rumor was always that he threw the fight with Leonard that he could

31
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.670
CalEd Leonard.
But he did,
if you all had to do is let,
let it go to a decision,

32
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.750
he would lose that decision.

33
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.690
They pay him a boatload of cash and he goes to Italy.

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.910
What does it says?
Marvin Hagler and a movie.
I just don't really,
oh,

35
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.160
he is in a movie.
I'm not saying that Jesus Christ.
Oh,

36
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.940
that's a long time ago because he looks really young back.
Oh my God.
He isn't.

37
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.010
Why no one's ever seen those movies.
Wow.
So this is an Italian,

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.840
well,
you know,
they made all those spaghetti westerns with [inaudible].

39
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120
They did all those movies in Italy.
Oh my God.
Isn't that something?
Those movies,

40
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.080
those a job look at you look at,
he's shooting everybody.
Oh yeah.

41
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.580
Is an access.
That's hilarious.

42
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.070
I wonder while he's still jacked in that movie,

43
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.850
so he must've been doing some kind of exercising.
What good them.
Oh God.
Oh God.

44
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.030
He's funny.
Jesus Christ flying through the air.
So India,
it looks like,

45
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.300
oh,
this is so hilarious.
This is so hilarious.
So,

46
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.880
you know,
when you do a movie and the guy hits you,

47
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.600
you're supposed to move your head so that he's not actually hitting you.

48
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.040
And I hope Marvin knew that.
I'm sure he had because he,
yeah,

49
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.640
thank God I pulled the punch,
I did a movie in,
um,

50
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
Boston called southy with a guy,
throws me in a dumpster and kills me.
Right.

51
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.590
And they had to do it over and over.
And the guy just got out of Walpole,

52
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.070
the state penitentiary.
Um,
I'm not gonna mention his name,
but he's,

53
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:21.820
he's the director now out here as a matter of fact.
And I said,
Hey,

54
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.150
do you know this is a fucking movie?
Because the fire in the fight,

55
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.920
you know the shot that the starter's pistol and he kept throwing me over.

56
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.320
That guy is in everything.
Brian.

57
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.890
Brian Dennehy was 1989 90 oh one.

58
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.040
So 89 was probably just a few years after he retired.

59
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.510
He retired somewhere around 86 87.

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.880
When did he fight Leonard?
What are never that was,
oh,
it was amazing.

61
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:52.420
We used to watch [inaudible] closed circuit fights.

62
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.430
We'd go to a theater and watch it on a big screen closer.

63
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.920
Tell you how many I got so ripped off because you had ties to Iran.

64
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
I remember driving,
I was out here to go to this big fight,
50 bucks,

65
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.760
and I'd walked in and Tyson knock them out in the first round.
That was all,

66
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.260
that never happened.
People were trying to figure out what he was amazing.
Yeah.

67
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.530
Yeah,
but it was a,
it's,
what did we say?
Seven,
eight,
seven.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah,

68
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.200
and that was it.
He's like,
I'm done.
So that was only two years after he retired.

69
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.033
He's doing movies,

70
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.240
but the best John the beast Mugabi but Marvin haggler versus John the beast mode

71
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.720
gun.
Marvin have hair from a Gabi.
No,

72
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.370
I remember seeing Martin with hair at the gardens.
What?
Yeah.

73
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.900
Did he grow it out for a goof?
No,
he had a,

74
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.820
Harley has created a really fucking heart.

75
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.210
He had an extra inch of scholar or something.
They was saying,
no,

76
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.840
the side temples,
is that what it was?
Temple muscles.

77
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.030
They said he was almost like built.
Is that Mugabe and Mugabe was a murderous,
no,

78
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.080
that's Thomas Hearns voice.
Thomas Thomas.
That's Mugabi for sure.

79
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.010
Mugabi he hit Marvin Hagler with an upper cut and snapped his head back and this

80
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.170
was an Africa that he was knocking everybody out.

81
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.830
But Non Marvin Marvin took a punch better than anybody.

82
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.970
He said the fight only started.
Why stock the pan?
I think one role,

83
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:09.610
Dan was the only guy that ever knocked Marvin down,

84
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.720
but it wasn't a real knockdown.
It was a trip and they counted it as a knockdown.

85
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.650
Oh,
he was a tremendous fighter.
But Oh,
inside.
Look at how it gets into the PSOAS.

86
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.440
Mugabe.
Mugabe was a murderer as punching him til he was knocking everybody out.

87
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:25.090
He knocked out Terry Norris.
He knocked,

88
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.330
he knocked people out dead like you would hit them and they would go flying,

89
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.260
but not Marvin Kreiss.

90
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.300
Marvin stood right in front of him and eventually Koom and then Mugabe was never

91
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:34.930
the same again.

92
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.440
Once he realized that this mother fucker could stand right in front of him,

93
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.420
the shit out shots.
What does this referee stop?
What is he doing?

94
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.711
I don't know what's going on.

95
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:45.940
Then that's mills lane and now that we have a break in the action,
I'd like to,

96
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.500
I'd like to plug my movies.
Sweeney killing Sweeney.
Yeah,
middle of March.

97
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.150
We talked about it.
It's coming out.
I want,
I want to plug it again.
Well,

98
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.890
toolkit plug and we'll plug the shit out of it when it comes out.

99
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:59.510
We'll put it on Twitter.
Right.
Fighting.
But I appreciate that.

100
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.710
But he was that guy.

101
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.160
Marvin Hagler was to me like he was the epitome of discipline,
you know,

102
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.560
and I thought about like a discipline fighter like that.

103
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.380
It was him always in shape,
always ready to go,

104
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.620
and then the discipline to never come back.
That was amazing too.
To me.

105
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.100
I've respected the fuck out of that because fighters never know when to when to

106
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.970
leave.
He knew when to leave.
And to this day I saw him in an interview recently.

107
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.730
He's fine.
Talks completely normal.
