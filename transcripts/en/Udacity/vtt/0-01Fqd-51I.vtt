00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.040
Instead of just calculating an IBS score percentage,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.850
IBD focuses on using this IBS, in a

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.680
particular order on your chromosomes. It helps you

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.740
determine which piece, which piece of the chromosome came

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.690
from, from who in your family., For example,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.180
let's think about the chromosome pieces you inherited from

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.740
your grandparents. Here we have your grandmother's chromosomes

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.390
and your grandfather's chromosomes. Now, your mother has her

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.920
own set of chromosomes. She got half from

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.530
her mother and half from her father; half from

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.570
your grandmother, half from your grandfather. Now when

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.790
your mother's germ cells went through miosis to make

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.460
eggs, Recombination allowed our chromosomes to mix and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.380
match the grandparental chromosomes, her parental chromosomes. So that

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.520
when you inherited a set of chromosomes from your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.700
mother, you got this interesting mix of your grandparents.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.080
Now you could do the same thing for your father. And we could add up how

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.469
much each grandparent contributed to each chromosome. And

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.630
you'll see that it's roughly 25%, right? Here you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.450
have half of your chromosomes came from mum.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.130
And of those half, you'll notice that the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.346
blue segments represent about half of that. So

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:15.910
total, 25% came from each grandparent. If you and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.840
a grandparent actually participate in a service

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.770
like 23andMe. You can see exactly which segments

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100
of the chromosomes you share with the grandparent

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.960
and the fact that you're roughly 25% related

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.090
to each other. Although the individual sizes and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.030
chunks of the segments you may share with

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.180
the grandparent can vary, roughly speaking would be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.060
about 25% related. Through IBD to a grandparent.
