WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.510
I kind of get it from a business standpoint.
If they're filling the rooms.

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:04.350
I did a Gig in,

3
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:08.850
in Arizona once and they had a daytime gig booked from a youtube influencer.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.940
They pack this place out at 11:00 AM with like 12 year old kids as fans.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.790
Yes,
it was.
It was a Bert Kreischer day show.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.830
He didn't take his whole shirt off.
It was a crop top or a halter.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.800
Did Burt does those day shows?
He does.

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.310
We'll do radio and then we'll do a show at like noon for people that don't have

9
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.150
jobs.
It's like work,
uh,
call in sick to work or something as they call it.

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:37.470
Something like that.
Yeah.
Call in sick to work.
Yeah,
but this was God,

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
this was so funny.
That lady didn't know what to do.
Them just looking slim.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:45.840
That is slim for Bert.
That's only like 19 months pregnant.
Yeah.

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.020
That's a protrusion and it's hard.
Eight year old in the valley.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.930
He's got an eight year old inside of him.
He has to take his shirt.

15
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:53.550
He takes his shirt off in the or now,

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.630
every time I used to take his shirt off only in the main room was like whoa.

17
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.280
Or keep my shirt on.
No,
no,
we decided no more of that.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.360
Does it come off all,
every show gets on stage.
He takes his shirt off.

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.650
When did you decide when that happens?
I wonder like is there a moment,

20
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.290
just write out how you do it pre,
pre Mike crap or grabs the mic.

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.350
Well his body is a source of pride.

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.580
He enjoys uh,
what the fruits of his Labor.
Yeah.
And his um,

23
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.470
appetite for a indulgence.
I Dunno if it's a body as much as it is a building,

24
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.790
it's a body.
People know what's his body.
They know he's a party animal.

25
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.080
Takes his shirt off and they go,
all right,
it's Burt.
Fuck yeah.
Woo.
He's,

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.850
he's fun.
It is a lot of fun.

27
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.110
It's a barnacle those written about that like talking about,
I was reading these,

28
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.460
this guy was like talking about how hilarious it was.
It's a party.

29
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.640
It definitely has.
I'm sorry he is an animal and sometimes you know,

30
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.260
I mean there's the opposite where people would just kind of quiet onstage,

31
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.640
fun on.
I'm sure laugh just by taking off my shirt.
I think I'd go for it.

32
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.940
Why not start off with it?
But now the problem is I think Bert owns it,

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.430
which is weird.
You know,
like he's like,

34
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:06.450
you think he should have some like a little bit of a feeling about it?
No,

35
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.070
like he owns it.
Like,
uh,

36
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.890
if I wanted to go up and take your shirt off,
people go,
what are you copying?

37
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.880
Hurt.
That's a good point.

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.110
He's the only comic disrobing every time.

39
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280
But there's some weird ones like that Bobby,
Bobby Lee takes his pants off.

40
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:23.671
I mean,
I've,

41
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.960
I've seen that that weeny weeny a few times winking at me from the green rooms

42
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:32.280
of the comedies.
You should probably not tell people that first stop doing it.

43
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.570
People probably get mad now.
He can't,
he can't not do it.
They're like,

44
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:41.160
take off the shirt.
It was a jump on him on stage.
Tackle them.
Yeah.

45
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.270
Yeah.
But I mean there's,
there's a couple of dudes who go close clove lists.

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.370
You took off their pants and their shirts,
but the,

47
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.690
but it's weird that that's Burt's thing.
That is weird.
You're right though.

48
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:55.200
If anybody else were to do it,
they would know that that was a,
a Bert situation.

49
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.550
There was another one like that though.

50
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.620
We were just talking about the other night at the comedy store.
Like how does it,

51
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.450
someone like took over like a thing?
Yeah.
Oh,
stand up comedian.

52
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.900
I think so.
It does not,
I'm not gonna remember.
Remember.

53
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.030
I want to know what it is.
Well,
there's like a,

54
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.430
there's a comic in New York or d snaps.
Got like a snap every time.
That's it.

55
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.470
You know what Frazier Smith,
I love watching Frazier Smith when he was like,

56
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.110
come on people.
These are jokes and he likes maps.
It's like a,

57
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.110
it's like a timekeeper.
I like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It keeps you in rhythm.

58
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.820
It's musical up there sometimes if it's going,
if it goes well.

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.310
It's weird how people can become like a thing.

60
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.480
Like this is the guy who talks about food.
I know.
I was thinking about that.

61
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.770
Like how,
what,
what,
what comes first in that scenario?

62
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.010
Does it naturally evolve or does it happen once and then the person builds

63
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.940
around it because it's a crutch.
Um,
there's a,

64
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.390
there's a fine line between the art and the marketing.
Exactly.

65
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.710
In who you know,
do your thing.
Like it's a short life.

66
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.190
Why not find that little niche that works for you and fucking make that money

67
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.290
and have fun and bring some joy to people who gives a fuck?

68
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.830
I have a problem where people would talk shit about people going after what

69
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.380
they're doing and finding a little trick to it.

70
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.390
Who cares isn't what everybody's doing to get tricked.
God.

71
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.380
That's true.
That's true.
Fucking tricky.
I believed that shit.
