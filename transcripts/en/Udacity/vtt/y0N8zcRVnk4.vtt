00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.240
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it is another well-founded induction because we've

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.750
shrunk the lengths of the things that we're comparing recursively. in,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.110
in logic this would look like x is the value at

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.600
position 1 of x does not equal the value in position 1 in y,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.540
that's our condition here and there, what we had before about the position x so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.900
there existed j. j is greater than one, j is less than the length of y

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.240
where x of 1 equals y of j and it must be the case that

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.900
there's a permutation between the tail of x. Leaving out the first element and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.560
the results of pasting together y from 1 up to j minus 1 with the result,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.770
with the the third segment which was from j plus 1 through the end of, end of y.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.130
And the little funny symbol with, looks like a cap hair is pasting together and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.460
the real name for that is concatenation. We can concatenate two vectors together

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.400
using this operator and if those conditions all hold then we'll,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.150
then what we're defining x to be a permutation of y.
