00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:02.069
- [Voiceover] So now, we've seen rotation

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.089
by multiplying j by j,

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.020
over and over again, and we see that

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.469
that's rotation.

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.960
Now, let's do it for the general
idea of any complex number.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.149
So, if I have a complex number,

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.988
we'll call it z, and we'll
say it's made of two parts.

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:20.155
A real part called a, and
an imaginary part called b.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.491
So now, what I want to do is,

00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:26.769
what happens if we
multiply z by j one time?

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.602
J times z.

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:31.097
And that equals, j times

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:34.095
a plus

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:35.632
jb.

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:38.334
And let's just multiply it through.

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:39.667
Equals j times a

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:42.185
plus j times

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:44.999
j times b.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.580
A and b have now switched places.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.437
So, we're gonna put ja on this side,

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.273
ja on this side.

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:56.602
And what do we have here?

00:00:56.602 --> 00:01:00.102
J times j is minus one, so we have minus b

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:02.835
plus ja.

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:13.606
So, now we have expressions for z and jz.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.503
And I wanna plot these on a complex plane

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:18.836
and see what they look like.

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.945
And here's the real axis,
here's the imaginary axis.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:25.695
And let's first plot,

00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:32.021
let's plot z, let's say
z has a large real value,

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:34.027
and that would be a.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.194
And let's say that b is a
smaller value, we'll put b here.

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.097
And that means that z is at a location

00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:44.930
in the complex plane, right there.

00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:50.301
We can plot the dotted lines.

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:58.462
That's z in the complex plane.

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:00.560
So now, let's put jz on this same plot.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.100
Jz has a real component of minus b,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.354
so that would be right about here.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:08.521
Here's minus b

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:10.629
and it has a

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.137
imaginary component of plus a.

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:14.701
So, let's swing a,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.701
a goes all the way up to about here.

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.261
And so, that's the location of

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:25.840
jz.

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.227
And let me draw the hypotenuse of that.

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:35.802
This is the vector
representing jz, right there.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:37.954
So, now we have a bunch
of triangles on the page,

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:39.756
and what I wanna demonstrate is that

00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:42.756
this angle right here is 90 degrees.

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:46.919
So, one way to do that,

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.279
let's see if we can do that.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.895
Let's say this angle here is theta.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:54.920
That's the angle right there.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.874
Now, this triangle here, this
triangle that we sketched in,

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:01.140
just imagine in your head
that we're gonna rotate

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.317
that angle up until the
a leg of that triangle

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:08.290
is resting right here
on the imaginary axis.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.457
So, this triangle rotates up
to become this triangle here.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:18.761
Since we moved that triangle,
we know that this angle here,

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.261
that's also theta.

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:23.991
It's the same triangle, just rotated up.

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:25.917
And what does that make this angle here?

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.167
This angle here

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:30.422
that equals

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.483
90 degrees

00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:34.523
minus theta.

00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:42.678
So, if I combine this theta
angle with this angle here,

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:44.537
what do I get?

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:45.370
Theta plus

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.259
90 degrees minus theta

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:52.291
and we get 90 degrees.

00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:55.734
So, we just showed that
this angle right here

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.992
is a 90 degree angle.

00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:00.603
That demonstrates that
any complex number z,

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:02.489
if I multiply it by j,

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.656
that results in a positive
rotation of 90 degrees.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.198
So, let's do this rotation
again, only this time,

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:13.515
instead of using the
rectangular coordinate system,

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:16.722
let's use the exponential representation.

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.874
So, in the exponential notation, we say,

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:21.541
in general, z equals some radius

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.613
times e to the j theta.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.865
Or this is the angle theta

00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:30.394
and r is the length of
this hypotenuse here

00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:31.727
to get out to z.

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:36.276
So, what is in this notation, what is jz?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.380
And that equals

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:42.238
j times r

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.318
e to the j theta.

00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:49.239
So, now I'm gonna do a little trick,

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:53.059
where I'm gonna represent
j in exponential notation.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.392
So, if I color in dark here,

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:57.659
this is j.

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:02.860
The vector j is right there
and it has a magnitude of one

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.914
and it points straight
up on the imaginary axis.

00:05:05.914 --> 00:05:08.066
So, I can represent j, like this.

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.399
I can say j is e

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.323
to the j

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.387
90 degrees.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.650
That's equivalent to this j here

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.650
and it's multiplied by r

00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:22.837
e to the j

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:24.856
theta.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.191
And now the last step is

00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:33.058
we just combine these two
exponents together and we get

00:05:33.058 --> 00:05:33.891
jz

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:37.199
equals r

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.032
times e

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.863
to the j

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:43.478
theta plus

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:47.085
90 degrees.

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:54.020
So, in exponential notation,
we get this vector here.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.415
We go an additional 90 degree rotation

00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:01.582
and we go out the same
distance we had originally, r.

00:06:02.604 --> 00:06:05.812
So, now we've shown that we we
can rotate any complex number

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:09.356
by 90 degrees if we multiply it by j.

00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:11.997
We're gonna get to apply this
kind of transformation to

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.937
working out the current and
voltage relationships in

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:16.880
inductors and capacitors,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.503
and that'll happen in a
couple videos from now.
