00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.580
Does it really make sense to listen to
sad music when you're sad?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.320
Wouldn't it make you sadder? You think it
would,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.320
but science says otherwise.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.300
Howdy y'all. Trace here for Dnews. We've
talked a lot about music over last year.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.439
How robots are kicking out the jams, how
music affects your brain,

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.909
and how your brain works when you're
rapping. Music is an integral part of

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.939
the human experience. But what is it
about sad music

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.390
that we like so much? When you're down, do
you listen to something that matches

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.730
your mood? If music is the universal
language of emotion, then we're gonna

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.430
need a universal translator

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.920
for sad music to really get it. If you're
listening in the West you probably

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.480
associate sad music with minor key
tonality.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.660
If you're not exactly familiar with what
that means, the Exploratorium in San

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.809
Francisco provided some nice

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.109
examples. So listen to this, Western music

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:56.109
has major keys 
and minor keys.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.620
A study in the frontiers of auditory
cognitive neuroscience explores music

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.910
not as entertainment but as a language

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.550
equal or maybe even superior to spoken
languages. Their example is new borns.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.190
As they're hearing speech for the first
time, it's rythm in vocal performance

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.390
rather than processing it as language.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.630
To nonverbal babies, speech is kinda like
music. The question is,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.740
what makes us think that music is sad
or happy?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.560
It's all in the culture man. We learn as
we grow to feel sad when we listen to certain

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.300
songs.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.140
We grow up associating sad cellos with
death and violins that are screeching with

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.610
horror.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.640
It's the same with major and minor modes.
In other cultures major and minor modes don't

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.130
necessarily
mean the same thing they do in the West,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.000
which is why we need to kinda understand

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
what's sad music is before we can
specifically study.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.370
Another study in frontiers of emotion
science look specifically at music and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.050
sadness. Sadness is described in the study
as

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.160
negative and unpleasant psychology of emotion.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.750
And when we hear it our brain processes
it through our cultural lens.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.800
The scientists hypothesized, because of our
cultural learnings, sad music

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.590
would make us sad. But they were wrong.
Instead when we listen to sad music our brain

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.210
knows it's a cultural expression of
sadness.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.760
But realizes that it's not personal
sadness.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.520
And we interpret that as pleasure. This
is because it turns out there are two

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.070
kinds of emotions. Felt emotion as in,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.490
"I feel sad," and perceived emotion as in,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.000
"That is sad, but it's not me."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Put another way, if a partner breaks up with
you, you're like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500
bummed out.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.120
Like really bummed out. It is
inside of you. You feel it.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.890
But when you listen to Otis Redding singing
about how sad he is, you actually end up feeling

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.910
kinda happy.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.040
It's tugging at your heart strings, but
your brain makes a distinction.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.780
It knows you're not actually sad and thus
you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.100
get pleasure from listening to it. Fantastically
this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.790
also works when you're actually sad.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.310
The music still gives you pleasure and
might even help you feel better in the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.900
long run.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.590
So next time you listen to that
emo song because it's a rainy day,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.540
relish it man. Your brain comprehends that
you are happy. That you are not

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.870
actually sad.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390
So song do you listen to when you're down?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.720
Let's make the saddest playlist ever.
