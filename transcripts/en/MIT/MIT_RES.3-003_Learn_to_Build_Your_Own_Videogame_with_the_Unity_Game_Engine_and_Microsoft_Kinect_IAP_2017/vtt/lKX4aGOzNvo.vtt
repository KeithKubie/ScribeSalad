00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.040
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
OK, so we are going

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.120
to be going through the
role of all tutorial today.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.610
This is one of the Unity
provided tutorials.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.820
And it is extremely good.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.460
Like, I was going to
try to create something.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.300
And I did.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.880
And it wasn't anywhere
near as clear.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.619
So it is here on this web page,
which if you could write down

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:39.660
how, that would be great.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.358
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yep.

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:45.115
Unity.com?

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:45.990
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yep.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.350
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.910
Learn/tutorials/projects.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:12.360
GUEST SPEAKER 2: /roll?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.890
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
/rollaballtutorial or you can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.300
just Google, roll a ball.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.877
It will be the first result.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.415
OK, so this is the
Unity game editor.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:31.040
Don't really worry about what it
looks like-- sorry, like right

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.310
now.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.440
It will introduce that to
you when you guys go off

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.480
and do small groups to
start going through it.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.510
But here is the end goal.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.370
This is what the camera
sees, by the way.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.590
And so you can move your ball
around with the arrow keys

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.160
and collect a bunch
of pick up items.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.035
I need to lower the--

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:52.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.930
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Whoa!

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.023
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I need to
lower the acceleration values

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:56.671
in that.

00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.460
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I played
around with a bit and yeah.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.100
One quick side note before
you start going through.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.470
The Unity editor has a
bunch of different layouts.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.500
So sometimes when you
see these tutorials,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.580
it's going to be a
different looking editor.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.230
Let's see this one.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.730
I think.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.320
Yeah.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.410
So everybody has their own
layout of the Unity editor

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.900
that they like best.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.300
The default one
is not like this.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.980
And it's not like mine.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.850
And how you can change that
is through window and layouts.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.100
I'd suggest experimenting
with all of them,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.690
find which one you like most.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.720
They all offer the
same functionality.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.770
The panels correspond
to each other.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.720
So when you see the hierarchy
panel within the tutorial,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.820
it's the same as this
panel, even though it's not

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.730
the same shape, you know.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.649
Yeah.

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.440
Is there anything else
I should go through?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.240
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Is the
tutorial a video or is this--

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.420
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.740
GUEST SPEAKER 2: The
rest inside Unity?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.989
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah, so
they have a bunch of videos.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.330
And these videos have the
corresponding code down below,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.984
if you need to examine
it more closely.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.650
They used to have the
corresponding code

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.260
in Java and Python, also.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.280
But now they don't.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.220
Unity is largely c-sharp based.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.820
But you don't need to know
c-sharp, really, going into it.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.620
It's very simple.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.850
They do a fairly good
job of explaining it.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.056
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Do you want
to mention the reference, even

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:38.172
if you don't [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:40.810
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah, So they
do talk about the reference,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.310
but--

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.770
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So you don't
have the program pretty much

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.010
anything in Unity, else you
want to do something custom,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.470
and then you add
a little script.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.020
And the script has
a bunch of functions

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.410
that are pre-built into Unity.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.040
And there is a website that has
all of those functions on it,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.270
and f you need to do
something, you go look here.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.940
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And this is
kind of intimidating right now.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.410
But everything is
gathered in classes.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.730
And they'll explain
these to you.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.800
And each component
you want to access

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.079
is going to be
within a subclass.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.963
And so Unityengine.windows.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.080
And then you can access
your windows functions.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.990
It's like speech recognition
or for getting files, etc.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.032
Or similar stuff.

00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:40.615
GUEST SPEAKER 2: If
you see some crazy

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:42.840
function and you're like, what?

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.400
Then it's probably here.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.170
And you can go
read about it here.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.990
And--

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.235
GUEST SPEAKER 1: There is
a handy search bar up here.

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:51.360
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So when
you come across something,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.320
you come up here, search
for it, and then you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.570
can read it in a little more
detail about how it works

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.278
and what it does.

00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:58.460
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.400
And like, similarly if you see
a command like, rigid body, add

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.410
force, you can see, OK, well,
this is what it's expecting,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.420
a vector and then a force mode.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.297
And that's it.

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:11.880
And if you don't
have those arguments,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.005
It's not going to be happy.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.450
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Cool.
